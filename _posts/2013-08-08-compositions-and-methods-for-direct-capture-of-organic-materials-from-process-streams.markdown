The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. DE AC02 06CH11357 between the United States Government and UChicago Argonne LLC representing Argonne National Laboratory.

The present invention relates to the separation of organic materials such as sugars lipids and hydrocarbons from process streams. More particularly this invention relates to magnetic nanostructured solid sorbent MNSS materials comprising superparamagnetic nanoparticles with functionalized surfaces that can sorb a target organic material from a process stream and to methods of separating a target organic material from a process streams utilizing the MNSS.

Non petroleum based alternative feedstocks for the production of organic materials e.g. sugars linear hydrocarbons lipids potentially offer the chemical industry substantial economic and environmental benefit by supplementing or displacing petroleum products in chemical and energy markets. For example the extraction of sugars e.g. glucose and xylose from lignocellulose biomass during the pretreatment stage is a focused research and development effort by the U.S. Department of Energy and by private industry for production of biofuels bio based products and biochemicals. Bioprocess pretreatment technologies generally produce a low titer of target organic products which requires significant downstream product separations to purify the target materials from complex mixtures and dewatering to concentrate the target materials to useful concentrations. A technoeconomic assessment of the fermentation of sugars from corn stover to produce cellulosic ethanol found that one third of the production costs came from the pretreatment stage. The separation and concentration of ethanol which is limited by the sugar titer consumed half of the total process energy budget.

For example sugar concentration in most pretreated lignocellulose hydrolysate i.e. the liquid fraction of dissolved sugar molecules in a pretreatment slurry is approximately 2 to 10 percent by weight wt . Removal of water from the hydrolysate to increase the sugar concentration is expensive. In another example phototrophic and heterotrophic algae are used to produce lipids for biofuel production. The ultimate lipid content in the algal slurries may be less than 1 wt . Removal of water from the lipid can use more energy than is contained in the lipid product.

Magnetic nanoparticles of various types have been used in biomass processing. For example acid functionalized nanomaterials reportedly were useful for the pretreatment and hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass L. Pena M. Ikenberry B. Ware K. L. Hohn D. Boyle X. S. Sun and D. Wang Cellobiose Hydrolysis Using Acid functionalized Nanoparticles 2011 16 6 1214 1222 . In this study cobalt spinel ferrite CoFeO nanoparticles were surface treated with silica and functionalized to varying degrees with acid groups. The functionalized nanoparticles were utilized as acidic processing aids to hydrolyze lignocellulose and the particles were then magnetically separated from the reaction medium and reused. Although cellobiose hydrolysis was observed nanoparticle aggregation occurred the result of ferromagnetic behavior of silica coated metal oxide nanoparticles large XRD peaks were observed and hydrolysis degraded with cycle count . The acidic nanoparticles in this study were utilized as a hydrolyzing agent and the resulting sugars were isolated and concentrated by conventional means. Magnetic separation processes also have been used in solid waste disposal and recycling operations.

Flotation has been used in separation processes as well. Such separations often depend on density or wettability differences to separate product components. However the use of sorbents which are surface treated to selectively capture sugar or other targeted organic products and capable of being separated from complex process streams by flotation has not been reported.

The passivation and functionalization of particles has been addressed over the years by many different techniques and chemical efforts. Functional magnetic nanoparticles that can be separated from a fluid using a magnetic field have been described in e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 7 795 041 to Hatton et al. which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The magnetic nanoparticles described by Hatton et al. were directly embedded into and non covalently bound with a polymer and lacked chemical stability which led to the loss of magnetization of the particles over time and particle dissolution under conditions of the process environment.

Others have coated the surface of particles to modify the physical or chemical properties of the particle surfaces. Sorption ion exchange or binding and covalent bonding techniques have conventionally been used to coat particulate surfaces. Sorption and ion exchange require the surface to have the appropriate chemical characteristics and reactions that enable covalent bonding to particle surfaces generally involve reactions with surface bound hydroxyl groups. U.S. Pat. No. 7 524 630 to Tan et al. which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirely describes nanoparticles having a core shell structure with a magnetic core and silicon oxide shell surface functionalized with biologically active molecules such as antibodies and nucleotides. The nanoparticles of U.S. Pat. No. 7 524 630 reportedly are useful to label cells to detect and isolate nucleic acid molecules having specific nucleotide sequences and to separate a mixture of different nucleic acid molecules. More specifically U.S. Pat. No. 7 524 630 discloses a pre formed silica surface being conjugated with at least one functional group comprising an oligonucleotide in the form of a molecular beacon in which the oligonucleotide comprises a single stranded loop structure comprising a nucleic acid sequence of interest. However biologically active molecules such as nucleotides or antibodies conjugated to the particle surface are rapidly consumed or degraded by deleterious compounds present in the biomass process environment and thus cannot be used for sorption of targeted organic materials in such processes.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 548 264 to Tan et al. which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety discloses silica coated nanoparticles and a process for producing silica coated nanoparticles. Silica coated nanoparticles in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 6 548 264 are prepared by precipitating nano sized cores from reagents dissolved in the aqueous compartment of a water in oil microemulsion. A reactive silicate is added to coat the cores with silica. The method employs a microemulsion i.e. isotropic and thermodynamically stable single phase system to produce nanoparticle cores of a predetermined very uniform size and shape. The coated nanoparticles reportedly can be customized for a particular application by derivatizing various chemical groups onto the pre formed silica coating. However the microemulsion synthesis described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 548 264 is cumbersome cannot be readily scaled up and requires purification of the particles from the surfactant employed to create the microemulsion.

Others have found similar methods of nanoparticle functionalization to be useful for isolation of biological material such as nucleic acids medical screening monitoring for chemotherapy treatment responses cancer recurrence or the like. Typically these coatings are thin surface treatments on metal oxide cores which afford dispersion compatibility and for the best available technology control particulate aggregation but cannot prevent ion migration from reactive e.g. metal particles or affect ultimate sorption properties.

There is an ongoing need for alternative materials and methods for separating target organic products such as sugars lipids and hydrocarbons from fluids such as bioprocess streams. The compositions and methods described herein address this ongoing need.

A particulate magnetic nanostructured solid sorbent MNSS material is described herein. The particles of the MNSS material comprise a plurality of tethered nanoparticles. The nanoparticles are tethered together by molecular chains comprising a substantially linear hydrocarbon chain a poly alkylene oxide chain or a combination thereof connecting the nanoparticles e.g. by covalent bonds to the nanoparticles or in the surface proximity of the nanoparticles in a three dimensional elastic network having a junction functionality of about 2.1 to about 6 with the nanoparticles as junctions of the network. The surfaces of at least some of the nanoparticles comprise a polysiloxane bearing sorption aiding substituents which can be hydrophilic groups lipophilic group or a combination thereof. The plurality of nanoparticles is made up of superparamagnetic nanoparticles or a combination of superparamagnetic and non magnetic nanoparticles. The cores of the superparamagnetic nanoparticles are metallic and comprise at least one nanocrystalline metal e.g. a single metal or an alloy having ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic properties. The superparamagnetic nanoparticles comprise a passivating metal oxide coating around a nanocrystalline core. The non magnetic nanoparticles preferably are composed of a nanocrystalline metal oxide. Unlike magnetic nanoparticle materials described in the prior art which comprise discrete magnetic nanoparticles or clusters of magnetic nanoparticles in direct contact with each other the nanoparticles of the particulate MNSS materials described herein are tethered together in an elastic network. The molecular size of tethering chains allow the nanoparticles sufficient flexibility to orient freely in an applied external magnetic field while at the same time inhibiting undesirable direct nanoparticle to nanoparticle aggregation.

In use the hydrophilic and or lipophilic groups on the surface of the nanoparticles i.e. from the polysiloxane can interact with a compatible target chemical that is contacted with the MNSS material in a fluid i.e. liquid medium e.g. in a bioprocess stream so that the target chemical is sorbed onto the surface of the nanoparticles to form a MNSS target compound complex. The complex can be separated from the bulk fluid by a variety of processes including magnetic and flotation techniques. Once the complex has been separated from the bulk fluid the target organic material can be desorbed from the surface of the nanoparticles for recovery and subsequent use or further processing.

Preferably the superparamagnetic nanoparticles and non magnetic nanoparticles when present are substantially spherical. In some preferred embodiments the cores of the superparamagnetic nanoparticles comprise Fe Co or a combination thereof e.g. FeCo . Preferably the superparamagnetic nanoparticles have a mean diameter of about 0.5 nm to about 100 nm more preferably about 2 nm to about 50 nm. The non magnetic nanoparticles preferably have a mean diameter of about 2 nm to about 50 nm. The non magnetic nanoparticles preferably comprise at least one metal oxide such as titania alumina ceria zirconia silica and the like. As used herein the term metal oxide is meant to encompass oxides of transition metals main group metals lanthanides actinides and metalloids e.g. Si .

The nanoparticles of the MNSS are tethered together by molecular chains preferably substantially linear chains comprising a hydrocarbon chain and or a poly alkylene oxide chain also sometimes referred to as a poly oxyalkylene chain . The molecular chains tethering the nanoparticles are covalently attached to the nanoparticles or the polysiloxane sorption aiding substituents on the surface of the nanoparticles and effectively deploy the nanoparticles in a flexible three dimensional array or network. In some embodiments each end of the tethering chain is bonded to a metal oxide on the surface of a nanoparticle or to the polysiloxane through a silicon to oxygen bond. Such bonding can be achieved by reacting the passivated superparamagnetic nanoparticles and non magnetic nanoparticles when present with a difunctional coupling agent that includes reactive groups at the ends of the molecular chains that can react e.g. with a metal oxide or the polysiloxane on the surface of the nanoparticles. One convenient and useful type of reactive group is a trialkoxysilyl group where the silicon is directly bonded to the end of a hydrocarbon chain or a poly oxyalkylene chain. One or more of the alkoxy substituents is displaced by a hydroxyl group in the surface proximity of the nanoparticles to form a silicon to oxygen bond thus anchoring the tether to the nanoparticle. As used herein reaction of a hydroxyl group or other reactive functional group in the surface proximity refers to reactions e.g. coupling or polymerization that occur on or around the surface of the nanoparticles. The polysiloxane and the tethering chains do not need to be covalently bonded to the surface of the nanoparticles for tethering or surface functionalization to occur. During formation of the MNSS network the siloxane monomers and tethering groups surround the surface of the nanoparticles e.g. like a net . The monomers polymerize around the nanoparticles and the tethering groups typically bond with a hydroxyl group or other reactive group of the polysiloxane. The net result is that the particles are tethered together even though there may not be any covalent bond the nanoparticle surface.

In some embodiments the surface proximity of at least some of the nanoparticles comprises a polysiloxane bearing sorption aiding hydrophilic groups that are capable of interacting with sugars or other organic target compounds. Such hydrophilic groups are utilized to sorb hydrophilic target compounds such as sugars polyols organic acids and the like from a liquid medium such as a bioprocess stream. In other embodiments the surface proximity of at least some of the nanoparticles comprises a polysiloxane bearing sorption aiding lipophilic groups i.e. hydrophobic groups capable of interacting with lipids hydrocarbons and the like . Such lipophilic groups are utilized to sorb lipids hydrocarbons terpenes and the like from a liquid medium such as a bioprocess stream.

In yet other embodiments the surface proximity of at least some of the nanoparticles comprises a polymerized siloxane or a combination of siloxanes bearing hydrophilic groups and lipophilic groups. Such materials allow the surface hydrophilicity lipophilicity to be tailored for particular target molecules. In cases where the polysiloxane includes more than one type of hydrophilic and or lipophilic group the different sorption aiding groups can be derived from the same monomer or from different monomers.

Also described herein is a method of separating a target organic compound from a liquid medium e.g. an aqueous or non aqueous liquid . The method comprises the steps of contacting a liquid containing the target organic compound with an MNSS material as described herein for a time sufficient to sorb at least a portion of the target organic compound from the liquid forming e.g. a complex and separating the complex i.e. MNSS material with the adsorbed target organic compound from the liquid. In some embodiments the liquid contains less than 15 wt of the target organic compound prior to contacting with the MNSS material. The separation can be effected magnetically e.g. by magnetocollection magnetoflocculation or magnetoanisotropic sorting or can be effected by other means such as flotation. Optionally the method can include the additional step of recovering the target organic compound from the MNSS complex following the separating step. For example the MNSS complex can be removed to another compartment vessel or unit operation e.g. by skimming pumping etc. this removal is referred to herein as elution and the complex can be subjected to one or more of the following concentration processes magnetostriction pH shock thermal shock mechanical deformation or solvent extraction to desorb the target compound. Alternatively subsequent to elution the complex can be injected into a reaction medium e.g. containing enzymes and or other reagents of significantly smaller volume than the original liquid to induce specific chemical reactions in the separation compartment.

In another aspect a method of preparing a MNSS material is provided. The method comprises forming a mixture comprising nanoparticles a coupling agent a polymerizable siloxane monomer e.g. a single monomer or a combination of monomers and optionally a solvent in relative quantities sufficient for the coupling agent to tether the nanoparticles to a selected degree of junction functionality of about 2.1 to about 6 and for the siloxane monomer to form a polysiloxane in the surface proximity of the nanoparticles heating the mixture to enable the coupling agent to tether the nanoparticles together and to enable the siloxane monomer to polymerize in surface proximity of the nanoparticles thereby forming the particulate MNSS material and optionally removing any volatile by products or solvent from the MNSS mixture. As described elsewhere herein the nanoparticles comprise superparamagnetic nanoparticles or a combination of superparamagnetic and non magnetic nanoparticles. Each superparamagnetic nanoparticle comprises a passivating metal oxide coating around a metallic nanocrystalline core and the non magnetic nanoparticles preferably comprise a metal oxide e.g. the same metal oxide as the passivating coating or a different metal oxide . The cores of the superparamagnetic nanoparticles comprise at least one a metal or alloy having ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic properties. The coupling agent comprises a substantially linear hydrocarbon chain poly alkylene oxide chain or a combination thereof in which the ends the chain include functional groups capable of covalently reacting with the nanoparticles or with the polysiloxane e.g. with a metal oxide or a reactive polysiloxane functional group. The polymerizable siloxane monomer can comprise a single monomer or a combination of monomers that collectively bear one or more hydrophilic groups lipophilic groups or a combination of hydrophilic and lipophilic groups.

MNSS materials that selectively capture sugars lipids hydrocarbons or other organics e.g. carboxylic acids aromatic compounds etc. extend the use of magnetic fields in separation processes by resolving process barriers that have long been associated with the use of solid sorbents e.g. separation of sorbents from heterogeneous process streams long separation times and expense generally required to collect a solid sorbent from a liquid mixture and organic product delivery for conversion. These problems are only exacerbated as particles approach nanometer dimensions by the inherently large surface area required for efficient organic sorption.

The MNSS materials described herein address the shortcomings of the existing art and provide additional advantages due at least in part to the elastic network of tethered nanoparticles and the functionalized polymer coatings in the surface proximity of the nanoparticle junctions of the networks which impart selectable physical properties e.g. flexibility glass transition temperature etc. and chemical properties e.g. desirable polymer product enthalpic interactions or solubility to sorb targeted organic material from a process stream further enable separation from the process stream or enable desorption of sorbed species. The large surface area of the nanoparticles must be functionalized to enable the economic advantages they impart to be realized. In addition the tethering of the nanoparticles provide MNSS particle diameters suitable to afford sufficient collective magnetization to enable the MNSS to be removed from a reaction mixture by the application of a magnetic field of effective strength to influence the mobility of the MNSS organic product complex in the mixture. The tethers also provide for spacing between the nanoparticles to better accommodate permeation of the target molecule into the particles of the MNSS and to allow the superparamagnetic nanoparticles to freely orient in an applied external magnetic field of sufficient strength to induce a net magnetization in the nanoparticles. The average MNSS particle diameter is the range of about 0.1 to 1 000 microns but preferably about 1 to 500 microns or more preferably about 50 to 300 microns.

The superparamagnetic nanoparticles are synthesized using colloidal techniques or other techniques known to those skilled in the art and coated with a metal oxide material to chemically passivate the particles. Superparamagnetic particles do not display permanent magnetism. Permanent magnetism after a magnetic field is switched off would lead to aggregation by mutual interaction between the particles. The use of superparamagnetic particles avoids this undesirable aggregation. As discussed elsewhere herein the particle size of the nanoparticles is 100 nm or less preferably 50 nm or less to achieve suitable superparamagnetic behavior which is characterized by single domain structures.

The tethering of the nanoparticles into a network affords advantages structural features and properties not found in the prior art relating to superparamagnetic nanoparticles. For example the tethering chains link the nanoparticles in a manner that enables the magnetic nanoparticles to orient freely in an applied magnetic field without clustering together to form a permanent magnetic moment. In addition the elastic expanded nature of the network provides porosity which allows the target organic compound to permeate the MNSS particles and interact with the functional groups on the surface of the nanoparticles to facilitate sorption of the targeted organic product. The surface functionalization can be tailored to affect the desired degree and selectivity of organic target compound sorption from a liquid such as a process stream and to further enable separation of the target compound from the process stream and or enable desorption of sorbed target compound subsequent to elution.

The particulate MNSS material is added to the aqueous fluid process steam in a quantity effective to enable a specific degree of organic product sorption from the fluid e.g. capture of sugar from the biomass hydrolysate.

The term superparamagnetic and grammatical variations thereof refers to a form of magnetism that appears in ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic nanoparticles generally less than 50 nm. e.g. about 3 to 50 nm depending on the material that have a single magnetic domain. In the absence of an external magnetic field the magnetization of each nanoparticle randomly flips direction in response to thermal energy temperature . The period of time between flips is referred to as the N el relaxation time. In the absence of an external magnetic field the magnetization of a superparamagnetic nanoparticle is zero when the magnetization is measured over a time period significantly longer than the N el relaxation time. In the presence of an external magnetic field the nanoparticles magnetize to create a single large magnetic moment the sum of all the individual magnetic moments carried by the atoms of the nanoparticle align .

The term sorption refers to a physical and or chemical process driven by favorable enthalpy by which one substance becomes attached to another i.e. absorption the incorporation of a substance in one state into another of a different state and adsorption the physical adherence or bonding of ions and molecules onto the surface of another phase are considered as a single process.

The term junction functionality refers to the average number of chains per cross linking junction in polymeric network. In the context of the present invention junction functionality refers to the average number of tethering chains e.g. hydrocarbon or poly alkylene oxide chains attached to each nanoparticle in a magnetic nanostructured solid sorbent MNSS material.

The term substantially linear as used herein in reference to a tethering chain refers to a contiguous chain of at least eight 8 atoms between the reactive groups attaching the chains to the nanoparticle surface. The term substantially linear encompasses linear hydrocarbon chains of the form CH CH CH for n equal to at least 6 e.g. 6 to 20 as well as hydrocarbon chains of the form CH CH CH in which one or more of the hydrogen atoms of a methylene group is replaces by a short alkyl substituent such as methyl ethyl or propyl. Similarly the term substantially linear when used in reference to a poly alkylene oxide chain encompasses poly ethylene oxide materials as well as materials comprising polypropylene oxide and or polybutylene oxide monomer units i.e. which include pendant methyl and ethyl substituents respectively along the principal polymer chain. Preferably the tethering chains are composed of linear hydrocarbon chains of the form CH CH CH poly ethylene oxide chains preferably including an average of at least 3 oxyethylene monomer units in the chain e.g. 3 to 12 or a combination of linear hydrocarbon and poly ethylene oxide groups of the form R O CHCHO R in which m has an average value of at least 2 e.g. 2 to 10 and each R is CH in which p is an integer from 1 to 8 preferably 1 2 or 3 . The poly alkylene oxide chains of the coupling agent can comprise molecules of substantially a single chain length i.e. m an integer or the poly alkylene oxide chains of the coupling agent can comprise a mixture of molecules of different chain lengths with the average chain length being equal to m i.e. m is not an integer .

MNSS materials methods for making the same and processes exploiting the separation concentration attributes of the same are described herein. A detailed discussion of certain examples of the MNSS materials and methods are presented below for purposes of illustration.

Non magnetic nanoparticles can be incorporated into the MNSS material to provide additional features such as the ability to separate the MNSS target compound complex from the liquid medium by flotation to desorb the target compound from the MNSS target compound complex e.g. by species by magnetostriction pH shock thermal shock or solvent extraction or to provide increased mechanical strength or elasticity e.g. to facilitate mechanical modes of desorption of sorbed target compound.

The sorption properties of the MNSS network depend on the number of factors including e.g. the density of functional side chains attached to the polysiloxane on the surface of the nanoparticles the length size of the tethering of the chains between the nanoparticles the density of the nanoparticle network junctions and the chemical nature of the chains hydrophilic lipophilic or both .

The cores of the superparamagnetic nanoparticles can be composed of any metal or alloy capable of exhibiting ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic properties and superparamagnetism such as e.g. iron cobalt and an iron cobalt alloy such as FeCo. Preferably the non magnetic nanoparticles comprise or are composed of a metal oxide such as aluminum oxide titanium oxide zinc oxide or iron oxide.

Illustrative substantially spherical iron nanoparticles that are about 30 to 40 nm in diameter can be synthesized from iron chloride by polyol reduction at 130 C. in ethylene glycol using sodium hydroxide reduction mediation following procedures known to those skilled in the art see D. Kodama et al. 2007 310 2393 2395 . The particle size crystallinity and single crystalline or magnetic domain structure can be confirmed by transmission electron microscopy TEM high resolution TEM HRTEM X ray dispersion XRD analysis and the like. The magnetic properties of the nanoparticles can be characterized using a superconducting quantum interference device SQUID . To prevent permanent ferromagnetic behavior the iron surface must be passivated e.g. with a metal oxide coating such as a silica or alumina coating. The measured magnetization of iron nanoparticles prepared using these methods should compare favorably with the bulk value of iron 220 emu g .

The superparamagnetic nanoparticle cores can be passivated by a number of methods such as colloidal precipitation and atomic Layer Deposition ALD techniques known to those skilled in the art see e.g. M. Ritala and M. Leskela in H. S. Nalwa Editor 2001. Academic Press San Diego. p. 103 and A. C. Dillon et al. Surface Chemistry of AlODeposition Using TMA and HO in a Binary Reaction Sequence 1995 322 230 242 to render the metallic nanoparticles stable in bioprocess environments and to prevent undesirable permanent magnetic behavior. The thickness of the passivation layer should be sufficient to render the metallic nanoparticles chemically stable in the environment in which the particles will be used and to provide for repeated recycling of the MNSS in a separation process to gain economic advantage over existing biomolecule separation processes. Typically the passivation layer will have a thickness in the range of about 5 to about 40 nm. Selection of a suitable thickness for the passivation layer is a routine matter within the capabilities of a person having ordinary skill in the art or nanomaterial preparation.

The nanoparticles are tethered together to form a network using coupling agents comprising substantially linear hydrocarbon and or poly alkylene oxide chains with pendent reactive groups at each end of the chain which can covalently react with the metal oxide or the polysiloxane on the surface of the nanoparticles forming an elastic network in which the nanoparticles are the network junctions and the tethering chains connect the junctions. Preferably the network has junction functionality in the range of about 2.1 to about 6. The reactive pendent groups can be any groups capable of reacting with the surface of the nanoparticles or the polysiloxane on the surface of the nanoparticles e.g. with the metal oxide or sorption aiding functional substituents of the polysiloxane present at the surface . Conveniently and preferably the reactive groups comprise trichloro substituted or trialkoxy substituted silyl groups in which the silicon is attached to the tethering chain and one or more of the chloro or alkoxy group can be displaced by an oxygen in the proximity of the metal or metal oxide surface or the polysiloxane in the surface proximity of the nanoparticles to form a silicon to oxygen bond thus anchoring the particle to the tethering chain. Alternatively the pendent groups of the coupling agent can comprise other reactive groups such as amino azido hydroxyl and glycidoxy. The molecular size of the linear hydrocarbon or poly alkylene oxide chains employed to tether the nanoparticles together is selected e.g. to enable the magnetic nanoparticles to orient freely in an applied magnetic field and to provide sorption of the targeted organic product.

The surfaces of the nanoparticle junctions are functionalized with hydrophilic and or lipophilic groups to enable sorption of target organic compounds further enable separation from the process stream and or enable desorption of sorbed compounds. The nanoparticle surfaces are functionalized by a polysiloxane disposed in the surface proximity of the nanoparticles e.g. by polymerization of a functionalized siloxane monomer or monomers at the surface proximity of the nanoparticles. The monomers from which the polysiloxane is formed include the hydrophilic and or lipophilic groups as side chains. The side chains can include groups such as for example amino aminophenoxy benzoyloxy alkyl e.g. methyl ethyl hexyl cyclohexyl octyl dodecyl octadecyl gluconamide glycidoxy hydroxyl mercapto methacryloxy fluoro aryl e.g. phenyl maleamate phosphonate a carboxylic anhydride e.g. succinic anhydride suitably attached to the polysiloxane. In some embodiments siloxane monomers can have the formula X Si R in which x is 1 2 or 3 preferably 2 Xis chloro or OR and the Rgroups are the hydrophilic and or lipophilic substituents of the polysiloxane. The chloro and ORgroups are hydrolyzable to form unstable silanol groups which than condense to form a polysiloxane backbone which optionally can be covalently bonded at the surface proximity of the nanoparticles. Preferably each Ris alkyl e.g. methyl or ethyl and each Rindependently is selected from the group consisting of amino hydroxyl mercapto alkoxy alkyl e.g. a C Calkyl such as methyl ethyl propyl butyl hexyl decyl dodecyl octadecyl which can saturated or unsaturated cycloalkyl e.g. cyclohexyl aryl e.g. phenyl and heteroaryl e.g. pyridyl in which the alkyl cycloalkyl aryl and heteroaryl groups can be unsubstituted or can be substituted with one or more suitable substituent such as alkyl cycloalkyl aryl heteroaryl amino hydroxyl mercapto alkoxy a carboxylic acid a phosphonic acid a sulfonic acid a carboxylic ester a carboxylic amide a carboxylic anhydride a saccharide sugar a halogen e.g. F Cl Br or a salt of such groups that may be ionizable. In some preferred embodiments siloxane monomers can be dicyclohexyl diethyl dimethyl or diphenyl siloxane monomers. Mixed side chain chemistries can be employed to affect the desired degree and selectivity of the target organic compound sorption from a process stream and or enable desorption the targeted organic products to effect concentration.

The degree of nanoparticle functionalization achievable in a given case is directly related to the nanoparticle surface area or the nanoparticle size and morphology. The surface functionalization formed by a heterogeneous polymerization reaction in the particle surface proximity . The preferred method of tethering and surface functionalizing the nanoparticles comprises mixing the nanoparticles with bi functional coupling agents and surface functionalization siloxane monomers and reacting the mixture under conditions e.g. temperature environment e.g. neat or in a suitable solvent and reaction time that are effective for the coupling agent to tether the nanoparticles together forming the MNSS network and the siloxane to polymerize at the surface proximity of the nanoparticles. Volatile by products may be driven off as the MNSS mixture is heated. The nanoparticles coupling agents and surface functionalization monomers are added in quantities effective to enable a specific separation. The selection of suitable coupling agents monomers reactions conditions and the like is within the capabilities of a person having ordinary skill in the chemical arts.

An exemplary process flow diagram is provided in to illustrate the separation and concentration of sugars produced by the hydrolysis of biomass feedstocks. The superparamagnetic properties of the MNSS material can be utilized to facilitate recovery of a MNSS sugar complex by magnetic separation. The term magnetic separation as used herein refers to a process that uses a magnetic solid and an externally magnetic field to separate materials or compounds. Examples of magnetic separation include e.g. magnetocollection magnetoflocculation and magnetoanisotropic sorting. The MNSS material is introduced into a biomass hydrolysate medium and sugars in the medium are sorbed by the MNSS to form a MNSS sugar complex. The complex can be magnetically separated and or separated by flotation from the hydrolysate medium moved eluted to another compartment vessel or unit operation such as by skimming or pumping and then concentrated e.g. by magnetostriction pH or thermally induced desorption mechanical modes of desorption solvent extraction to desorb the target compound. Subsequent to elution the complex optionally can be introduced into a reaction medium e.g. containing enzymes or other reagents of significantly smaller volume than the volume of liquid from which the complex was eluted to begin subsequent processing such as fermentation or catalytic conversion. The sugar can be separated from the MNSS sugar complex during the concentration process if desired so the MNSS can be recycled into the biomass processing environment to separate additional target sugar.

In the process described in an acid pretreated lignocellulosic biomass slurry is subjected to solid liquid separation to form a liquid hydrolysate . A particulate MNSS material with hydrophilic surface functionality compatible with the target sugar is added to liquid hydrolysate where the target sugar is sorbed by the MNSS material . The resulting mixture is subjected to magnetic separation to separate a MNSS C5 sugar complex from the residual acidic hydrolysate medium which can be recycled into slurry . After separation the solids cellulosic and lignin can be subjected to enzyme hydrolysis to form C6 sugar. The C6 sugar can also be treated with MNSS and subjected to magnetic separation to form a MNSS C6 sugar complex . Complexes and can be separated from the MNSS to form a high titer sugar solution which can be converted to other materials e.g. a biofuel as desired.

The small size of the MNSS sugar complexes micro sized particles enable the complexes to be dispersed in an aqueous or liquid phase and treated with homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts to produce valuable products. Therefore the MNSS materials descried herein can be used not only to capture targeted organic compounds e.g. sugars from a process stream but also to resolve process barriers long associated with the use of solid absorbents such as the continuous separation of absorbents from solid liquid process streams long separation times and expense generally required to collect a solid sorbent from a liquid mixture and organic product delivery for conversion. In addition the energy requirements for magnetic fields used in the separation process are minimal and thus should not significantly offset cost savings from the other benefits.

Direct capture of sugar molecules from the aqueous phase of a biomass hydrolysate using an MNSS material as described herein can significantly simplify the overall biomass conversion process at the pretreatment stage and significantly reduce energy and processing costs. The captured sugar can be made available at very high titers for conversion to biofuels bio based products or biochemicals.

This technology is not limited to the direct capture of cellulosic sugars from pretreatment hydrolysate but is generally applicable to any process with a low titer organic product and could significantly reduce down stream product separation cost and save energy. Examples of other such products include e.g. organic acids lipids and hydrocarbons.

Commercial adsorbents based on silicon titania alumina metal oxide particles and polymer beads form the basis of industrial ionic separation processes. Specifically chemically functionalized poly styrene co divinylbenzene ion exchange resin beads are tailored to absorb glucose and xylose. The sugar capture efficiencies of these commercial ion exchange beads were evaluated as a basis for comparison with the MNSS materials described herein.

Substantially spherical nanocrystalline superparamagnetic iron cobalt alloy FeCo particles approximately 10 to 20 nm in diameter were synthesized by metal carbonyl decomposition at 200 C. In a typical synthesis 1.5 mmol of hexadecylamine hydrochloride HDA.HCl and 20 mL of benzyl ether BE were mixed and degassed at room temperature for 30 minutes under a flow of Argon Ar with stirring. Trioctylphosphine TOP 1.5 mmol was then added to the degassed solution and the reaction mixture was heated to 120 C. degassed for an additional 30 minutes to dissolve HDA.HCl and then heated to 200 C. Concurrently 0.5 mmol of cobalt carbonyl CoCO was dissolved in 4 mL of octyl ether at 45 C. under Ar with stirring. Fe CO 6 mmol was added to the CoCO octyl ether solution mixed well and then added to the 200 C. TOP HDA.HCl reaction solution under Ar. The reaction solution was maintained at 200 C. for 30 minutes and then cooled to room temperature. FeCo nanoparticles were harvested from the cooled reaction solution with a magnet washed with a hexane ethanol mixture and stored in hexane. The particle size and crystallinity of the recovered FeCo nanoparticles were confirmed by TEM HRTEM and XRD analysis. Energy dispersive spectra EDS were taken over several areas of the nanoparticles on a TEM grid demonstrating a consistent Fe to Co atomic ratio of approximately 2 to 1. The X ray diffraction XRD pattern of the nanoparticles exhibited a bcc crystal phase.

Substantially spherical nanocrystalline superparamagnetic FeCo alloy particles 10 to 20 nm in diameter were synthesized from iron chloride FeCl 0.2 mmol and cobalt acetate tetrahydrate Co Ac .HO 0.1 mmol by polyol reduction at 130 C. in ethylene glycol EG using sodium hydroxide NaOH 12 mmol reduction mediation and chloroplatinic acid HPtCl.6HO 2.4 10mol as a reducing catalyst. The particle size and crystallinity of the nanocrystalline FeCo alloy particles were confirmed by TEM HRTEM and XRD analysis.

High aspect ratio nanocrystalline FeCo alloy fibers are produced by electrospinning followed by thermal oxidization and thermal reduction. Thermal reduction in forming gas produces metal or metal alloy nanofibers. The metal oxide state is extremely friable and ball milling the metal oxide fibers prior to thermal reduction converts the fibers into substantially spherical nanocrystalline superparamagnetic particles of approximately 30 to 50 nm in size subsequent to thermal reduction. The particle size and crystallinity of the FeCo alloy nanoparticles were confirmed by BET TEM HRTEM and XRD analysis. Magnetic characterization was conducted using a SQUID device. The measured magnetization of the FeCo nanoparticles was 190 emu g.

The superparamagnetic nanoparticle surfaces can be passivated by colloidal methods using IGEPAL CO 520 emulsifier and coupling agent chemical name nonyl phenol ethylate 5 moles EO CAS Number 68412 54 4 manufactured by Rhodia followed by reaction with tetraethylorthosilicate TEOS under basic conditions pH approximately 9 to form a coating of colloidal silica on the surface of the metal nanoparticles. The degree of nanoparticle passivation imparted by the colloidal method is directly related e.g. to the nanoparticle surface area the quantity of nanoparticles and the passivation material. For example to passivate 85 of the surface area of a plurality of nanoparticles with a surface area of 23 m g approximately 0.01446 moles of the passivation agent i.e. tetraethylorthosilicate per 100 g of nanoparticles is required. The passivated nanoparticles are separated from the synthesis solution and washed to remove unreacted ingredients. Care must be taken not to passivate the magnetic nanoparticles at too high a concentration to prevent aggregate formation. Metal nanoparticles must be passivated to prevent undesired reaction with the process environment e.g. oxidation and to enable repeated process cycling of the MNSS.

The superparamagnetic nanoparticles also can be passivated using Atomic Layer Deposition ALD techniques see e.g. M. Ritala and M. Leskela in H. S. Nalwa Editor 2001 Academic Press San Diego. p. 103 A. C. Dillon A. W. Ott J. D. Way and S. M. George Surface Chemistry of AlODeposition Using TMA and HO in a Binary Reaction Sequence Surface Science 1995 322 p. 230 242 . Advantage can be taken of ALD passivation of the magnetic nanoparticles of the invention under solventless process conditions to render the metallic nanoparticles stable in a bioprocessing environment.

The thickness of the passivation layer is not limited but should be sufficient to render the metallic nanoparticles chemically stable and provide for repeated recycling of the MNSS in process to gain economic advantage over existing bioprocess separation processes. Typically passivation layers have a thickness of about 5 to about 40 nm preferably about 15 nm.

MNSSs are synthesized in two concurrent chemical processes 1 the passivated magnetic nanoparticles are tethered together with non magnetic nanoparticles as a network to form larger MNSS particles and 2 and the surface of the individual nanoparticle junctions of the network are functionalized to enable sorption of targeted organic products further enable separation from the process stream and or enable desorption of sorbed species.

As described elsewhere herein passivated magnetic and non magnetic nanoparticles preferably are tethered together to form a network using coupling agents comprised of substantially linear hydrocarbon or poly alkylene oxide chains e.g. poly methylene oxide poly propylene oxide or poly butylene oxide chains with a pendent reactive group at each end of the chains such that each reactive group can bind with a nanoparticle surface or the polysiloxane sorption aiding substituents on the surface or in the surface proximity of a different nanoparticle. The various nanoparticles in essence become the junctions connecting the organic chains in a three dimensional network. The reactive pendent groups Non limiting examples of certain preferred bi functional coupling agents include e.g. 1 8 bis triethoxysilyl octane i.e. EtO Si CH CH CH Si OEt and bis 3 triethoxysilylpropyl poly ethylene oxide i.e. EtO Si CHCHCH O CHCHO CHCHCH Si OEt where m preferably has an average value of about 2 to about 10.

Elastic networks preferably are formed with junction functionalities of about 2.1 to about 6 e.g. about 2.2 to about 4 or about 2.3 to about 3. Advantage can be taken of the superparamagnetic properties of the magnetic particles by selecting the molecular weight of the linear hydrocarbons employed to tether the nanoparticles together to enable the magnetic nanoparticles to orient freely in an applied magnetic field and to provide sorption of the targeted organic product.

As described elsewhere herein the surfaces of the magnetic and non magnetic nanoparticles are chemically functionalized to enable sorption of targeted organic products further enable separation from the process stream and or enable desorption of sorbed species. The chemistry of the surface functionalization is not limited and preferably comprises polymerized siloxane chains polysiloxanes that include with one or more pendent hydrophilic hydrophobic and or lipophilic side chains. Sorption is enabled by forming desirable enthalpic interactions between the targeted organic compounds e.g. sugars carboxylic acids lipids hydrocarbons present in a process stream and the nanoparticle surface functionality on the nanoparticles and may be enhanced by including multiple types of pendent side chains on the nanoparticles surfaces. Separation from the process stream can be effected for example by flotation mechanisms which are enabled by hydrophobic surface functionalities and or my magnetic separation methods. Desorption of sorbed species can be effected for example by processes such as magnetostriction pH and or thermal shock solvent extraction and increased mechanical strength or elasticity to enable mechanical modes of desorption. The mechanical properties of the network depend on the number of polymer chains attached in the proximity of the nanoparticle surface the molecular weight of the polymer chains tethering the junctions together and the density of the network junctions see e.g. Brotzman R. W. Flory P. J. The Elastic Behavior of Cis 1 4 Polybutadiene 1987 20 351 356 Brotzman R. W. The Elastic Behavior of Cis 1.4 Polybutadiene in 1986 ACS Symposium Series Plenum 361 377 Brotzman R. W.

Nanoparticles preferably are surface functionalized by heterogeneous vapor phase polymerization of siloxane monomers at the particle surface proximity and may be catalyzed using alkali metal methoxide salts. Surface functionalization can be characterized by thermogravimetric analysis TGA as well as magic angle spinning MAS and cross polar magic angle spinning CP MAS solid state NMR techniques. Nanoparticles may also be functionalized with a greater amount of surface functionalization precursors to form surface treatments that contain polymer loops.

One exemplary method of tethering and functionalizing the nanoparticles surfaces comprises mixing the substantially spherical passivated superparamagnetic and or non magnetic nanoparticles with coupling agents and siloxane monomers. The mixture is reacted at a temperature e.g. sufficient to vaporize the siloxane monomers in an environment e.g. in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as a methoxide salt and for a time that is effective for the coupling agent to tether the nanoparticles together forming the MNSS network and the surface functionalization precursors to polymerize in the particle surface proximity functionalizing the passivated magnetic and non magnetic nanoparticles. Volatile by products may be driven off as the MNSS mixture is heated. The nanoparticles coupling agents and the surface functionalization precursors are added in quantities effective to enable a specific separation.

FeCo superparamagnetic nanoparticles about 20 nm particle size were passivated with TEOS and IGEPAL CO 520 in water under basic conditions pH approximately 9 as described in Example 1 to afford passivated FeCo superparamagnetic nanoparticles comprising a silica coating in an amount about 10 greater than required to achieve complete surface coverage. A combination of bis triethoxysilyl octane and a monomer mixture of a 3 glycidoxypropyl substituted siloxane and a phenyl substituted siloxane at four different monomer ratios was combined the passivated nanoparticles and then reacted in the presence of sodium methoxide catalyst to polymerize the siloxane monomers and tether the nanoparticles into an MNSS network with junction functionality of about 2.6. The resulting polysiloxane coating over the surface of the nanoparticles comprised dihydroxypropyl and phenyl substituents. Four MNSS examples were prepared with the dihydroxypropyl phenyl monomer ratios provided in Table 2.

MNSS sugar sorption uptake or capture was quantified in single pass sorption experiments using synthetic hydrolysate liquids containing glucose or xylose in water at a sugar concentration of about 30 g L and expressed as mass sugar sorbed per mass of MNSS. The incorporation of phenyl groups into the surface treatment depressed sugar sorption. Evaluation of surface functionalization processes reveals the efficacy of the surface treatment is process dependent and control of surface functionalization connectivity is critical to high sorption. The data in Table 2 are averages of 2 to 6 replicate experiments.

Glucose is the primary monomeric component in the cellulose polymer and xylose is the primary monomeric component in hemicellulose polymer. They are both present biomass.

The separation of lipophilic products from a process stream such as non polar hydrocarbons and lipids can be achieved by producing MNSS with lipophilic pendent groups on the polysiloxane such as e.g. hexyl octyl dodecyl and or octadecyl groups as described elsewhere herein. Optionally the separation process can employ hydrocyclone separation of hydrocarbon products and hydrocarbon product complexes that are less dense than the process stream and or do not wet the process stream magnetic separation of MNSS would follow hydrocyclone separation. The use of a hydrocyclone adds value by affecting the separation of process solids from the hydrocarbon product complex.
