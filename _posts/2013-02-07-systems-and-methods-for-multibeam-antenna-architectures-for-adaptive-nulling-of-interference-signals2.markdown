A multiple Beam Antenna MBA is a type of antenna system employed in the satellite applications and under normal operating mode has a field of view FOV that covers a section of the Earth s surface termed the coverage area. The MBA contains several feeds that illuminate a lens or a reflector system to produce multiple beams. The adaptive MBA is designed to combat interference sources including intentional jammers located anywhere within the desired area covered by the quiescent pattern of the antenna. This is accomplished by relatively high resolution afforded by a multibeam antenna with a relatively large aperture size and a significant number of beams providing the desired degrees of freedom in the adaptive nulling process. The outputs of the multiple beams are linearly combined in the MBA beamformer in an adaptive manner so as to introduce nulls in the direction of interference sources while minimizing the inevitable antenna gain reduction in any other direction within the quiescent beam width. To achieve the desired objectives effectively the adaptive algorithm must have sufficiently rapid convergence rate to adapt in a dynamic scenario such as the presence of blinking jammers and have reasonable computational requirements in terms of the actual number of arithmetic operations per update of the algorithm.

The adaptive algorithms of the prior art are based on the constrained optimization of the array gain related to the signal to noise power ratio for a signal source in the direction of the peak of the antenna gain as specified by the steering vector. The steering vector or the quiescent weight vector actually produces reasonable directive gain to users in the specified coverage area in the absence of jammers essentially a property of the MBA antenna.

However this is not the case with the adapted pattern obtained with the adaptive algorithm in the presence of jammers wherein there is considerable reduction in the antenna gain in the coverage area with the reduction being highly non uniform over the area of coverage. One of the adaptive algorithms termed SMI Sample Matrix Inversion minimizes the residual interference power at the MBA beamformer output. However the SMI algorithm does not optimize the area covered by the adapted beam. In terms of implementation the SMI algorithm requires Ncomplex multiplications and additions and an N N matrix inversion for each algorithm update wherein N is the number of beams in the MBA. Furthermore in situations involving multiple jammers of varying power levels the estimated correlation matrix may become ill conditioned and high precision arithmetic may be required to avoid numerical instability. A computationally simpler algorithm termed correlation feedback CF requires only order N computations. However for the case of high condition number of the relevant correlation matrix involved the convergence may be very slow and may not be acceptable in some dynamic scenario.

Quantized state QS algorithms taught by Kumar have convergence rates similar to that of SMI algorithm and possibly orders of magnitude faster than the CF algorithm. The QS algorithm require much smaller computational requirements compared to the SMI algorithm and are also numerically robust with matrix condition number that is order of the square root of the condition number of the correlation matrix involved in the SMI algorithm. The quantizes state algorithms are also capable of providing better gain distribution in the coverage area than the SMI algorithm especially in areas in the vicinity of the interference sources.

The adaptive algorithms of the previous literature exhibit spurious nulls in the adapted MBA beam pattern in that the antenna gain pattern has nulls in the directions other than the direction of the interfering sources. The number of the spurious nulls their locations and depth is highly variable and depends upon the algorithm used the number of interfering sources their directions and power levels etc. and is otherwise unpredictable. Due to these spurious nulls the coverage area of the MBA antenna has undesirable holes around these nulls in addition to those around the interfering sources.

Thus it is desirable to have architectures that eliminate the presence of spurious nulls in the area of coverage provide superior antenna gain distribution in the coverage area compared to the architectures of the prior art and result in a higher signal to interference plus noise ratio for the users located in the coverage area. It may be also desirable to be able to have architectures for finding the directions of the interference sources including intentional jammers for RF surveillance purposes. The adaptive multibeam architectures of this invention possess these and various other benefits.

Various embodiments described herein are directed to methods and systems for adaptive multibeam antenna architectures for recovering users signals transmitted from sources in the coverage area of the antenna in the presence of interference sources. The invention presents architectures that mitigate the presence of spurious nulls in the area of coverage provide superior antenna gain distribution in the coverage area compared to the architectures of the prior art and result in a higher signal to interference plus noise ratio for the users located in the coverage area. For example various embodiments may utilize an architecture comprised of an array of antenna feeds an RF to baseband conversion subsystem a bank of digital beamformers a channelization subsystem a bank of weighted combiners and a bank of demodulators for the demodulation and detection of user signals.

In one of the invented architectures the bank of digital beamformers is comprised of a multiplicity M of MBA beamformers that have a common RF front end and employ different algorithms for example one of the MBAs may employ one of the QS algorithms with the other employing SMI algorithm in the case of two beamformers and combining the outputs of the multiplicity of the beamformers to produce the resultant MBA pattern. As another example two different QS algorithms may be employed in the two of the beamformers thus maintaining the computational advantages of the QS algorithm.

The invented architecture inherits many advantages of the various algorithms in the component beamformers resulting in an overall superior antenna gain distribution in the coverage area after the adaptation. Due to different weight vector arrived at by the different adaptive algorithms in the multiplicity of the beamformers resulting from a relatively large degree of freedom due to the number of beams N being much higher than the number of interference sources the residual interference from M different beamformers may have significant decorrelation among them. Thus a diversity gain can be realized by combining the outputs of the M beamformers using for example maximal ratio combining in addition to the gain that will be realized by the selecting the beamformer with the highest antenna gain.

As the antenna gain of any of the M beamformers is highly non uniform over the coverage area such a selection or maximal ratio combining performed over the total outputs of the multiplicity M beamformers may not provide the complete benefit of the diversity combining. However the realization that different users in the coverage area transmit their signals in a multiple access mode such as the frequency division multiple accessing FDMA mode users at different locations in the coverage area can be differentiated on the basis of the frequency bands allocated to them for transmission. Therefore the invention presents architectures that first channelize different user signals based on their allocated bandwidth in FDMA system or assigned code in the CDMA Code Division Multiple Accessing System for each of the M beamformers and then using diversity combining or selection techniques for different users realize a full benefit of the multiple beamformer architecture with diversity combining. Various other embodiments of the architecture of the invention may use various other multiple accessing modes including time division multiple accessing TDMA mode and various hybrid modes.

The invention presents algorithms such as the quantized state algorithms with multiple thresholds termed generalized quantized state GQS algorithms and transformed state quantized state TQS algorithms that may be employed in various embodiments of the invented multibeam antenna architectures. The method for obtaining the input threshold levels and the corresponding quantized state levels in terms of the power levels of the multiplicity N feeds outputs is presented for increased antenna gain in the close vicinity of the interference sources.

Various embodiment of one of the architectures may comprise of phased array antenna with multiple digital beamformers wherein a single digital beamformers may receive signals from multiple signal sources transmitting in different frequency bands in a the FDMA mode or using different codes in the CDMA mode while introducing nulls in the direction of interference sources. In various embodiments of the invention more than one digital beamformer may receive signal from a common source and a diversity gain may be achieved by combining the signals from multiple digital beamformers. As an example of M equal to 4 digital beamformers with K equal to 4 different desired signal sources transmitting in different bandwidth slots wherein one of the four digital beamformers may receive signals from 3 signal sources with indices 1 2 3 with the other three digital beamformers receiving signals from the sources given with indices 1 3 4 2 3 4 and 1 2 4 respectively and appropriately combining these signals in the signal combiners may result in achieving triple diversity gain.

An important characteristic of the invented architecture is that the resultant composite MBA beam pattern does not exhibit any spurious nulls in the coverage area when the multiplicity of the beamformers M is sufficient. This is due to the fact that different beamformers employ different adaptive algorithms and thus their spurious nulls may not coincide with the result that any of the users that are not in the immediate vicinity of the interfering sources do not experience antenna gain null and the resulting loss in the availability of the communication link. Furthermore the gain pattern obtained by selecting the maximum of the gain of the M beamformers at each location of the coverage area also may not exhibit any spurious nulls. The absence of spurious nulls makes it possible to precisely locate the sources of interference with the MBA architecture of the invention useful for possible counter measures.

These and other advantages of the invention will be apparent form the detailed description of the invention.

The following description is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention and sets forth the best modes contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention. Various modifications however will remain readily apparent to those skilled in the art since the generic principles of the present invention have been defined herein specifically to provide systems and methods for adaptive multibeam antenna architectures.

Referring to the RF signals v . . . vat the output of the N RF feeds in the focal plane of the MBA reflector not shown are inputted to the RF to baseband conversion subsystem for providing the state vector x k comprised of the digital complex baseband signals to the digital beamformers through M. Throughout the description of the invention the notations a b . . . M and 1 2 . . . M for any integer are equivalent and both refer to the enumeration between 1 and M. In various other embodiments of the invention the reflector may be replaced by a lens.

Referring to the state vector x k is inputted to the digital beamformers blocks 1 . . . M. The digital beamformers linearly combine the elements x k . . . x k of the state vector x k in an adaptive manner so as to create antenna beam nulls in the directions of the interference sources. All of the M digital beamformers introduce nulls in the direction of the interference sources however they may apply different adaptive algorithms for the nulling process and or some of the beamformers may use the same class of algorithms but with different algorithm parameters. Application of different nulling algorithms may result in significantly different MBA gain pattern after the adaptation for the M digital beamformers 1 2 . . . M.

Referring to the outputs of the digital beamformers z k . . . z k are inputted to the signal combiner block for appropriately combining the signals at the outputs of the M digital beamformers. Referring to the signals z k . . . z k are inputted to the polyphase analyzer blocks 1 2 . . . M. Polyphase analyzer is a computationally efficient system for filtering channelizing the input spectrum into K FFT channels that may correspond to the spectral bands allocated to K different users with the users signals converted to the complex baseband. In a polyphase channelizer each of the K FFT channel has the same bandwidth. A user with a higher bandwidth requirement may be allocated multiple adjacent frequency slots corresponding to multiple FFT channels.

Referring to the polyphase channelizer outputs u u . . . uare inputted to the weighted combiner n 1 . . . K. Each of the M signals u u . . . uat the input to the combiner is a different version of the complex baseband signal of the user n with the difference arising from different MBA antenna gain of the M beamformers in the direction of the user n that results in a different receiver signal to noise plus interference power ratio among the M inputs to the weighted combiner . Due to different weight vectors in the M digital beamformers arising from the fact that the number of degrees of freedom equal to the dimension of the weight vector is much higher than the number of interference sources to be nulled the residual interference plus noise at the output of the M beamformers may be significantly uncorrelated. This results in the resulting noise plus interference associated with the M inputs to a weighted combiner being significantly uncorrelated. By appropriate combination of the M signal inputs a significant diversity gain can be achieved in terms of the reduction of the noise plus interference power at the combiner output by employing various diversity combining techniques thereby achieving a higher signal to noise plus interference ratio at the weighted combiner output compared to the signal to noise plus interference ratios at the inputs to the weighted combiner.

In various embodiments of the invention the weighted combiner may use a switched diversity scheme wherein the combiner selects the input with the maximum input signal to interference plus noise ratio by assigning a weight 1 to the input with the maximum input signal to interference plus noise ratio and weight 0 to all of the other M 1 inputs. After the convergence of the adaptive digital beamformers the residual interference power on all the M beamformer outputs is relatively insignificant compared to the noise power. With the weight vectors in the M beamformers all normalized to unit norm the noise powers at the outputs of the M beamformers are equal and equal to the variance of the noise at the outputs . . . N of the IF to baseband converters . Therefore selection of the input with the maximum input signal to interference plus noise ratio form the M inputs to the weighted combiner is equivalent to selecting the input with maximum total signal plus noise power. In case of uncorrelated noise and interference among various signals at the input of the weighted combiner the signal to noise plus interference ratio SNIR at the weighted combiner output may be equal to the sum of the SNIR at the individual inputs to the weighted combiner with the use of maximal ratio combining resulting in very significant diversity gain due to the multiple digital beamformers.

Referring to the outputs u . . . uof the weighted combiners are inputted to the respective data demodulator blocks 1 . . . K for the demodulation and detection of the various user data providing detected data outputs circumflex over d circumflex over d . . . circumflex over d . The data demodulator blocks may also include a low pass filter to eliminate any out of band noise or interference before the demodulation and detection operation.

In various embodiments of the invention that use polyphase channelizer for channelization any user c allocated number of bandwidth slots the corresponding output signals at the weighted combiner are selected by the channel selector block . The outputs selected by the channel selector are inputted to the polyphase synthesizer block that translates the spectrum of the inputs such that the translated spectrum of the inputs occupy adjacent frequency slots and combines these translated signals to provide the composite baseband signal uat the output of the polyphase synthesizer block . The composite baseband signal at the output of the polyphase synthesizer block is inputted to the data demodulator block for filtering demodulation and detection providing the detected data circumflex over d for the user n that has allocation of multiple frequency slots at the output of block . In various embodiments of the invention there may be multiple number of users allocated with different number of frequency slots wherein the composite baseband signal for each such user is generated and detected with the use of channel selector polyphase synthesizer block and the data demodulator block as in the generation of data circumflex over d for the user c allocated with frequency slots.

The multiplicity channels allocated to a single user c all have the same physical location and thus the weighted combiner weight vectors of the corresponding weighted combiners may be the selected to be equal and therefore splitting the spectrum of user c by the polyphase analyzer into channels and combing the corresponding outputs form the weighted combiner output may not result in any discontinuity due to different signal gain experienced by different components of the split spectrum of the composite user c. Furthermore any impact due to the filtering operations in the polyphase analyzer and synthesizer in terms of introduction of any possible discontinuity in the spectrum at the boundaries of the adjacent multiple channels in the composite signal ucan be eliminated by the use of generalized polyphase channelizer taught by Kumar in Generalized Polyphase Channelization System U.S. Pat. No. 7 403 577 issued Jul. 22 2008 incorporated by reference with this application. In various other embodiments of the invention the channels corresponding to the composite user c may be combined at the output of the polyphase analyzer 1 2 . . . M with M polyphase synthesizers and the M composite signals inputted to the weighted combiner that provides the composite baseband signal to the data demodulation block . In various other embodiments of the invention various methods other than the polyphase analyzer method may be used for the channelization operation wherein in some of these methods the bandwidth allocated to different users may be different. However the alternative channelization methods may also have a higher computational requirement then the polyphase analyzer synthesizer method. Non limiting examples of such alternative methods are the frequency domain filtering method analytical signal method multistage and hybrid techniques.

The adaptive algorithm of block in may select the weight vector w ww. . . w with T denoting transpose so as to minimize the power Jat the combiner output according to Min 1 Subject to 1 2 In 1 E denotes the expected value operator superscript H denotes the conjugate transpose operation and x xx. . . x and in 2 ddenotes the steering vector. In 1 and 2 it is implicitly assumed that there are no desired signal sources other than in the direction corresponding to the steering vector which may be equal to 1 1 . . . 1 or the power levels from any of the desired signal sources is sufficiently small relative to the interference or jammer power.

Referring to in various embodiments of the invention the digital beamformers . . . M may use different adaptive algorithms that may be selected for example from the set of algorithms including the state matrix inversion SMI recursive least squares RLS correlation feedback CF quantized state 1 QS1 quantized state 2 QS2 quantized state 1 with constraints QC1 quantized state 2 with constraints QC2 generalized versions of the QC1 and QC2 algorithms involving multiple thresholds referred to as QCG1 and QCG2 algorithms or any other similar adaptive algorithms. In various embodiments of the invention more than one digital beamformers may use the same adaptive algorithm with different algorithm parameters.

In the minimization in 1 and 2 the signal sources may be turned off during the adaptation phase otherwise the beamformer may also place nulls in the direction of the desired signal sources as well. In the period following the adaptation phase the beamformer weights are not perturbed and the desired signal sources are turned on. The disadvantage of such a strategy is that it may not be possible to null the interference from blinking jammers. The quantized state algorithms may provide some shielding of the signal sources from the adaptation algorithm. The SMI algorithm obtained from the minimization in 1 and 2 with a quadratic constraint given by 3 results in the following non recursive version of the SMI algorithm

In 3 is some small positive scalar and in 4 is an implicit function of . Relatively higher values of result in reduced interference rejection capability but may provide some gain in the direction of the signal sources with relatively small power levels that are turned on during the adaptation phase. AS the signal to noise plus interference ratio SNIR is not changed by an arbitrary scaling of the weight vector the denominator in 4 may be dropped. Replacing the matrix R by its estimate circumflex over R k the recursive version of the SMI algorithm is given by 1 1 1 1 2 5a 5b 

In situations where a pilot signal form a desired signal source is available an unconstrained adaptive algorithm for the estimation of the weight vector may be obtained by minimization of the following optimization index J 6 

In 6 s k is the pilot signal to be tracked by the digital beamformer. The least squares algorithm obtained by minimization of Jis given by 7 

In 8 n k and I k denotes the spatial noise vector and the interference vector respectively present at the output of the RF to baseband conversion subsystem and substitution of the expression for x k in 7 in the following expression for r. 9 

As both n k and I k are uncorrelated with s k . Substitution of 9 in 7 results in an expression for w k that is similar to w k in 5b .

In various other implementations of the invention the adaptive algorithm in the digital beamformer of may be the exponentially data weighted recursive least squares algorithm given by 10 . 1 1 10a 1 1 1 1 10b 1 10 

In 10c the scalar normalizes the norm of the weight vector w k to 1 and circumflex over R k in 10a b is equal to a scalar that is a function of k times the inverse of the matrix circumflex over R k in 5a with 0 and with 0

An alternative version of the RLS algorithm for the case wherein instead of the known pilot signal the steering vector d is specified is given by 11 In 11 the scalar is selected so as to reduce the norm of the weight vector equal to 1.

In various other embodiments of the invention the correlation feedback algorithm may be used in the digital beamformer of wherein the weight vector w is decomposed as 12 with wdenoting the component that is equal to a scalar times the steering vector d and with wdenoting the component of w that is orthogonal to the vector d selected so as to optimize the index Jin 1 and is given by 1 1 13a 0 13b In 13 circumflex over R k is given by 5 a tilde over P is the projection operator and is a positive scalar selected to be sufficiently small so as to ensure convergence of the algorithm.

In various embodiments of the invention the digital beamformers in may use the various quantized state algorithms. The quantized state algorithms are obtained as a result of projection of the weight vector w k 1 on to the hyper plane Hin the weight vector space given by s k wx k 0 so as to minimize the weighted norm square 1 14 with respect to a positive semi definite matrix B k resulting in a point w k on the hyper plane Hand then evaluating the center of mass of the weight vectors w 1 . . . w k with respect to a positive semi definite matrix k . With the selection of the matrices B k x k x k and k x k x k x k x k result in the following QS1 algorithm. 1 1 15a 1 1 1 1 15b 1 15c In 15 k is a scalar that may be selected to be some constant that is sufficiently small to ensure convergence of the algorithm and x k is the quantized state vector.

Alternatively the weight vector win terms of the steering vector d is given by 1 1 1 16a 16b In 16b is the selected to normalize the weight vector to unit norm. In 15 16 the quantized state vector x k is obtained by a component wise quantization of the state vector x k .

The real and imaginary components of the jcomponent of the vector x k in 15 16 denoted by x k are given by 17 

In 17 Re z and Im z denote the real and imaginary parts respectively of z for any complex variable z and D x for any real x is the threshold function given by

Another version of the QS1 algorithm that may be used in the various embodiments of the invention is given by

In various embodiments of the invention one or more of the digital beamformers in may use the QS2 adaptive algorithm obtained by replacing P k in 15 by P k and given by 1 1 19a 1 1 1 1 19b 1 19c In cases wherein the number of interference sources is greater than 1 the threshold function D x x real in 17 used to quantize the state vector x k in the generalized quantized state GQS algorithms may be replaced by the threshold function D x with multiple thresholds given by 0 1 20 where Nis the number of thresholds V i 1 2 . . . Nare the Ninput thresholds with Vfor i N 1 equal to and Vare the output levels of the threshold function D x .

The input threshold levels Vand the output levels Vin 20 are some progressively increasing positive numbers possibly based on the average power levels Pof the feed outputs x k j 1 2 . . . N. In some of the various embodiments of the invention the N power levels Pare arranged in an increasing order and divided into Ngroups wherein the power levels within each group differ by less than dB for some relatively small value for for example may be selected equal to 3 dB. The power levels of the first group may be selected to be equal to the sum of the power of the spatially white noise arising in the RF to baseband conversion subsystem and the expected power level due to the relatively small signal power sources distributed over the coverage area that may be transmitting during the adaptive nulling process. Denoting by P P . . . Pthe power level equal to the maximum of the power levels in each of the Ngroups then the threshold levels may be determined as follows. With V 0 and V square root over P 3 j 1 2 . . . N V for j N 1 V 0 V 1 and square root over 2 21 The computed value of Vfrom 21 may be rounded off to for example a power of 2 and is some positive constant that may be selected equal to . With V 0 the impact of the distributed and relatively small signal power sources is minimized on the adaptive nulling algorithm thus providing a shielding effect on the desired signals from the nulling algorithm.

The grouping or the partitioning of the power levels P j 1 2 . . . N in 21 may be accomplished by first dividing the power levels in dBW by and rounding off the result to the nearest integer value. The power levels with the same rounded off values are then grouped into the same group. For example with the power levels equal to 31 21.5 19.7 10.5 dBW and with 3 dB the division of the power levels by and rounding off the result to the nearest integer values results in 10 7 7 3 . As the second and third elements of the set are both equal to 7 the corresponding power levels belong to the same group resulting in the partition of the power levels given by 31 21.5 19.7 and 10.5 dBW.

In various embodiments of the invention the state vector x k may be transformed by an orthonormal matrix Qthat may be equal to the eigenvector matrix of the covariance matrix R with the normal form of R given by 22 

In 22 the diagonal matrix is the eigenvalue matrix of R with the correlation matrix of x k given by E x k x k resulting in the components of x k being uncorrelated. Applying the QS1 algorithm to the transformed state vector x k and denoting by x k the quantized version of the state vector x k results in the following transformed state version of QS1 algorithm TQS1. 1 1 23a 1 1 1 1 23b 1 23c 

A transformed state version of the QS2 algorithm TQS2 is similarly given by 1 1 24a 1 1 1 1 24b 1 24c 

In various embodiments of the invention one or more digital beamformers in may use the constrained quantized state projection algorithm CQ2. In the CQ2 algorithm the adjustment in the weight vector is constrained to lie in the state space orthogonal to the vector dwith initial estimate of the weight vector given by a scaled version of the vector dequal to w d dd and the weight update algorithm given by 1 25a 1 1 1 0 25b 1 0 25c 1 25d In 25a k is in general a time varying positive scalar selected so as to adjust the convergence rate of the algorithm and in 25b is some relatively small positive scalar.

In 26a the matrix T k is updated according to 25b . The QC1 and QC2 algorithms wherein the quantized state vector is based on the multiple threshold function x in 20 are termed in the description of the invention as the GCQ1 generalized QC1 and GQC2 generalized QC2 algorithms. The QC1 and QC2 algorithms due to the threshold function in the quantization of the state vector x k shield at least partially the signal sources with their power levels Pcorresponding to the first threshold level Vin the threshold function D in 20 from the adaptive nulling algorithm. Thus the adaptation may be performed without turning off the desired signal sources with relatively small power levels in a dynamic or blinking jammer scenario. However the adaptive algorithm may result in the nulling of signal sources with relatively higher power levels and these may have to be turned off during the process of adaptation making it more difficult to mitigate interference in the dynamically changing interference environment.

In various other embodiments of the invention the projection based algorithms including the QC1 and QC2 algorithms may be generalized to the case of multiple steering vectors corresponding to multiple signal sources with relatively large signal power levels. For the case of Nsignal sources with relatively large power levels relative to the threshold V and with the corresponding steering vectors equal to the N Nmatrix Qis considered wherein there are Ninterference sources with their direction vectors represented by the columns of the N Ndimensional matrix Q.

The subspace of the vector subspace spanned by the columns of Qthat is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by the columns of the matrix Qis given by subspace spanned by the columns of the matrix Q given by 27 where in 27 the rank of the matrix Qis Nso that the matrix QQis nonsingular. In case the rank of the matrix Qis smaller than N the number of columns of Qcan be reduced by for example using the Gram Schmidt orthogonalization procedure resulting in the number of columns equal to the rank of the matrix with reduced columns. In 27 the rank of the matrix Q may be smaller than N in which case the number of columns of Q are reduced by the Gram Schmidt orthogonalization procedure resulting in the matrix Qwith independent columns.

In case wherein the direction vectors of the interference sources are orthogonal to those of the signal power sources the matrix Q is equal to Qas QQ 0 and Q Q. From the matrix Q the projection matrix tilde over P is given by 28 

The CQ1 and CQ2 algorithms for the case of multiple steering vectors are given by 25 26 with tilde over P given by 27 and 28 and with the vector wconstrained to lie in the subspace spanned by Q wherein the vector wmay be selected as 1 1 . . . 1 29 

The matrix Qin 27 may be obtained in an initial step wherein adaptation is performed with transmission from relatively large power signal sources turned off to determine the location of the interference sources with further adaptation performed with the transmission of the signal sources turned on to adapt to the dynamic interference conditions. Alternatively the locations of all the interference and signal sources can be determined with all the signal sources turned and the signal sources identified by some additional means from the totality of the interference and signal sources determined by the adaptive algorithm. Any additional sources that are turned on after the initial phase are also nulled during the adaptation phase if their steering vectors are not in the subspace spanned by tilde over P .

In various other embodiments of the invention the steering vectors of the relatively high power signal sources and the interference sources may be determined from the normal form of the covariance matrix R of the state vector x k given by 22 . The subspace spanned by the columns of the matrix Qin 22 corresponding to the dominant eigenvalues given by the elements of the eigenvalue matrix in 22 contains the direction vectors of the sources with relatively large power.

In phased array antenna without adaptation a relatively narrow beam is steered in the direction of the desired signal source within the coverage area defined by the extent of the scan angle of the phased array antenna by introducing a relative phase difference among the outputs of the various feeds in the array. In adaptive nulling phased array antenna the outputs of the various feeds are weighted by complex weights. The weighted outputs are summed to provide the digital beamformer output and the weights are adapted so as to introduce a null in the direction of the source of interference while tracking a signal from the desired signal source. Multiple signal sources are tracked with different beamformers. However if the multiplicity of sources that are possibly in different geographical location but are transmitting in different frequency slots in the FDMA mode or at different codes in the CDMA multiple accessing systems the signals from such multiple sources may be received by a single digital beamformer with one of the various embodiments of the invention.

A diversity gain may be achieved by combining the signals from multiple digital beamformers. Referring to as an example of M 4 digital beamformers with K different desired signal sources transmitting in different bandwidth slots one of the four digital beamformers may receive signals from 3 signal sources with indices 1 2 3 with the other three digital beamformers receiving signals from the sources given with indices 1 3 4 2 3 4 and 1 2 4 respectively and appropriately combining these signals in the signal combiner block of achieving triple diversity gain.

In various embodiments of the invention for the phased array antenna system a single digital beamformer may adjust the beamformer weights by minimizing the index 30 wherein s k s k . . . s k are the pilot signals form the signal sources with indices 1 2 . . . with respect to the weight vector w. Minimization of 22 with respect to w results in the following solution

A recursive least squares algorithm for the minimization of the time average version of Jin 30 is given by

In various other embodiments of the invention for the case of phased array antenna system the weight vector may be estimated by . . . 34a 1 1 1 34b Quantized state algorithms for the case of phased array antenna may be obtained by replacing some of the x k terms in 33 34 by the quantized version x k as in 15 and 16 .

Referring to the outputs z k of the digital beamformer is inputted to the polyphase analyzer . The polyphase analyzer is a computationally efficient channelizer architecture for band pass filtering the signals occupying K adjacent frequency slots in the input signal z k and simultaneously translating the spectrum of the K signals to the center frequency equal to 0 providing the complex baseband signals u k . . . u k at the output of the polyphase analyzer . For the critically sampled case the polyphase analyzer is comprised of a demultiplexer that provides K outputs each at a sample rate equal to R K sps samples per second wherein Ris the sample rate of the input signal z k and the rate decimation factor is equal to K. The K low rate signals at the output of the demultiplexer are inputted to a bank of polyphase filters with the filter outputs inputted to a K K FFT Fast Fourier Transform block. The outputs of the DFT block are the channelized signals u k . . . u k also referred to as the K FFT channel outputs. The polyphase channelizer effectively band pass filters the K user signals and translates all of the K band pass filtered signals to the complex baseband in a computationally efficient manner wherein the K band pass filters have non overlapping pass bands. The polyphase channelizers for the critically sampled case for wideband signals are taught by Kumar in Polyphase Channelization system U.S. Pat. No. 7 145 972 Dec. 5 2006 incorporated by reference with this patent application.

A computationally efficient polyphase channelizer for the case wherein the various users have different bandwidth allocation is taught by Kumar in Generalized Polyphase Channelization System U.S. Pat. No. 7 403 577 issued Jul. 22 2008 incorporated by reference with this application wherein any of the users may be allocated multiple adjacent FFT channels and there is introduced an intentional overlap among the frequency response of the K bandpass filters by selecting the rate decimation that is smaller than K such that a user may be provided a seamless spectral band of desired bandwidth.

In various alternative embodiments of the invention channelization methods other than polyphase channelizer may be used. Non limiting examples of such methods are the analytical signal method frequency domain filtering method multistage tree method and the hybrid methods.

Referring to the outputs through M u . . . uof the polyphase analyzer m 1 2 . . . M are inputted to the weighted combiner for n 1 2 . . . K. The weighted combiner selects a set of inputs with M from the M inputs and weighs the selected inputs with the complex weights j 1 2 . . . and sums the weighted inputs providing the nuser signal uat the combiner output for n 1 2 . . . K according to 35 providing a diversity gain of order .

The digital beamformers 1 2 . . . M may have different antenna gain patterns after the weight vectors of the adaptive nulling algorithms have converged to their quiescent values and the beamformer output corresponding to the maximum antenna gain in the direction of the user n may be selected for maximizing the signal to noise plus interference ratio at the output of the weighted combiner n. In the FDMA system the users at different locations have different frequency band allocations due to the intrinsic characteristics of the FDMA system therefore selection of the input with the highest antenna gain at the user location is achieved by selecting the input with the maximum signal power from the inputs to the weighted combiner. Such a selection also maximizes the output signal to noise ratio if the noise power at the various inputs to the weighted combiner is equal.

After the adaptive algorithms in the digital beamformers 1 through M have achieved convergence the residual interference due to any jammers may be relatively insignificant compared to the beamformer output noise due to the spatially uncorrelated noise at the outputs of the RF BPF AMP blocks 1 through N of . With denoting the variance of the complex baseband noise appearing at the outputs of the IF to baseband converters corresponding to the spatially uncorrelated RF noise at the output of blocks the variance of the noise n k at the output of the digital beamformer is given by w where wdenotes the weight vector of the digital beamformer m. As the various adaptive algorithms used in the digital beamformers normalize the norm of the vector wto 1 the noise variance at the outputs of the beamformers through M are all equal to . Furthermore the variance of the noise in any specific frequency band is also equal among the outputs of the digital beamformers resulting in equal noise variance among all the inputs inputted to any one of the K weighted combiners . Thus selection of the input with maximum signal to noise ratio in the weighted combiner is accomplished by selecting the input with the maximum signal plus noise power that may be estimated from the samples of the signals u.

In one of the various embodiments of the invention the weight in 35 with the index mcorresponding to the maximum total signal plus noise power among the M inputs to the weighted combiner is set equal to 0 with the remaining weights set equal to 0. The input signal plus noise power at the minput may be estimated by the time average Pgiven by 1 1 1 2 36 In 36 the parameter with 0

The weight vectors wof the various digital beamformers are in general different due to the application of different adaptive algorithms that result in different multibeam antenna gain pattern. Due to differences in the digital beamformers weight vectors the noise processes at the digital beamformers outputs given by n k w k with k denoting the complex baseband noise vector k n k . . . n k wherein n k i 1 2 . . . N denotes the noise present at the output of the IF to digital baseband converter may be significantly uncorrelated with each other. Thus an additional diversity gain may be achieved by the application of the maximal ratio combining technique in the weighted combiner given by 35 .

In maximal ratio combining technique the weights in 35 are selected to be proportional to the signal to noise ratio present at the M inputs to the weighted combiner after the signal phase of the various inputs are aligned with one of the inputs selected as the reference. Selecting the first input uas the reference the phase difference between the phase of the inputs uand umay be estimated as arg 1 1 1 2 . . . 37 The initial estimate for 0 in 37 may be taken to be 0. In 37 arg z denotes the phase of z for any complex value z and with 0

In 38 P k is the total power estimate as estimated by 36 and may be estimated by B B where is the variance of the noise present at the outputs of the IF to baseband converter Bis the bandwidth of the complex baseband signal x k and Bis the bandwidth of the user n signal. For the case of equal bandwidth allocated to all the users B B K where K is the number of users. The weighting coefficient in 35 for the maximal ratio combining is given by exp square root over 1 n 1 21 2 39 

In various embodiments of the invention a blind mode adaptive algorithm such as the Sato s algorithm may be used to obtain the combiner weights k in 35 . Foe faster convergence the signals u k are first normalized by the square root of the average signal power Pproviding y k by square root over 40 and the weighted combiner output given by

In 42 is some sufficiently small positive scalar to ensure convergence denotes complex conjugate operation sgn z is the signum function operating separately on the both the real and imaginary parts of real argument z. The signum function is equal to the function D x defined by 17b with V 0. The scalar in 42 for the nuser signal is given by is given by

In 42 43 is the property of the modulation type used for the nsignal and may be known a priori in that case it does not need to be estimated from 43 for example for BPSK modulation is equal to 1. In case needs to be estimated from 43 Pmay be estimated by averaging the powers Pover the index m and E s k may be estimated by time averaging the absolute value of the signal u k averaged over the index m.

In various other embodiments of the invention the various user signals may transmit in a code division multiple accessing CDMA system wherein the sampled complex baseband signal for user n is given by square root over 1 44 In 44 d k and d k denote the inphase and quadrature data of user n modulating the inphase code c k and quadrature code c k respectively assigned to user n.

Referring to the signals u k . . . u k are inputted to the weighted combiner block that combines the signals u k . . . u k with weights determined according to 35 to 43 resulting in user n signal u k at the output of the weighted combiner with u k given by exp square root over 1 46 In 46 Aand denote the amplitude and phase associated with the user signal n with n k denoting the noise at the weighted combiner output.

Referring to the signal u k is inputted to the data demodulator that provides the demodulated data output circumflex over d k circumflex over d k jcircumflex over d k j square root over 1 where circumflex over d k denotes the estimate of the data symbol d k of user n.

G u v in the coverage area as a function of the parameters u vgiven by sin cos sin sin 47 wherein and are respectively the elevation and azimuth angles in the satellite coordinate system is the signal wavelength and Dis the reflector diameter. The MBA gain pattern G u v m 1 2 . . . M may be obtained for example based on the model in the teachings of J. T. Mayhan in Nulling limitations for a multiple beam antenna IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation Vol. AP 24 No. 6 March 1976 pp. 769 779 incorporated by reference with this application.

Referring to the multiplicity M MBA gain patterns G u v m 1 2 . . . M are inputted to the max selector block that selects the maximum of G u v G u v . . . G u v for various values in the coverage area. The u v values for which the various gains are evaluated may lie on a rectangular grid in the u vparameter space with an appropriate grid spacing. Initially a relatively course grid may be selected for the evaluation of the MBA gain patterns and the evaluations may be repeated on relatively fine grids around the jammer locations for a more precise evaluation of the u vcoordinates of the jammers.

Referring to the gain pattern G u v at the output of the max selector block is inputted to the direction of the interference sources detector that obtains various local minima in the gain pattern using any of the known function minimization algorithms. Such algorithms include the LMS and Newton s algorithms for the function minimization. The u vcoordinates of the various jammers may be denoted by u vfor i 1 2 . . . Nwith Ndenoting the number of jammers or interference sources. As 0 2 with the use of equation 47 the value of sin may be obtained by 48 

From 47 and 48 the values of cos and sin may be obtained in 50 cos sin sin sin 0 50 With the knowledge of cos and sin in 50 may be obtained from the four quadrant inverse tangent function.

In case wherein the signal sources are transmitting along with the interference or jammer sources the minima obtained by the source detector will comprise of the u v or the coordinates of both the desired signal sources and the interference sources. In such a case the signal sources may be identified by a separate means such as via signaling information between the satellite or the base station in case of the applications of the MBA architectures to the terrestrial systems and the signal sources or from their locations obtained possibly by GPS or other position location means thereby identifying the directions of the interference or jammer sources from all the coordinates provided by the source detector .

A simulation example with 19 elements hexagonal structure as shown in is considered located in the focal plane of a parabolic reflector not shown. The evaluation of the complex electric field pattern for various feeds is based on the Mayhan model. The MBA gain pattern is evaluated using the weighted sum of the complex electric field due to various feeds with the weights given by the components of any of the beamformer weight vectors w k w k . . . w k . The offset reflector geometry is considered with the f number defined as the focal length fto the reflector diameter Dratio f D set equal to 0.25.

In the simulation example the MBA normalized gain pattern with the maximum gain normalized to 0 dB is plotted versus the parameters u D sin cos and v D sin sin where and are respectively the elevation and azimuth angles in the satellite coordinate system. In the simulation example two jammers with relative power levels of 40 dB and 30 dB relative to the spatially uncorrelated white noise of variance are present with their u v coordinates given by 3.3 1.9 and 1.8 1.8 respectively corresponding to the elevation and azimuth angles equal to 0.98 28 and 0.66 225 respectively.

As may be inferred form the contour plot does not show the spurious minima that appear in except for two shallow ones near the boundary of the coverage area. By taking the maximum of the QS QC2 and SMI gain patterns not shown these spurious nulls are also eliminated. In different jammer scenarios different spurious nulls are exhibited by the SMI QS and QC2 algorithms. also shows that that location of the nulls are much closer to the jammer locations compared to that in any of the three gain plots obtained by any single algorithm selected from the QS QC2 and SMI algorithms shown in .
