title: Water-lined munition container
abstract: A storage apparatus for a munition that contains energetic material uses a water-filled liner to absorb heat applied from the exterior of the storage apparatus. The liner is disposed between the munition and a metal storage container. The liner has segregated compartments which release water into either the storage container or the liner itself. The released water boils and forms steam. A spiral-shaped steam conduit is formed in either the wall of the storage container or in the liner itself. The steam conduit directs the steam away from the munition. The metal storage container includes a pressure relief valve to release the steam pressure. The storage apparatus delays the detonation of the energetic material in the munition.

The invention relates in general to munitions and in particular to compliance with Insensitive Munitions IM standards. IM standards require that to the extent practicable munitions are safe when subjected to unplanned stimuli. The Fast Cook Off FCO test is used to simulate a situation wherein munitions are exposed to a fire. In FCO munitions are engulfed in a flame of at least 1700 C. until the munition reacts. It is desirable for the reaction to be limited to no more than burning Type 5 IM reaction . A detonation type of reaction Type 1 IM reaction is to be avoided. During a FCO test munitions with no IM features typically demonstrate a Type 1 IM detonation in less than ten minutes.

In some cases the IM features of a munition require a slow heating to function properly. In other cases where a complete IM solution is not viable an improvement such as delaying the onset of the Type 1 IM reaction is desirable.

Known munition and ammo containers have several forms including boxes and tubes. Some of these containers have IM features for the venting of gases or for insulating the munition. The venting of gases may increase the delay time to detonation. Insulating a munition by itself has a minimal effect on the delay time to detonation. One known munition container is made of a composite glass reinforced resin with meltable salts. As the salts melt they absorb heat. However resin or plastic containers are often not suitable for munitions because the containers do not meet leak test standards after the containers are thermally cycled. Some commercial fireproof safes and fireproof doors use a layer of felt that is impregnated with a water based hydrogel as a means to mitigate heat damage.

IM venting is not feasible for some munitions. For example the AT4 single shot recoilless weapon is stored with the propellant in the weapon. The propellant in the AT4 is contained in its barrel between the warhead and a counter mass. Without venting and when exposed to conditions like the FCO test munitions such as the AT4 will detonate quickly. There is not enough time prior to detonation to evacuate or rescue nearby personnel. In some munitions even if IM vents are present the heating may occur distal from the IM vent and the munition may detonate before the IM vent has activated. The heating rate in situations like the FCO test is so rapid that there may not be enough time for the IM features to function prior to detonation.

A need exists for an apparatus and method for delaying the detonation time of munitions exposed to a FCO test.

One aspect of the invention is an apparatus including a closed metal container having a central longitudinal axis. A munition is disposed in the container. The munition contains energetic material and has a central longitudinal axis that is generally parallel to the central longitudinal axis of the container. A pressure relief valve is disposed in a wall of the container for relieving steam pressure in the container. A heat absorbing liner is disposed between an interior surface of the container and the munition. The liner has a central longitudinal axis that is generally parallel to the central longitudinal axis of the munition. The liner extends around a perimeter of the munition and extends axially along at least a portion of the munition.

The liner has an inner layer facing the munition and an outer layer facing the interior of the container. The inner and the outer layers define a plurality of segregated compartments. Each compartment contains water. The apparatus includes a fluid conduit having a spiral shaped cross section and a central longitudinal axis that is generally parallel to the central longitudinal axis of the munition. The munition is disposed internal to the fluid conduit.

Preferably the central longitudinal axes of the container the munition the liner and the fluid conduit are all generally horizontal.

In another embodiment the liner includes the spiral shaped fluid conduit. At least one of the inner and outer layers of the liner may include a peripheral metal foil layer. The spiral shaped conduit may be defined by adjacent wraps of the liner around the munition.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A novel apparatus for storing a munition uses water or water compositions such as hydrogel to absorb heat. The heat source is external to the stored munition. Water has a heat of vaporization of 2257 joules per gram. The heat of vaporization of water is 540 times greater than the heat needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water 1 degree C. Water maintains its boiling temperature until it is evaporated.

A heat absorbing liner shown in dashed lines in is disposed between an interior surface of container and munition . Liner has a central longitudinal axis C that is generally parallel to axis B of munition . Liner extends around the entire perimeter of munition and extends axially along at least a portion of munition . Liner may extend around the perimeter of munition multiple times. Liner has an inner layer that faces munition and an outer layer that faces interior surface of container . In container munition and liner are shown as cylindrical shapes for clarity. However container munition and liner may have other shapes and each need not be the same shape as the other. It is preferred that axes A B and C are all generally horizontal.

As liner absorbs heat generated external to container one or more compartments may burst or fail. The water or hydrogel from the burst compartments will collect in the bottom of liner and or in the bottom of container . As the water or hydrogel in the bottom of liner and or container boils steam is produced. Thermal protection for munition occurs by directing the steam that is produced through a fluid conduit having a spiral shaped cross section. The munition is disposed internal to the spiral shaped fluid conduit.

The entrance to conduit is preferably located vertically at least as high as the axis G of conduit . Water or hydrogel from burst compartments in liner collects in the bottom of liner boils and enters entrance of conduit . The steam flowing in spiral shaped conduit absorbs heat being applied to container from the external environment outside container . The steam leaves conduit at conduit exit and enters container . When the steam pressure in container is high enough the steam will exit container via relief valve .

A heating test was conducted on an AT4 single shot recoiless weapon loaded with its propellant. To establish a baseline measurement an AT4 weapon was placed in a wooden container without a liner and heated. The AT4 weapon detonated in about 7 minutes. Another baseline measurement was made using computer simulation to calculate the time required to detonate the AT4 when placed in a steel container. In the simulation of the steel container the time to detonation was also about 7 minutes. The reaction time of 7 minutes is from the perspective of munitions in general exceptionally long because the propellant in the AT4 is insulated by a barrel. Most munitions have a thin walled cartridge case and during a FCO test will react in a matter of seconds. Such a short time period does not enable another type of IM feature to activate.

A liner was constructed using two sheets of plastic that were heat sealed to form compartments and water was placed in the compartments . A vapor barrier sheet having a foil layer was placed on the exterior of one of the plastic sheets of the liner . The liner was wrapped around the AT4 weapon three times and secured to the AT4 weapon with duct tape. The AT4 weapon and liner were placed in a PA116 steel container with a vent . The test time was limited to about 22 minutes. The flame temperature fluctuated and averaged about 1700 degrees F.

The AT4 weapon with the liner did not react after a burn time of 22 minutes. The apparatus was examined after the burn test and water was still retained in the spiral shaped conduit . The surface of the AT4 weapon under the liner including plastic parts of the AT4 decals on the AT4 and the duct tape were all intact. is a graph of the temperature on the top surface of the AT4 inside the conduit as a function of time. Because water from the burst compartments pools at the bottom of liner the cooling at the top of the AT4 as shown in is from the steam in conduit .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
