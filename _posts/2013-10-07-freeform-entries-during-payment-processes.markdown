This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 730 101 filed Mar. 23 2010 which is incorporated herein by reference as part of the present disclosure.

The present invention generally relates to conducting a financial transaction on line and in particular to conducting financial transactions using free form entries to select desired actions.

During a typical payment process flow the user may be asked to authorize a payment or transmission before the transaction can be completed. Authorization may include the user selecting a specific button or link such as Pay Now Confirm Send Purchase Buy etc. The user may also have the option of selecting a specific button or link to perform other actions such as cancel the transaction e.g. Cancel continue shopping e.g. Continue save to cart or account e.g. Save etc. By selecting such buttons or links which may be done by clicking or tapping the desired information is conveyed to the recipient typically a payment provider or merchant in a purchase transaction.

However requiring the user to select a specific button can be inconvenient because the user has to look for find and select the button on the screen. This can be problematic with small screens small buttons and mobile devices in situations when the user or device is moving or non stationary. As a result the user may select the wrong button or spend extra time and effort to select the desired button. All this leads can lead to frustration by the user cancellation of a purchase transaction either intentional or inadvertent hesitancy to engage in a future transaction and other consequences that may be undesirable for the merchant user or payment provider.

In addition simple selection of the buttons is a relatively mundane task which while needed may not be much fun for the user.

Therefore a need exists for ways in which a user can make selections on a device that overcomes the disadvantages mentioned above.

According to one embodiment of the disclosure a user places a check mark or V anywhere on the display to convey an approval and an X anywhere on the display to cancel a transaction or process. For a touch screen display the user simply swipes the screen with the user s finger to place the desired mark on the display. In other types of displays the user may use a stylus mouse track ball or other means suitable to the display. Once the mark is placed the corresponding action is performed. For example when a user is ready to make a payment typically conveyed by clicking a Pay button the user may simply place a check mark on the screen instead of looking for and selecting the specific button.

In other embodiments different free form marks or actions can be used to convey information typically conveyed through one or more buttons or links. Examples include drawing a currency symbol to show a currency conversion from the current currency to the swiped currency or to send a payment using the currency that was swiped shaking the mobile device to cancel the current transaction and double tapping the screen to skip a review screen and proceed directly to checkout. The free form actions can also be verbal. For example the user may say checkout or other word or phrase to complete or initiate a checkout cancel or end to cancel or restart a transaction or other suitable words during various stages of a process or transaction. In another embodiment the action may be shaking the device to cancel or restart a transaction.

Thus the user is provided a fun and easy way to handle various stages of a transaction on a user device without having to find and select specific buttons or links.

These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.

The screen presented to the user at step may be in response to a request from the user such as initiating a transaction or as part of including completion of a transaction. The screen is presented on a user device having a display that allows the user to perform a free form action which may include making a mark on the display inputting an audio word or phrase or shaking or moving the user device. Examples of suitable devices may be a PC smart phone laptop or other computing device. The device may have a touch screen display such as an iPhone by Apple or displays in which the user can speak a command into the device or make a mark such as with a stylus mouse track ball track pad or other means.

In response to seeing the screen requesting the user for an action the user performs a free form action. In one embodiment the user swipes a check mark or V on the screen such as with the user s finger or a mouse. Other free form actions may include marks such as an X a slash or a currency symbol or any other suitable mark. In different embodiments the free form action may also be or alternatively be a voice command such as cancel continue yes no confirm etc. or a movement such as shaking the device to cancel or restart a transaction. Thus the user device must be capable of processing the free form action and transmitting it to the entity or system processing the transaction. For swipes and other movements the device detects the movement on or through the display and converts the movement to a signal for transmission. For audio actions the device converts the audio command to a signal for transmission. For movements an accelerometer or other motion sensing device processes the detected motion and converts the motion to a signal for transmission. Such methods are conventionally known. Transmission may be through any suitable communication medium such as through the Internet via a wired or wireless connection.

Once the user performs the free form action the corresponding signal is transmitted to and received at step by the system processing the transaction. The system then determines at step whether the user action is recognized. An unrecognizable action may be the result of the user performing a proper action but in a way that is unrecognizable to the system. For example if the user was intending to swipe a check mark that action may be unrecognizable because the check mark was made in an area outside an acceptable area of the user display the mark was made too quickly for the device to properly process it and or the mark was not made properly e.g. lines not straight enough or broken . The action may also be unrecognizable because it was not an action accepted by the system e.g. the user swiping a circle when a circle does not correspond to anything in the system the user saying Commence when that word does not correspond to anything in the system or the user shaking the device in a circle when the device only recognizes an up and down motion.

If the user action received at step is determined as one that is not recognized by the system the system notifies the user at step . The notification may be a text or audio message informing the user that the action was not accepted or recognized. The user may re enter the action if requested by the system. The number of re entries which can be zero may be limited as determined by the system.

If the action is recognized by the system as determined at step the action is processed at step . Some examples of actions include but are not limited to confirm a payment send a payment cancel a transaction convert a currency send a payment in a selected currency initiate a checkout process approve a transaction and cancel a payment. After processing the user may be sent a message about the status of the action e.g. that the payment was successfully transmitted. This can be through any means such as a text message email recorded voice message etc.

At step the user is requested to enter a specific action that is to be recognized by the system and or entity processing the action request such as PayPal Inc. For example the user may be requested to draw a check mark X or other visual mark say Cancel Approve Checkout or other audio comments or move the device in an up and down motion side to side motion or other physical movement. The user does the requested action which is processed by the system. Next at step the user is asked to repeat the action for confirmation. The user repeats the action requested from step and the system processes the repeated action.

A determination is then made at step whether the action in step and the action in step matches. Determining a match between two actions can be done with conventional and known methods and algorithms. The system may decide how much variation is acceptable between the two actions. For example with a mobile device the system may be willing to accept wider variations than with a PC or laptop because the user and or device may be moving when the action is being performed.

If the two actions to not match the user may be requested to enter and re enter the action again. This may be beneficial if the first entered action at step was incorrect or not what the user intended. In other embodiments the user may be asked only to repeat or re enter the action at step . Once there is a match the action which may from step step or a combination of steps and is stored with the system at step . The stored action is associated with the specific user. Thus when a user logs into the system the user can match the user action with what is stored for that user resulting in a system that may be more reliable with less errors and unrecognizable actions.

Thus using different free form actions such as marks symbols vocal commands or physical device movements the user may cause an action to be performed without having to locate and select a specific button or link on the device.
