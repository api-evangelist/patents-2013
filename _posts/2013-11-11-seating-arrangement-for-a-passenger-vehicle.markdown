These and other aspects objects and features of the present invention will be understood and appreciated by those skilled in the art upon studying the following specification claims and appended drawings.

For purposes of description herein the terms upper lower right left rear front vertical horizontal and derivatives thereof shall relate to the invention as oriented in . However it is to be understood that the invention may assume various alternative orientations except where expressly specified to the contrary. It is also to be understood that the specific devices and processes illustrated in the attached drawings and described in the following specification are simply exemplary embodiments of the inventive concepts defined in the appended claims. Hence specific dimensions and other physical characteristics relating to the embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting unless the claims expressly state otherwise.

With reference to there is shown a first embodiment of a compact passenger motor vehicle having a front end F a longitudinal central axis X X and a passenger compartment P defined by front rear and side walls and . The vehicle has a source of motive power that can be of any suitable known kind including wheel motors that can be located in any suitable position.

A seating arrangement for two occupants is provided in the form of a front seat and a rear seat arranged in a staggered duplex partial overlapping relationship within the passenger compartment.

The front seat has seat cushion or squab and a backrest. The front seat squab has a front edge a rear edge an inboard edge and an outboard edge and is positioned forward in the passenger compartment P so as to be located as close as practicable to the front wall .

The length of the front seat squab is the distance between the front and rear edges and of the front seat squab and the width of the front seat squab is the distance between the inboard and outboard edges and of the front seat squab .

The rear seat has seat cushion or squab and a backrest. The rear seat squab has a front edge a rear edge an inboard edge and an outboard edge and is positioned towards the rear of the passenger compartment P such that the rear wall is located as close as practicable to the rear edge of the rear seat squab .

The length of the rear seat squab is the distance between the front and rear edges and of the rear seat squab and the width of the rear seat squab is the distance between the inboard and outboard edges and of the rear seat squab .

Minimizing the distance between the front and rear walls and is advantageous if a short vehicle is used and is affected by the overall length of the seating arrangement. Similarly minimizing the distance between the side walls and is advantageous if a narrow vehicle is used and is affected by the overall width of the seating arrangement. Therefore minimizing the overall length and width of the seating arrangement is advantageous if a trying to produce a very compact motor vehicle.

A front inboard corner of the rear seat squab has a cut out to provide a relief for the front part of the rear seat squab to extend past the rear edge of the front seat squab . In this case the cut out is produced by the removal of a rectangular shaped portion of the front inboard corner of the rear seat squab .

The relief of the rear seat squab facilitates the duplex partial overlapping of the front and rear seat squabs and . This duplex partial overlapping allows at least part of the front edge of the rear seat squab to overlap with at least part of the rear edge of the front seat squab and at least part of the inboard edge of the rear seat squab to overlap with at least part of the inboard edge of the front seat squab .

By positioning the front and rear seats and in such a duplex partial overlapping manner the overall width and length of the seating arrangement is reduced compared to the situation where there is no overlap and the seats are of the same dimensions.

When arranged in a duplex partial overlapping manner a longitudinal distance between a front edge of the front seat squab and a rear edge of the rear seat squab is less than the sum of the lengths of the front and rear seat squabs and and a transverse distance between an outboard edge of the front seat squab and an outside edge of the rear seat squab is less than the sum of the widths of the front and rear seat squabs and .

Therefore a very compact seating arrangement is provided that enables a motor vehicle to be produced that can be parked nose in in a standard parking bay and for three of such vehicles to be parked side by side in the parking bay.

Although shows the two seats and arranged in a left hand drive arrangement with the front seat being on the left hand side of the vehicle it will be appreciated that it could also be used in a right hand drive vehicle in which case the front seat would be on the right hand side of the vehicle.

With reference to there is shown a second embodiment of a compact passenger motor vehicle having a front end F a longitudinal central axis X X and a passenger compartment P defined by front rear and side walls and . The rear wall may be a fixed or moveable wall and delineates the passenger compartment P from an adjacent rear compartment which is often a luggage compartment. The vehicle has a source of motive power that can be of any suitable known kind including wheel motors that can be located in any suitable position.

A seating arrangement for two occupants is provided in the form of a front seat and a rear seat arranged in a staggered duplex partial overlapping relationship within the passenger compartment.

The front seat has seat cushion or squab and a backrest. The front seat squab has a front edge a rear edge an inboard edge and an outboard edge and is positioned forward in the passenger compartment P so as to be located as close as practicable to the front wall . It will be appreciated that the spacing of the front seat from the front wall depends upon the amount of room to comfortably accommodate the legs of a driver that will occupy the front seat in use.

The length of the front seat squab is the distance between the front and rear edges and of the front seat squab and the width of the front seat squab is the distance between the inboard and outboard edges and of the front seat squab .

The rear seat has seat cushion or squab and a backrest. The rear seat squab has a front edge a rear edge an inboard edge and an outboard edge and is positioned towards the rear of the passenger compartment P so as to be located as close as practicable to the rear wall .

The length of the rear seat squab is the distance between the front and rear edges and of the rear seat squab and the width of the rear seat squab is the distance between the inboard and outboard edges and of the rear seat squab .

A front inboard corner of the rear seat squab has a cut out to provide a relief for the front part of the rear seat squab to extend past the rear edge of the front seat squab . In this case the cut out is produced by the removal of a triangular shaped portion of the front inboard corner of the rear seat squab so that the inboard edge of the rear seat squab has a tapered form so as to reduce the width of the front edge of the rear seat squab and provide the relief to permit the front part of the rear seat squab to extend past the rear edge of the front seat squab .

In this second embodiment a rear inboard corner of the front seat squab is also relieved so as to assist the front part of the rear seat squab to extend past the rear edge of the front seat squab . The relief is provided by using a tapered form for a rear part of the inside edge of the front seat squab so as to reduce the width of the rear edge of the front seat squab .

The reliefs of the front and rear seat squabs facilitate the duplex partial overlapping of the front and rear seat squabs and . As before the duplex partial overlapping allows at least part of the front edge of the rear seat squab to overlap with at least part of the rear edge of a squab of the front seat squab and at least part of the inboard edge of the rear seat squab to overlap with at least part of the inboard edge of the front seat squab .

By positioning the front and rear seats and in such a duplex partial overlapping manner the overall width and length of the seating arrangement is reduced compared to the situation where there is no overlap and the seats are of the same dimensions. This reduction in overall length and width of the seating arrangement provides an opportunity for reducing the overall length and width of the motor vehicle in which the seats are mounted.

By arranging the two seats in a duplex partial overlapping manner a longitudinal distance between a front edge of the front seat squab and a rear edge of the rear seat squab is less than the sum of the lengths of the front and rear seat squabs and and a transverse distance between an outboard edge of the front seat squab and an outside edge of the rear seat squab is less than the sum of the widths of the front and rear seat squabs and .

Therefore as before a very compact seating arrangement is provided that enables a motor vehicle to be produced that can potentially be parked nose in in a standard parking bay and for three of such vehicles to be parked side by side in the parking bay.

Although shows the two seats and arranged for left hand drive it will be appreciated that it could also be adapted for use in a right hand drive vehicle.

With reference to there is shown a third embodiment of seating arrangement that is intended to be a direct replacement for the seating arrangements shown in .

As before the seating arrangement for two occupants is provided in the form of a front seat and a rear seat arranged in a staggered duplex partial overlapping relationship within the passenger compartment.

The front seat has a seat cushion or squab and a backrest. The front seat squab has a front edge a rear edge an inboard edge and an outboard edge and is positioned forward in the passenger compartment so as to be located as close as practicable to a front wall of the motor vehicle in which it is fitted.

The length of the front seat squab is the distance between the front and rear edges and of the front seat squab and the width of the front seat squab is the distance between the inboard and outboard edges and of the front seat squab .

The rear seat has a cushion or squab and a backrest. The rear seat squab has a front edge a rear edge an inboard edge and an outboard edge and is positioned towards the rear of the passenger compartment P so as to be located as close as practicable to the rear wall .

The length of the rear seat squab is the distance between the front and rear edges and of the rear seat squab and the width of the rear seat squab is the distance between the inboard and outboard edges and of the rear seat squab .

In this embodiment both front corners of the rear seat squab have respective cut outs . The inboard cut out provides the relief for the front part of the rear seat squab to extend past the rear edge of the front seat squab and the outboard cut out is provided to enable the rear seat squab to also be used on a right hand drive vehicle when the cut out will be the inboard cut out. In this case both of the cut outs are produced by the removal of a triangular shaped portion of the front corners of the rear seat squab so that the inboard and outboard edges and of the rear seat squab both have a tapered form so as to reduce the width of the front edge of the rear seat squab .

With this embodiment both rear corners of the front seat squab have respective cut outs the inboard cut out is to provide the relief enabling the front part of the rear seat squab to extend past the rear edge of the front seat squab and the outboard cut out is provided to enable the front seat squab to also be used on a right hand drive vehicle when the cut out will be the inboard cut out. The cut outs are produced by the removal of a triangular shaped portion of the rear corners of the front seat squab so that the inboard and outboard edges and of the front seat squab both have a tapered form and reduce the width of the rear edge of the front seat squab

The reliefs on the front and rear seat squabs and facilitate the duplex partial overlapping of the front and rear seat squabs and . The duplex partial overlapping utilizes at least part of the front edge of the rear seat squab to overlap with at least part of the rear edge of a squab of the front seat squab and at least part of the inboard edge of the rear seat squab to overlap with at least part of the inboard edge of the front seat squab .

By positioning the front and rear seats and in such a duplex partial overlapping manner the overall width and length of the seating arrangement is reduced compared to the situation where there is no overlap and the seats are of the same dimensions and so is advantageous in that the length and width of the motor vehicle can potentially be reduced.

When the two seats are arranged in a duplex partial overlapping manner a longitudinal distance between a front edge of the front seat squab and a rear edge of the rear seat squab is less than the sum of the lengths of the front and rear seat squabs and and a transverse distance between an outboard edge of the front seat squab and an outside edge of the rear seat squab is less than the sum of the widths of the front and rear seat squabs and .

Therefore as before a very compact seating arrangement is provided that potentially enables a motor vehicle to be produced that can be parked nose in in a standard parking bay and for three of such vehicles to be parked side by side in the parking bay.

Although shows the two seats and arranged for left hand drive it will be appreciated that it could also be adapted for use in a right hand drive vehicle.

With reference to there is shown a fourth embodiment of seating arrangement that is intended to be a direct replacement for the seating arrangements shown in . Although shows the two seats and arranged for left hand drive it will be appreciated that it could also be adapted for use in a right hand drive vehicle.

As before the seating arrangement for two occupants is provided in the form of a front seat and a rear seat arranged in a staggered duplex partial overlapping relationship within the passenger compartment.

The front seat has a seat cushion or squab and a backrest . The front seat squab has a front edge a rear edge an inboard edge and an outboard edge and is positioned forward in the passenger compartment so as to be located as close as practicable to a front wall of the motor vehicle in which it is fitted.

The length of the front seat squab is the distance between the front and rear edges and of the front seat squab and the width of the front seat squab is the maximum distance between the inboard and outboard edges and of the front seat squab .

The rear seat has seat cushion or squab . The rear seat squab has a front edge a rear edge an inboard edge and an outboard edge and is positioned towards the rear of the passenger compartment P so as to be located as close as practicable to the rear wall .

The length of the rear seat squab is the distance between the front and rear edges and of the rear seat squab and the width of the rear seat squab is the maximum distance between the inboard and outboard edges and of the rear seat squab .

In this embodiment the front and rear seat squabs and both have all corners relieved by having respective convex curved inboard and outboard side edges and 

One advantage of such an arrangement is that the same seat squab can be used for front and rear seats and and also for left hand and right hand drive vehicles thereby reducing manufacturing complexity and costs.

The length of the front seat squab is the distance between the front and rear edges and of the front seat squab and the width of the front seat squab is the distance between the inboard and outboard edges and of the front seat squab at its widest position.

The length of the rear seat squab is the distance between the front and rear edges and of the rear seat squab . The width of the rear seat squab is the distance between the inboard and outboard edges and of the rear seat squab at its widest position.

The inboard reliefs at the front of the rear seat squab and the rear of the front seat squab facilitate the duplex partial overlapping of the front and rear seat squabs and . As before the duplex partial overlapping utilizes at least part of the front edge of the rear seat squab to overlap with at least part of the rear edge of a squab of the front seat squab and at least part of the inboard edge of the rear seat squab to overlap with at least part of the inboard edge of the front seat squab .

The other reliefs are utilized if the seat squabs are arranged in different positions. For example the seat squabs could be used in a right hand drive vehicle instead of a left hand drive vehicle or their position is swopped with the front seat squab being used as a rear seat squab and vice versa.

By positioning the front and rear seats and in such a duplex partial overlapping manner the overall width and length of the seating arrangement is reduced compared to the situation where there is no overlap and the seats are of the same dimensions.

For example in one example of such a seating arrangement the overall length of the seating arrangement was reduced from 1.265 m if the two seats are positioned one behind the other with no overlap. Made up of a seat squab length of 0.59 m for both squabs and a longitudinal stagger distance of 0.675 m . An overall length of 0.92 m was achieved using seat squabs of the same length and a longitudinal stagger distance of 0.33 m and a longitudinal overlap of 0.26 m.

The overall width of the same seating arrangement was reduced from 1.08 mm when the two seats where positioned side by side with no overlap to 0.755 m using a transverse overlap of 0.125 m and seat squabs of 0.44 m width. A seat centerline to vehicle centerline distance for a conventional side by side seat city car is typically 0.32 m. This means that the distance between the centerlines of the two seat squabs of a conventional city car is typically 0.64 m resulting in an overall width for the seating arrangement of 0.22 0.22 0.64 1.08 m . The overall width for a duplex partial overlapping seating arrangement in accordance with one embodiment of this invention was reduced by using a centerline lateral seat spacing of 0.315 m made up of 0.175 m for the driver squab and 0.140 m passenger squab. The duplex partial overlapping arrangement therefore produced a reduction in overall width of 0.325 m using 0.44 wide seat squabs. Of this gain 0.125 m is due to the transverse overlap 0.22 0.175 0.22 0.14 0.125 m and the rest is due to the fact that the longitudinal stagger allows the inboard shoulders of the two occupants to be overlapped.

As before when the seats are arranged in a duplex partial overlapping manner a longitudinal distance between a front edge of the front seat squab and a rear edge of the rear seat squab 0.59 0.33 m 0.92 m is less than the sum of the lengths of the front and rear seat squabs and 0.59 0.59 1.180 m a gain of 0.26 m and a transverse distance between an outboard edge of the front seat squab and an outside edge of the rear seat squab 0.22 m 0.175 m 0.22 m 0.14 m 0.755 m is less than the sum of the widths of the front and rear seat squabs and 0.44 m 0.44 m 0.88 m a gain of 0.125 m.

Therefore as before a very compact seating arrangement is provided that enables a motor vehicle to be produced that can be parked nose in in a standard parking bay and for three of such vehicles to be parked side by side in the parking bay.

In the position of a left leg PL of a rear seated passenger is indicated by a dotted oval. It can be seen that the backrest has a wide upper part U and a narrower lower part L. Therefore the backrest of the front seat is cutaway at lower inboard and outboard corners so as to produce the wide upper backrest U and narrow lower backrest L shape. It will be appreciated that the backrest could be formed of two separate parts having differing widths.

The inboard cutaway provides space for the leg PL of a passenger seated on the rear seat to extend past the front seat .

A recline adjuster mechanism for adjusting the angle between the front seat backrest and the rear seat squab is also shown on . The cutaway on the outboard lower corner of the front seat backrest allows the accommodation of the recline adjuster mechanism without increasing the overall width of the front seat . That is to say because the lower part L of the backrest is narrower than the upper part U there is room to accommodate the recline adjuster mechanism in the cutaway without increasing the overall width of the front seat .

The front seat is shown mounted onto a floor of a motor vehicle such as the motor vehicle or the motor vehicle by means of a fore aft position adjuster . Such position adjusters are well known in the art.

It will be appreciated that if the rear seat is turned outwardly by a small amount such as but not limited to 1 or 2 degrees and the front seat is turned inwardly by a similar small amount then increased room for the leg PL if the passenger can be obtained. However in such a case unless relief is provided on the outboard sides of the squabs then the width of the passenger compartment would potentially increase when the seats are rotated due to their elongate shape.

If relief is provided both inboard and outboard for such a seat and the seats are rotated as described above it is possible to reduce the overall width of the passenger compartment even further compared to a case where both seats are arranged parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle.

With particular reference to and there is shown a seat frame assembly for use in a seat such as the front seat shown in . It will be appreciated that the same construction could be used for a rear seat.

With particular reference to the seat frame assembly includes an inverted U shape backrest frame having a pair of uprights . Each of the uprights is pivotally connected at a lower end via a pivot rod forming part of a backrest adjuster to an upper end of a respective one of a pair of upstanding arms .

A cross rail is provided to strengthen the backrest frame which could be a single piece component or could be fabricated from several parts that are fastened together.

Each of the upstanding arms is attached at a lower end to a seat pan structure of the seat frame assembly. The seat pan structure is mounted on the floor by means of the fore aft position adjuster .

A backrest recline adjuster mechanism is provided to control the angular displacement of the backrest frame relative to the seat pan structure . The backrest adjuster mechanism includes the two pairs of arms and a backrest adjuster having components interposed between the two pairs of arms linked via the pivot rod . One of the pairs of arms is connected to the uprights and the other one of the two pairs is fastened to the seat pan structure with the backrest adjuster interposed therebetween. In this case the pair of upstanding arms is fastened to the seat frame and a second pair of arms is fastened to the uprights .

Each of the upstanding arms is a cranked arm so that the distance between upper ends of the two upstanding arms is less than the distance between lower ends of the two upstanding arms where the two upstanding arms join the seat pan structure . The waisted arrangement of the upstanding arms the narrow width of the backrest frame at its lower end and the narrow width W of the backrest adjuster are advantageous in that they enable the front seat to be provided with the cutaway shaped backrest shown in which provides space for the leg PL of the passenger as it passes by the inboard side of the front seat .

A vertical distance Z from an internal surface of the seat pan structure submarine panel to a rotational centerline of the pivot rod is set by the lengths of the cranked arms to be above the position where the hips of a person sat on the seat would be positioned in use. This is done so as to avoid discomfort to the person sat on the seat due to the presence of the backrest recline adjuster mechanism and in particular the backrest adjuster and also to provide extra clearance for the leg PL of the passenger as it passes by the inboard side of the front seat .

The seat frame shown in and is in most respects the same as that previously described with respect to . As before a backrest adjuster mechanism including a backrest adjuster is used to control the angular position between two pairs of arms that is to say it is interposed therebetween. The primary difference between this embodiment and that previously described is that two cranked arms forming one of the two pairs of arms are in this case fastened to the two uprights of the seat frame rather than to the seat pan . The backrest adjuster mechanism is in this case connected to the seat pan structure by two substantially planar arms forming the second pair of arms rather than by cranked arms as is the case with the embodiment of

As before the width of the seat frame is less than the width of the seat pan structure and the backrest recline adjuster mechanism and in particular the backrest adjuster is narrower than the seat pan structure . The backrest adjuster is as before positioned higher than normal at a position Z above a lower part of the seat pan structure so as to avoid discomfort for a user of the seat and also to provide extra clearance for the leg PL of the passenger as it passes by the inboard side of the front seat .

It will be appreciated that the amount of overlap between the front and rear seats in the transverse direction is limited by the need for the inboard leg of the passenger to be able to pass by the side of the front seat. The magnitude of the longitudinal overlap is at least partially limited by the need to provide adequate space between a rear seated passenger and a rear face of the front seat.

Therefore a duplex partial overlapping arrangement is one where there is sufficient room for a passenger to comfortably occupy the rear seat and for a 95percentile male to occupy the rear seat.

It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that although the invention has been described by way of example with reference to one or more embodiments it is not limited to the disclosed embodiments and that alternative embodiments could be constructed without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.

It will be understood by one having ordinary skill in the art that construction of the described invention and other components is not limited to any specific material. Other exemplary embodiments of the invention disclosed herein may be formed from a wide variety of materials unless described otherwise herein.
