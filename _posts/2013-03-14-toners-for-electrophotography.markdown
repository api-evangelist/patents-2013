This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2012 092331 filed on Apr. 13 2012.

The present invention relates to toners for electrophotography and a process for producing the toners for electrophotography.

Toners are required to have a good heat resistant storage property and a good low temperature fusing property which are contradictory to each other. In order to satisfy both the contradictory properties there have been proposed toners having a core shell structure including a core portion and a shell portion covering the core portion.

For example Patent Document 1 discloses a resin binder for toners in the form of core shell particles each including a core portion containing an amorphous resin obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component containing at least one of an alkyl succinic acid and an alkenyl succinic acid with an alcohol component and a crystalline polyester and a shell portion containing an amorphous resin obtained by polycondensing an alcohol component containing an aliphatic dialcohol with a carboxylic acid component. In Patent Document 1 it is described that the reason why the alkyl succinic acid or the like is used as the carboxylic acid component of the amorphous resin constituting the core portion is that the crystalline polyester contained in the core portion can be finely dispersed in the amorphous resin constituting the core portion and enclosed in the core shell structure so that the resulting toner can be enhanced in high anti staining property for carriers and charging rate.

Also in Patent Document 2 it is described that when using an alkyl succinic acid or an alkenyl succinic acid as a carboxylic acid component of an amorphous resin of a core portion it is possible to enhance a compatibility between the amorphous resin and a crystalline polyester contained in the core portion.

Patent Document 3 discloses a process for producing a toner which includes a first aggregation step of aggregating resin fine particles containing an amorphous polyester resin to produce a dispersion of a first precursor of toner particles a mixing step of mixing the dispersion of the first precursor of toner particles with a dispersion of carboxyl group containing polyester resin fine particles to produce a dispersion of a second precursor of toner particles and a second aggregation step of aggregating the second precursor of toner particles to form toner particles for the purpose of enhancing a low temperature fusing property a heat resistant storage property an anti breaking property and an anti filming property of the resulting toner and suppressing occurrence of dusts and scattering of the toner.

The present invention relates to the following aspects 1 and 2 . 1 A toner for electrophotography including core shell particles as a resin binder each including a core portion containing an amorphous resin A having a softening point of 105 C. or lower which is obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component containing an alkenyl succinic acid with an alcohol component and a shell portion containing an amorphous resin B obtained by polycondensing an alcohol component containing an aliphatic diol having 2 to 6 carbon atoms with a carboxylic acid component containing a trivalent or higher valent polycarboxylic acid compound in an amount of 20 mol or less. 2 A process for producing a toner for electrophotography including the following steps 1 to 4 

Step 1 subjecting a resin aqueous dispersion containing an amorphous resin A having a softening point of 105 C. or lower which is obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component containing an alkenyl succinic acid with an alcohol component to aggregation of the resin to prepare an aqueous dispersion of resin particles I 

Step 2 preparing a resin aqueous dispersion containing an amorphous resin B obtained by polycondensing an alcohol component containing an aliphatic diol having 2 to 6 carbon atoms with a carboxylic acid component containing a trivalent or higher valent polycarboxylic acid compound in an amount of 20 mol or less 

Step 3 mixing the aqueous dispersion of the resin particles I obtained in the step 1 with the resin aqueous dispersion containing the amorphous resin B obtained in the step 2 to aggregate the resin particles I and the amorphous resin B thereby preparing an aqueous dispersion of resin particles II and

As described in Patent Documents 1 and 2 there have been made studies on toners having a core shell structure in which by using a crystalline polyester in a core portion of the core shell structure a softening point of the core portion is reduced to improve a low temperature fusing property of the toner. However when such a crystalline polyester serving as a plasticizable portion is contained in the toners the resulting toners tend to be deteriorated in durability. For this reason it has been required to develop toners capable of exhibiting excellent heat resistant storage property low temperature fusing property and durability regardless of the presence or absence of the crystalline polyester.

The present invention relates to a toner for electrophotography which is excellent in heat resistant storage property low temperature fusing property and durability as well as a process for producing the toner for electrophotography.

The present inventors have found that in a toner having a core shell structure including a core portion and a shell portion when an alkenyl succinic acid is used as a carboxylic acid component of an amorphous resin constituting the core portion and an aliphatic diol having 2 to 6 carbon atoms is used as an alcohol component of an amorphous resin constituting the shell portion it is possible to obtain a toner for electrophotography which is excellent in heat resistant storage property low temperature fusing property and durability.

The toner for electrophotography according to the present invention includes core shell particles as a resin binder each including a core portion containing an amorphous resin A having a softening point of 105 C. or lower which is obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component containing an alkenyl succinic acid with an alcohol component and a shell portion containing an amorphous resin B obtained by polycondensing an alcohol component containing an aliphatic diol having 2 to 6 carbon atoms with a carboxylic acid component containing a trivalent or higher valent polycarboxylic acid compound in an amount of 20 mol or less.

The reason why the toner for electrophotography according to the present invention is excellent in heat resistant storage property low temperature fusing property and durability is considered as follows.

That is since the alkenyl succinic acid is used as the carboxylic acid component of the amorphous resin A constituting the core portion in the case where a softening point of the amorphous resin A is adjusted to 105 C. or lower a glass transition point of the resin becomes lower than that of a resin obtained using no alkenyl succinic acid even if the softening points of both the resins are the same. As a result it is considered that the resulting toner can be enhanced in low temperature fusing property. Further in addition to the use of the alkenyl succinic acid in the amorphous resin A since the aliphatic diol especially having 2 to 6 carbon atoms is used as the alcohol component of the amorphous resin B constituting the shell portion a compatibility between the core portion and the shell portion can be reduced to an appropriate extent so that the core shell structure of the toner can be well maintained to allow the core portion and the shell portion to suitably exhibit their respective functions. As a result it is considered to enable production of a toner for electrophotography which is excellent in heat resistant storage property low temperature fusing property and durability.

In addition when the trivalent or higher valent carboxylic acid compound is contained merely in a small amount the resulting resin forms a good cross linked structure so that a molecular weight thereof can be increased or maintained. However if a large mount of the trivalent or higher valent carboxylic acid compound is contained it is considered that the resulting resin has a wide molecular weight distribution and therefore a large amount of low molecular weight components are produced. On the other hand since the low molecular weight components tend to be miscible with various resins the presence of the low molecular weight components may increase the above compatibility between the core portion and the shell portion. In the present invention since the content of the trivalent or higher valent carboxylic acid compound in the amorphous resin B used in the shell portion is limited to a predetermined amount or less the resulting resin can be prevented from exhibiting a wide molecular weight distribution in particular can be prevented from suffering from production of the low molecular weight components. As a result it is considered that the above core shell structure can be maintained so that a toner for electrophotography which is excellent in heat resistant storage property low temperature fusing property and durability can be obtained.

The resin binder for toners according to the present invention includes core shell particles which each includes a core portion containing the amorphous resin A and a shell portion containing the amorphous resin B .

The amorphous resin A is obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component containing an alkenyl succinic acid with an alcohol component and has a softening point of 105 C. or lower. Thus by reducing a softening point of the amorphous resin A to 105 C. or lower it is possible to enhance a low temperature fusing property of the resulting toner.

The carboxylic acid component as a raw material monomer of the amorphous resin A contains an alkenyl succinic acid. By using the alkenyl succinic acid in the amorphous resin A in the case where the softening point of the amorphous resin A is adjusted to 105 C. or lower the glass transition point of the resulting resin becomes lower than that of a polyester resin used in the conventional toners so that the obtained toner can be enhanced in low temperature fusing property.

The toner was loaded to a copying machine tradename AR 505 available from Sharp Corp. to print a toner image on an image fixing paper for evaluation of the toner. More specifically a solid image printed on the paper was taken out before allowing the paper to pass through a fuser to thereby obtain an unfused image printed area 2 cm 12 cm amount of the toner deposited 0.5 mg cm . The paper with the thus obtained unfused image was loaded again to a copying machine tradename AR 505 available from Sharp Corp. and then subjected to printing of a solid image two more times such that each solid image printed was taken out before allowing the paper to pass through the fuser thereby obtaining a layered unfused image three layers having a layer thickness of 1.5 mg cm.

With the fuser of the copying machine being held in an off line condition the three layered unfused image was fused and fixed on the paper at a rate of 300 mm s while increasing the fusing temperature from 90 C. to 240 C. at intervals of 5 C.

Ltd. fusing contact fusing method development non magnetic one component development method developing roll diameter 2.3 cm and a slanted stripe pattern having a print coverage of 5.5 was continuously printed on sheets of paper at a temperature of 32 C. and a humidity of 85 . The a print coverage as used herein means the area of the printing portion on the basis of the total area of the paper. In the course of continuously printing the stripe pattern a black solid image was printed on the paper every 500 sheets to confirm whether or not any white streaks or lines occurred on the printed image. The printing was interrupted at the time at which the white streaks occurred on the image although it was continued until reaching 9000 sheets in maximum unless any defects occurred. The number of sheets of paper printed up to the time at which the white streaks were first observed on the image by naked eyes was regarded as the number of sheets of paper printed which was capable of withstanding occurrence of white streaks owing to the toner fused and fixed on a developing roll and was used to evaluate a durability of the toner. The larger the number of sheets of paper printed the more excellent the durability of the toner became. The results are shown in Table 8.

As shown in Table 8 in Comparative Examples 1 to 4 since no alkenyl succinic anhydride was used as a carboxylic acid component in the core portion the resulting toners were insufficient in low temperature fusing property.

Also in Comparative Example 3 since the crystalline polyester was used in the core portion the resulting toner was deteriorated in durability.

On the other hand in Examples 1 to 17 the resulting toners were excellent in all of low temperature fusing property heat resistant storage property and durability.

The toner according to the present invention is excellent in heat resistant storage property low temperature fusing property and durability and can be therefore suitably used as a toner for electrophotography which is employed in an electrophotographic method an electrostatic recording method an electrostatic printing method and the like.
