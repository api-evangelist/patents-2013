The feedback service can be configured to receive the activity representation and to take various actions with respect to the activity representation . In some embodiments the feedback service can receive the activity representation and execute based upon contents of the activity representation a price search a web search a review or ratings search combinations thereof or the like relating to the product or item referenced within the activity representation . Thus although not visible in the feedback service can query various electronic resources such as a website associated with a particular product or other item a price check application a review site or service combinations thereof or the like to obtain and provide data to the user device .

According to some embodiments the feedback service can be configured to communicate with a computing device . According to various embodiments the computing device can be associated with can be operated by can be accessible by and or can report to a manufacturer of the product or item associated with the activity occurring at the user device . As such the computing device can be referred to as a manufacturer computing device. It should be understood that this example is illustrative and therefore should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

In some embodiments the feedback service can communicate with the computing device to obtain one or more templates from the computing device . The templates can be used to generate a synthetic image or other representation relating to the product or item associated with the activity as will be explained in more detail below. The computing device can in response to a communication with the feedback service provide a template to the feedback service or to the user device . According to various embodiments the feedback service and or the feedback application can generate a representation of the item or product.

The representation of the item or product can include a computer generated image of the user associated with the user device using wearing holding or otherwise making use of the product or other item with which the activity is associated. This representation can be created using the template . Thus it can be appreciated that the template can correspond to an image video or the like which can be superimposed on an image of the user associated with the user device . Additionally or alternatively the template can correspond to an image video or the like with a cutout or other area through which a portion of an image video or other representation of the user associated with the user device can be shown. Additionally or alternatively the template can correspond to an overlay or the like which can be imposed on an image video or other representation of the user a location associated with the user or other person location item or other entity. It should be understood that these examples are illustrative and therefore should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

According to some embodiments the feedback service can be configured to generate the representation. The feedback service can be configured by the user or other entities to access a social networking account associated with the user. In some embodiments the feedback service can be configured to access a social networking application executed for example by a web server . The user or other entity can provide credentials used by the feedback service to access the social networking account of the user. By accessing the account the feedback service can access photographs videos or other representations associated with the user. Thus it should be appreciated that the feedback service can access photos videos or other representations of the user locally by communicating with the user device and or by communicating with other devices or applications such as the web server and or the social networking application . It should be understood that these examples are illustrative and therefore should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

The feedback service can be configured to generate the representation of the user holding wearing or otherwise using the product or item with which the activity was detected by using the template and the photo video or other representation obtained from the user device the social networking application and or other sources. In some other embodiments the feedback service can obtain the representation from the user device as noted above. The feedback service also can be configured to solicit feedback relating to the item or other product using the representation.

In particular the feedback service can be configured to generate a social networking post a realtime message or other post post . The post can include the representation and a solicitation for feedback feedback solicitation . The feedback service can access the social networking application to upload the post to a social networking account associated with a user of the user device . In one example embodiment the feedback service can generate a social networking post as the post wherein the post can include the representation of the user with the product or other item and a solicitation for feedback.

In one example the product or item can correspond to a shirt or other piece of clothing. The template can correspond to an image of the shirt or other piece of clothing. The feedback service can generate a representation of the user wearing the shirt or other piece of clothing. For example the template can include an image of the shirt with a transparent portion through which the user s face can be visible if the template is overlaid on an image of the user. Thus the representation can appear to be an image of the user wearing the shirt or other product. The feedback service can generate the post to include a solicitation for feedback such as what do you think comments please or the like. It should be understood that this example is illustrative and therefore should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

In response to viewing the post one or more social networking connections associated with the user of the user device may comment on the representation. The social networking application can capture these comments or other activity and provide the comments or other information as feedback . The feedback can be provided to the feedback service or the feedback service can be configured to view comments or other activity recognize these comments or other activity as the feedback and to download or otherwise obtain the feedback from the social networking application . It should be understood that this example is illustrative and therefore should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

The feedback service also can be configured to interpret the feedback and or to perform various types of analysis on the feedback . In particular the feedback service can be configured to identify various aspects of comments or other forms of feedback provided in response to the post . The feedback service can be configured to access the web server to access the feedback in some embodiments. In some other embodiments web server can be configured to provide the feedback to the feedback service . Because the feedback service can be configured to obtain the feedback in additional and or alternative ways it should be understood that these examples are illustrative and therefore should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

As noted above the feedback service can be configured to analyze the feedback based upon various aspects of the feedback including but not limited to content demographics and or other aspects of the feedback . The content of the feedback can include for example a rating or review value a comment text of the comment indicated and or inferred emotions associated with the comments or ratings such as for example likes or dislikes indications of reposts or retweets or the like associated with the comments or ratings and or other content of the feedback . The feedback service can be configured to analyze language of the comment or other feedback to determine if the feedback is positive or negative or neutral a degree to which the feedback is positive or negative if not neutral specific aspects of the product or item mentioned or otherwise referenced in the feedback or the like.

In particular if an example comment to the post reads that shirt looks awesome I like the collar the feedback service can be configured to recognize from language analysis of the post that the commenter who provided this comment likes the product or item associated with the post and that the collar is specifically mentioned as a desirable feature of the product or item. Similarly if a comment to the post is negative or neutral the feedback service can be configured to recognize that and interpret the feedback in accordance with the determined tone and or contents of the feedback . The feedback service can be configured to analyze multiple comments or other feedback associated with a post and to determine an overall tone or rating to identify trends associated with the tone or ratings and the like. The feedback service can be configured to summarize the content of the feedback and to generate feedback data that captures trends if present. Additional aspects of the feedback data will be addressed below.

The demographics associated with the feedback can be obtained by communication with the social networking application and or by publically available information that the feedback service can be configured to access via an application programming interface API associated with the social networking application or the web server by an API associated with search engines or other applications or devices or the like. Thus the feedback service can be configured to determine for a particular instance of feedback and or for multiple instances of feedback demographics such as for example age gender location income race religion or the like.

The feedback service can be configured to determine trends associated with the demographics content and or other aspects of the feedback and to represent these and or other trends in the feedback data . For example a first comment to the post may state I like the shirt but not the collar and the demographics associated with the commenter may indicate that the comment was made by a female age 20 24 who lives in New York City. A second comment to the post may state I like the shirt especially the collar and the demographics associated with the commenter may indicate that the comment was made by a female age 20 24 who lives in Atlanta Ga.

Based upon analysis of the content and demographics of these two example comments the feedback service can generate a summary that indicates that all feedback associated with the shirt is positive that half of the feedback approves of the collar and that half of the feedback does not approve of the collar. Furthermore the feedback service can generate a summary that indicates that all feedback from females age 20 24 approve of the shirt that all feedback made by commenters living in the Northeast New York and or New York City dislike the collar and or that all feedback made by commenters living in the Southeast Georgia and or Atlanta like the collar. Of course with an increased number of comments or other feedback the feedback service can identify additional and or alternative trends. It should be understood that these examples are illustrative and therefore should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

Thus the feedback data can include for example trends relating to the item or product associated with the post as well as critiques and or compliments associated with the product or item demographics associated with specific and or general critiques or compliments combinations thereof or the like. Thus for example if comments reference a type of granite used for a table top the feedback data can include a summary of comments or other feedback that reference the granite the tone and or content of those comments or other feedback demographics associated with various opinions and or uniform opinions represented by the feedback combinations thereof or the like. The feedback service can provide the feedback data to the computing device and the computing device can output the feedback data to one or more entities such as for example a manufacturer.

The manufacturer may pay for the feedback data or other aspects of the feedback service . The manufacturer for example can use the feedback data to provide rapid prototyping relating to the product or item to generate different versions of the product or item for specific demographics or the like. Thus the manufacturer can use the feedback service and or the feedback data to replace or supplement market research advertising or the like. In the above example of the shirt and collar the manufacturer could determine if the trends above hold for more than two comments of course that a shirt with the collar as commented on is appropriate for sale in Atlanta Ga. and that a second version of the shirt with a different collar should be sold in New York City. It should be understood that these examples are illustrative and therefore should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

The feedback service also can be configured to provide the feedback to the user device for presentation to a user or other entity. The feedback can be provided to the user or other entity via a user interface or various forms of communication such as text messages emails web page links reports or the like. Some example user interfaces for communicating feedback to the user or other entity are illustrated and described herein with reference to .

In practice a user or other entity may consider making a purchase of a product or other item. As part of the consideration the user or other entity may search the web take a photograph scan a barcode or QR code execute a price check or the like relating to the product or item. The user or other entity may use a user device to perform these and or other activity relating to the product or other item. The user device can execute a feedback application to detect the activity and to generate an activity representation that can include data relating to the product or item a request for a web search relating to the product or item a request for a price search relating to the product or item or the like. The activity representation can be provided to a feedback service that can be hosted or executed by a server computer .

In some embodiments the activity representation can prompt a feedback service executed or hosted by a server computer to provide a template relating to the product or item. The template can be provided by a computing device or other device associated with various entities such as for example a manufacturer distributer retailer or the like. In some other embodiments as explained above the feedback service can be configured to obtain the template and to use the template as explained herein.

According to various embodiments the user device and or the feedback service can be configured to generate a representation of the product or item referenced in the activity representation . The representation can include a synthetic image or photograph of a user with the product or item and can be generated for example by accessing photographs of the user or other entity on the user device on a social networking account provided by a social networking application and or elsewhere. The representation can be generated using the template as explained above in detail.

The feedback service can generate the representation or obtain the representation from the user device and generate a post for the social networking site or service that includes the representation. The post also can include a feedback solicitation that asks members of the user s or other entity s social network to comment on the product or item represented in the representation. The feedback service can upload the post to the social networking application for publication.

The feedback service can be configured to obtain or receive feedback relating to the post and to analyze the feedback to detect opinions ratings reviews trends and or other feedback relating to the product or item. The feedback service also can analyze the feedback to detect trends and or opinions based upon demographics or the like associated with commenters associated with the feedback . The feedback service can provide some or all of the feedback to the user device for presentation to a user or other entity and or can generate feedback data that summarizes part or all of the feedback for other entities such as a manufacturer or the like.

The feedback service can provide the feedback data to a computing device associated with the other entities and the other entities can use the feedback data to drive decisions relating to the product or item such as for example distribution in certain markets product evolution pricing and or the like.
