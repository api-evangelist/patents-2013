This application claims the priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 602 646 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ORGANIZING A MEDIA PROGRAM GUIDE ACCORDING TO POPULARITY which was filed on Feb. 24 2012 and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

In general electronic and interactive program guides are organized according to timeslot channel and the name of the program. is an example of a prototypical interactive program guide organized according to timeslot program and channel.

Aspects of the present disclosure include a method and apparatus for organizing a media program guide to be accessed via television computer wireless devices and including but not limited to web television and other such devices. According to one aspect of the present disclosure the method includes assigning a multidimensional popularity ranking of media programming and organizing elements of the media program guide in order of the popularity ranking either in real time or based on historical popularity values. The method may also include steps of assigning values to preference terms analyzing associations of the preference terms to data related to media programs and assigning the popularity ranking of the media programs based on the association. The method may include extracting the associations of the preference terms to the data from social media communications while media programs are being broadcast or televised and or assigning the popularity ranking of the media programs based on social media activities regarding the media programs. Therefore what is disclosed in one illustrative embodiment is a media program guide that in real time automatically re orders available programming choices across time zones and cable providers based largely on an instantaneous lexical analysis of social media chatter about said media programs and about the celebrities and personalities featured in those media programs so that users will be immediately aware of which currently available media programming choices are exciting and interesting to either 1 the viewing population in general 2 particular demographic groups or 3 various interest groups within the viewing population. Therefore in one said illustrative embodiment the media programming guide is organized based on a real time social media lexical analysis regarding media programming as opposed to a listing driven purely by timeslot and channel.

According to another aspect of the present disclosure the method for organizing a media program guide may include assigning the popularity ranking of the media programs based on a number of viewers currently viewing the programming or assigning the popularity ranking of the media programs based on a historical number of viewers of the programming. For example according to aspects of the present disclosure assigning the popularity ranking of the media programs may be based on the number of viewers currently viewing the programming via on line streaming or may be based on the number of viewers currently viewing the programming via web TV.

The systems and methods disclosed include one or more Application Program Interfaces APIs configured to reorganize listings of various types of Network broadcasts Cable TV broadcasts Internet Based broadcasts and other broadcasts of the type hereafter media programs according to popularity timeslot genre and various other special interests.

Generally the systems and methods disclosed herein include and the API is implemented within a computer system network of computer systems one or more mobile devices having one or more databases and other storage apparatuses servers networks and additional components for example processors modems terminals and displays wireless displays computer readable media algorithms modules and other computer related components. In an illustrative embodiment the computer systems are especially configured programmed and adapted to perform the functions and processes of the systems and methods and the API as disclosed herein.

Communications between components in the systems and methods disclosed herein may be unidirectional or bidirectional electronic communication through a wired or wireless configuration or network. For example one component may be wired or networked directly indirectly through a third party intermediary wirelessly for example over the Internet or otherwise with another component to enable communication between the components.

In an illustrative embodiment the API collects and or maintains a master list of data including but not limited to 

In an illustrative embodiment the API collects media program scheduling data. To collect the media program scheduling data the API may employ one or more crawlers or web crawlers. The media program scheduling data may be collected from for example but not limited to Tribune TV Data Gemstar TV Guide Rovi Corporation FYI Television Inc and IMDB and others. The API may collect the names of media programs the genere of the media programs the names of actors broadcasters coaches athletes and personalities on those media programs and names of the characters in the media programs. The API may also associate the names of the characters in the media programs to the actors actresses that play those characters. The API may also include a real time feed or dynamic feed of such data allowing the data to be updated with media program or television seasons day light savings time breaking news pre emptions and other changes of the type.

In an illustrative embodiment the API assigns values to each preference term. The API may assign the same value to preference terms that are generally considered to be synonyms.

In an illustrative embodiment the API identifies documented public APIs private APIs and various other data repositories hereafter the target APIs and uses programmatic controllers to interface with the target APIs for the purpose of crawling analyzing requesting and extracting specific data contained therein hereafter the analyzed data and transferring the extracted data to the API for processing which is described below in further detail.

The target APIs may be for example but not limited to Hulu Facebook Youtube Veemo Twitter ITunes Tumblr Nielsen s BuzzMetrics and any chatroom or social media platform where users share opinions and information with natural language ranking systems and ratings systems.

In an illustrative embodiment the API analyzes when users of the target APIs type certain preference terms in close proximity to names of television shows actors and actresses players coaches etc. It should be appreciated that more than one API may be used to analyze the target APIs as each of the different target APIs may require a different API.

The analyzed data may include but is not limited to 1 the names of media programs 2 the actors and actresses in those media programs 3 the preference terms 4 the number of users who have typed one or more preference terms within a defined proximity to the name of an actor actress name of a character in a media program or the name of a media program and demographic information about those users. The API may analyze the above information for example but not limited to in real time on a periodic basis while a media program is airing prior to a media program airing and after a media program has aired.

In an illustrative embodiment the API analyzes the proximity of the preference terms to the name of a media program media personality and other data of the type. The API may then associates the value assigned to the preference term with the media program media personality product or service prior to extraction in another illustrative embodiment however the function of assigning a value for said preference terms could occur when the terms are first indexed .

In an illustrative embodiment the API counts the number of times per given time interval that a preference term is typed by an aggregate number or a defined group of users bloggers or program viewers within a specified proximity to the name of a media program or media personality. The API may also the number of times per given time interval that the name of a media program or media personality is typed or mentioned.

In an illustrative embodiment the API maintains a list of the IP addresses the term IP addresses shall be used as an illustrative example that for ease of reference includes references to all numerical labels stored text files cookies various internet protocols wireless or wifi signatures or binary numbers or protocols that may be used to identify or locate a particular user or a computing device of the users that are using the preference terms that are in close proximate to the names. The API associates the demographic information of users with the IP addresses of those users for the purpose of a saving user preference conclusions b ranking and listing programming selections within the media programming guide in light of those conclusions and c potentially marketing to users based on their respective preference conclusions.

In an illustrative embodiment the API automatically creates one or more charts of preference conclusions about given media personalities media programs products and services. In one example in the context of a media program the API a analyzes how many times per given time interval users have typed a preference term love or another preference term of an assigned equivalent value within two words of Mad Men the title of a popular cable television show or within two words of the names of actors and actresses that appear in Mad Men b the API associates Mad Men with the numerical value assigned to the preference term love and c the API counts the number of times per given time interval that Mad Men has been associated with love or the equivalently valued terms.

The API performs the steps above for all selected media programs and then the API lists the media programs on a chart in the order of sum total of the preference values that have been associated with those media programs.

In an illustrative embodiment the API also gathers data from one or more public APIs private APIs and various other data repositories to determine the ranking value or preference value for the purpose of analyzing the preferences of one or more viewers.

In an illustrative embodiment the API aggregates the data described above about various media programs collected from the various public APIs private APIs and various other data repositories for the purpose of ranking media programs according to popularity on a yearly a monthly a weekly a daily and or a real time basis during the program s airtime.

In an illustrative embodiment the API automatically generates reports for example in one or more forms including but not limited to excel spreadsheets pdfs and electronic program guides that compare and contrast how frequent preference terms are used in conjunction with the names of various media programs and the actors and actresses in those media programs before during and after those programs air.

The API may then list the media programs on a media programming guide not solely by channel but also by popularity and ranking among users and by genre on a yearly a monthly a weekly a daily and or a real time basis during the program s airtime. This allows the API to present to a user for example via a Graphical User Interface GUI an electronic and interactive program guide that is organized according to popularity timeslot and or category.
