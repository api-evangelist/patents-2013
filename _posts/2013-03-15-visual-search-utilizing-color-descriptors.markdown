title: Visual search utilizing color descriptors
abstract: Various embodiments provide a method for computing color descriptors of product images. For example, a number of fine color representatives can be determined to describe color variation in an image as a histogram by assigning a saturation value and a brightness value to a plurality of color hues. For each pixel of the image, the closest color among a defined fine color representative set is computed. In this example, each of the pixels is assigned a color ID corresponding to their closest matching fine color representative and at least one family color ID corresponding one or more pure color families. In this example, a histogram of the color representatives and a histogram for the color families are computed. A single color vector descriptor for the image is then determined by combining the family histogram with the color representative histogram.

Users are increasingly utilizing electronic devices to obtain various types of information. For example a user wanting to purchase a pair of shoes might access an electronic marketplace in order to search the types of shoes offered through that marketplace. Unless the user knows an exact brand or style of shoe that the user wants however the user might have to search through hundreds or thousands of different shoes using various options to attempt to locate the type of shoe in which the user is interested. In many cases the shoes are organized by categories such as casual and formal which only lend general guidance to the types of shoes in each of the categories. Color can also be an important cue for narrowing search results while browsing. In order to facilitate such a browsing experience each product image needs to be tagged with the color of the product contained therein. However manually tagging each and every product is not scalable or practical. Manually tagging each product is not scalable and hence there is a need for automated algorithms to analyze the visual content of these images and tag them with color contained therein. Therefore as technology advances it can be advantageous to adapt the ways in which product information is made available to users and also the ways in which users access the same.

Systems and methods in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure may overcome one or more of the aforementioned and other deficiencies experienced in conventional approaches to determining information about items using a computing device. In particular various embodiments provide a method of determining color descriptors for images. In at least some embodiments an image is described as a histogram over a number of representative colors for encoding the color content in product images. In one example the color content of two images can be compared by computing their associated color descriptors and computing the dot product or other distance metric between the same to determine a similarity measure of the color for the two images. In another example the pure color content of an image can be determined which can then be used in a query by color search.

In at least one embodiment a number of fine color representatives are determined for describing color variation in an image as a histogram by assigning a saturation value and a brightness value to a plurality of color hues. For each pixel of the image the closest color among a defined fine color representative set is computed. In this example each of the pixels is assigned a color ID corresponding to their closest matching fine color representative and at least one family color ID corresponding one or more pure color families. In this example a histogram of the color representatives and a histogram for the color families are computed. A single color vector descriptor for the image is then determined by combining the family histogram with the color representative histogram.

Therefore a fine grained set of representatives that adequately cover the color space along with a corresponding set of family color representatives that substantially respect perceptual color boundaries are chosen. The final descriptor is a concatenation of these two types of representatives. Accordingly the color content of two images can be matched by extracting the descriptors and comparing them using Euclidean distance or an image can be matched against a pure color by fabricating a color descriptor as described herein.

Various other functions and advantages are described and suggested below as may be provided in accordance with the various embodiments.

As discussed color can be an important filter for narrowing search results while browsing especially for apparel products such as shoes dresses and the like. To facilitate such a browsing experience each product image needs to be tagged with the color contained therein. Manually tagging all products is not scalable and hence there is a need for an automated algorithm to analyze the visual content of these images and tag the same with the color contained therein. Therefore in at least one embodiment color of an object or product in an image can be described as a histogram over a number representative colors. For example at least a portion of each red green and blue RGB pixel in an image can be mapped to one or more of the representative colors and the corresponding counts can be aggregated to form a vector color descriptor of the image. The choice of representative colors is critical to both matching complexity and accuracy. For example one possible choice includes all RGB color triplet combinations in the range 0 255 . This however leads to an overly large descriptor which is not only computationally intensive to match but likely too specific for many color variations to be perceived by the human eye. For example if two images with very similar colors have slightly different RGB values their corresponding descriptors may return a low match score when comparing them. Conversely the other extreme is choosing too few color representatives where two image s corresponding descriptors may return a high match score for very different colors. Choosing a proper number of color representatives is therefore critical to properly describing and subsequently matching colors of an object in an image.

Color representatives can be chosen by essentially segment the entire color gamut into regions where all colors are considered equal. represents an example RGB Space graph . In this example each location within the 3 dimensional space represents a different combination of red green and blue yielding all color possibilities. Besides being computationally intensive uniformly dividing the 3 dimensional RGB space to determine color representatives in accordance with various embodiments is not desirable for a number of reasons. Another consideration in choosing the color representatives therefore is that they should respect perceptual boundaries between colors. For example color variations at low intensity are often difficult for the human eye to disambiguate so there does not need to be as many color segments or categories for low intensity regions. Further the color content of each segment might be different or yield different results at different brightness values. A different segmenting method for choosing color representatives is therefore desirable.

Each of the fine grained color representatives described above is assigned to one or more color families to provide a coarser set of representatives to help generalize the descriptors to regions in the color gamut that are sparsely populated by fine grained color representatives. illustrates an example process for assigning color representatives to pure color families that can be used in accordance with various embodiments. In this example a set of pure color families are defined and this set is described in terms of a finite number or range of RGB color values. In this example the closest RGB family color is computed for each of the color representatives. As described above for the fine color representatives the set color families are also chosen to respect perceptual color boundaries of the human eye. For example if two colors are at a boundary of two pure colors using only fine color representatives will often lead to an equal similarity score being calculated for both colors. Therefore each color representative is assigned to a pure color family to provide a needed bias towards the correct pure color. If for example there are multiple color representatives within a determined distance threshold the corresponding representatives can be assigned to all the respective color families.

Having a defined set of color representatives and color families a color descriptor of an image can be computed. illustrates an example process for extracting color descriptors that can be used in accordance with various embodiments. It should be understood that for this and other processes discussed herein there can be additional fewer or alternative steps performed in similar or alternative steps or in parallel within the scope of the various embodiments unless otherwise stated. In this example a number of fine color representatives are determined to describe color variation in an image as a histogram by assigning a saturation value and a brightness value to a plurality of color hues for each of a set of colors. For each pixel in the image the closest color among the fine color representatives is computed . Each of the pixels is assigned to a color ID for the closest matching fine color representative and to at least one pure color family having a corresponding family ID. In this example a global histogram of the color representatives is computed for at least a portion of the pixels. Additionally a color family histogram is also computed . A single color vector descriptor for the image is computed by normalizing and combining or concatenating the color family histogram with the color representative histogram with a weighting factor. illustrates such an example histogram with the color representative histogram portion concatenated with the color family histogram portion . Further the descriptor can be scaled to have a unit Euclidean norm. In one example the color family histogram is weighted higher 1.2 for example when combining the histograms than the color representative histogram 1.0 for example. There are some applications however where the color family histogram isn t always weighted higher. For example the color representative histogram can be weighted higher when determining a visual similarity between two items or images as will be described below.

In at least one embodiment the computation of the closest color among the fine color representatives can be performed in a color space other than RGB space or HSV space as discussed above. For example Lab color space CIELAB which incorporates a dimension L for lightness and a and b for color opponent dimensions could also be utilized for assigning image pixels to the fine colors. As used herein a color opponent is associated with a process in color theory that suggests that color perception is controlled by the activity of two opponent systems a blue yellow mechanism and a red green mechanism. Accordingly the HSV and Lab color spaces can be utilized for different purposes. For example the HSV space can be used to lay out the fine colors representatives and Lab space to compute distances.

In order to compare the color content of two images their descriptors are first computed as described elsewhere herein and the dot product or any other distance metric between these descriptors is used as a measure of color similarity between the two images. illustrates an example process for comparing color descriptors that can be used in accordance with various embodiments. In this example a second image to compare to a first image or a first image to compare against a color is obtained . A closest matching fine color representative for each pixel of the image is determined . As discussed elsewhere herein a global histogram of the closest matching fine color representatives for the image and corresponding family histogram is determined . A color vector descriptor is computed from a combination of the global and family histograms and a similarity measure is determined by computing the dot product or any other suitable distance metric between a comparison vector descriptor of an image in an image database or for comparison against a color in general and the vector descriptor for the obtained image. In at least one example a similarity score can be calculated based on the distance between the descriptors. Various other types of information and techniques can be utilized or provided as well within the scope of the various embodiments.

As discussed elsewhere herein color can be an important cue for narrowing search results while browsing for a product in an electronic marketplace. In order to facilitate such a browsing or shopping experience that can search or filter by color each product image will need to be tagged with the color of the product contained therein. However manually tagging each and every product is not scalable or practical. Therefore in accordance with at least one embodiment an automated algorithm discussed herein can analyze the visual content of images and automatically tag the same with color therein. In at least one embodiment a synthetic color descriptor can be fabricated to compare against product image color descriptors to tag the same for narrowing or filtering search results by color. Further such a process could be performed in real time as a search is being requested by a user. illustrates an example process for fabricating color descriptors that can be used in accordance with various embodiments. For example a color selection is received by a user. Given the pure color RGB value N closest fine color representatives are determined along with their associated distances from the nearest pure color representative in either HSV or RGB space. In one example a fixed decreasing function is used determine these distances. Accordingly the associated families for each of the closest fine color representatives are determined . The family counts along with the associated distances are used to determine histograms for numerical counts of the closest matching fine color representatives and corresponding color family representatives. A descriptor is computed from a combination of color representative and family histograms which is used to tag the image or identify search results with the computed descriptor. Accordingly products in accordance with the user s search and color filtering criterion can be returned .

Histogram descriptors as discussed herein in a color context can be used to identify visually similar images or images with similar colors in the collection of content. For example if a user identifies an image of an item of interest and elects to filter by color then embodiments search across the collection of content to identify other images of items that are visually similar to the selected item of interest. To do so embodiments search across other color histogram descriptors of the images in the collection of content to identify one or more images that have color

It will be helpful to have reference to an example environment configured to create color histogram descriptors and to use the descriptors to automatically tag search and filter content in accordance with at least one embodiment. illustrates an example environment in which information such as search criteria and item color can be submitted by a computing device in order to attempt to obtain information for matching items as a set of search results or other such content. In this example a user is able to specify an item including a color and other such information using at least one computing device . For example the computing device can send at least a portion of information across at least one appropriate network such as may include the Internet a local area network LAN a cellular network and the like. The request can be sent to an appropriate content provider as may provide one or more services systems or applications for processing such requests.

In this example the request is received to a network interface layer of the content provider . The network interface layer can include any appropriate components known or used to receive requests from across a network such as may include one or more application programming interfaces APIs or other such interfaces for receiving such requests. The network interface layer might be owned and operated by the provider or leveraged by the provider as part of a shared resource or cloud offering. The network interface layer can receive and analyze the request and cause at least a portion of the information in the request to be directed to an appropriate system or service such as a color matching service as illustrated in . A color matching service in this example includes components operable to receive color data for a type of item analyze the color data of an image tag the images with color tags and the like. Further the system may also return information relating to people products places or things that are determined to match the color data with etc.

The color matching service in this example can cause information to be sent to at least one identification service device system or module that is operable to analyze the contour data and attempt to locate one or more matches. In at least some embodiments an identification service will process the received data such as to extract specific representative color points then compare the processed data against data stored in a matching data store or other such location. The data in an image matching data store might be indexed and or processed to facilitate with matching as is known for such purposes.

The color matching service can receive information from each contacted identification service as to whether one or more matches could be found with at least a threshold level of confidence for example and can receive any appropriate information for a located potential match. The information from each identification service can be analyzed and or processed by one or more applications of the color matching service such as to determine data useful in obtaining information for each of the potential matches or products to provide to the user. For example a color matching service might receive bar codes product identifiers or any other types of data from the identification service s and might process that data to be provided to a service such as an information aggregator service that is capable of locating descriptions or other content related to the located potential matches.

In at least some embodiments an information aggregator might be associated with an entity that provides an electronic marketplace or otherwise provides items or content for consumption e.g. purchase rent lease or download by various customers. Although products and electronic commerce are presented in this and other examples presented it should be understood that these are merely examples and that approaches presented in the present disclosure can relate to any appropriate types of objects or information as discussed and suggested elsewhere herein. In such an instance the information aggregator service can utilize the aggregated data from the color matching service to attempt to locate products in a product data store or other such location which are offered through the marketplace and that match or are otherwise related to the potential match information. For example if the identification service identifies a type or brand of boot with the desired color the information aggregator can attempt to determine whether instances of that type or brand of boot are offered through the marketplace or at least for which information is available through the marketplace. In at least some embodiments the information aggregator can utilize one or more suggestion algorithms or other such approaches to attempt to determine related elements that might be of interest based on the determined matches. In some embodiments the information aggregator can return various types of data or metadata to the environmental information service as may include item description availability reviews and the like. In other embodiments the information aggregator might instead return information such as a product identifier uniform resource locator URL or other such digital entity enabling a browser or other interface on the computing device to obtain information for one or more products etc. The information aggregator can also utilize the aggregated data to obtain various other types of data as well. Information for located matches also can be stored in a user data store of other such location which can be used to assist in determining future potential matches or suggestions that might be of interest to the user. Various other types of information can be returned as well within the scope of the various embodiments.

The color matching service can bundle at least a portion of the information for the potential matches to send to the client as part of one or more messages or responses to the original request. In some embodiments the information from the identification services might arrive at different times as different types of information might take longer to analyze etc. In these cases the matching service might send multiple messages to the client device as the information becomes available. The potential matches located by the various identification services can be written to a log data store or other such location in order to assist with future matches or suggestions as well as to help rate a performance of a given identification service. As should be understood each service can include one or more computing components such as at least one server as well as other components known for providing services as may include one or more APIs data storage and other appropriate hardware and software components. It should be understood that although the identification services are shown to be part of the provider environment in that one or more of these identification services might be operated by third parties that offer these services to the provider.

In this example the computing device has a display screen e.g. an LCD element operable to display information or image content to one or more users or viewers of the device. The display screen of some embodiments displays information to the viewers facing the display screen e.g. on the same side of the computing device as the display screen . The computing device in this example can include one or more imaging elements in this example including two image capture elements on the front of the device and at least one image capture element on the back of the device. It should be understood however that image capture elements could also or alternatively be placed on the sides or corners of the device and that there can be any appropriate number of capture elements of similar or different types. Each image capture element and may be for example a camera a charge coupled device CCD a motion detection sensor or an infrared sensor or other image capturing technology.

As discussed the device can use the images e.g. still or video captured from the imaging elements and to generate a three dimensional simulation of the surrounding environment e.g. a virtual reality of the surrounding environment for display on the display element of the device . Further the device can utilize outputs from at least one of the image capture elements and to assist in determining the location and or orientation of a user and in recognizing nearby persons objects or locations. For example if the user is holding the device the captured image information can be analyzed e.g. using mapping information about a particular area to determine the approximate location and or orientation of the user. The captured image information may also be analyzed to recognize nearby persons objects or locations e.g. by matching parameters or elements from the mapping information .

The computing device can also include at least one microphone or other audio capture elements capable of capturing audio data such as words spoken by a user of the device music being hummed by a person near the device or audio being generated by a nearby speaker or other such component although audio elements are not required in at least some devices. In this example there are three microphones one microphone on the front side one microphone on the back and one microphone on or near a top or side of the device. In some devices there may be only one microphone while in other devices there might be at least one microphone on each side and or corner of the device or in other appropriate locations.

The device in this example also includes one or more orientation or position determining elements operable to provide information such as a position direction motion or orientation of the device. These elements can include for example accelerometers inertial sensors electronic gyroscopes and electronic compasses.

The example device also includes at least one communication mechanism such as may include at least one wired or wireless component operable to communicate with one or more electronic devices. The device also includes a power system such as may include a battery operable to be recharged through conventional plug in approaches or through other approaches such as capacitive charging through proximity with a power mat or other such device. Various other elements and or combinations are possible as well within the scope of various embodiments.

The device typically will include some type of display element such as a touch screen electronic ink e ink organic light emitting diode OLED or liquid crystal display LCD although devices such as portable media players might convey information via other means such as through audio speakers.

As discussed the device in many embodiments will include at least one imaging element such as one or more cameras that are able to capture images of the surrounding environment and that are able to image a user people or objects in the vicinity of the device. The image capture element can include any appropriate technology such as a CCD image capture element having a sufficient resolution focal range and viewable area to capture an image of the user when the user is operating the device. Methods for capturing images using a camera element with a computing device are well known in the art and will not be discussed herein in detail. It should be understood that image capture can be performed using a single image multiple images periodic imaging continuous image capturing image streaming etc. Further a device can include the ability to start and or stop image capture such as when receiving a command from a user application or other device.

The example computing device also includes at least one orientation determining element able to determine and or detect orientation and or movement of the device. Such an element can include for example an accelerometer or gyroscope operable to detect movement e.g. rotational movement angular displacement tilt position orientation motion along a non linear path etc. of the device . An orientation determining element can also include an electronic or digital compass which can indicate a direction e.g. north or south in which the device is determined to be pointing e.g. with respect to a primary axis or other such aspect .

As discussed the device in many embodiments will include at least a positioning element for determining a location of the device or the user of the device . A positioning element can include or comprise a GPS or similar location determining elements operable to determine relative coordinates for a position of the device. As mentioned above positioning elements may include wireless access points base stations etc. that may either broadcast location information or enable triangulation of signals to determine the location of the device. Other positioning elements may include QR codes barcodes RFID tags NFC tags etc. that enable the device to detect and receive location information or identifiers that enable the device to obtain the location information e.g. by mapping the identifiers to a corresponding location . Various embodiments can include one or more such elements in any appropriate combination.

As mentioned above some embodiments use the element s to track the location of a device. Upon determining an initial position of a device e.g. using GPS the device of some embodiments may keep track of the location of the device by using the element s or in some instances by using the orientation determining element s as mentioned above or a combination thereof. As should be understood the algorithms or mechanisms used for determining a position and or orientation can depend at least in part upon the selection of elements available to the device.

The example device also includes one or more wireless components operable to communicate with one or more electronic devices within a communication range of the particular wireless channel. The wireless channel can be any appropriate channel used to enable devices to communicate wirelessly such as Bluetooth cellular NFC or Wi Fi channels. It should be understood that the device can have one or more conventional wired communications connections as known in the art.

The device also includes a power system such as may include a battery operable to be recharged through conventional plug in approaches or through other approaches such as capacitive charging through proximity with a power mat or other such device. Various other elements and or combinations are possible as well within the scope of various embodiments.

In some embodiments the device can include at least one additional input device able to receive conventional input from a user. This conventional input can include for example a push button touch pad touch screen wheel joystick keyboard mouse keypad or any other such device or element whereby a user can input a command to the device. These I O devices could even be connected by a wireless infrared or Bluetooth or other link as well in some embodiments. Some devices also can include a microphone or other audio capture element that accepts voice or other audio commands. For example a device might not include any buttons at all but might be controlled only through a combination of visual and audio commands such that a user can control the device without having to be in contact with the device.

In some embodiments a device can include the ability to activate and or deactivate detection and or command modes such as when receiving a command from a user or an application or retrying to determine an audio input or video input etc. In some embodiments a device can include an infrared detector or motion sensor for example which can be used to activate one or more detection modes. For example a device might not attempt to detect or communicate with devices when there is not a user in the room. If an infrared detector i.e. a detector with one pixel resolution that detects changes in state detects a user entering the room for example the device can activate a detection or control mode such that the device can be ready when needed by the user but conserve power and resources when a user is not nearby.

In some of the above examples the actions taken by the device relate to deactivating certain functionality for purposes of reducing power consumption. It should be understood however that actions can correspond to other functions that can adjust similar and other potential issues with use of the device. For example certain functions such as requesting Web page content searching for content on a hard drive and opening various applications can take a certain amount of time to complete. For devices with limited resources or that have heavy usage a number of such operations occurring at the same time can cause the device to slow down or even lock up which can lead to inefficiencies degrade the user experience and potentially use more power.

In order to address at least some of these and other such issues approaches in accordance with various embodiments can also utilize information such as user gaze direction to activate resources that are likely to be used in order to spread out the need for processing capacity memory space and other such resources.

In some embodiments the device can have sufficient processing capability and the imaging element and associated analytical algorithm s may be sensitive enough to distinguish between the motion of the device motion of a user s head motion of the user s eyes and other such motions based on the captured images alone. In other embodiments such as where it may be desirable for the process to utilize a fairly simple imaging element and analysis approach it can be desirable to include at least one orientation determining element that is able to determine a current orientation of the device. In one example the at least one orientation determining element is at least one single or multi axis accelerometer that is able to detect factors such as three dimensional position of the device and the magnitude and direction of movement of the device as well as vibration shock etc. Methods for using elements such as accelerometers to determine orientation or movement of a device are also known in the art and will not be discussed herein in detail. Other elements for detecting orientation and or movement can be used as well within the scope of various embodiments for use as the orientation determining element. When the input from an accelerometer or similar element is used along with the input from the camera the relative movement can be more accurately interpreted allowing for a more precise input and or a less complex image analysis algorithm.

When using an imaging element of the computing device to detect motion of the device and or user for example the computing device can use the background in the images to determine movement. For example if a user holds the device at a fixed orientation e.g. distance angle etc. to the user and the user changes orientation to the surrounding environment analyzing an image of the user alone will not result in detecting a change in an orientation of the device. Rather in some embodiments the computing device can still detect movement of the device by recognizing the changes in the background imagery behind the user. So for example if an object e.g. a window picture tree bush building car etc. moves to the left or right in the image the device can determine that the device has changed orientation even though the orientation of the device with respect to the user has not changed. In other embodiments the device may detect that the user has moved with respect to the device and adjust accordingly. For example if the user tilts their head to the left or right with respect to the device the content rendered on the display element may likewise tilt to keep the content in orientation with the user.

As discussed different approaches can be implemented in various environments in accordance with the described embodiments. For example illustrates an example of an environment for implementing aspects in accordance with various embodiments. As will be appreciated although a Web based environment is used for purposes of explanation different environments may be used as appropriate to implement various embodiments. The system includes an electronic client device which can include any appropriate device operable to send and receive requests messages or information over an appropriate network and convey information back to a user of the device. Examples of such client devices include personal computers cell phones handheld messaging devices laptop computers set top boxes personal data assistants electronic book readers and the like. The network can include any appropriate network including an intranet the Internet a cellular network a local area network or any other such network or combination thereof. The network could be a push network a pull network or a combination thereof. In a push network one or more of the servers push out data to the client device. In a pull network one or more of the servers send data to the client device upon request for the data by the client device. Components used for such a system can depend at least in part upon the type of network and or environment selected. Protocols and components for communicating via such a network are well known and will not be discussed herein in detail. Communication over the network can be enabled via wired or wireless connections and combinations thereof. In this example the network includes the Internet as the environment includes a Web server for receiving requests and serving content in response thereto although for other networks an alternative device serving a similar purpose could be used as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.

The illustrative environment includes at least one application server and a data store . It should be understood that there can be several application servers layers or other elements processes or components which may be chained or otherwise configured which can interact to perform tasks such as obtaining data from an appropriate data store. As used herein the term data store refers to any device or combination of devices capable of storing accessing and retrieving data which may include any combination and number of data servers databases data storage devices and data storage media in any standard distributed or clustered environment. The application server can include any appropriate hardware and software for integrating with the data store as needed to execute aspects of one or more applications for the client device and handling a majority of the data access and business logic for an application. The application server provides access control services in cooperation with the data store and is able to generate content such as text graphics audio and or video to be transferred to the user which may be served to the user by the Web server in the form of HTML XML or another appropriate structured language in this example. The handling of all requests and responses as well as the delivery of content between the client device and the application server can be handled by the Web server . It should be understood that the Web and application servers are not required and are merely example components as structured code discussed herein can be executed on any appropriate device or host machine as discussed elsewhere herein.

The data store can include several separate data tables databases or other data storage mechanisms and media for storing data relating to a particular aspect. For example the data store illustrated includes mechanisms for storing content e.g. production data and user information which can be used to serve content for the production side. The data store is also shown to include a mechanism for storing log or session data . It should be understood that there can be many other aspects that may need to be stored in the data store such as page image information and access rights information which can be stored in any of the above listed mechanisms as appropriate or in additional mechanisms in the data store . The data store is operable through logic associated therewith to receive instructions from the application server and obtain update or otherwise process data in response thereto. In one example a user might submit a search request for a certain type of item. In this case the data store might access the user information to verify the identity of the user and can access the catalog detail information to obtain information about items of that type. The information can then be returned to the user such as in a results listing on a Web page that the user is able to view via a browser on the user device . Information for a particular item of interest can be viewed in a dedicated page or window of the browser.

Each server typically will include an operating system that provides executable program instructions for the general administration and operation of that server and typically will include computer readable medium storing instructions that when executed by a processor of the server allow the server to perform its intended functions. Suitable implementations for the operating system and general functionality of the servers are known or commercially available and are readily implemented by persons having ordinary skill in the art particularly in light of the disclosure herein.

The environment in one embodiment is a distributed computing environment utilizing several computer systems and components that are interconnected via communication links using one or more computer networks or direct connections. However it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that such a system could operate equally well in a system having fewer or a greater number of components than are illustrated in . Thus the depiction of the system in should be taken as being illustrative in nature and not limiting to the scope of the disclosure.

The various embodiments can be further implemented in a wide variety of operating environments which in some cases can include one or more user computers or computing devices which can be used to operate any of a number of applications. User or client devices can include any of a number of general purpose personal computers such as desktop or laptop computers running a standard operating system as well as cellular wireless and handheld devices running mobile software and capable of supporting a number of networking and messaging protocols. Such a system can also include a number of workstations running any of a variety of commercially available operating systems and other known applications for purposes such as development and database management. These devices can also include other electronic devices such as dummy terminals thin clients gaming systems and other devices capable of communicating via a network.

Most embodiments utilize at least one network that would be familiar to those skilled in the art for supporting communications using any of a variety of commercially available protocols such as TCP IP OSI FTP UPnP NFS CIFS and AppleTalk. The network can be for example a local area network a wide area network a virtual private network the Internet an intranet an extranet a public switched telephone network an infrared network a wireless network and any combination thereof.

In embodiments utilizing a Web server the Web server can run any of a variety of server or mid tier applications including HTTP servers FTP servers CGI servers data servers Java servers and business application servers. The server s may also be capable of executing programs or scripts in response requests from user devices such as by executing one or more Web applications that may be implemented as one or more scripts or programs written in any programming language such as Java C C or C or any scripting language such as Perl Python or TCL as well as combinations thereof. The server s may also include database servers including without limitation those commercially available from Oracle Microsoft Sybase and IBM .
