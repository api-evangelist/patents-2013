This application claims the benefit of priority from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 61 691 793 filed Aug. 21 2012 under 35 U.S.C. 119 e and from United Kingdom patent application Ser. No. 1215377.1 filed Aug. 29 2012 under 35 U.S.C. 119 a the entire contents of both of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

The present disclosure relates to a computer implemented method for facilitating creation of an advanced digital communications network and a terminal a system and a computer readable medium for the same.

Modern digital communication networks allow the transmission and receipt of information even between far flung users. For example although educational content has traditionally been delivered by using a combination of lecture self study and one or more of physical classroom and face to face educator interaction and testing due at least in part to the proliferation of alternative content delivery systems provided by digital technologies recent efforts in education and non educational decision making are being tried. Some of these new methods involve students or users learning selected background materials independently and replacing classroom lectures with an educator facilitated student to student interactive environment or video conferencing. Yet none provide advancements in the quality of what is being communicated.

To be sure digital media have fostered many new innovations one of which is distance learning or so called e learning and another of which is video conferencing. While these methods provide several ways of delivering and exchanging content to students or users they are less successful however at providing even the kind of interactive group learning allowable in physical face to face classroom based teaching or face to face conferencing.

While digital capabilities promise an efferent way of educating students or making decisions in their current forms and with current attempts resultant useable student knowledge and or sound decisions will likely continue to wane. In the quest to use them deep and functionable understanding of the subject matter is being replaced by memorization of disjointed data sets and aggravating misunderstandings often by e mail . There is also a failure to instil or facilitate social and human to human interaction skills creating a workforce with factual knowledge but little ability to innovate and or problem solve.

It would be desirable to provide a more effective method of distance learning or decision making which enhances and increases knowledge.

Further features and advantages of the disclosure will become apparent from the following description of preferred embodiments of the disclosure given by way of example only which is made with reference to the accompanying drawings.

Embodiments of the disclosure are concerned with the creation of an advanced digital communication network that obtains transmits and or broadcasts education group interaction and or survey data respectively from and by stationary or mobile devices and interactive features of the educational and or survey data. They have several aspects including the way in which educational group interactive and or survey data are formatted interactive content of educational group interactive and or survey data embedding of educational group interactive and or survey data in applications such as social media or games and the like peer to peer distribution of educational group interactive and or survey data and of applications arranged to display and run such educational group interactive and or survey data and selection of user settings using educational group interactive and or survey data. Details of these aspects will be described in detail latter in the description but first a description of the basic infrastructure needed to support the aspects will be presented.

One aspect of the disclosure is directed to a computer implemented method wherein the method is an adaptation of one or more general or special purpose computers or other electronic devices for carrying out the method. In at least one embodiment such method may be performed by execution of at least one computer software program that creates a further technical effect of variously obtaining transmitting and broadcasting information in a particular way or sequence at particular times above and beyond the normal functioning of such computer s or device s .

Now referring to in at least one embodiment the method is expressed as an educator commanded computer program that automatically organizes and coordinates student learning and or decision making in a stepwise fashion in a way that utilizes both competitive and collaborative group dynamics unique to the current disclosure to facilitate the learning process in a controlled and restricted interactive digital environment. In at least one embodiment the program s can be run on e.g. one or more of an internet or intranet platform comprising any one of e.g. a centralized partially centralized or decentralized such as peer to peer network and may accommodate a minimum of about nine and a maximum of at least about 144 000 students or users.

As illustrated in B and C in at least one embodiment a base functional component is composed of at least one of a plurality of devices configured to be ordered by predetermined default settings or user selected settings into groupings of one or more student device set groups that can be composed of a minimum of three and maximum of at least twelve user device sets including 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and 11 user device sets. Each device set may comprise only one or multiple single user entity e.g. informal group or participant controlled owned or used device s . Any one or more of these may include for example remote log on and or remote usage via any Web capable device to a Web based ASP or peer to peer decentralized network even though device possession and or control is only temporary and or through established other user owned or installed applications such as by embedded implementation via a widely used social media application or website.

Referring to groups of device sets bi directionally communicate at an initial stage exclusively with only one another and optionally one or more administrator e.g. educator device sets. Device sets and exclusively comprise one administrator or software predetermined communication group . Sets and exclusively comprise a second device set group . Sets and exclusively comprise a third device set group . Any number of device sets per groups may be implemented but in at least one embodiment there are preferably at least three. At certain default or administrator selected times going forward device sets may continue to communicate with one another either continuously or as permitted by specially timed and optionally formatted information input request periods. At this initial stage and over several stages intra device set communications occur for example through networks W1 W2 W3 W4 W4 W5 W6 W7 W8 W9 W10 W11 W12 W13 W14 and W15 each of which may be different or the same as one another.

Referring to collective device group data determined depending on data received from direct user to device input into one or more of each device set in a device set group are transmitted to each of the other closed communication device set groups in device set classroom a k a second tier group for broadcast at all device sets in the other device set groups within device set classroom . Device set group decisions may be determined within the relevant device set group or any other group device set or terminal or alternately for example by any one or more other terminals in the plurality of devices of the system before being distributed to and broadcast at other device set groups or classrooms. Each device set in classroom is arranged then to receive direct user to device input data responsive to each other device set group s transmitted received and broadcast data in its device set classroom .

Referring to collective device classroom data determined depending on data received from direct user to device input into one or more of each device set or group in a device set classroom are transmitted to each of the other closed communication device set classrooms in device set school a k a third tier group for broadcast at all device sets in the other device set classrooms within device set school . Device set classroom decisions may be determined within the relevant device set classroom or any other classroom device set or terminal or alternately for example by any one or more other terminals in the plurality of devices of the system before being distributed to and broadcast at other device set classrooms. Each device set in school is arranged then to receive direct user to device input data responsive to each device set classroom s transmitted received and broadcast data in its device set school .

In at least one alternate embodiment each device set group may have preferably from 4 to 12 device sets each device set classroom may have preferably 3 to 12 device set groups and each device set school may have preferably from 2 or 4 to 1000 or more as manageable device set classrooms.

In at least one embodiment rather than being in closed communication with only certain other device sets device sets may be in open communication with any one or more device sets but only selectively display or broadcast data input from other devices sets so as to provide closed communication device display and broadcast.

As used herein display or displaying are respectively a type of broadcast or a type of broadcasting and broadcast and broadcasting each require digital data signal transduction into readily understandable by human form and which may be limited to broadcast by only one device.

In at least one embodiment each student device set is determined by e.g. password protection and is for use by only one student. Yet in at least one alternate embodiment multiple participants may use each device set each at different times or collectively at the same time. As used herein the term device and terminal shall be meant to include both a single digital communication device over the duration of the method and multiple such devices in the same device set performing or configured to perform one or more of the various method steps or substeps and having one or more of the various method features and or elements.

In at least one embodiment features performed by each device create user impressions actions and reactions individually and or specifically due to each single one or various combinations of every one of such feature s or feature element s execution. Through a complex interplay of specially programmed device and human interactive and critical thinking it has been surprisingly discovered that a far more advanced digital communication method can be achieved which optimizes and harnesses biological critical thinking. Non limiting examples include one or more of certain features and options attributable to feature element s such as individual communications and sequences of communications to and or from a device and or certain other devices broadcast display determination and or storage of data placements timings and or sequences of such features and the programmed control or change of the sequence timing and availability of any or all such features and or elements each resulting either individually or from various of the myriad disclosed embodiments herein. As the method manifests e.g. both a sequence of physically changing devices and unexpected influences on the physical learning and decision making ability of its participants occur as is further discussed and illustrated below.

Thus in various of the embodiments the method produces the creation of an advanced digital communications network that causes at least any one or more of 1 training 2 educating 3 facilitated educating 4 one or more of enhancing and promoting one or more of biological synaptic growth and biological synaptic numerosity and 5 better collective decision making. In all of these one or more of electronic signals computers and electronic devices are necessary or the only means tools for obtaining such effect s .

In such embodiments the method facilitates one or more of learning unbiased decision making and critical thinking. For instance there has been an observed enhancement of data input by a terminal user and resulting output after user interaction with broadcast or displayed data resulting therefrom which is achieved by among other factors unbiased critical thinking in light of one or more the user s existing knowledge and information obtained from operation of an embodiment terminal.

Alternatively or in addition in at least several of the embodiments the method creates unexpected advantages by removing one or more of physiological sociological or other interpersonal biases that are unrelated to the merits of education or learning.

Now referring to in at least one embodiment an answer derived hierarchy of device sets develops within a predetermined device set architecture through one or more of collaboration and e.g. followed by competition thereby to create a surprisingly optimized and un expectantly advanced digital communication network. Providing the basic framework for this hierarchy are various tier groups to a single one of which each device set may belong at any given time such as while in a particular tier or in at least one embodiment even momentarily . At each tier various device sets display information based on data from other device sets in their same single tier group. In the first tier the device sets in each first tier group have been determined at least in advance of their first collaboration. A second tier group includes devices sets from an increased pool of possible device sets which is greater than the number of device sets that were in a given device set s first tier group. A third tier group includes device sets from a further increased pool of possible device sets which is greater than the number of device sets that were in a given device set s second tier group. In at least one alternate embodiment however both collaboration and competition may partially or completely precede or follow the other.

The overall structure of at least one embodiment drives students users to first collaborate then compete to determine a single result or group consensus. Thereafter the groups first experience inter group collaborative learning and then compete to determine a single result or classroom consensus. These classrooms then compete without a collaboration stage to determine a single or multiple school consensus. This process demands that each challenge be addressed analyzed and results modified on three separate occasions and with advancing levels of student to student interactivity. This provides the best prospects for better collaboration more active completion and enhanced learning and subject matter retention.

At least one embodiment provides that the number of students that interact to create the group and classroom consensus es will be small enough to allow participation by all students i.e. users Overall architecture hierarchy depends on groups. Groups are learning or decision making units composed of from three to twelve device sets in the same first tier. These groups are organized into classrooms that can be composed from one to twelve groups in a same second tier. The numbers of device sets in a group and the number of groups in a classroom has been determined as a minimum number of students for meaningful interactivity and so that the maximum number that will not overwhelm or allow students to hide allowing and requiring all students a chance for meaningful participation and not over burdening and confusing students by requiring them to review and process more than twelve responses at any one time.

In at least one embodiment the predetermined method architecture will accommodate up to about 1000 classrooms in a school at the same third tier. Given these parameters the architecture dictates at least one embodiment of the method can accommodate as few as about nine students and as many as about 144 000 students . There is no limit as to the number of students in a school by increasing the number of classrooms . This gives the program the flexibility to be used in all settings from small to medium and very large educational or non educational the latter intended only for decision making settings.

In at least one preferred embodiment the maximum group size is no more than 8 device sets. And a preferred maximum class size should be no more than about 8 groups. This means that no user will need to evaluate more than seven answers at any one time. More preferably six device sets are in each group so each user needs to evaluate 5 other answers.

In at least one embodiment these groups can be organized into multiple classrooms with as few as three and a maximum of about twelve groups in a classroom.

In at least one embodiment an ideal minimum and maximum number of students in a group and groups in a classroom is a minimum number of students needed for meaningful interactivity and the maximum number is a maximum number that will not overwhelm. Both minimum and maximum numbers allow all students a chance for meaningful participation and do not over burden students by requiring them to review and process more than twelve responses at any one time. In at least one preferred embodiment three to twelve students may provide maximum functionality to an embodiment.

Now referring to in at least one embodiment by execution of an educator course set up module which in at least one embodiment can be configured to perform educator set up prior to students being assigned into a group all students are required to study pre assigned materials and thereafter take a group pre qualification entrance examination. The group pre qualification entrance examination assures that all those assigned into a group have a minimum comprehension of the subject matter. This increases the likelihood of critical interactivity among group members and between groups. This in turn drives critical thinking and creativity creating thoughtful and diverse short answer results leading to more comprehensive learning better learning retention and a more well rounded understanding of subject matter. As a result students receive a better platform from which to use the educational subject matter in their lives.

In at least one embodiment an educator sets parameters prior to initiating a course. These parameters include a the content to be studied b test questions for an entrance examination to qualify for group entrance c questions challenges that will be posed to all groups d time intervals for the completion of each step e answer length parameters and e other parameters. This set up process gives educators the flexibility to optimize educational programs better to meet the needs of students and allows educators the opportunity to use their experience and unique teaching method s and knowledge.

In at least one embodiment by execution of an intergroup qualification and assignment module which can be configured to perform intergroup qualification and assignment students perform one or more of a conducting independent study b taking a group entrance exam c passing or not an exam d being admitted and assigned to a group.

In at least one embodiment by execution of an inter group collaborative learning module which can be configured to enable inter group collaborative learning challenges are answered in the form of short answers. Challenges can be issued one at a time or as a slate of up to five or even more up to any N number. In at least one preferred embodiment at each stage of the process space available for a short answer doubles. Limiting the number of characters allowable for each short answer requires both individuals and groups to distill large bodies of knowledge into short punchy responses highlighting areas they deem important and perhaps even more importantly to choose what information to exclude so as to become more competitive in voting competitions. This feature also better assures that different individuals and groups address different areas of the subject matter augmenting the collaborative portion of the education process. This feature increases the chances for students to invent new ideas while exploring the subject matter and increases overall learning and retention.

In at least one embodiment one goal is to determine a school consensus for one or more of each challenge and each slate. The stages in this 12 step process include any one or more of the following 

In at least one embodiment by execution of an group disbanding and individual testing module which can be configured to perform group disbanding and individual testing 

In at least one embodiment students may be anonymous or identified. Whether a student is known by that student s real or virtual identity all students may track one or more of their own and another other student s s performance s on a real time or delayed basis on scoreboard which is output on e.g. one or more of any printed medium and any graphical user interface by scoreboard module .

In at least one embodiment this scoring takes place automatically by one or more computer algorithm tracking key words and or phrases that are similar to the consensus results at the various stages. In this way larger numbers of students can have high scores even if their particular short answer failed to win in the voting competition but largely resembles with winning answers.

In at least one embodiment maintaining participation may require following simple rules requiring on going participation. For example failing to participate in any three required steps may cause a student to be eliminated from a course. Processes are integrated to identify and eliminate students exhibiting inappropriate behavior. On going positive feedback rewards are given to individual students groups and classrooms. In at least one embodiment successful learning is determined 9 e.g. by individual testing.

Several non limiting unexpected advantages of several individual of the various above indicated features include how at least one embodiment drives critical thinking and creativity during the educational process and gives educators better insight into the actual level of comprehension students have about specific subject matter. First it also understood to mean one or more of multiple embodiments going forward allows all students effectively to participate without the effect of physiological or other non scholastic merit based dominance. Second it maximizes student participation by grouping them into small manageable groups. Third it creates a competitive game like environment driving interactivity enhancing learning and retention. Fourth it is self policing automatically excluding students and allowing educators to focus on educating students. Fifth it gives educators keen insight into the thinking process of students and groups of students allowing them to craft and optimize student interaction and lectures. Sixth it can be used as both an education and testing tool. Seventh it allows fewer educators productively to educate more students increasing system wide efficiencies and saving money. Eighth it may also allow the overseers of educators keen insight into the effectiveness of individual educators providing the opportunity for optimization of the educator pool. Ninth it optimizes group dynamics by a natural selection process. Further it provides for complete accountability by testing students individually at the end of a process.

At least one embodiment is a pre programmable educator led method. After initial set up it automatically and seamlessly allows organization and coordination of competitive student to student learning interactions driving students stepwise into deeper and deeper understanding of subject matter incorporating collaborative and competitive processes of group thinking and consensus building. It is alternately completely performed locally by one or more students him herself or themselves. It surprisingly takes advantage of anonymity and objectivity removing in large part social political and other negative aspects of group dynamics focusing instead on more intellectual logic based interactivity and thought processes.

In at least one embodiment a method is implemented as an internet or intranet based implementation on one of more special purpose computers that may be programmed by educators in accordance with their educational philosophy and subject matter.

Once programmed at least one embodiment automatically groups students into learning groups that collaborate on pre defined questions challenges . In at least one embodiment the executed program has one or more of four distinct modules. Non limiting examples include a educator course set up module b group qualification and assignment module c inter group collaborative learning module and d group disbanding and individual testing module .

Educator s Course Set up Module may comprise one or more of several modules several non limiting example of which are as follows.

Universal Content Sink Module An educator modified and loaded program that is adaptable to any kind of educational content. This content can be include any one or more of the following non limiting materials text based video e learning assigned independent research and traditional classroom lectures. Any content can be placed into Universal Content Sink Module directly or through an Internet link. This allows educators quickly and easily to set up course materials by linking into existing educational content. This in turn allows fewer educators effectively to create class materials for more students thus saving education system resources. It also allows for flexibility quickly to modify course content to meet the needs of individual classrooms and update educational content in accordance with an evolving knowledge base.

Educator Defined Parameters Module Prior to initiating the course the educator s program the course parameters in accordance with their education philosophy and in accordance with the appropriateness of the subject matter. These parameters may include any one or more of the following and are described in further detail below 

Group Entrance Examination Loading Module Educator s pre loads all challenges that will be posed to student groups in sequential order in which they will be given to the groups. This program will accommodate from one to one hundred challenges per course.

Challenge e.g. question Loading Module In at least one embodiment each challenge can be either a single challenge or a maximum of two three four five six or seven or more preferably five challenges in a single group. This group of challenges will be referred to herein as a slate .

In at least one embodiment all challenges may be programmed and are appropriate for short answer text based questions. In at least one preferred embodiment it is critical that challenges are appropriate for short answer text questions and short answer text questions. An advantage of a short answer is that it mandates a critical evaluation of the subject matter and demands students process the educational content. Short answer questions also allow for collaborative opportunities and a better overall evaluation of subject matter mastery allowing for a meaningful competitive voting process. All of this in turn drives critical thinking and creativity creating thoughtful and diverse short answer results leading to more comprehensive learning better learning retention and more well rounded understanding of the subject matter. It therefore provides a better platform from which to use the educational subject matter in their lives.

Now referring to each student prepares for and attempts to pass a group entrance examination. If the student passes the student is assigned to a group.

Group Entrance Examination and Student Assignment Modules and To insure all students entering the program have the minimum level of understanding to interact with other students the educator s will enter from about 10 to 100 multiple choice test questions. The educator s can restrict group entry by cutting off the ratio of correct answers necessary for participation. Students not passing can be re directed to the universal content sink module for further study using independent study module . The group entrance examination increases the likelihood of critical interactivity among group members and between groups. This also in turn drives critical thinking and creativity creating thoughtful and diverse short answer results leading to more comprehensive learning better learning retention and a more well rounded understanding of the subject matter.

A subsequent step is group assignment. After a student passes the group entrance examination he she is assigned to a group composed of from three to twelve students. Educator s have one or more of several non limiting options for determining group selection for each student s placement. These include but are not limited to 

Each student placed into a learning group will be assigned a different username and password for each course. In the case a student changes groups for any reason the username will he changed. This provides for better anonymity which will provide an open environment less prone to physiological dominance and increased overall participation among students.

In at least one alternate or additional embodiment it has been surprisingly discovered that having a random assortment of group members forces groups into fairly drastic compromising positions and drives toward a single homogenized consensus. Yet this configuration does not necessarily mimic traditional interactions. Complex inquiries typically have several points of view and none of these points of view are necessarily wrong or better. Reasonable people can disagree and differing assumptions often lead to vastly differing but reasonable results even when such results are vetted by critical thinking and rational analysis.

It has been discovered quite surprisingly that groups formed of member shaving disparate backgrounds may lead to disjointed or unpredictable results. To provide a more traditional learning experience that more succinctly produces honed and sharpened collaborative critical views participants are self selected by their own personal demographic philosophical educational characteristics early in the process such that these groups having one or more common attributes operate amongst themselves in the same groups or classes depending on the number of participants . Their task is to develop the best consensus answer to reflect their perspective and point of view. Midway through or at the end of the process they each arrive at their own relatively more coherent and representative views. Collectively several group class or even school consensus results result which reflect the best answers from different recognized positions or common attributes.

Using this alternate embodiment or in combination with certain degree of randomization or subject matter mastery pre testing users can be grouped early by one or more of a Results of a belief survey that would be in bedded in the group entrance examination b by analyzing their early voting ranking patterns and c simple self selection process.

The inclusion and weight given to these types of feature s versus subject matter mastery can be dependent on one or more of the philosophy of the administrator and the subject matter being learned.

Now referring to in at least one embodiment to force students to think critically the number of characters allowable for short answers is limited. As each stage of the process progresses the maximum length of each answers double to allow room for additional content from an increasing number of students within the pool of answer submissions. Therefore if the educator s set s the first submission at 30 characters maximum the second set of answers automatically include a maximum of 60 characters and the third a maximum of 120 characters. This doubling of space occurs a maximum of three times. In determining the maximum characters the program may include all letters numbers and spaces.

Limiting the number of characters allowable for the short answers will require both individuals and groups to distill large bodies of knowledge into short punchy responses highlighting areas they deem important and equally importantly forcing students to prioritize and exclude information to make more competitive responses for the voting process giving them the best chance of winning in the voting competition. This feature better assures that different individuals and groups will address different areas of the subject matter augmenting the collaborative portion of the education process. A resulting unpredictable result is an increase in student chances to invent new ideas while exploring the subject matter and increasing overall learning and retention.

The automated and mandatory doubling of allowable space for short answer responses at each of the first three phases facilitates collaboration between students and between groups. This increases the number and complexity of new concepts that can be included into a short answer response at each phase and forces people to combine ideas into one or more single coherent response s . This thinking and collaborative process surprisingly and unexpectedly deepens understanding of the subject matter increases retention and increases the possibility that responses will venture into new and unexplored and valuable areas that are not foreseeable and not predictable.

In at least one embodiment a central feature is inter group collaborative learning cascade . This organization and flow of competitive results dictates that all groups in all classrooms in a school are given the same challenge or slate of challenges. This these one or more challenge s are presented through the following cascade divided into one or more of at least three distinct student learning stages optionally followed by one or more of at least two educator selectable stages. These include the non limiting following stages 

One or more of a plurality of devices on a decentralized partially centralized partially decentralized or decentralized network display or otherwise broadcast group entrance examination s to one or more groups of students or individual students and receive and tabulate or calculate examination results for student s . Students via their unique device sets are assigned to groups . Pre group formation examination increases the likelihood of critical interactivity among group members and between groups. This in turn drives critical thinking and creativity creating thoughtful and diverse short answer results leading to more comprehensive learning better learning retention and gives students a more well rounded understanding of the subject matter therefore a better platform from which to use the educational subject matter in their lives.

All individual students populating all groups in a classroom and school are given the same challenge or slate of challenges. Sequentially numbered sets of identical challenges posed by one or more educators are presented to all students in a group. A first set of challenge number 1 is displayed or e.g. audibly or touch sensory broadcast to students . Each student in the group is required to submit a short answer in response to the challenge. This forces each student to independently evaluate and respond to the subject matter prior to collaborating with other students. This serves the purpose of validating meaningful participation by each individual setting the stage for meaningful collaboration informed voting and a richer learning experience and knowledge retention. These students may access universal content sink module at any time to help them determine their individual response.

Challenges can be given as a single question or in batches of up to 5 questions per challenge slate. This gives the educator s the flexibility to optimize the program in accordance with the subject matter length of course and classroom and student dynamics.

Devices receive individual response submission s . At a pre determined time all submitted individual student results are shared with all group mates within the individual groups. Students who have not submitted answers are permitted to proceed only in accordance with a three strike rule or other rule implemented to discipline students.

Individual students within a group share their responses only with the others in their assigned group group and group . Each student within the group is encouraged to review the answers derived by his her group mates. In at least one embodiment all students have the ability to change their answers one time . In at least one embodiment the number of characters in the text message answer available for the new answer is two times double the number in the students original response. After one change in each student s proposed answer each student s answer is made final and is submitted to the group by display to individual student device s for individual evaluation and voting to select the group consensus result.

In an alternate embodiment the individual evaluation of changed answers is replaced by group one or more of group discussion and evaluation by however many participants are able to control possess or use a particular device set.

After all students have had the opportunity to review all final answers from their own group mates all group members may vote for whatever answer they want to represent their group. Devices receive such voting data and assign each inputted or selected vote data to a particular answer or set of answers. The collaborative result or results is determined or received by direct student input and becomes the group consensus result by tabulation or calculation of the group consensus . Thus consensus is received by the network by voting selection by each individual participant or group or participants per device set at the one or more devices and determined by at least one device on the network of devices and transmitted to one or more other devices on the network of devices.

In at least one alternate embodiment consensus is received by the network in addition or instead of voting selection by some other determination and input at each device set e.g. as by one or more designated students who verbally input via microphone one or more text or verbally discussed and mutually agreed upon group consensus answer .

This stage brings multiple benefits to the educational process non limiting examples of which include the following. First it forces students to think and answer independently. This assures that the students go through an independent thinking process. Second the sharing of results with their group mates forces students to acknowledge and understand the different perspectives of other students and potentially incorporate these diverse ideas and opinions into their subsequent answer s . Third this process also allows students the opportunity to extrapolate into new and unexplored areas. This feature increases the chances for students to invent new ideas while exploring the subject matter and increases overall learning and retention.

Allowing students to change answers only one time between answer submissions forces students to examine all available information and group mate responses carefully and deeply prior to submission. This single chance better insures that students review the group mates and other groups results prior to submission increasing program compliance and deepening critical thinking learning and learning retention.

In at least one embodiment and as illustrated in which shows a supplement or replacement to step above multiple parallel on line data entry fields e.g. in a web browser page form principle components of dialogue box . This box is alternately embedded in software architecture as described elsewhere herein and is available for display on each device set in a particular group or alternately class or school for an optionally adjustable period of time. Each dialogue box is assigned to and represents e.g. is populated with answer data collaboration data and or selection data associated with database stored device set information for that group for all device sets in a group preferably with one dialogue box to each group available for display at any given time. Each such box can be accessed only by that assigned group and can be viewed only by all students from that device set s group.

In at least one embodiment each dialog box may or may not have an adjacent i.e. above beside diagonal and herein shown below associated retort box for providing remote cursor prompted entry and local and or remote display of the associated device sets revisions to answer data in its own associated dialogue box. Alternatively there may or may not be just one or two or three or fewer than one for each dialog box such retort box.

As such each device set in a group can see a question field and vertically disposed side by side retort boxes comprising data display fields assigned to and containing revisable periodically updated data only from each one of every or a user selected number of one s own group member s . Each device set can send revised answer data for incorporation into its own retort box to be transmitted and displayed in a same or different language or format to all other device sets in its group.

In at least one embodiment each dialogue box s retort box may or may not have its own similarly variously adjacent discussion box for retort box for retort box for retort box for retort box for retort box wherein any group member may make real time or frequently updated textually displayed comments either from text or audio voice recognition input at a remote terminal about the answer inside the corresponding retort box.

In at least one embodiment each dialogue box s retort box as displayed and ranked at each group device display may or may not have its own similarly variously adjacent and or diagonal and overlapping at a corner as shown herein selection dropdown numerical ranking selector or alternately numerical input data field for retort box for retort box for retort box for retort box for retort box wherein any group member may make real time or frequently updated textually displayed ranking selections that remain until changed. These could be change either from drop down of numbers up to and equal to the number of group members N 1 not including a device set s own box text or audio voice recognition input at a remote terminal about the ranking inside the corresponding selector field. Here we see the screen displayed on a device set associated with the same user who has an answer data displayed in retort box of his own as well as other same group members device set displays .

Each dialogue box operates in accordance with one or more of The amount of time that the boxes are active is limited by administrator input into its their device set s e.g. educator . All dialogue boxes open and close at the same or substantially the same time. As seen dialogue boxes have character limited text input fields pre set to the maximum number of characters selected for a group consensus result. Device sets allow user access and changing of responses as often as a user wishes as long as dialogue boxes are open.

In at least one embodiment display device sets display activity generated by other device sets in the same group in real time and allow each device set user s to respond to changes based on that user s individual preferences schedule and desires within the time boxes are open . Device set users can likewise choose to be notified whenever a fellow group mate changes his her result. Users can also choose to be notified about changes to any dialogue box or to one or more specific dialogue box es or retort boxes or other fields in dialog box . When participants are actively logged into their devices displaying these dialog boxes other participants are made aware of this by a participant active icon associated with each retort box in each dialog box. Through various of the operating software mentioned herein and using relevant scripts for each respective operating system or via web browser interface device set s are arranged to enable users also to communicate with other group mates but only within the constraints of the character limitation and if they want to communicate anything more they must type over existing text in order stay within the character limits . In other words at no time do participants have more characters in a dialogue box than the designated character limitation. At any time participants can view the activity history of any selected group thus allowing students to review all changes made in any or all dialogue boxes. When the allotted time limit is reached the dialogue box is frozen and responses are uploaded as final answers to be voted upon by other group mates.

Access to dialogue boxes is limited and restricted to participants of the same group in accordance with association database data for one or more of each 1 dialog box 2 each retort box 3 each selection ranking drop down selector for each other group member device set and 4 each discussion box also associated for each device set. Depending on the subject matter and or the educational philosophy of the educator administrator these boxes can be used in at least three different ways 

First prior to determining the group consensus result boxes can be activated so that participants can interact before voting and can alter their responses accordingly. Second after the first group consensus result has been determined and everyone can see the group consensus results from all the other groups in their classroom dialogue boxes are automatically pre populated with that group s consensus result. This result can be manipulated by participants as much as they wish within the time limits but once the time limit ends the results are frozen and each group can again vote for a new group consensus result. This result would compete to become the classroom consensus result. Third any combination the first and second embodiments immediately above .

Several unforeseen advantages arise from the dialog boxes. When group participants view all the group consensus results in a classroom and participate in collaboration via the dialog boxes the competitive dynamics related to the initial group consensus voting process changes. What was formerly a competitive dynamic transforms into something more collaborative and users suddenly become motivated to help each to achieve the best group result.

Because these features allow interaction only in a user friendly format limited in length and controlled by the participants themselves it less frequently overwhelms participants particularly those who are more reticent. It also forces students to process information in manageable bites which should lead to a more efficient and effective collaboration.

Since the use of these features means that users can be remotely notified when one or more group mates have made changes to their responses it alleviates the need for students to be constantly logged into the system. This saves time for users by allowing them to stay up to date on inter group activities while doing something else. These features also allows users to see the entire history of changes made within a given dialogue box via device set display. This saves time and keeps students up to date on inter group activities while they are performing other tasks.

Device sets configured to display and operate such feature s lets users know which group mates are actively engaged and also provides a conversation like environment among the two or more logged on users. This creates increased collaboration between individuals and to provide quiet group observers with the chance to learn from these interactions.

Allowing educators or administrators to choose when to activate these features gives such educators and or administrators the flexibility to adjust time frames according to a challenge and or differing subject matter and group dynamics.

Through extensive research it is surprisingly discovered that users clearly value the ability to interact more with their group mates during the process. By comparison a standard chat environment however has several drawbacks a it is unorganized and is difficult to track b some participants can easily overwhelm the dialogue with excess text effectively drowning out other voices.

It is also clear that using any type of interactive text exchange at a point just prior to voting for an initial group consensus result may be counter intuitive for some participants due to the competitive nature built into this stage of the process e.g. there is a disincentive to help someone you will compete with later . Having dialog boxes activated after all initial group consensus results are shared among all participants in all groups within a classroom however dramatically and surprisingly shifts this dynamic to one that rewards inter group collaboration in preparation for the extra group competition that determines classroom consensus result.

It is further discovered that when the dialog boxes are activated in both collaborative and competitive phases of the process a complex psychological dynamic is created the results of which are likely hard to predict.

Referring again each group in a classroom has its chosen group consensus results displayed or otherwise broadcast on any one or more of the network devices for review by the other groups at scoreboard . Each group has the opportunity to review the group consensus results submitted by all other groups in a classroom.

At this time the individual group s chat rooms are un locked for a pre determined amount of time and students within the groups are allowed to interact by text chat or another interactive computerized method such as VOIP or teleconference voice chat or via social media outlet web pages and smartphone applications such as Facebook Twitter or LinkedIn and may have the option of creating one or more revised group consensus result based on review of other groups answers . This embedding of results and or any other step of the method embodiments disclosed herein can be accomplished e.g. by using one or more IP protocol smtp http https sms scripts and or commonly used and available operating system Windows Ubuntu MacOS coupled with a server side scripting language PHP Pyton Ruby etc. and database software SQL etc. and storage device or drive.

In at least one embodiment allowing students to interact at this stage provides students this opportunity at a time when they have deeply considered the subject matter are best equipped to have deep interactive discussions. This is a time when students can actively argue their points with their group mates with a goal of having their answers chosen as the classroom consensus. A motivation for this is linked to the fact that winners in these competitions get higher scores as to students that have similar answers to challenges as determined e.g. in at least one embodiment by one or more word and phrase matching algorithms.

In at least one embodiment live interactive and simultaneous back and forth collaboration occurs only when the chat room is open. All of the other collaborations are in the form of reviewing the responses from others in a group and or classroom. At these other collaborations everything happens within the confines of a participant s head or in some cases a participant may refer for example to data broadcast by from Universal Content Sink 11 or may for example conduct other research outside what is offered for broadcast on a device of an embodiment. This is critical because it creates an environment for originality. The ideal and winning answer may incorporate none some or all of the initial participant offered content. No previously expressed content in fact might be the most interesting assuming the process created new connections and ideas that would have not been derived by not experiencing the effects of an embodiment process.

In at least one embodiment allowing students to change answers only one time between answer submissions forces students to examine all available information and group mate responses carefully and deeply prior to submission. This single chance better insures that students review the group mates and other group s results prior to submission increasing program compliance and deepening critical thinking learning and learning retention.

In at least one embodiment this new group consensus result can have a maximum of double the number of characters as previously submitted. Changing the initial group consensus result may require e.g. a simple majority or super majority vote of voting group mates in each group. This voting ballot functionality may be incorporated into each group chat room. If no majority vote is reached the original inter group consensus may remain the group consensus result.

All students in a classroom then vote for which group answer they want to represent their classroom. This result will determine a classroom consensus. Device sets receive such voting data and assign each inputted or selected vote data to a particular answer or set of answers. The winning result or results is determined and becomes the classroom consensus result by tabulation or calculation of the classroom consensus for device sets and . Thus consensus is received by the network by voting selection or other competitive determination and input such as by one or more group designated students who verbally input via microphone one or more text or verbally argued or otherwise victorious group competition determined answer at the one or more devices and determined by at least one device on the network of devices and transmitted to one or more other devices on the network of devices.

In at least one embodiment the voting process drives the competitive component of the program. This incents individuals groups and classrooms the initiative to create interesting and engaging results to better assure their responses receive the votes from their peers. This in turn drives critical thinking and creativity creating thoughtful and diverse short answer results leading to more comprehensive learning better learning retention and gives students a more well rounded understanding of the subject matter therefore a better platform from which to use the educational subject matter in their lives.

In at least one embodiment changing an answer in a group chat session requires that at least 20 30 40 60 70 80 90 or preferably 50 of group members vote in favor of changing the answer. If a majority vote is not reached an original and shorter group consensus result may stand in the competition to become the classroom consensus result. This highly incentivizes students to participate vigorously at this stage increasing all student interaction with the subject matter increasing the possibility for unpredictable results and facilitating interaction discussion and debate thus deepening learning and increasing subject matter retention.

In at least one embodiment a school consensus may be determined after each challenge or slate of challenges. In the event that there are multiple classrooms classroom results will be competed amongst each other in a minimum grouping of three and a maximum of grouping of twelve classrooms. At each stage results may be determined by a simple majority voting process wherein devices receive vote data . Each classroom has a single vote based on a majority vote of its member groups. School consensus can be predetermined as instructed by the educator s . This process continues until a single result represents a school consensus for each challenge. In addition or alternately this process may be repeated for each challenge . All the results from each single classroom and all classrooms are shared with other classrooms via scoreboard . All students in the school are eligible to vote throughout this process. This process may continue until a single result represents a school consensus for each challenge.

In at least one embodiment devices next receive voting data to determine through one or more of calculation and tabulation of classroom school consensus.

In at least one alternate embodiment before receiving voting data devices display or broadcast classroom consensus es and enable sharing of results and one chance to make a change . Providing live text chat or other communication method only one time optionally and preferably with the timing of this single opportunity being just prior to the submission of the final classroom consensus result is a critical aspect of at least one embodiment. This occurs after the challenge has gone through the collaborative and competitive process on two occasions within the groups and for the first time all groups can see the group consensus es from other groups. This flood of new information along with the optional opportunity to once again double the number of response characters is a complex and critical junction requiring the more organic interaction provided by live chat or other preferably live communication method . This is a single opportunity for students to be persuasive to further what they think or feel is the best short answer result or other result to represent their group and ultimately their classroom. The resultant answer represents and is the last time for them to win the inter classroom group competition and the one chance for their response to represent their classroom in the classroom run off competitive heats and the possibility that their short answer response could win and become the school consensus result. This facilitates a debate like format increasing collaboration and increasing learning critical thinking decision making and learning retention.

Referring to answers are competitively eliminated or progress through a bracketed tournament selection process . This process of competitive elimination of answers from among competing classrooms forces all students to review the diverse set of short answer responses on multiple occasions and as winners in the voting competition begin to emerge the logic behind why the majority of students are voting in a certain way provides a keen opportunity for students to refine their understanding of the subject matter. This drives critical thinking and creativity better learning retention and gives students a more well rounded understanding of the subject matter.

Referring again to in at least one embodiment educator s have the option to comment on the school consensus result and provide final instruction . The educators response can for example be a maximum of 10 000 characters or 60 minutes of video or audio programming and my include links to other sites and other reference materials. This allows the educator s directly to address the students needs rather than giving them a pre conceived pre determined pre screened lecture. Educator s can focus directly on areas where the participants deficits lie and spend less time on areas where comprehension exists. This increases the effectiveness of the teaching process and better utilizes limited student educator interaction. This also allows educators to craft subsequent challenges to best meet the needs of the participating students. As a result at least one embodiment of the method drives critical thinking and creativity creating thoughtful and diverse short answer results leading to more comprehensive learning better learning retention and gives students a more well rounded understanding of the subject matter which therefore provides a better platform from which to use the educational subject matter in their lives.

Educator responses to school consensus results create transparency for those charged with evaluating the competency of each educator or group of educators. This also allows administrators to more predictably identify superior and poor performing educators provide them remedial support where appropriate and increase the efficiency of the overall educational system by re assigning or eliminating ineffective educators thus increasing the overall effectiveness of educational systems.

After all challenges are completed groups are dissolved or disbanded and the remaining students are tested and scored individually to determine their level of understanding . In at least one embodiment this completes the method.

Group disbandment and individual testing assures ultimate accountability for students who find ways to take unfair advantage of weaknesses in the system by shirking or other social or technical subterfuge non limiting examples of which may include e.g. paying other students to participate on their behalf to participate in their stead. It is at the stage of the final examination were actual comprehension of the subject matter will be individually ascertained. Students aware of this individual testing component from the beginning are dis incentivized and discouraged from cheating or gaming knowing that this ultimate challenge awaits. The final testing of students on an individual basis bolsters the integrity of the entire process and best assures learning and retention.

In at least one embodiment individual scores are accessed and optionally broadcast on one or more of each student group classroom or school s version of scoreboard according whatever devices correspond to a particular student students in a group students in a class or students in a school respectively.

In at least one embodiment a process of issuing challenges to groups can continue for a minimum of a single question challenge or go for multiple challenges as determined by the educator s . During this process the educator s have several options for managing group members between challenges. These options include but are not limited to 

The best performers are considered to be those students whose submitted short answer results receive the most votes from fellow students or if their answers effectively reflect or best coincide with predetermined e.g. prior or pre established or larger group paradigmatic answers winning answers as determined by one or more word and or phrase algorithms.

This feature allows educators to customize and optimize courses in accordance with their individual teaching methods and philosophies and to accommodate differences in classroom dynamics and subject matter.

A single challenge at a time or a group s of challenges a Slate can be submitted to the groups. In at least one embodiment the minimum number of challenges is one and the maximum number is one hundred.

In at least one embodiment the maximum number of challenges that can be assigned in one Slate is five. Therefore in such embodiment s the maximum number of challenges issued during an entire course may be 500.

This gives educators the flexibility to manage all types of courses from short seminar like courses to full fledged semester based courses using a single educational tool.

Students may request to be re assigned to a different group up to three times in a course by selecting a reassign me option. If a slot becomes available a student will be reassigned to a different group.

This function allows individual students to jump from one group to another without penalty and to do so anonymously. This allows students who are dissatisfied with the collaborative or competitive interaction to seek an environment more conducive to their individual needs. This will create a kind of Darwinian natural selection process whereby groups of people are optimized over time allowing for better collaborative and more competitive group teams. This will deepen the collaborative and competitive nature of the program and create a deeper understanding of the subject matter and better overall learning retention.

In at least one embodiment in the event that the number of individuals within a group drops below the number set by the educator s or drops below three students the group will automatically be abandoned and the students reassigned to other groups.

In at least one embodiment if a school drops below nine students the course will automatically be closed. This provides more efficient use of the method so that its full potential and efficiencies can be approximated. In other words it assures that the functionality of such embodiment s remain. It also provides a safety guard and transparency in cases where the program is ill suited to the subject matter educators are poorly trained in their use of the embodiment or students do not have or exhibit a high perceived value of the course or how it is conducted.

At least one embodiment can be used as a tool from longer to shorter time intervals depending upon the educator s preference. The following are two non limiting diverse examples of how such embodiment s may be used 

The ability to change the time specification between course stages allows the educator the option of designing courses that require very rapid collaborative and competitive processes leading to consensus results. It alternately allows longer time scales to accommodate a more thoughtful process. While the program methods are identical the underlying dynamics and results are different depending on time taken to complete the same one or more steps. In case of a faster process quicker development of challenge and rapid competition and or testing conditions students minds for creative agility. In case of a slower process students are conversely given time for increased levels of collaboration the ability to access outside resources and a deeper and more thoughtful analysis prior to offering results. Altering these time scales will be a key tool to be used by the educator depending on the subject matter and stage of the learning process. In an extreme form a fast program can be used as a competency assessment and testing modality.

Participation in at least one embodiment is governed by a simple three strike rule. Any student violating any three rules will be either expelled from the course or preferably will be shunted back to the group entrance examination section. Rules to maintain participation include any one or more of the non limiting following examples 

Educator s has have the option of implementing the three strike rule for each challenge or challenge slate or for the length of the course.

In at least one embodiment in the event that a member of a group is submitting non sense non responsive or lurid answers or being belligerent during chat room sessions the members of the group can request that this student be removed from the group. This can only occur with unanimous consensus of all group mates except the alleged abuser . This student will be reassigned to another group. If this student is blackballed from three groups he she will be expelled from the course. The blackballed student s username will be changed when transferred to the new group allowing them a fresh start.

A three strike rule allows for the program to automatically exclude students who are non participative or disruptive. Each of the following non limiting examples will be considered one strike a not submitting an initial result b not altering answers between stages c not voting at any stage d not logging onto the scheduled chat. Given that there are one or more of at least seven critical steps. These include 1 Initial answer 2 Review of group results and changing initial answer more characters 3 Voting for group consensus result 4 Participating in chat 5 Changing answer more characters 6 Voting for a classroom consensus result and 7 Voting for a school consensus result multiple votes possible Each requires active participation which provides fairness and balance and allows for more optimal social harmony among group members better collaboration and more competitive responses increasing learning and retention.

Rules built within at least one embodiment allow groups to exclude individual members from the group by having all group members vote to exclude this member. The excluded member will be anonymously reassigned to another group. This allows for another component of the Darwinian natural selection optimizing group interaction and collaborative environment and increase the competitiveness of individual groups and increasing learning and retention.

In at least one embodiment throughout the course the performance of individuals groups and classrooms are tabulated by and broadcast by a school scoreboard module . Rankings are visible by student group classroom and school.

In at least one embodiment the school scoreboard will be the first screen students see when logging on to the program.

In at least one embodiment the maximum number of groups and classrooms listed on the scoreboard may be 12. The twelve selected will be determined by voted rankings.

Posting on scoreboard and mandating that all students view scoreboard each time they log in provides transparency into how each group and each student is ranked among their peers. This provides an incentive to compete more vigorously. This also deepens the collaborative and competitive nature of the program and creates a deeper understanding of the subject matter and better overall learning retention.

This will provide transparency into how each student each group and each classroom is ranked among his her its peers. This provides an incentive to compete more vigorously. This also deepens the collaborative and competitive nature of the program and creates a deeper understanding of the subject matter and better overall learning retention.

Educator s responses to school consensus results will create transparency for those charged with evaluating the competency of educators. This allows administrators to more predictably identify good and poor performing educators providing remedial support where appropriate and increasing the efficiency of the overall educational systems by reassigning or eliminating ineffective educators increasing the overall effectiveness of educational systems.

At least one embodiment can be used as a testing media using live interactivity and competition among students to more accurately evaluate on demand functioning knowledge and to better evaluate a student s future learning capability. This could allow education systems better to select students over current standardized testing methods for scholastic program entrance will increase the competitiveness of the education process and create better performing working peoples and a more functional society.

In at least one embodiment once a course is set up by the educator s it can be run with as little or as much participation by the educator as deemed appropriate by the educator and administrator s . Once a course is optimized it can be fully automated allowing fewer educators to provide quality education to more students. This will increase the productivity and decrease the costs of administering education programs and educational systems.

After a single wave of such process es is complete and a school consensus is derived through the competitive and collaborative processes educator s will have the opportunity to respond to this result or slate of results. This allows the educator directly to address the students needs rather than giving a pre conceived lecture. The educator can focus directly on areas where the participants deficits lie and spend less time on areas where comprehension exists. This increases the effectiveness of the teaching process and better utilizes limited student to educator interaction. This also allows educators to craft subsequent challenges to best meet the needs of the participating students. As a result these embodiments drive critical thinking and creativity creating thoughtful and diverse short answer results leading to more comprehensive learning better learning retention and a more well rounded understanding of the subject matter which produces a better platform from which to use the educational subject matter in their lives.

Educators will not only have access to the consensus results they will have access to results of the process leading up to each group and each classroom consensus process for reaching these results. This will have multiple advantages such as a It allows educators to identify both high and low performing students b It provides the educator a better understanding of what areas of the subject matter the students lack comprehension allowing targeted remedial support c It also allows the educator the opportunity to spike programs with especially engaging short answer responses to spur both high and low performing students toward the most meaningful directions. These spiked responses can be invented by the educator or can be recycled using short answer responses from past programs.

At least one embodiment allows educators the wide verity of options from fully walk away automated program to being highly involved each step along the way by acting as phantom students in some or all groups. This gives the educator s the opportunity of crafting a highly interactive and cohesive educational discussion targeted at individual students and impacting all participants. This in turn drives critical thinking and creativity creating thoughtful and diverse short answer results leading to more comprehensive learning better learning retention and a more well rounded student understanding of the subject matter and therefore a better platform from which to use the educational subject matter in their lives.

Referring to one illustrative example of a method in at least one embodiment includes one or more of requiring students to read a chapter of physics regarding principles of light and then broadcasting a challenge that asks students to write short text answers to the question what is light . As seen each student in a group A I determines an individual answer that forms the basis of multiple collaborative group consensuses . Based on voting between multiple group answers multiple classroom consensuses are formed and a school consensus is determined based on majority vote among the three classrooms .
