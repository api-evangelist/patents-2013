This patent application is a continuation in part of and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 730 439 titled System and Method of Measuring a User s Influence in Social Networking Websites filed Nov. 27 2012. The entire disclosure of the afore mentioned patent application is incorporated by reference as if fully stated herein.

The present disclosure relates generally to a computer application software program for mobile phones and more specifically to an application program related to social networking websites wherein an individual s influence on social networking websites can be quantified based on his her quantitative and qualitative activity postings. A social networker may register any one or more social networking websites for which he she is a participant and the system and method discussed herein will measure all activity postings responses replies discussions third party use of the original activity postings and the like to generate weighted scores that are aggregated for an impact score that is reflective of the social networkers respective influence.

Micro blogging online or asynchronous discussions sharing of photos video clips and or music clips are common activity postings that social networkers engage in to which their friends contacts acquaintances followers relatives and the like collectively friends may respond favorably or unfavorably by posting comments likes dislikes etc. As such many social networkers exert influence on their friends and may not be aware of how influential their activities e.g. postings i.e. comments videos blogs TWEETS re TWEETS replies and the like are. This invention allows social networkers to measure their social impact among their sphere of friends based on their collective activity postings on all registered social networking websites generating a final impact score. The impact score is aggregated using several factors including but not limited to the number and quality of registered social networks participation level responses generated to postings comments replies and the like. For example a social networker who is very active on any one social networking site may still garner a higher impact score than an individual who has registered a plurality of social networking websites but has limited participation i.e. minimal activity on these social networks. Accordingly it can be appreciated that if social networker fails to actively participate on the registered social networking websites the social networker will accumulate a low impact score.

Computer implemented method comprises of maintaining at least one registration data file within a computer readable storage medium for receiving registration of at least one or more social networking websites for a social networker for measuring the social networker s collective influence on the registered at least one or more social networking websites step .

Method further comprises using the social networking application program for automatically collecting empirical data using a computer processor regarding the social networker s use and activity level for the registered at least one or more social networking websites step for example measuring the frequency of an activity posting by the social networker to the at least one or more registered social networking websites within a predetermined period step wherein the predetermined period may be set by the social networking application program or in some embodiments set by the social networker. In either event the predetermined period may include periods of days months or years thereby allowing social networker to make activity posting and sufficient time for the social networker to develop a following and or gain influence.

Method also comprises of using the social networking application program for determining number of responses to the activity posting step . Such responses include but are not limited to likes dislikes comments TWEETS and the like. Method also comprises using the social networking application program for measuring the length quantitative and qualitative discussion emanating from the social networker s activity posting step where for example the social network application takes various factors into consideration e.g. number of likes dislikes ratio of likes to dislikes of social networker s activity posting TWEETS re TWEETS and the like to determine the weighted discussion score that is aggregated into the final impact score .

Method further comprises using the social networking application program for measuring one or more third party s use of the social networker s activity posting step and assigning individual weighted scores for each quantitative and qualitative empirical data step by generating an impact score by tabulating an aggregate of the individual weighted scores derived from the plurality of weighted scores step and posting the impact score on a social networking website viewable by the social networker and a community of friends step .

Once social networking application program measures the various factors for the impact score it assigns individual weighted scores for each quantitative and qualitative empirical data for example the computer processor is configured for automatically assigning a weighted network score for the number of registered social networking websites . Some social networking websites are more popular than others and as such registration of popular social networking websites e.g. FACEBOOK may garner a higher weighted network score than e.g. MYSPACE . In this manner additional elements are taken into consideration for assigning the weighted network score other than the number of social networking websites registered.

Social networking application program is also configured for assigning a weighted frequency score for the measured frequency of activity posting within a predefined period of time e.g. number of days. Here too several factors are also taken into consideration e.g. activity posting on holidays where most social networkers may either spend quality time with families or submit activity posting to friends . Also factored into the weighted frequency score are expected activity posting during for example natural disasters exciting news events of public import e.g. 911 in New York for which one would expect a social networker to file an activity posting and for his her friends to spark a discussion . Absent such activity posting the weighted frequency score may be negatively affected.

Method further comprises of using the social networking application program for assigning a weighted response score for the number of responses to the social networker s activity posting and assigning a weighted discussion score based on factors that include but are not limited to the length quantitative and qualitative content of the discussion emanating from the social networker s activity posting . The social networking application program also operates as social networking website and as such any activity posts and discussions ensuing therefrom are also included in any tabulations of the social networker s impact score . Social networking application program is also configured for assigning a weighted use score for measured third party s use of the social networker s activity postings. For example re TWEETS copied activity posting e.g. video clips articles movie clips comments and the like when copied by others are monitored and noted and are factored into the weighted use score . The more third parties use social networker s activity posting the higher his her weighted use score will be.

Method also comprises using the social networking application program for displaying friend s impact score and the details comprising the impact score such that an individual may learn why a friend may have more or less influence in their social sphere than social networker. In some embodiments the details comprising the impact score are displayed in a graph charting the activity posting during the predetermined period of time.

In some embodiments the social networking application program is also configured for displaying the registered social networks or the impact score of social networker s friends in an elliptical format in a planetary arrangement with identifying icons from which any individual s friend s impact score can be viewed for details.
