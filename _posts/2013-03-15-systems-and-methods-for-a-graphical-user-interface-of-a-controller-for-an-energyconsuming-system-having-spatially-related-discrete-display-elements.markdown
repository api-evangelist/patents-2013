title: Systems and methods for a graphical user interface of a controller for an energy-consuming system having spatially related discrete display elements
abstract: Devices and methods are provided for generating and/or displaying a graphical user interface used to control an energy-consuming system, such as a heating, ventilation, or air conditioning (HVAC) system. Such an electronic device may include, for example, a processor that generates the graphical user interface and an electronic display that displays the graphical user interface. The graphical user interface may include a menu formed from discrete display elements that, owing to the way in which the discrete display elements are shifted into and out of view on the screen, appear to be spatially related to one another.

The commonly assigned patent applications noted in this application including all of those listed above are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety for all purposes. These applications are collectively referred to below as the commonly assigned incorporated applications. 

This disclosure relates to generating and displaying a graphical user interface with spatially related discrete display elements for controlling an energy consuming system such as a heating ventilation and or air conditioning HVAC system.

This section is intended to introduce the reader to various aspects of art that may be related to various aspects of the present techniques which are described and or claimed below. This discussion is believed to be helpful in providing the reader with background information to facilitate a better understanding of the various aspects of the present disclosure. Accordingly it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light and not as admissions of prior art.

While substantial effort and attention continues toward the development of newer and more sustainable energy supplies the conservation of energy by increased energy efficiency remains crucial to the world s energy future. According to an October 2010 report from the U.S. Department of Energy heating and cooling account for 56 of the energy use in a typical U.S. home making it the largest energy expense for most homes. Along with improvements in the physical plant associated with home heating and cooling e.g. improved insulation higher efficiency furnaces substantial increases in energy efficiency can be achieved by better control and regulation of home heating and cooling equipment. By activating heating ventilation and air conditioning HVAC equipment for judiciously selected time intervals and carefully chosen operating levels substantial energy can be saved while at the same time keeping the living space suitably comfortable for its occupants.

Historically however most known HVAC thermostatic control systems have tended to fall into one of two opposing categories neither of which is believed be optimal in most practical home environments. In a first category are many simple non programmable home thermostats each typically consisting of a single mechanical or electrical dial for setting a desired temperature and a single HEAT FAN OFF AC switch. While being easy to use for even the most unsophisticated occupant any energy saving control activity such as adjusting the nighttime temperature or turning off all heating cooling just before departing the home must be performed manually by the user. As such substantial energy saving opportunities are often missed for all but the most vigilant users. Moreover more advanced energy saving capabilities are not provided such as the ability for the thermostat to be programmed for less energy intensive temperature setpoints setback temperatures during planned intervals of non occupancy and for more comfortable temperature setpoints during planned intervals of occupancy.

In a second category on the other hand are many programmable thermostats which have become more prevalent in recent years in view of Energy Star US and TCO Europe standards and which have progressed considerably in the number of different settings for an HVAC system that can be individually manipulated. Unfortunately however users are often intimidated by a dizzying array of switches and controls laid out in various configurations on the face of the thermostat or behind a panel door on the thermostat and seldom adjust the manufacturer defaults to optimize their own energy usage. Thus even though the installed programmable thermostats in a large number of homes are technologically capable of operating the HVAC equipment with energy saving profiles it is often the case that only the one size fits all manufacturer default profiles are ever implemented in a large number of homes. Indeed in an unfortunately large number of cases a home user may permanently operate the unit in a temporary or hold mode manually manipulating the displayed set temperature as if the unit were a simple non programmable thermostat.

Proposals have been made for so called self programming thermostats including a proposal for establishing learned setpoints based on patterns of recent manual user setpoint entries as discussed in US20080191045A1 and including a proposal for automatic computation of a setback schedule based on sensed occupancy patterns in the home as discussed in G. Gao and K. Whitehouse The Self Programming Thermostat Optimizing Setback Schedules Based on Home Occupancy Patterns Proceedings of the First ACM Workshop on Embedded Sensing Systems for Energy Efficiency in Buildings pp. 67 72 Association for Computing Machinery November 2009 . It has been found however that crucial and substantial issues arise when it comes to the practical integration of self programming behaviors into mainstream residential and or business use issues that appear unaddressed and unresolved in such self programming thermostat proposals. By way of example just as there are many users who are intimidated by dizzying arrays of controls on user programmable thermostats there are also many users who would be equally uncomfortable with a thermostat that fails to give the user a sense of control and self determination over their own comfort or that otherwise fails to give confidence to the user that their wishes are indeed being properly accepted and carried out at the proper times. At a more general level because of the fact that human beings must inevitably be involved there is a tension that arises between i the amount of energy saving sophistication that can be offered by an HVAC control system and ii the extent to which that energy saving sophistication can be put to practical everyday use in a large number of homes. Similar issues arise in the context of multi unit apartment buildings hotels retail stores office buildings industrial buildings and more generally any living space or work space having one or more HVAC systems. It has been found that the user interface of a thermostat which so often seems to be an afterthought in known commercially available products represents a crucial link in the successful integration of self programming thermostats into widespread residential and business use and that even subtle visual and tactile cues can make a large difference in whether those efforts are successful.

Thus it would be desirable to provide a thermostat having an improved user interface that is simple intuitive elegant and easy to use such that the typical user is able to access many of the energy saving and comfort maintaining features while at the same time not being overwhelmed by the choices presented. It would be further desirable to provide a user interface for a self programming or learning thermostat that provides a user setup and learning instantiation process that is relatively fast and easy to complete while at the same time inspiring confidence in the user that their setpoint wishes will be properly respected. It would be still further desirable to provide a user interface for a self programming or learning thermostat that provides convenient access to the results of the learning algorithms and methods for fast intuitive alteration of scheduled setpoints including learned setpoints. It would be even further desirable to provide a user interface for a self programming or learning thermostat that provides insightful feedback and encouragement regarding energy saving behaviors performance and or results associated with the operation of the thermostat. Notably although one or more of the embodiments described infra is particularly advantageous when incorporated with a self programming or learning thermostat it is to be appreciated that their incorporation into non learning thermostats can be advantageous as well and is within the scope of the present teachings. Other issues arise as would be apparent to one skilled in the art upon reading the present disclosure.

A summary of certain embodiments disclosed herein is set forth below. It should be understood that these aspects are presented merely to provide the reader with a brief summary of these certain embodiments and that these aspects are not intended to limit the scope of this disclosure. Indeed this disclosure may encompass a variety of aspects that may not be set forth below.

Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to systems and methods for generating and or displaying a graphical user interface of an electronic device for controlling an energy consuming system such as a heating ventilation or air conditioning HVAC system. The electronic device may include a processor that generates the graphical user interface and an electronic display that displays the graphical user interface. The graphical user interface may include a menu formed from discrete display elements that owing to the way in which the discrete display elements are shifted into and out of view on the screen appear to be spatially related to one another. For example first and second discrete display elements may appear spatially related to one another when the first of the discrete display elements is shifted out of full view and the second of the discrete display elements is shifted into full view.

In another example a method for providing a graphical user interface of an electronic display of an electronic device that controls a heating ventilation or air conditioning HVAC system may include among other things displaying a screen of a first logical hierarchical level of the graphical user interface. The screen may include a user selectable option to enter a menu of a second logical hierarchical level of the graphical user interface. The second logical hierarchical level may be lower than the first logical hierarchical level. After receiving an indication of a user selection of the option to enter the menu a first discrete display element of the menu may be displayed on the electronic display. After receiving an indication of a user navigation from the first discrete display element of the menu to a second discrete display element of the menu the first discrete display element may be shifted out of full view on the electronic display while the second discrete display element is shifted into full view on the electronic display. The first discrete display element and the second discrete display element may appear to have a spatial relationship to one another at least while being shifted.

In a further example one or more tangible non transitory machine readable media may include instructions to be carried out on an electronic device that controls a heating ventilation or air conditioning HVAC system. The instructions may generate a screen of a navigable ordered series of screens of a graphical user interface configured to be displayed on an electronic display of the electronic device in which the ordered series of screens includes a first screen and a last screen and each is directly navigable to at least an immediately subsequent one or an immediately prior one of the ordered series of screens. Further each of the ordered series of screens includes a discrete display element. The instructions may also display the generated screen on the electronic display. In response to user input indicating a desire to navigate from the generated screen to another screen of the ordered series of screens the instructions may display an animated transition on the electronic display to provide an appearance of a spatial relationship between the respective discrete display elements of the at least one screen and the other screen.

Although being formed from a single lens like piece of material such as polycarbonate the cover has two different regions or portions including an outer portion and a central portion . According to some embodiments the cover is painted or smoked around the outer portion but leaves the central portion visibly clear so as to facilitate viewing of an electronic display disposed thereunderneath. According to some embodiments the curved cover acts as a lens that tends to magnify the information being displayed in electronic display to users. According to some embodiments the central electronic display is a dot matrix layout individually addressable such that arbitrary shapes can be generated rather than being a segmented layout. According to some embodiments a combination of dot matrix layout and segmented layout is employed. According to some embodiments central display is a backlit color liquid crystal display LCD . An example of information displayed on the electronic display is illustrated in and includes central numerals that are representative of a current setpoint temperature. According to some embodiments metallic portion has number of slot like openings so as to facilitate the use of a passive infrared motion sensor mounted therebeneath. The metallic portion can alternatively be termed a metallic front grille portion. Further description of the metallic portion front grille portion is provided in the commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 13 199 108 supra. The thermostat is preferably constructed such that the electronic display is at a fixed orientation and does not rotate with the outer ring so that the electronic display remains easily read by the user. For some embodiments the cover and metallic portion also remain at a fixed orientation and do not rotate with the outer ring . According to one embodiment in which the diameter of the thermostat is about 80 mm the diameter of the electronic display is about 45 mm. According to some embodiments an LED indicator is positioned beneath portion to act as a low power consuming indicator of certain status conditions. For example the LED indicator can be used to display blinking red when a rechargeable battery of the thermostat see infra is very low and is being recharged. More generally the LED indicator can be used for communicating one or more status codes or error codes by virtue of red color green color various combinations of red and green various different blinking rates and so forth which can be useful for troubleshooting purposes.

Motion sensing as well as other techniques can be use used in the detection and or predict of occupancy as is described further in the commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 12 881 430 supra. According to some embodiments occupancy information is used in generating an effective and efficient scheduled program. Preferably an active proximity sensor A is provided to detect an approaching user by infrared light reflection and an ambient light sensor B is provided to sense visible light. The proximity sensor A can be used to detect proximity in the range of about one meter so that the thermostat can initiate waking up when the user is approaching the thermostat and prior to the user touching the thermostat. Such use of proximity sensing is useful for enhancing the user experience by being ready for interaction as soon as or very soon after the user is ready to interact with the thermostat. Further the wake up on proximity functionality also allows for energy savings within the thermostat by sleeping when no user interaction is taking place our about to take place. The ambient light sensor B can be used for a variety of intelligence gathering purposes such as for facilitating confirmation of occupancy when sharp rising or falling edges are detected because it is likely that there are occupants who are turning the lights on and off and such as for detecting long term e.g. 24 hour patterns of ambient light intensity for confirming and or automatically establishing the time of day.

According to some embodiments for the combined purposes of inspiring user confidence and further promoting visual and functional elegance the thermostat is controlled by only two types of user input the first being a rotation of the outer ring as shown in referenced hereafter as a rotate ring or ring rotation input and the second being an inward push on an outer cap see until an audible and or tactile click occurs referenced hereafter as an inward click or simply click input . For the embodiment of the outer cap is an assembly that includes all of the outer ring cover electronic display and metallic portion . When pressed inwardly by the user the outer cap travels inwardly by a small amount such as 0.5 mm against an interior metallic dome switch not shown and then springably travels back outwardly by that same amount when the inward pressure is released providing a satisfying tactile click sensation to the user s hand along with a corresponding gentle audible clicking sound. Thus for the embodiment of an inward click can be achieved by direct pressing on the outer ring itself or by indirect pressing of the outer ring by virtue of providing inward pressure on the cover metallic portion or by various combinations thereof. For other embodiments the thermostat can be mechanically configured such that only the outer ring travels inwardly for the inward click input while the cover and metallic portion remain motionless. It is to be appreciated that a variety of different selections and combinations of the particular mechanical elements that will travel inwardly to achieve the inward click input are within the scope of the present teachings whether it be the outer ring itself some part of the cover or some combination thereof. However it has been found particularly advantageous to provide the user with an ability to quickly go back and forth between registering ring rotations and inward clicks with a single hand and with minimal amount of time and effort involved and so the ability to provide an inward click directly by pressing the outer ring has been found particularly advantageous since the user s fingers do not need to be lifted out of contact with the device or slid along its surface in order to go between ring rotations and inward clicks. Moreover by virtue of the strategic placement of the electronic display centrally inside the rotatable ring a further advantage is provided in that the user can naturally focus their attention on the electronic display throughout the input process right in the middle of where their hand is performing its functions. The combination of intuitive outer ring rotation especially as applied to but not limited to the changing of a thermostat s setpoint temperature conveniently folded together with the satisfying physical sensation of inward clicking together with accommodating natural focus on the electronic display in the central midst of their fingers activity adds significantly to an intuitive seamless and downright fun user experience. Further descriptions of advantageous mechanical user interfaces and related designs which are employed according to some embodiments can be found in U.S. Ser. No. 13 033 573 supra U.S. Ser. No. 29 386 021 supra and U.S. Ser. No. 13 199 108 supra.

According to some embodiments the thermostat includes a processing system display driver and a wireless communications system . The processing system is adapted to cause the display driver and display area to display information to the user and to receiver user input via the rotatable ring . The processing system according to some embodiments is capable of carrying out the governance of the operation of thermostat including the user interface features described herein. The processing system is further programmed and configured to carry out other operations as described further hereinbelow and or in other ones of the commonly assigned incorporated applications. For example processing system is further programmed and configured to maintain and update a thermodynamic model for the enclosure in which the HVAC system is installed such as described in U.S. Ser. No. 12 881 463 supra. According to some embodiments the wireless communications system is used to communicate with devices such as personal computers and or other thermostats or HVAC system components which can be peer to peer communications communications through one or more servers located on a private network or and or communications through a cloud based service.

Backplate includes electronics and a temperature humidity sensor in housing which are ventilated via vents . Two or more temperature sensors not shown are also located in the head unit and cooperate to acquire reliable and accurate room temperature data. Wire connectors are provided to allow for connection to HVAC system wires. Connection terminal provides electrical connections between the head unit and backplate . Backplate electronics also includes power sharing circuitry for sensing and harvesting power available power from the HVAC system circuitry.

According to some embodiments the transitions between some screens use a coin flip transition and or a translation or shifting of displayed elements as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 033 573 supra. The animated coin flip transition between progressions of thermostat display screens which is also illustrated in the commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 29 399 625 supra has been found to be advantageous in providing a pleasing and satisfying user experience not only in terms of intrinsic visual delight but also because it provides a unique balance between logical segregation a sense that one is moving on to something new and logical flow a sense of connectedness and causation between the previous screen and the next screen . Although the type of transitions may not all be labeled in the figures herein it is understood that different types of screen to screen transitions could be used so as to enhance the user interface experience for example by indicating to the user a transition to a different step or setting or a return to a previous screen or menu.

In screen the user proceeds to the connection setup steps by selecting CONNECT with the rotatable ring followed by an inward click. Selecting CONNECT causes the thermostat to scan for wireless networks and then to display screen in . If the user selects SKIP then screen is displayed which informs the user that they can connect at any time from the settings menu. The user acknowledges this by clicking which leads to screen . In screen the first step Internet Connection is greyed out which indicates that this step has been intentionally skipped.

In screen is shown after a scan is made for wireless networks e.g. using Wi Fi or ZigBee wireless communication . In the example shown in screen two wireless networks have been found and are displayed Network2 and Network3. The electronic display preferably also includes a lock icon to show that the network uses password security and also can show a wireless icon to indicate the wireless connection to the network. According to some embodiments wireless signal icon can show a number of bars that indicates relative signal strength associated with that network. If the user selects one of the found networks that requires a password screen is displayed to obtain the password from the user. Screen uses an alphanumeric input interface where the user selects and enters characters by rotating the ring and clicking. Further details of this type of data entry interface is described in the commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 13 033 573 supra. The user is reminded that a password is being entered by virtue of the lock icon . After the password is entered screen is displayed while the thermostat tries to establish a connection to the indicated Wi Fi network. If the network connection is established and the internet is available then the thermostat attempts to connect to the manufacturer s server. A successful connection to the server is shown in screen . After a pause or a click to acknowledge screen is displayed that indicates that the internet connection setup step has been successfully completed. According to some embodiments a checkmark icon is used to indicate successful completion of the step.

If no connection to the selected local network could be established screen is displayed notifying the user of such and asking if a network testing procedure should be carried out. If the user selects TEST then screen with a spinner icon is displayed while a network test is carried out. If the test discovers an error a screen such as screen is displayed to indicate the nature of the errors. According to some embodiments the user is directed to further resources online for more detailed support.

If the local network connection was successful but no connection to the manufacturer s server could be established then in screen the user is notified of the status and acknowledges by clicking CONTINUE. In screen the user is asked if they wish to try a different network. If the user selects NETWORK then the thermostat scans for available networks and then moves to screen . If the user selects SKIP then screen is displayed.

Under some circumstances for example following a network test screen the system determines that a software and or firmware update is needed. In such cases screen is displayed while the update process is carried out. Since some processes such as downloading and installing updates can take a relatively long time a notice combined with a spinner having a percent indicator can be shown to keep the user informed of the progress. Following the update the system usually needs to be rebooted. Screen informs the user of this.

According to some embodiments in cases where more than one thermostat is located in the same dwelling or business location the units can be associated with one another as both being paired to the user s account on a cloud based management server. When a successful network and server connection is established screen and if the server notes that there is already an online account associated with the current location by comparison of a network address of the thermostat with that of other currently registered thermostats then screen is displayed asking the user if they want to add the current thermostat to the existing account. If the user selects ADD the thermostat is added to the existing account as shown in screens and . After adding the current thermostat to the online account. If there is more than one thermostat on the account a procedure is offered to copy settings beginning with screen . In screen notifies the user that another thermostat in this case named Living Room is also associated with the user s account and asks the user if the settings should be copies. If the user selects COPY SETTINGS then the screen is displayed with a spinner while settings are copied to the new thermostat. According to some embodiments one or more of the following settings are copied account pairing learning preferences e.g. learning on or learning off heating or cooling mode if feasible location setup interview answers current schedule and off season schedule if any .

Advantageous functionalities can be provided by two different instances of the thermostat unit located in a common enclosure such as a family home that are associated with a same user account in the cloud based management server such as the account tomsmith3 mailhost.com in . For purposes of the present description it can be presumed that each thermostat is a primary thermostat characterized in that it is connected to an HVAC system and is responsible for controlling that HVAC system which can be distinguished from an auxiliary thermostat having many of the same sensing and processing capabilities of the thermostat except that an auxiliary thermostat does not connect to an HVAC system but rather influences the operation of one or more HVAC systems by virtue of its direct or indirect communication with one or more primary thermostats. However the scope of the present disclosure is not so limited and thus in other embodiments there can be cooperation among various combinations of primary and or auxiliary thermostats.

A particular enclosure such as a family home can use two primary thermostats where there are two different HVAC systems to control such as a downstairs HVAC system located on a downstairs floor and an upstairs HVAC system located on an upstairs floor. Where the thermostats have become logically associated with a same user account at the cloud based management server such as by operation of the screens the two thermostats advantageously cooperate with one another in providing optimal HVAC control of the enclosure as a whole. Such cooperation between the two thermostats can be direct peer to peer cooperation or can be supervised cooperation in which the central cloud based management server supervises them as one or more of a master referee mediator arbitrator and or messenger on behalf of the two thermostats. In one example an enhanced auto away capability is provided wherein an away mode of operation is invoked only if both of the thermostats have sensed a lack of activity for a requisite period of time. For one embodiment each thermostat will send an away state vote to the management server if it has detected inactivity for the requisite period but will not go into an away state until it receives permission to do so from the management server. In the meantime each thermostat will send a revocation of its away state vote if it detects occupancy activity in the enclosure. The central management server will send away state permission to both thermostats only if there are current away state votes from each of them. Once in the collective away state if either thermostat senses occupancy activity that thermostat will send a revocation to the cloud based management server which in turn will send away state permission revocation or an arrival command to both of the thermostats. Many other types of cooperation among the commonly paired thermostats i.e. thermostats associated with the same account at the management server can be provided without departing from the scope of the present teachings.

Where there is more than one thermostat for a particular enclosure and those thermostats are associated with the same account on the cloud based management server one preferred method by which that group of thermostats can cooperate to provide enhanced auto away functionality is as follows. Each thermostat maintains a group state information object that includes i a local auto away ready AAR flag that reflects whether that individual thermostat considers itself to be auto away ready and ii one or more peer auto away ready AAR flags that reflect whether each other thermostat in the group considers itself to be auto away ready. The local AAR flag for each thermostat appears as a peer AAR flag in the group state information object of each other thermostat in the group. Each thermostat is permitted to change its own local AAR flag but is only permitted to read its peer AAR flags. It is a collective function of the central cloud based management server and the thermostats to communicate often enough such that the group state information object in each thermostat is maintained with fresh information and in particular that the peer AAR flags are kept fresh. This can be achieved for example by programming each thermostat to immediately communicate any change in its local AAR flag to the management server at which time the management server can communicate that change immediately with each other thermostat in the group to update the corresponding peer AAR flag. Other methods of direct peer to peer communication among the thermostats can also be used without departing from the scope of the present teachings.

According to a preferred embodiment the thermostats operate in a consensus mode such that each thermostat will only enter into an actual away state if all of the AAR flags for the group are set to yes or ready . Therefore at any particular point in time either all of the thermostats in the group will be in an away state or none of them will be in the away state. In turn each thermostat is configured and programmed to set its AAR flag to yes if either or both of two sets of criteria are met. The first set of criteria is met when all of the following are true i there has been a period of sensed inactivity for a requisite inactivity interval according to that thermostat s sensors such as its passive infrared PIR motion sensors active infrared proximity sensors PROX and other occupancy sensors with which it may be equipped ii the thermostat is auto away confident in that it has previously qualified itself as being capable of sensing statistically meaningful occupant activity at a statistically sufficient number of meaningful times and iii other basic reasonableness criteria for going into an auto away mode are met such as a the auto away function was not previously disabled by the user b the time is between 8 AM and 8 PM if the enclosure is not a business c the thermostat is not in OFF mode d the away state temperature is more energy efficient than the current setpoint temperature and e the user is not interacting with the thermostat remotely through the cloud based management server. The second set of criteria is met when all of the following are true i there has been a period of sensed inactivity for a requisite inactivity interval according to that thermostat s sensors ii the AAR flag of at least one other thermostat in the group is yes and iii the above described reasonableness criteria are all met. Advantageously by special virtue of the second set of alternative criteria by which an individual thermostat can set its AAR flag to yes it can be the case that all of the thermostats in the group can contribute the benefits of their occupancy sensor data to the group auto away determination even where one or more of them are not auto away confident as long as there is at least one member that is auto away confident. This method has been found to increase both the reliability and scalability of the energy saving auto away feature with reliability being enhanced by virtue of multiple sensor locations around the enclosure and with scalability being enhanced in that the misplacement of one thermostat for example installed at an awkward location behind a barrier that limits PIR sensitivity causing that thermostat to be away non confident will not jeopardize the effectiveness or applicability of the group consensus as a whole.

It is to be appreciated that the above described method is readily extended to the case where there are multiple primary thermostats and or multiple auxiliary thermostats. It is to be further appreciated that as the term primary thermostat is used herein it is not required that there be a one to one correspondence between primary thermostats and distinct HVAC systems in the enclosure. For example there are many installations in which plural zones in the enclosure may be served by a single HVAC system by virtue of controllable dampers that can stop and or redirect airflow to and among the different zones from the HVAC system. In such cases there can be a primary thermostat for each zone each of the primary thermostats being wired to the HVAC system as well as to the appropriate dampers to regulate the climate of its respective zone.

Referring now again to in screen a name is entered for the thermostat assuming the thermostat is being installed in a dwelling rather than in a business. The list of choices is larger than the screen allows so according to some embodiments the list scrolls up and down responsive to user ring rotation so the user can view all the available choices. For purposes of clarity of description it is to be appreciated that when a listing of menu choices is illustrated in the drawings of the present disclosure as going beyond the spatial limits of a screen such as shown with listing of screen those menu choices will automatically scroll up and down as necessary to be viewable by the user as they rotate the rotatable ring . The available choices of names in this case are shown including an option to enter a custom name by selecting TYPE NAME . The first entry Nest 2 is a generic thermostat name and assumes there is already a thermostat on the account named Nest 1. If there already is a Nest 2 thermostat then the name Nest 3 will be offered and so on. If the user selects TYPE NAME then a character entry user interface is used to enter a name. Screen shows a thermostat naming screen analogous to screen except that is represents a case in which the thermostat is being installed in a business rather than a dwelling. Screen is displayed when thermostat learning or self programming features are turned on. In this case the user is asked if the current schedule from the other thermostat should be copied. Screens and show what is displayed after completion of the Internet connection server connection and pairing procedures are completed. Screen is used in the case there an Internet connection is established but no pairing is made with a user account on the server. Screen is used in the case where both an Internet connection and pairing the user s account on the server is established. Finally screen is used in the case where no internet connection was successfully established. In all cases the next setup topic is Heating and Cooling. 

If the user selects HEATING at screen then in screen the user is asked to set a low energy using away heating temperature that should be maintained when the home or business is unoccupied. According to some embodiments the default value offered to the user is 65 degrees F. the maximum value selectable by the user is 75 degrees F. the minimum value selectable is 55 degrees F. and a leaf or other suitable energy savings encouragement indicator is displayed when the user selects a value below 63 degrees F. Screens and show examples of the user inputting 63 and 62 degrees respectively. According to some embodiments a schedule is then created while the screen is displayed to the user.

According to some alternate embodiments parameters other than simply the difference in current to setpoint temperature can be used in displaying background colors and intensity. For example time to temp the estimated amount of time it will take to reach the current setpoint temperature amount of energy and or cost if accurately known can also be used alone or in combination determine which color and how intense or opaque is used for the background of the thermostat display.

According to some preferred embodiments the characters and other graphics are mainly displayed in white overlying the black orange or blue backgrounds as described above. Other colors for certain displayed features such green for the leaf logo are also used according to some embodiments. Although many of the screens shown and described herein are provided in the accompanying drawings with black characters and graphics overlaying a white background for purposes of clarity and print reproduction it is to be understood that the use of white or colored graphics and characters over black and colored backgrounds such is generally preferable for enhancing the user experience particularly for embodiments where the electronic display is a backlit dot matrix LCD display similar to those used on handheld smartphones and touchpad computers. Notably although the presently described color schemes have been found to be particularly effective it is to be appreciated that the scope of the present teachings is not necessarily so limited and that other impactful schemes could be developed for other types of known or hereinafter developed electronic display technologies e.g. e ink electronic paper displays organic LED displays etc. in view of the present description without departing from the scope of the present teachings.

In screen has a red orange background color with white central numerals indicating the current setpoint of 72 degrees F. The current setpoint of 72 degrees is also shown by the large tick mark . The current ambient temperature is 70 degrees as shown by the small numerals and the tick mark . Other tick marks in a circular arrangement are shown in a more transparent or more muted white color to give the user a sense of the range of adjustments and temperatures in keeping with the circular design of the thermostat display area and rotatable ring. According to some embodiments the circular arrangement of background tick marks are sized and spaced apart so that 180 tick marks would complete a circle but 40 tick marks are skipped at the bottom such that a maximum of 140 tick marks are displayed. The setpoint tick mark and the current temperature tick mark may replace some the of the background tick marks such that not all of the background tick marks are displayed. Additionally the current temperature is displayed numerically using numerals which can also be overlaid or displayed in muted or transparent fashion over the background tick marks. According to some embodiments so as to accentuate visibility the setpoint tick mark is displayed in 100 opacity or 0 transparency is sized such that it extends 20 farther towards the display center than the background tick marks and is further emphasized by the adjacent background tick marks not being displayed. According to some embodiments a time to temperature display is used to indicate the estimated time needed to reach the current setpoint as is described more fully co pending commonly assigned patent application U.S. Ser. No. 12 984 602. shows a screen which displays a HEAT TO message indicating that the HVAC system is in heating mode although currently is not active HEATING will be displayed when the HVAC system is active . According to some embodiments the background color of screen is a neutral color such as black. A fan logo can be displayed indicating the fan is active without any associated heating or cooling. Further a lock icon can be displayed when the thermostat is locked. shows a screen which has the message COOLING indicating that cooling is being called for in addition to a background color such as blue. In this case the message COOLING is displayed instead of the time to temp display since there may be low confidence in the time to temp number may such as due to insufficient data for a more accurate estimation . In screen shows an example similar to screen but with the time to temp displayed instead of message indicating that there is a higher confidence in the time to temp estimation. Note that the background color of screen and are bluish so as to indicate HVAC cooling is active although the color may be partially muted or partially transparent since the current setpoint temperature and current ambient temperature is relatively close.

According to some embodiments to facilitate the protection of compressor equipment from damage such as with conventional cooling compressors or with heat pump heating compressors the thermostat prevents re activation of a compressor within a specified time period lockout period from de activation so as to avoid compressor damage that can occur if the de activation to re activation interval is too short. For example the thermostat can be programmed to prevent re activation of the compressor within a lockout interval of 2 minutes after de activation regardless of what happens with the current ambient temperature and or current setpoint temperature within that lockout interval. Longer or shorter lockout periods can be provided with 2 minutes being just one example of a typical lockout period. During this lockout period according to some embodiments a message such as message in screen of is displayed which provides a visually observable countdown until the end of the lockout interval so as to keep the user informed and avoid confusion on the user s part as to why the compressor has not yet started up again.

According to some embodiments a manual setpoint change will be active until an effective time of the next programmed setpoint. For example if at 2 38 PM the user walks up to the thermostat and rotates the outer ring see supra to manually adjust the setpoint to 68 degrees F. and if the thermostat has a programmed schedule containing a setpoint that is supposed to take effect at 4 30 PM with a setpoint temperature that is different than 68 degrees F. then the manual setpoint temperature change will only be effective until 4 30 PM. According to some embodiments a message such as message till 4 30 PM will be displayed on screen in which informs the user that their setpoint of 68 degrees F. will be in effect until 4 30 PM.

According to a preferred embodiment all of the operational screens of the thermostat described herein that correspond to normal everyday operations such as the screens of will actually only appear when the proximity sensor A see supra indicates the presence of a user or occupant in relatively close proximity e.g. 50 cm 200 cm or closer to the thermostat and the electronic display will otherwise be dark. While the user is proximal to the thermostat the electronic display will remain active and when the user walks away out of proximity the electronic display will remain active for a predetermined period of time such as 20 seconds and then will go dark. In contrast to an alternative of keeping the electronic display active all of the time this selective turn on and turn off of the electronic display has been found to be a preferable method of operation for several reasons including the savings of electrical power that would otherwise be needed for an always on electronic display extension of the hardware life of the electronic display and also aesthetic reasons for domestic installations. The savings of electrical power is particularly advantageous for installations in which there is no C wire provided by the HVAC system since it will often be the case that the average power that can safely obtained from power stealing methods will be less than the average power used by a visually pleasing hardware implementation of the electronic display when active. Advantageously by designing the thermostat with the rechargeable battery and programming its operation such that the electronic display will only be active when there is a proximal viewer the electronic display itself can be selected and sized to be bright bold informative and visually pleasing even where such operation takes more instantaneous average electrical power than the power stealing can provide because the rechargeable battery can be used to provide the excess power needed for active display and then can be recharged during periods of lesser power usage when the display is not active. This is to be contrasted with many known prior art electronic thermostats whose displays are made very low power and less visually pleasing in order to keep the thermostat s instantaneous power usage at budget power stealing levels. Notably it is also consistent with the aesthetics of many home environments not to have a bright and bold display on at all times such as for cases in which the thermostat is located in a bedroom or in a media viewing room such as a television room. The screens of can be considered as the main display for thermostat in that these are the screens that are most often shown to the user as they walk up to the thermostat in correspondence with normal everyday operation.

According to one embodiment the thermostat is programmed and configured such that upon the detection of a working C wire at device installation and setup the user is automatically provided with a menu choice during the setup interview and then revised later at any time through the settings menu whether they would like the electronic display to be on all the time or only upon detection of a proximal user. If a C wire is not detected that menu choice is not provided. A variety of alternative display activation choices can also be provided such as allowing the user to set an active display timeout interval e.g. how long the display remains active after the user has walked away allowing the user to choose a functionality similar to night lighting or safety lighting i.e. upon detection of darkness in the room by the ambient light sensor B the display will be always on and other useful functionalities. According to yet another embodiment if the presence of a C wire is not detected the thermostat will automatically test the power stealing circuitry to see how much power can be tapped without tripping the call relay s and if that amount is greater than a certain threshold then the display activation menu choices are provided but if that amount is less than the certain threshold the display activation menu choices are not provided.

Screen has a central disk indicating the name of the sub menu in this case the Fan mode. Some sub menus only contain a few options which can be selected or toggled among by inward clicking alone. For example the Fan sub menu only has two settings automatic shown in screen and always on shown in screen . In this case the fan mode is changed by inward clicking which simply toggles between the two available options. Ring rotation shifts to the next or previous settings sub menu item. Thus rotating the ring from the fan sub menu shift to the system on off sub menu shown in screens in the case of system ON and in the case of system OFF . The system on off sub menu is another example of simply toggling between the two available options using the inward click user input.

In screen is the top level of the lock sub menu. If the thermostat is connected and paired i.e. has Internet access and is appropriately paired with a user account on a cloud based server an inward click will lead to screen . At screen the user can vary the highlighting between the displayed selections by rotating the rotatable ring and then can select the currently displayed menu item by inward clicking the rotatable ring . If LOCKED is selected then the user is asked to enter a locking PIN in screen . If the thermostat is already locked then screen is displayed instead of screen . If the thermostat is unlocked then a PIN confirmation is requested such as in screen . If the confirmation PIN does not match then the user is asked to enter a new PIN in screen . If the confirmation PIN matches then the temperature limits are set in screens and or in . The described locking capability can be useful in a variety of contexts such as where a parent desires the limit the ability of their teenager to set the temperature too high in winter or too low in summer. According to some embodiments locking of the thermostat is not permitted if the thermostat is not connected to the Internet or is not paired to an account so that an online backup method of unlocking the thermostat is available should the user forget the PIN number. In such case if the thermostat is not connected to the Internet then screen is displayed and if the thermostat is not paired then screen is displayed.

Upon user ring rotation at screen screen is displayed which allows entry to the auto away sub menu. Screen asks if the auto away feature should be active. Screen notifies the user about the auto away feature. Screen is an example showing the user the status of training and or confidence in the occupancy sensors. Other examples instead of screen include TOO LOW FOR AUTO AWAY and ENOUGH FOR AUTO AWAY as appropriate.

In screen shows an example of a wiring warning which is denoted by a yellow or otherwise highlighted disk next to the connector terminal label cool . An inward click input leads to an explanation of the warning in this case being an error in which there is a wire insertion detected at terminal Y1 but no electronic signature consistent with a cooling system can be sensed. Note that the wiring warning shown in this example is not serious enough to block operation. However some wiring errors are serious enough such that HVAC operation is blocked. An example is shown in screen where the wires are detected on the C and Rc terminals but no power is detected. A red disk appears next to the terminal connected labeled cool which indicates a wiring error. Clicking leads to an explanation screen and a notification screen followed by a mandatory thermostat shut down blank screen . Examples of detected wiring warnings that do not block operation and wiring errors that block operation are discussed supra with respect to .

According to some embodiments timewise navigation within the week long schedule is accomplished using the rotatable ring shown in . Rotating the ring clockwise shifts the schedule in one direction such as in screen which is moves forward in time i.e. the schedule plot area shifts to the left relative to the centrally located current schedule time cursor bar and the analog clock spins forward in displayed time . Rotating the ring counter clockwise does the opposite as shown in screen shifting the schedule backwards in time i.e. the schedule plot area shifts to the right relative to the centrally located current schedule time cursor bar and the analog clock spins backward in displayed time . According to some preferred embodiments the schedule time adjustment using the rotatable ring is acceleration based. That is the speed that the schedule time is adjusted is based on the speed of rotation of the ring such that detailed adjustments in the current schedule time can be made by slowly rotating the ring while shifts from day to day or over multiple days can be made by rapidly rotating the ring. According to some embodiments the difference in acceleration rate factor is about 4 to 1 between the fastest and slowest rotating speeds to achieve both adequate precision and easy movement between days or to the end of the week. Screen shows an example of more rapid movement of the rotatable ring where the schedule has been shifted at a higher rate factor than in screen . According to some embodiments the schedule time adjustments are accompanied by audible click sound or other noise to provide further feedback and further enhance the user interface experience. According to some preferred embodiments the audible clicks correspond to each 15 minutes of schedule time that passes the time cursor bar .

If the time cursor bar is not positioned on an existing setpoint such as shown in screen and an inward click is received a create new setpoint option will be offered as in screen of . In screen if the user selects NEW then a new setpoint disk will appear on the time cursor bar as shown in screen . For some embodiments this birth of the new setpoint disk proceeds by virtue of an animation similar to that illustrated in the commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 29 399 637 supra wherein as soon as the user clicks on NEW a very small disk much smaller than the disk at screen appears near the top of the cursor bar and then progressively grows into its full size version as it visibly slides downward to land at a vertical location corresponding to a starting temperature setpoint value. For some embodiments the starting temperature setpoint value is equal to that of an immediately preceding setpoint in the schedule. Rotating the ring will then adjust the setpoint temperature of the new setpoint disk upward or downward from that starting temperature setpoint value. According to some embodiments an energy savings encouragement indicator such as the leaf logo is displayed when the new setpoint temperature corresponds to energy saving and or cost saving parameters which aids the user in making energy saving decisions. Once the temperature for the new setpoint is satisfactory an inward click allows adjustment of the setpoint time via the rotatable ring as shown in screen . Once the start time for the new setpoint is satisfactory another inward click establishes the new setpoint as shown in screen . If the time cursor bar is positioned on an existing setpoint such as shown in screen an inward click brings up a menu screen in which the user can choose to change the setpoint remove the setpoint or return out of the schedule viewer editor. If the user selects CHANGE then the user can make adjustments to the temperature and start time similar to the methods shown in screens and respectively.

According to some embodiments setpoints must be created on even quarter hours i.e. on the hour or 15 30 or 45 minutes past and two setpoints cannot be created or moved to be less than 60 minutes apart. Although the examples shown herein display a week long schedule according to other embodiments other time periods can be used for the displayed schedule such as daily 3 day two weeks etc.

As illustrated in the user can perform a ring rotation to change the setpoint with showing a new setpoint of 73 degrees along with a shift in the setpoint tick mark to a different arc location representative of the higher setpoint and with a current temperature tick mark and current temperature numerical display appearing as shown. As with other embodiments there is preferably a sweeping visual display of tick marks not illustrated in that sweeps from the current temperature tick mark to the setpoint temperature tick mark analogous to the tick mark sweep shown in supra. With the exception of the differently implemented ring rotation facility and the changing of various display layouts to conform to the rectangular electronic display screen operation of the thermostat is preferably similar to that of the circularly shaped thermostat embodiments described supra. Thus by way of non limiting example the thermostat is configured to provide a menu options screen not shown on electronic display that contains menu options such as Heat Cool Schedule Energy Settings Away and Done and to function similarly to that shown in responsive to rotation of the belt style rotatable ring with the exception that instead of the electronically displayed words moving around in a circular trajectory those words move around in a rectangular trajectory along the periphery of the electronic display .

Although the foregoing has been described in some detail for purposes of clarity it will be apparent that certain changes and modifications may be made without departing from the principles thereof. By way of example it is within the scope of the present teachings for the rotatable ring of the above described thermostat to be provided in a virtual static or solid state form instead of a mechanical form whereby the outer periphery of the thermostat body contains a touch sensitive material similar to that used on touchpad computing displays and smartphone displays. For such embodiments the manipulation by the user s hand would be a swipe across the touch sensitive material rather than a literal rotation of a mechanical ring the user s fingers sliding around the periphery but not actually causing mechanical movement. This form of user input which could be termed a virtual ring rotation static ring rotation solid state ring rotation or a rotational swipe would otherwise have the same purpose and effect of the above described mechanical rotations but would obviate the need for a mechanical ring on the device. Although not believed to be as desirable as a mechanically rotatable ring insofar as there may be a lesser amount of tactile satisfaction on the part of the user such embodiments may be advantageous for reasons such as reduced fabrication cost. By way of further example it is within the scope of the present teachings for the inward mechanical pressability or inward click functionality of the rotatable ring to be provided in a virtual or solid state form instead of a mechanical form whereby an inward pressing effort by the user s hand or fingers is detected using internal solid state sensors for example solid state piezoelectric transducers coupled to the outer body of the thermostat. For such embodiments the inward pressing by the user s hand or fingers would not cause actual inward movement of the front face of the thermostat as with the above described embodiments but would otherwise have the same purpose and effect as the above described inward clicks of the rotatable ring. Optionally an audible beep or clicking sound can be provided from an internal speaker or other sound transducer to provide feedback that the user has sufficiently pressed inward on the rotatable ring or virtual solid state rotatable ring. Although not believed to be as desirable as the previously described embodiments whose inwardly moving rotatable ring and sheet metal style rebounding mechanical click has been found to be particularly satisfying to users such embodiments may be advantageous for reasons including reduced fabrication cost. It is likewise within the scope of the present teachings for the described thermostat to provide both the ring rotations and inward clicks in virtual or solid state form whereby the overall device could be provided in fully solid state form with no moving parts at all.

By way of further example although described above as having ring rotations and inward clicks as the exclusive user input modalities which has been found particularly advantageous in terms of device elegance and simplicity it is nevertheless within the scope of the present teachings to alternatively provide the described thermostat with an additional button such as a back button. In one option the back button could be provided on the side of the device such as described in the commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 13 033 573 supra. In other embodiments plural additional buttons such as a menu button and so forth could be provided on the side of the device. For one embodiment the actuation of the additional buttons would be fully optional on the part of the user that is the device could still be fully controlled using only the ring rotations and inward clicks. However for users that really want to use the menu and back buttons because of the habits they may have formed with other computing devices such as smartphones and the like the device would accommodate and respond accordingly to such menu and back button inputs.

According to some embodiments the future scheduled program and or historical information are accessed by the user via a inward click. shows the thermostat immediately following an inward click. The information that was previously displayed showing the current status in this case the current temperature of 72 is shrunk down in size as shown by the dotted ring in . Note that if the current status had shown current heating or cooling such as with alternative colors the color and set point temperature would be displayed in the area within dotted ring of . The two partial circles and on the left and right sides of circle respectively indicate to the user that another screen lies to the left and right that can be accessed via rotating the ring .

According to some embodiments the scheduled program can be edited by a user. From any of the displayed programmed set points such as shown in screen in an inward click is used to indicate the desire to edit the set point. In response to an inward click the white inner circle expands to fill the display area as shown in . The set point temperature indicated by numerals also blinks that indicates to the user the value that will be altered by rotating ring . When the desired set point temperature is set using the ring another inward click will advance to . In the time blinking and is adjusted using the rotating ring . When the desired set point temperature is set using the ring another inward click will advance to . In the user uses the rotating ring to select one of four choices lists. The selected choice is highlighted in black or a different suitable contrasting color or using an outline. The choices shown in are DONE which will accept the changes and take the user back to the displayed schedule screen shown in ADD NEW SET POINT which will add a new programmed set point change for the given day DELETE SET POINT which sill delete the current programmed set point and CANCEL which will return the user to the displayed schedule screen without making any changes. According to some embodiments the thermostat has a predefined number of set points such as 4 per day 28 per week which can each be edited as shown in but for simplicity and ease of use the user cannot add new set points or delete set points.

According to some embodiments historical information can be displayed to the user as shown in . shows the display area as in . An inward click from a user causes the display are to change to the navigation mode shown in which corresponds to display area in . By rotating the ring in the opposite direction as would cause the display of future programmed set points such as shown in a display of historical information can be accessed by the user. According to some embodiments as shown in historical temperature can be displayed in graphical form.

According to some embodiments the settings mode is exited by navigating to the DONE screen shown in and then making an inward click. According to some embodiments the a coin flip transition is used to indicate to the user that a mode is being change in this case as shown in the coin flip transition indicates the transition from Settings Mode back to current display. Thus according to some embodiments transitions between screens can graphically indicated to the user in different ways including a coin flip transition see e.g. a shrinking or growing portion of the display see e.g. A and B and a translation or shifting of displayed elements from right to left or from left to right see e.g. .

Usability of the user interface displayed on thermostat may be positively enhanced when the user s hand position on thermostat remains in a comfortable position throughout all aspects of operating the thermostat . In some implementations the user s hand may initially be comfortably positioned in any one of the circular quadrants I through IV depending on the user s left or right handedness height relative to the position of the thermostat and a variety of other ergonomic factors. Once the user s hand is placed in a comfortable position the user should be able to navigate most if not all aspects of the user interface displayed on thermostat while rotating rotatable ring through one or two but preferably no more three of the circular quadrants I through IV . This navigation is preferably done without the user having to lift and reposition their hand.

As an example a user s hand in starting position a initially begins navigation of a user interface displayed on thermostat as indicated by the approximate position of the forefinger in circular quadrant I . The user s hand placed on thermostat may then rotate clockwise approximately a quarter revolution into intermediary position b and towards the lower boundary of circular quadrant I which may happen to be a limit on the user s ability to rotate their wrist and hand. With the user s hand remaining engaged to the thermostat in intermediary position b the user may peer through the open area between the thumb and forefinger to read information displayed on the user interface reposition a display element on the display select a display element with a inward click or other interactions with the user interface. The user may then turn an equivalent quarter revolution counter clockwise from the intermediary position b arriving in a final position c whereupon the user s hand continues to remain engaged to the thermostat and is ready to further interact with the user interface.

Embodiments of the present invention facilitate keeping the user s hand in a comfortable position and engaged to the thermostat as menus and interactions within the user interface vary in both complexity and number of display elements presented. A variable assist scroll engine for rotational inputs not shown in also referred to as a variable assist scroll engine designed in accordance with embodiments of the present invention uses heuristics to provide assistance in scrolling through an arbitrary number of display elements presented on the user interface while in the process also helping keep the user s hand in a natural and comfortable position on the thermostat. As described hereinabove the user s rotational input in one embodiment may traverse a sequence of display elements preferably using less than a quarter revolution in order to enhance the user experience and improve the usability of the thermostat. In alternate embodiments and depending on the user s preference the variable assist scroll engine may also allow the user to configure the rotational input for scrolling to less than a half revolution a three quarter revolution or set as a measurement of angular displacement from 0 to 360 degrees.

As a brief example illustrates a short menu from a user interface having two display elements i.e. UNLOCKED and LOCKED and a long menu having eight display elements with wider spacing and multiple lines of data. In accordance with some embodiments the variable assist scroll engine may not accelerate the scrolling movement between the two display elements since the element distance i.e. the distance between the beginning and end of the sequence of elements is quite short might make using the short menu difficult for the user. Even if a user imparts a rapid rotational acceleration during rotational input indicating an imperative to scroll more quickly some embodiments of variable assist scroll engine may select to actually reduce or quickly dampen the amount of acceleration on the short menu to a predetermined level. In some embodiments limiting the acceleration to the predetermined level may improve the interface by providing the user with a more predictable and consistent interaction with the display elements. In comparison the variable assist scroll engine may detect that a user has subsequently imparted the same rapid rotational acceleration to scroll through long menu . In this case the variable assist scroll engine may respond by increasing the acceleration of the scrolling movement as the associated element distance is much greater than the short menu . The variable assist scroll engine assists the user entering rotational input by accelerating the scrolling movement of the sequence of display elements thereby allowing the user to quickly scroll through the more numerous display elements on the long menu . In some embodiments the user is able to scroll through the display elements while using less than quarter revolution of the rotatable ring as indicated.

In some embodiments variable assist scroll engine receives these linear and or rotational displacements over time and uses them to determine a scrolling movement for display elements on the electronic display. The scrolling movement may be calculated using linear or angular equations describing speed change in displacement velocity speed in a direction and acceleration change in velocity over time with direction . Variable assist scroll engine may modify the degree of acceleration than provided through rotational input device according to the application of information such as tuning parameters for scrolling display elements also referred to as tuning parameters as well as display elements metadata which are used to describe the shapes and sizes of display elements as they are rendered on the electronic display of the thermostat.

Some of these tuning parameters help the variable assist scroll engine model the scrolling of the display elements as physical objects having a mass and inertia being accelerated and then damped by friction or other opposing forces. Different inertial models used in simulating movement of these display elements may include a flywheel or weighted cylinder spinning around a rod as well as other variations to provide a smooth and attractive appearance of the display elements as they are rendered on the electronic display. For example if a user enters user rotational inputs in the opposite direction to the movement of the scrolling display variable assist scroll engine may dampen the scrolling of the display elements based on tuning parameters and the inertial model. In some embodiments tuning parameters may also be selected to accommodate for different menu types such as a circular menu and a linear menu either with wrapping and non wrapping effects and to achieve an overall effect on the scrolling of the display elements on the electronic display.

In some implementations these tuning parameters may include an acceleration multiplier a scroll decay factor edge bounce decay factor a center decay factor and a scroll settle threshold. The acceleration multiplier is used to increase or decrease the amount of acceleration applied to a set of scrolling elements. The value may be set to a higher value if a menu has a larger sequence of display elements and it is desirable to scroll quickly through the sequence. Scroll decay factor helps simulate the effect of friction and determines how the long the elements may scroll before stopping. If the scroll decay is set to a high value the scrolling movement may decay quickly and stop. In some embodiments the scrolling may continue even after a user has stopped providing rotational input to the rotational input device due to simulated force and inertia. The edge bounce decay factor is used in a non wrapping menu when it reaches the terminus element. In some embodiments the menu will not stop quickly but bounce when it reaches the end and oscillate briefly as the energy decays. Accordingly edge bounce decay determines how quickly the energy in the terminus element in a sequence of display elements will decay when it reaches the end of the menu. The center decay is used to determine how a quickly the decay will occur for a display element once it settles into a position. In some embodiments a user interface may apply gravity to a display element and cause the display element to settle into simulated notch groove or indentation simulated in the user interface. Accordingly the center decay determines the decay associated with this event and how quickly a display element may settle into position. The scroll settle threshold is a threshold value used to determine when a scrolling of elements has effectively stopped. Once the movement of the scrolling elements falls below this threshold scrolling of the elements will be stopped. In some embodiments the scroll settle threshold may vary for different menus depending on the simulated forces inertia and friction associated with the scrolling movement of the display elements.

The variable assist scroll engine sends these display elements to render engine to be displayed on the electronic display at a frequency determined by the display device. In some implementations the frequency of the electronic display device may be every 1 60th of a second or faster depending on the capabilities of the particular device and how it is configured. As this process repeats the display elements scrolling over the electronic display appear animated pleasing to the user and easier to navigate in accordance with embodiments of the invention.

Referring to a schematic block diagram provides an overview of some components inside a thermostat in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Thermostat is similar to thermostat in and highlights selected internal components including a Wifi module a head unit processor with associated memory a backplate processor with associated memory and sensors e.g. temperature humidity motion ambient light proximity . Further details regarding the physical placement and configuration of the thermostat head unit backplate and other physical elements are described in the commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 13 199 108 supra. The backplate processor is coupled to and responsible for polling on a regular basis most or all of the sensors including the temperature and humidity sensors motion sensors ambient light sensors and proximity sensors. For sensors that may not be located on the backplate hardware itself but rather are located in the head unit ribbon cables or other electrical connections between the head unit and backplate are provided for this purpose. Notably there may be other sensors not shown for which the head unit processor is responsible with one example being a ring rotation sensor that senses the user rotation of the outer ring . Battery supplies power to the electronic display not shown in used to display scrolling display elements in accordance embodiments of the present invention as well as to Wifi module and both backplate processor and head unit processor .

In some embodiments memory may include a menu system module variable assist scroll engine display render module HVAC module communications module and a runtime environment for managing these modules and their execution on head unit processor . In one embodiment menu system module may include the menu systems associated with configuring controlling and generally interfacing with thermostat through rotatable ring . In accordance with some embodiments variable assist scroll engine processes scrolling display elements used in menu system module to interact more efficiently with rotatable ring as well as display more attractively on the electronic display of the thermostat . For example the variable assist scroll engine may further accelerate the scrolling of display elements from a menu in menu system module and thereby reduce the required amount of rotational input applied to rotatable ring . In some embodiments variable assist scroll engine accelerates the scrolling movement allowing the user to scroll through many display elements in multiple areas of menu system module . In each the areas of the menu the user may scroll through a variable number of display elements without turning rotatable ring more than a quarter turn. This advantageously makes the thermostat or other control devices with a rotational input easier to use since user s hand can control the thermostat without having to remove and reposition multiple times in the midst of navigating a menu setting a set point on the thermostat or performing some other task. The display render module receives the various display elements from variable assist scroll engine and renders them on the electronic display not shown of thermostat . HVAC module may further be used to gather commands and data from menu system module in consideration of controlling the HVAC system.

In some embodiments aspects of the present invention may display on the electronic display associated with the control device at least a portion of an initial display element selected from a sequence of display elements. For example the initial display element may be a symbol or image selected from a sequence of display elements arranged along on a circular menu or may be a symbol or image selected from a sequence of display elements arranged in a series on a linear menu. If the initial display element is larger then it may only be partially displayed on the electronic display while a smaller display element from a sequence of display elements may be fully displayed on the on the electronic display. In some embodiments the electronic display is centrally mounted on a body of a control device providing for a smaller overall form factor for the device while in alternate embodiments the display may be mounted offset or adjacent to the body of the control device.

In some embodiments determining an angular movement is made from a rotational user input applied to a rotational input device associated with the control device. The angular movement may be determined as a measurement of the displacement velocity and acceleration of the rotational input device averaged over a time interval. For example a user may impart a rotational user input with their hand using a rotatable ring around a periphery of the electronic display such as rotatable ring described and shown supra. in . The angular displacement on the rotatable ring sampled at regular time intervals is provided to embodiments of the present invention and used to calculate the angular movement. In alternative embodiments the rotational input device may be a rotatable knob or other mechanism to rotate and scroll through display elements in the interface. The rotatable knob may be smaller and positioned adjacent to the display rather than surrounding the electronic display portion and adjustable with a user s fingers.

In some embodiments one or more heuristics are applied to variably assist with a scrolling movement of the sequence of display elements on the electronic display and reduce the rotational user input necessary to traverse the sequence of display elements. The user may preferably configure one embodiment of the variable assist scroll engine to assist in scrolling through the sequence of display elements using a rotational input of less than a quarter revolution a half revolution a three quarter revolution or set as a measurement of an angular displacement from 0 to 360 degrees. Alternate embodiments of the variable assist scroll engine may set the default rotational input to less than quarter revolution if the user selects to not customize or change these settings. In providing assistance with the scrolling movement one embodiment takes into consideration an angular movement associated with the rotational user input and an element distance associated with the sequence of display elements to be displayed on the electronic display. If the angular movement has a larger rotational acceleration component and the element distance is quite long the engine may increase the assistance with scrolling through the sequence of display elements in one or multiple ways as the user has indicated an imperative to quickly view the sequence of display elements. For example a user may wish to read a terminus element in a menu having a long list of display elements with text and thus provide a large rotational acceleration to the rotational input device.

In some embodiments a heuristic to reduce the required rotational user input may cause the engine to increase or decrease the rate of scrolling movement associated with the sequence of display elements compared with a rate of angular movement received from the rotational input device. To perform this function for example the engine may increase the acceleration of the scrolling movement to meet both the user s request to view the information quickly and reduce the rotational input required to a predetermined amount such as a quarter rotation of the rotational ring in . To increase the acceleration one embodiment may use the rotational acceleration component of the angular movement and either add a predetermined amount of acceleration or multiple of the acceleration by a factor such as an acceleration multiplier.

In some embodiments a heuristic to reduce the required rotational user input may cause the engine to create an extended scrolling movement that continues to display additional display elements from the sequence of display elements after the initial angular movement associated with the rotational user input has stopped. For example a rotational user input with acceleration may impart a simulated force and inertia on the sequence of display elements causing the display elements to scroll after the rotational user input has ended. As previously described hereinabove the movement of the display may be modeled as a physical object having mass inertia and decay due to friction or opposing rotational forces. Incorporating this type of virtual inertia increases the visual attraction of the interface while simultaneously achieving the goal of reducing the rotational input required to scroll through the display elements in a manner understood and expected in the user s physical world i.e inertia and decay . In some embodiments the extended scrolling movement may be reduced through successive subtraction or division by a scroll decay factor until the scrolling movement falls below a scroll settle threshold and is determined to have stopped.

In some embodiments a heuristic to reduce the required rotational user input may cause the engine to increase a distance covered by the scrolling movement compared with a distance covered by the angular movement. For example a user may provide a quarter revolution on a rotatable ring as an input and cause the corresponding elements to scroll a half revolution on the electronic display. In some embodiments the distance traveled by the scrolling elements may be one or several times the distance provided by the user through the rotational input device. This is particularly useful if a user is scrolling through a long sequence of display elements and needs to cover the longer distance quickly.

In some embodiments a heuristic to reduce the required rotational user input may cause the engine to continue the scrolling movement of the sequence of display elements until at least one has been affirmatively identified on the electronic display. For example a user s rotational input may cause a sequence of display elements to scroll with a scrolling movement and land in an area between two display elements leaving it not possible to select or identify a specific display element in the context of the user interface. To keep the required rotational user input reduced or minimized one embodiment simulates a notch indentation or groove coincident with each display element under the force of gravity and friction which in turn causes the scrolling movement to settle on a particular display element. In one embodiment a distance calculation may be used to select one display element over another nearby display element as the scrolling movement of the display elements slows and comes close to falling below the scroll settle threshold.

In some embodiments the variable assist scroll engine may determine whether a user has applied a subsequent angular movement in an opposite rotational. In some embodiments the user applies the subsequent rotational input to the rotational input device in an opposite direction to the scrolling movement displayed on the electronic display. Yes For example the user may see a display element of interest and desire to quickly slow or potentially stop the scrolling of the display elements. Variable assist scroll engine responds by gradually slowing the scrolling of display elements in proportion to the amount of the subsequent angular movement. In one embodiment variable assist scroll engine models the subsequent rotational input as an opposing rotational force upon an object thus the user experience is familiar and expected. In addition this heuristic further reduces the required rotational user input as the variable assist scroll engine allows the user to quickly slow or stop the scrolling movement with a reduced rotational input.

In one embodiment the circular menu at t in has a display elements velocity hereinafter display velocity in velocity graph which is also greater than the rotatable ring velocity hereinafter ring velocity . Circular menu also moved through a rotational displacement at t that is at least twice the rotational displacement associated with the rotatable ring of the thermostat . In this application the variable assist scroll engine has applied one heuristic to reduce the rotational user input to a quarter rotation of the rotatable ring while traversing at least half the sequence of display elements in the circular menu .

At a subsequent time interval t the user is no longer moving rotatable ring and the ring velocity as indicated by velocity graph is negligible or zero. In contrast circular menu continues to travel at a much more significant display velocity reduced in part by a simulated friction or decay. In this embodiment. variable assist scroll engine has imparted a rotational inertia and decay to circular menu to further reduce the rotational input required by the user. While not displayed in rotational displacement will continue to increase after t until display velocity decays further and circular menu stops.

Referring to in this example a user has applied a rotational force in clockwise direction to a rotatable ring of thermostat . The acceleration graph indicates schematically at t the ring acceleration is less than the display acceleration as the variable assist scroll engine has slightly increased the simulated acceleration associated with the animation of circular menu . The ring acceleration provided in is similar to the ring acceleration in except that it has a much lower magnitude in comparison. As a result the variable assist scroll engine has also responded with a lower acceleration for the animation of the circular menu to reflect the user s intent when using the interface.

In one embodiment the circular menu at t in has a display velocity in velocity graph which is comparable with the ring velocity . It follows that circular menu has also moved through a rotational displacement at t that is also comparable to the rotational displacement associated with the rotatable ring of the thermostat . In this application the variable assist scroll engine has applied one heuristic of allowing the user to make a quarter rotation of the rotatable ring that more directly controls the scrolling movement of display elements in the circular menu .

At a subsequent time interval t in the user is no longer moving rotatable ring and the ring velocity as indicated by velocity graph is negligible or zero. Likewise variable assist scroll engine has damped circular menu at t such that display velocity is also negligible or zero and the animation of circular menu has effectively stopped. In this embodiment. variable assist scroll engine has reduced the effects of any inertial energy in order to provide the user with more control over the scrolling movement of the display elements in circular menu .

Referring to in this example a user has again applied a rotational force in clockwise direction to a rotatable ring associated with a thermostat . The acceleration graph indicates schematically at t that ring acceleration is less than the display acceleration as the variable assist scroll engine has increased the simulated acceleration associated with the animation of circular menu . The ring acceleration is similar to the ring acceleration in except that it is at a much higher magnitude in comparison. As a result the variable assist scroll engine responds with an even higher acceleration for the animation of the circular menu to reflect the user s intent when using the interface.

In one embodiment the circular menu at t in has a display velocity in velocity graph which is significantly greater than the ring velocity . As a result of the associated relatively high acceleration and velocity circular menu has also moved through a rotational displacement at t that is almost three times the rotational displacement associated with the rotatable ring . In this application the variable assist scroll engine has applied one heuristic to reduce the rotational user input to a quarter rotation of the rotatable ring while traversing almost three quarters of the sequence of display elements in the circular menu .

At a subsequent time interval t in the user is no longer moving rotatable ring and the ring velocity as indicated by velocity graph is negligible or zero. In contrast circular menu at t continues to travel at a much more significant display velocity reduced only partially by the simulated friction or decay. In this embodiment the inertia imparted a rotational to circular menu allowed the circular menu at t to complete almost a full revolution from only a quarter revolution input to rotatable ring . Referring to the user at t has now applied a rotational force to a rotatable ring with ring acceleration in counter clockwise direction causing circular menu at t to receive a negative acceleration and dampening force. Despite the display acceleration going negative at t the animation of circular menu does not immediately reverse direction but gradually slows before appearing to reverse direction. Accordingly circular menu has a rotational displacement at t and continues to extend to rotational displacement in t with a display velocity of as indicated by velocity graph . In contrast rotatable ring has traveled at ring velocity at t with a rotational displacement in the opposite direction for a brief moment to the rotation of circular menu at t. At t in the ring velocity associated with rotatable ring is negligible or zero and the display velocity has reversed direction causing the animation of circular menu to reverse direction traveling counter clockwise with rotational displacement .

In this example a rotational displacement on thermostat at t results in circular menu at t experiencing a rotational displacement such that indicator momentarily falls between symbols u and v making it not possible to determine whether u or v has been identified in the context of the user interface. To resolve this dilemma and further reduce or minimize additional required rotational input from the user one embodiment at t in simulating the groove associated with each symbol either advances or retreats circular menu . Upon moving circular menu a slight amount indicator affirmatively identifies a display element such as symbol v as shown in detail . On or about the same moment detail also shows that an audible Click sound is provided in the user interface providing a user with audible feedback and providing a sense of added control confidence and comfort when operating the thermostat .

In one embodiment the linear menu at t in has a display velocity in velocity graph which is also greater than the ring velocity . Linear menu also moved through a linear displacement at t that is at least twice the rotational displacement associated with the rotatable ring of the thermostat . This linear displacement can be observed as the indicator at t was indicates 4 pm on Monday while the indicator at t indicates 8 pm on Thursday. In this application the variable assist scroll engine has applied one heuristic to reduce the rotational user input to a quarter rotation of the rotatable ring while traversing more than twice a comparable linear distance in the sequence of display elements in the linear menu .

At a subsequent time interval t in the user is no longer moving rotatable ring and the ring velocity as indicated by velocity graph is negligible or zero. In contrast linear menu continues to travel at a much more significant display velocity reduced in part by a simulated friction or decay. In this embodiment variable assist scroll engine has imparted an inertia and linear menu to further scrolls where indicator shows 2 pm Friday. While not displayed in the linear displacement of linear menu will continue to increase after t until display velocity decays further and the scrolling stops.

Referring to in this example a user has applied a rotational force in clockwise direction to a rotatable ring of thermostat . The acceleration graph indicates schematically at t the ring acceleration is less than the display acceleration as the variable assist scroll engine has slightly increased the simulated acceleration associated with the animation of linear menu . The ring acceleration provided in is similar to the ring acceleration in except that it is a lower magnitude in comparison and more importantly is used to change a setpoint rather than a date in the schedule of linear menu . As a result the variable assist scroll engine has also responded with a lower acceleration for the animation of the linear menu to reflect the user s intent when using the interface.

In one embodiment the linear menu at t in has a display velocity in velocity graph which is comparable with the ring velocity . It follows that linear menu has also moved through a linear displacement at t that is comparable to the rotational displacement associated with the rotatable ring . For example a relatively small change between the setpoint at 76 degrees and the setpoint at 68 degrees in does not require a large linear displacement. In this application the variable assist scroll engine has applied one heuristic of allowing the user to make a quarter rotation of the rotatable ring that more directly controls the movement of the scrolling movement of display elements in the linear menu .

At a subsequent time interval t in the user is no longer moving rotatable ring and the ring velocity as indicated by velocity graph is negligible or zero. Likewise variable scroll assist engine has damped linear menu at t such that display velocity is also negligible or zero and the animation of linear menu has effectively stopped. In this embodiment variable assist scroll engine has reduced the effects of any inertial energy in order to provide the user with more control over the scrolling movement of the display elements in linear menu .

Although the foregoing has been described in some detail for purposes of clarity it will be apparent that certain changes and modifications may be made without departing from the principles thereof. By way of example it is within the scope of the present teachings for the rotatable ring of the above described thermostat to be provided in a virtual static or solid state form instead of a mechanical form whereby the outer periphery of the thermostat body contains a touch sensitive material similar to that used on touchpad computing displays and smartphone displays. For such embodiments the manipulation by the user s hand would be a swipe across the touch sensitive material rather than a literal rotation of a mechanical ring the user s fingers sliding around the periphery but not actually causing mechanical movement. This form of user input which could be termed a virtual ring rotation static ring rotation solid state ring rotation or a rotational swipe would otherwise have the same purpose and effect of the above described mechanical rotations but would obviate the need for a mechanical ring on the device. Although not believed to be as desirable as a mechanically rotatable ring insofar as there may be a lesser amount of tactile satisfaction on the part of the user such embodiments may be advantageous for reasons such as reduced fabrication cost. By way of further example it is within the scope of the present teachings for the inward mechanical pressability or inward click functionality of the rotatable ring to be provided in a virtual or solid state form instead of a mechanical form whereby an inward pressing effort by the user s hand or fingers is detected using internal solid state sensors for example solid state piezoelectric transducers coupled to the outer body of the thermostat. For such embodiments the inward pressing by the user s hand or fingers would not cause actual inward movement of the front face of the thermostat as with the above described embodiments but would otherwise have the same purpose and effect as the above described inward clicks of the rotatable ring. Optionally an audible beep or clicking sound can be provided from an internal speaker or other sound transducer to provide feedback that the user has sufficiently pressed inward on the rotatable ring or virtual solid state rotatable ring. Although not believed to be as desirable as the previously described embodiments whose inwardly moving rotatable ring and sheet metal style rebounding mechanical click has been found to be particularly satisfying to users such embodiments may be advantageous for reasons including reduced fabrication cost. It is likewise within the scope of the present teachings for the described thermostat to provide both the ring rotations and inward clicks in virtual or solid state form whereby the overall device could be provided in fully solid state form with no moving parts at all.

While examples and implementations have been described they should not serve to limit any aspect of the present invention. Accordingly implementations of the invention can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry or in computer hardware firmware software or in combinations of them. Apparatus of the invention can be implemented in a computer program product tangibly embodied in a machine readable storage device for execution by a programmable processor and method steps of the invention can be performed by a programmable processor executing a program of instructions to perform functions of the invention by operating on input data and generating output. The invention can be implemented advantageously in one or more computer programs that are executable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor coupled to receive data and instructions from and to transmit data and instructions to a data storage system at least one input device and at least one output device.

Any of the foregoing can be supplemented by or incorporated in ASICs.

By way of further example although described above as having ring rotations and inward clicks as the exclusive user input modalities which has been found particularly advantageous in terms of device elegance and simplicity it is nevertheless within the scope of the present teachings to alternatively provide the described thermostat with an additional button such as a back button. In one option the back button could be provided on the side of the device such as described in the commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 13 033 573 supra. In other embodiments plural additional buttons such as a menu button and so forth could be provided on the side of the device. For one embodiment the actuation of the additional buttons would be fully optional on the part of the user that is the device could still be fully controlled using only the ring rotations and inward clicks. However for users that really want to use the menu and back buttons because of the habits they may have formed with other computing devices such as smartphones and the like the device would accommodate and respond accordingly to such menu and back button inputs. For some embodiments the features and advantages of one or more of the teachings hereinabove are advantageously combined with the features and advantages of one or more of the teachings of the following commonly assigned applications each of which is incorporated by reference herein U.S. Ser. No. 13 317 423 filed Oct. 17 2011 U.S. Ser. No. 13 440 910 filed Apr. 5 2012 U.S. Ser. No. 13 434 560 filed Mar. 29 2012 and U.S. Ser. No. 13 624 875 filed Sep. 21 2012.

By way of even further example other forms of user input modalities could be provided by the above described thermostat as additions and or alternative to the above described ring rotations and inward clicks without necessarily departing from the scope of the present teachings. Examples include optically sensed gesture based user inputs similar to those provided with modern video game consoles and voice inputs implemented using known speech recognition algorithms. It is to be appreciated that there are many alternative ways of implementing both the processes and apparatuses described herein. Accordingly the present embodiments are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive and the inventive body of work is not to be limited to the details given herein which may be modified within the scope and equivalents of the appended claims.
