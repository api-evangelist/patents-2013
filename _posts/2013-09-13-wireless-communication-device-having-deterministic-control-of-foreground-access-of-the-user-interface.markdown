The present application is a continuation in part of U.S. Provisional application Ser. No. 12 134 129 entitled WIRELESS COMMUNICATION DEVICE HAVING DETERMINISTIC CONTROL OF FOREGROUND ACCESS OF THE USER INTERFACE filed Jun. 5 2008 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

The present invention relates to portable wireless communication devices. More specifically the present invention relates a wireless communication device that can deterministically control which user interface of the resident applications controls the display of the device.

In modern wireless communication networks many of the wireless communication devices have resident computer platforms with operating systems and software applications that can be run either individually or in parallel on the computer platform. The software applications can vie for control of the resident user interface for the wireless communication device which often is displayed on a resident display of the wireless communication device and several problems can result from the collision of executing applications trying to seize control of the user interface.

For example in an operating system with a notification mechanism to send events to other resident applications the operating system may typically use notifications to broadcast events to multiple software applications such as the receipt of incoming communications the execution of various applications and the status of resident hardware components. The resident software applications can register for notifications using a common operating system application programming interface API . Also a resident software application can implement a notify class and send notifications to other software applications as intended. Once an application receives an event the resident software application is typically free to act and come to the foreground on the API.

One problem occurs if there are multiple applications that can handle a specific event and they all want to come to the foreground of the UI. This can cause thrashing and undesirable user behavior where each application tries to come to the foreground and thus the operating system may not let any one application stay on top in the UI. One prior art solution to this problem has been simply to allow foreground thrashing as a consequence of the broadcast event model. However simply letting the UI thrash is undesirable as the applications do have any specified order in which they seize and display upon the UI and high priority applications are left to contend with low priority applications for control.

It would therefore be advantageous to provide a system and method for a wireless communication device to control which of a plurality of resident applications may have control of the UI if multiple applications are simultaneously invoked and compete for control of the UI. Such system and method should be able to prioritize which application may have the UI without utilizing significant device resources in determining the control. It is thus to such a system and method of a wireless communication device determining resident application control of the UI that the present invention is primarily directed.

Briefly described there is provided herein a wireless communication device that has one or more applications resident on a local computer platform and includes at least a wireless communication interface and a display. Each application has a user interface that it uses to interact with the user. The arbiter application that resides on the computer platform controls which application may bring its user interface to the foreground based upon a predetermined criteria such as a prioritization scheme a most recently used algorithm or based upon the nature of the event invoking multiple applications.

In one embodiment the method of determining which user interface of the resident applications on the computer platform of the wireless communication device controls the display with the user interface at least appearing on the display of the wireless communication device and through which a user of the wireless communication device interacts with resident applications includes the steps of displaying the user interface on the display of the wireless communication device where the display is configured to be selectively controlled by the user interface of one or more applications resident on the computer platform then either receiving a request at an arbiter from one or more of the resident applications to control the display with the arbiter resident on the computer platform and determining at the arbiter which application of the user interfaces of the one or more resident applications controls the user interface based upon a predetermined criteria or if the one or more resident applications include priority data indicating a priority of control of the display the one or more resident applications may determine which user interface of which application controls the display.

In another embodiment a method of assigning control of each of a plurality of display to an application of a plurality of applications resident on a wireless communication device may include determining via an arbiter a first application of the plurality of applications that controls one of the plurality of displays based upon predetermined criteria in response to receiving a notification event that simultaneously invokes more than one application determining whether an activity relevant to a second application of the plurality of applications is detected in response to the determination via the arbiter that the first application controls the one of the plurality of displays ordering a list of viable displays of the plurality of displays in order of priority for the second application in response to detecting the activity relevant to the second application selecting a display in the ordered list of viable displays of the plurality of displays determining whether the selected display is in use by a third application and sending to the second application a flag that assigns control of a foreground of the selected display in response to determining the selected display is not in use by the third application.

In another embodiment a method of associating user input data with a plurality of applications resident on a wireless communication device in accordance with a user intent may include determining via an arbiter a first application of the plurality of applications that controls a display of the wireless communication device based upon predetermined criteria in response to receiving a notification event that simultaneously invokes more than one application detecting in response to the determination via the arbiter that the first application controls the display a change in a control of the display from the first application in the plurality of applications to a second application in the plurality of applications identifying a first input received before the detected change in the control of the display and a second input received after the detected change in the control of the display determining whether the first input was received within a first time threshold of the detected change in the control of the display determining whether the second input was received within a second time threshold of the detected change in the control of the display and associating the second input with the second application in response to determining that the first input was not received within the first time threshold or the second input was not received within the second time threshold.

In another embodiment a method of controlling a plurality of applications resident on a wireless communication device may include determining via an arbiter such as an arbiter application that has administrative privileges a first application of the plurality of applications controls a display of the wireless communication device based upon predetermined criteria in response to receiving a notification event that simultaneously invokes more than one application determining whether a second application of the plurality of applications did not comply with the determination via the arbiter that the first application of the plurality of applications controls the display and terminating the second application in response to determining that the second application of the plurality of applications did not comply.

The present system and method are therefore advantageous in that they provide a wireless communication device with the ability to control which one of a plurality of invoked or active resident UI applications may have control of the display such as is caused with an invoking event to minimize thrashing in control of the display. There are several embodiments to prioritize the application control of the display which allows implementation in a variety of wireless environments. The determination of the control of the display may accordingly be accomplished without having to devote significant device processing resources in arbitrating control of the display.

Other objects features and advantages of the present invention may become apparent after review of the Brief Description of the Drawings Detailed Description of the Invention and the Claims.

The various embodiments may be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible the same reference numbers may be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. References made to particular examples and implementations are for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention or the claims.

In this description the terms communication device wireless device wireless communication device PTT communication device handheld device mobile device and handset are used interchangeably. The terms call and communication are also used interchangeably. The term application as used herein is intended to encompass executable and non executable software files raw data aggregated data patches and other code segments. The term exemplary means that the disclosed element or embodiment is only an example and does not indicate any preference of user. All methods of interaction between applications are intended to be encompassed herein to include all forms of invocation execution calling and data exchanging. Further like numerals refer to like elements throughout the several views and the articles a and the includes plural references unless otherwise specified in the description.

With reference to the figures in which like numerals represent like elements throughout is a representative diagram of one embodiment of a system with a wireless network in a common cellular telecommunication configuration with communications occurring between the wireless communication devices . The system here also includes a series of group communication computer devices group communication servers that support a push to talk PTT system. The wireless network is merely exemplary and may include any system whereby remote modules communicate over the air between and among each other and or between and among components of a wireless network including without limitation wireless network carriers and or servers. A series of group communication servers are shown here as connected to a group communication server local area network LAN but other computer devices may be accessible to the LAN to provide functionality to any component on the network. Wireless communication devices may request packet data sessions from the group communication server s using a data service option.

The back office computer devices such as the group communication server s are connected to a wireless service providers packet data service node PDSN such as PDSN shown here resident on a carrier network . Each PDSN may interface with a base station controller of a base station through a packet control function PCF . The PCF is typically located in the base station . The carrier network controls messages generally in the form of data packets sent to a messaging service controller MSC . The carrier network communicates with the MSC by a network the Internet and or POTS plain ordinary telephone system . Typically the network or Internet connection between the carrier network and the MSC transfers data and the POTS transfers voice information. The MSC may be connected to one or more base stations . In a similar manner to the carrier network the MSC is typically connected to the branch to source BTS by both the network and or Internet for data transfer and POTS for voice information. The BTS ultimately broadcasts and receives messages wirelessly to and from the wireless devices such as wireless communication devices e.g. cellular telephones by short messaging service SMS or other over the air methods known in the art. It should also be noted that carrier boundaries and or PTT operator network boundaries do not inhibit or prohibit the sharing of data as described herein.

Cellular telephones and mobile telecommunication devices such as wireless telephone in are being manufactured with increased computing capabilities and are becoming tantamount to personal computers and hand held PDAs. These smart cellular telephones allow software developers to create software applications that are downloadable and executable on the processor of the wireless communication device. The wireless communication device such as cellular telephone may download many types of applications such as web pages applets MIDlets games and data. In wireless communication devices that have designated a communication group the wireless communication device may directly connect with the other member of the set and engage in voice and data communication. However all such direct communications may occur through or at the control of the group communication server . All data packets of the devices do not necessarily have to travel through the group communication server itself but the group communication server is typically able to ultimately control the communication because it may typically be the only carrier network component that is aware of and or may retrieve the identity of the members of the communication group or direct the identity of the members of the communication group to another computer device. It should be appreciated that the number of computer components resident on server side LAN or across the wireless network or Internet generally are not limited.

In addition to voice communications between the wireless communication devices other media may be sent such as graphic media to include pictures in JPEG TIF and the like audio files such as MP3 MP4 WAV and the like. The media may also be streaming media such as a multimedia application Powerpoint MOV file and the like . The group directed media may also be streaming media or an interactive session on another computer device on the wireless communication network such as a hosted game or private bulletin board. Also for PTT communications the group directed communication could be half duplex audio and or video conferencing among members of the communication group in substantial real time or in delay.

As shown here the wireless communication device may be a mobile telephone with a graphics display but may also be any wireless communication device with a computer platform as known in the art such as a mobile device or even a separate computer platform that has a wireless communication portal and may otherwise have a wired connection to a network or the Internet. Further the memory may be comprised of read only or random access memory RAM and ROM EPROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. The computer platform may also include a local database for storage of software applications not actively used in memory . The local database is typically comprised of one or more flash memory cells but may be any secondary or tertiary storage device as known in the art such as magnetic media EPROM EEPROM optical media tape or soft or hard disk. The graphics display may present not only information about the ongoing group call but also the information on the group directed media to include a file preview as is more fully described herein.

In this embodiment of the wireless communication device the computer platform also includes a direct or wireless communication interface that may open the direct communication channel from the wireless communication device . The direct or wireless communication interface may also be part of the standard communication interface for the wireless communication device which ordinarily carries the voice and data transmitted to and from the wireless communication device . The direct or wireless communication interface typically is comprised of hardware as is known in the art.

In overview the wireless communication device has one or more applications resident upon the computer platform which also includes the wireless communication interface a display and a user interface that at least appears on the display with one example of the user interface shown in and through which a user of the wireless communication device interacts with the computer platform . Each application has a user interface and in one embodiment an arbiter in may be resident on the computer platform and configured to determine which application of the one or more UI applications controls the display based upon a predetermined criteria. Examples of the predetermined criteria are a priority list allowing the last application to control the user interface to again control the user interface most recently used algorithm assigning a class to the one or more applications such that determining control is based upon the class of the application allowing the control of the user interface based upon the specific type of data being handled in the user interface and allowing the control based upon the type of data being received at the wireless communication interface . In other embodiments the resident applications themselves may determine the priority either alone or in conjunction with an arbiter using predetermined criteria in the same manner as an arbiter .

In one embodiment the arbiter may utilize a provisioned priority list of applications where Application A has its code changed to allow a list of class IDs to be provisioned possibly by a network carrier or other entity. This list of class IDs are provisioned in the order of priority of the applications that should be allowed to come to the foreground of the UI . For example one may choose that Application C should have a higher priority over Applications B or D to come to the foreground and after broadcast of an event to all of the applications the broadcast also lists the chosen class ID for Application C in the event notify payload. When the applications receive the event notification they typically check if their class ID matches with what is sent in the payload and if it does then it should come to the foreground. The arbiter may merely verify the UI control in this embodiment and does not actually have to grant control as the class ID may be apparent to each application. However this embodiment does require additional overhead as each resident application may have to be configured to understand the class IDs.

Another embodiment to determine control of the UI is to use a simple algorithm such as having the last application to come to the foreground to accept an event of a particular event class alert call presence etc. is the next application to come to the foreground. In such embodiment Application A may broadcast the last known foreground application class ID with the event and the receiving application is advised to compare its own class ID to the suggested last known foreground application s class ID and come to the foreground of the UI only if the two match. However this may cause edge case problems such as initial thrashing in the case there was no last known foreground application fresh start up or when it is not clear which application was last in control so a default priority class should still be used.

In another embodiment a preferred controlling of applications is automatically set. The application itself may register itself as the primary application to come to the foreground to process an event of a particular event class alert call presence etc. . In such embodiment the application may retrieve the class ID for the currently registered application for a particular event class and make a decision about whether to overwrite the stored class ID with its own. If none is stored the application may set its own class ID as the primary foreground application for a particular event class. In a further embodiment there may be a provisioned list based upon the type of event and the activity being invoked such as provision a list of MIME types in Application A . This set of MIME types may be provisioned in the order of and Application A may broadcast the events to all the applications with the MIME type of the highest priority included in the payload of the event notification. When the applications receive this event they typically see if the included MIME type matches with what they have been provisioned as and may come to the foreground only if they match. In essence this embodiment uses MIME types instead of Class IDs. However to implement this embodiment the applications typically co operate and typically do not come to the foreground if their class ID does not match with what is sent in the event which requires additional programming in each module.

Otherwise if there is not a predetermined priority criteria at decision block the priority of the application to have the display is determined as shown at block or step and then a flag is sent to the priority application to control the display as shown at block or step and the arbitration again terminates as shown at termination block . The priority may be determined at block or step with the methodology as set forth above or a combination of any of the above methodologies.

It may therefore be seen that the wireless communication device provides an inventive method of determining which resident application on a computer platform of wireless communication device controls the display thereof with the user interface at least appearing on a display of the wireless communication device and through which a user of the wireless communication device interacts with the computer platform which includes displaying the user interface on the display of the wireless communication device the user interface configured to be selectively controlled by one or more applications resident on the computer platform . In one embodiment the method includes receiving a request at an arbiter from one or more of the resident applications to control the display with the arbiter resident on the computer platform and then determining at the arbiter which application of the one or more resident applications controls the display based upon a predetermined criteria.

In one embodiment where each of the one or more resident applications include a priority data that determines the priority for the application to control the display the method includes the steps of after display of the user interface invoking a plurality of the one or more resident applications as shown in and determining which application of the one or more resident applications controls the display based upon the priority data within each invoked application. Such determination may be based upon the use of a class identification that determines the priority for the application to control the display or alternately may be based upon one of the plurality of invoked applications seizing control of the display based upon the priority data. In this embodiment the priority data ranking may preferably keep display control to the highest priority application to lessen or preferably prevent thrashing.

When embodied with an arbiter the step of determining which application of the one or more resident applications controls the display based upon a predetermined criteria is utilizing a priority list for applications attempting to control the display . Alternately determining at the arbiter which application of the one or more resident applications controls the display based upon a predetermined criteria may be allowing the last application to control the display to again control the display . Also determining at the arbiter which application of the one or more resident applications controls the display based upon a predetermined criteria may be assigning a class to the one or more applications and determining control is based upon the class of the application. Furthermore determining at the arbiter which application of the one or more resident applications controls the display may be allowing the control of the display based upon the type of data being handled in the user interface or may be based upon the type of data being received at the wireless communication interface .

The method may further include displaying data to the user of the wireless communication device at the user interface and if the user interface is a display screen such as interface on the display the method may include displaying graphic information to the user of the wireless communication device at the display such as the APIs . Alternately where user interface is a control interface for the user to access the computer platform the method may further include displaying graphic information to the user of the wireless communication device at the display screen to control a device function. If the user interface includes one or more user interface applications configured to selectively control the user interface the arbiter may further be configured to selectively allow control of the display to one or more user interface applications such as the windowed APIs .

As described above with reference to block of and block of described above the wireless communication device may be configured to send flags or other messages to priority applications. In various embodiments the wireless communication device may be configured to transmit messages flags or other signals to applications resident on the computer platform indicating that those applications may not control the display or may not come to the foreground . In particular the wireless communication device such as via an arbiter may transmit suspend messages indicating that an application should operate as an inactive or suspended application in the background of the wireless communication device. For example after determining the priority application using the operations in block of or block of the wireless communication device may transmit a flag to the priority application and a suspend message to every other application executing on the processor of the wireless communication device. In this way applications may receive the results of arbitration operations by the wireless communication device through such messages or signals regardless of whether they are the priority application that may control a display or come to the foreground .

In various embodiments the wireless communication device may perform operations to modify and or support arbitration operations described above. In particular the wireless communication device may perform methods and as described below. In various embodiments operations of the methods described below may be performed in combination with or as part of the arbitration operations described above. For example the wireless communication device such as via an arbiter may perform any or all of the operations of the methods or as described below after performing the operations in blocks of or blocks of .

Further in various embodiments the wireless communication device may be configured to perform operations of the various methods described below via an arbiter as described above. For example the wireless communication device may perform any combination of the operations in any of the methods or via an arbiter application or app executing on the processor of the wireless communication device or alternatively via arbiter processes routines threads software or other instructions that are part of the operating system of the wireless communication device. Accordingly any operations of the wireless communication device described below may be considered to be executed via such an arbiter.

In an embodiment via wireless or wired connections the wireless communication device may also be connected to or tethered to other displays e.g. a portable laptop computer a desktop computer a plurality of LCD monitors used in combination to render a larger whole image etc. or other wireless communication devices having displays e.g. another smartphone linked to the wireless communication device . In various embodiments a plurality of displays may refer to different sections quadrants or pixel ranges within a single display e.g. a plurality of monitors used in combination to display a larger whole image such as a billboard . For example the wireless communication device may divide the real estate of a single touchscreen display for rendering a plurality of desktops environments or foreground applications.

The embodiment methods and described below with reference to may be performed by the wireless communication device such as via an arbiter to manage how applications resident on the computing platform of the wireless communication device may be permitted to control one of the plurality of displays based on priority information. For example the wireless communication device may perform the methods via an arbiter application or app executing on the processor for managing which other applications executing on the wireless communication device may come to the foreground of a display based upon predetermined criteria.

In block the wireless communication device may register applications such as by storing registration information that includes descriptive information of applications executing on the wireless communication device. Registered applications may be considered as resident on the computer platform of the wireless communication device. The wireless communication device may register applications at the boot up of the wireless communication device in response to receiving registration requests from the applications or dynamically when the applications are installed launched or otherwise activated e.g. at run time or at an application activation . In an embodiment applications may be registered by the wireless communication device via the arbiter in response to receiving event notifications.

At the registration of an application resident on the computer platform of the wireless communication device various registration information may be stored in relation to the application such as in a data table or database accessible to an arbiter application or OS process executing on the wireless communication device. In particular each registered application may be associated with an identification e.g. application ID a default priority e.g. high low critical etc. network requirements of the application e.g. Internet access a certain required quality of service QoS broadcast or multicast needed global positioning system GPS needed etc. an indication of whether the application may be dynamically reprioritized as discussed below with reference to e.g. an arbiter may dynamically change priority from high to low based on operating conditions etc. and an indication of whether the application can be used on a secondary display e.g. a supplementary touchscreen etc. .

Additionally each registered application may be associated with an indication of whether the registered application is capable of running in the background of the wireless communication device i.e. background enabled or background disabled . For example when a video call application e.g. QCHAT registers with the wireless communication device and arbiter as being background enabled and a video call is subsequently received while a camera application is controlling the foreground or executing in the foreground for a display the wireless communication device via the arbiter may permit the camera application to continue controlling the foreground while the video call application continues running in the background. As another example when the video call application is registered without the background enabled indication i.e. registered with a background disabled indicator the wireless communication device may pause the camera application and authorize the video call application to take control of the foreground of a display when the video call application is registered with a higher priority level than the camera application. In an embodiment the wireless communication device may be configured to emit or render tones music or other sounds that may indicate a video call status and or floor control such as tones that indicate the video call application is conducting a call as a process executing in the background.

The registration information of the various registered applications may be stored as data within data records bits variables descriptive strings or any other data that the wireless communication device may access to evaluate the applications. In an embodiment the registration information such as the indication of whether an application is background enabled may be based on user preferences associated with the application the wireless communication device and or the arbiter. For example user preferences may be set for a particular application that indicate the application may only be rendered on a default primary screen or that the application may always or never be executed as a background process on the wireless communication device.

Returning to in determination block the wireless communication device may determine whether an activity relevant to a first application is detected. For example as described above the wireless communication device via the arbiter may detect when notification events or other messages are received that may invoke the applications registered with the arbiter. Such detected activities may be predefined events for each individual registered application or may be universal for all applications. Detected activities that may be relevant to the first application may include encountered exceptions detected changes in stored information associated with registered applications e.g. a priority change and or received event notifications signals interrupts or other messages that are received in response to various conditions such as the registration of a new application with the arbiter a change in the operating status e.g. suspended active etc. or registration information e.g. priority class etc. of an application an application requests control of the foreground of a display the loss of control of a display foreground by an application and an activity state change of a display e.g. a primary display has become available etc. .

In an embodiment the wireless communication device may determine a received message is relevant to the first application based on bits or other indicators that identify the first application and or the class or priority of the first application. Alternatively any received message may be relevant to any launched and or active applications e.g. applications executing in the background foreground of the wireless communication device . In various embodiments the wireless communication device may evaluate every registered application to determine relevancy to any such detected activity e.g. received message .

If the wireless communication device does not detect an activity relevant to the first application i.e. determination block No the wireless communication device may continue with the operations for registering applications in block . For example the wireless communication device may continually or periodically register applications and monitor for notification events. If the wireless communication device does detect an activity relevant to the first application i.e. determination block Yes in block the wireless communication device may identify or order a list of all viable displays for the first application in order of display priority. For example the wireless communication device may identify all touchscreens LCD screens and other display units associated with the wireless communication device that are functioning properly i.e. not broken being repaired etc. and that are currently in use. In other words the identified list of viable displays may be a list of all the possible displays on which the first application may come to the foreground.

In an embodiment the wireless communication device may identify the list based on registration information associated with the first application. For example if the registration information of the first application indicates that the first application does not support multiple displays the wireless communication device may identify a list that includes only the default or primary display of the device. As another example the wireless communication device may evaluate the registration information of the first application to find a preferred display priority and may identify the list accordingly. In another embodiment the wireless communication device may identify the list of viable displays by evaluating the power required to use a display. In particular the wireless communication device may evaluate the available battery power of the device to determine whether a de activated secondary display may be activated or energized for the first application to control. The wireless communication device may estimate the power consumption of such a secondary display with the first application and may compare the estimated consumption to a threshold value to determine whether it is feasible to activate the secondary display.

The display order of the list of viable displays may be based on predefined stored information related to the various displays e.g. a database with information describing the priority classifications of display units user preferences activity e.g. how often the display is used and usefulness to the first application. For example the list of viable displays may be in order from default or primary touchscreen to secondary displays. As another example the list of viable displays may be presented in descending order of resolution or render quality e.g. HD SD black and white etc. . As yet another example the list may order the displays in order of best able to render the particular type of data associated with the first applications e.g. video text etc. . In various embodiments the identified list for the first application may be different than the identified list for other registered applications. For example the wireless communication device may identify that an OLED or LED screen has a highest display priority for the first application e.g. a video game based on the first application s registered information but may identify a touchscreen as the highest display priority for a second application e.g. a picture editor .

In block the wireless communication device may select a next display from the identified list of viable displays. For the first time the wireless communication device performs the operations in block the next display may be the first display in the identified list of viable displays i.e. the display having the highest display priority for the first application . For example the wireless communication device may first select the default or primary display to evaluate for the first application. In determination block the wireless communication device may determine whether the selected display is in use by a second application. If the selected display is not in use by the second application i.e. determination block No in block the wireless communication device may send a flag or other signal that assigns control of the foreground of the selected display to the first application.

If the selected display is in use by the second application i.e. determination block Yes in determination block the wireless communication device may determine whether the second application has a higher priority than the first application. The wireless communication device may compare the registration information of the first and second applications such as by comparing the priority class or other characteristics to identify the application having the higher priority. The wireless communication device may perform operations similar to those described above with reference to blocks and or of to determine which application has the higher priority.

If the second application does not have a higher priority i.e. determination block No in optional block the wireless communication device may change the status of the second application such as by storing a bit indicating the second application is being removed from control of the foreground of the selected display. In an embodiment the change of status may be accompanied by the wireless communication device sending a message or signal indicating the status change of the second application e.g. a suspend message and thus triggering the performance of the method to reassign the second application to another display if possible. The wireless communication device may then continue with the operations in block .

If the second application has a higher priority i.e. determination block Yes in determination block the wireless communication device may determine whether there is a next display in the identified list of viable displays to select. In other words the wireless communication device may determine whether to perform the operations of block in another iteration to assign the first application to the display with the next highest display priority in the identified list of viable displays. If there is not a next display in the identified list of viable displays to select i.e. determination block No in block the wireless communication device may add the first application to a wait queue for a display. For example the first application may be suspended until the primary display or any display in the identified list of viable displays becomes available. As described above the wireless communication device may receive a message or signal when displays become available and in response may perform operations of the method to assign the first application to a display.

In an embodiment the wireless communication device may perform the method to successively assign an application to different displays in its associated list of ordered displays. In other words in response to receiving a message or signal indicating a certain display e.g. default primary high priority has become available the wireless communication device may perform the operations in the method to determine whether an application controlling a secondary display may be re assigned to the certain display. For example when a higher priority second application is terminated and surrenders control of a front facing display i.e. the default or primary display the wireless communication device may determine whether a lower priority first application previously assigned to a secondary display on the backside of the housing of the wireless communication device may be re assigned to the front facing display.

In block the wireless communication device may re calculate priorities or perform re prioritization of applications registered for dynamic priority changes in response to predefined events. As described above the registration information stored by the wireless communication device at the registration of the various applications may include indications of whether the applications may be dynamically reprioritized. In other words the registration information may indicate whether an application has opted in to being re prioritized by the wireless communication device such as via an arbiter application or OS routine. Certain applications such as emergency call applications may have static priorities and may not be registered to permit dynamic re prioritization by the wireless communication device.

In various embodiments the predefined events may be stored in data generally accessible by the wireless communication device e.g. in memory associated with the arbiter application or alternatively stored within registration information of the individual registered applications. The predefined events may include conditions timers messages or received message types or other circumstances that may trigger the re calculation of priority for particular applications. For example the registration information for a certain application may indicate that the wireless communication device should re calculate the certain application s priority once every time period e.g. millisecond s second s minute s etc. and or every certain number of processor clock cycles or signals . As another example the wireless communication device may perform re prioritization operations for the certain application based on detecting the registration or launching of an application. In an embodiment the wireless communication device may perform re prioritization operations for an application based on detected user input such as taps on a touchscreen or text typing inputs corresponding to an address book application.

In another embodiment the wireless communication device may perform re prioritization operations for an application based on changes in the operating parameters of the device. For example an application may be re prioritized in response to the wireless communication device detecting a change in network connectivity such as the wireless communication device losing a connection to a wide area network WAN gaining a connection to the WAN detecting cellular network service activity changes and or connecting to a certain access point. As another example an application may be re prioritized in response to the wireless communication device receiving a short range wireless signal e.g. Bluetooth etc. and or detecting a change in available power e.g. available battery life below a predefined threshold connected to a power source etc. . In another embodiment the wireless communication device may re calculate priorities of applications in response to detecting status changes in the registered applications e.g. suspended activated removed from control of a display etc. . For example the wireless communication device may lower the priority of a typically high priority video call application when the application has an idle screen.

As an example to illustrate an embodiment the wireless communication device may execute on its processor two applications registered for dynamic re prioritization a video call application that requires a network connection and that may be initially registered with a high priority and a camera application that does not require a network connection and may be initially registered with a low priority. When the video call application is launched the wireless communication device via the arbiter may detect that there is no cellular network connection available i.e. no coverage and thus the video call application may be temporarily inoperable. In such a condition the wireless communication device via the arbiter may dynamically re prioritize the camera application to have a higher priority than the video call application to avoid a situation where the camera may lose control of the foreground of the wireless communication device s display.

As another example to illustrate an embodiment the wireless communication device may execute on its processor two applications registered for dynamic re prioritization a video call application that may be initially registered with a high priority and an address book application that may be initially registered with a low priority. The wireless communication device may detect user inputs when the address book application is controlling the foreground for a display and as a result may increase the priority of the address book application to avoid interrupting the input even if the video call application is launched or receives an incoming call.

The recalculation or reprioritization operations for the applications may use various weighting schemes rule sets balancing factors models equations and other considerations for determining new priority values for each application. Further the reprioritization of one application may trigger the wireless communication device to re calculate the priority of another application. For example in response to re calculating a first application as having the highest priority the wireless communication device via the arbiter may re calculate the priority of a second application that previously had the highest priority.

Returning to in determination block the wireless communication device may determine whether an activity relevant to a first application is detected. In particular the wireless communication device may determine whether a change in priority has occurred for registered applications. For example if the first application is in a wait queue for a display the wireless communication device may determine whether any applications having a higher priority than the first application have been re prioritized. As another example if the first application is in a wait queue for a display or if the first application is not currently in control of its preferred display the wireless communication device may determine whether any of the displays of the device have become available especially a display that is preferable for the first application based on its registration information.

If the wireless communication device does not detect an activity relevant to the first application i.e. determination block No the wireless communication device may continue with the operations for registering applications in block . If the wireless communication device does detect an activity relevant to the first application i.e. determination block Yes in block the wireless communication device may identify a list of all viable displays for the first application in order of display priority. In block the wireless communication device may select a next display from the identified list of all viable displays. In determination block the wireless communication device may determine whether the selected display is in use by a second application. If the selected display is not in use by the second application i.e. determination block No in block the wireless communication device may send a flag that assigns control of the foreground of the selected display to the first application. If the selected display is in use by the second application i.e. determination block Yes in determination block the wireless communication device may determine whether the second application has a higher priority than the first application. If the second application does not have a higher priority i.e. determination block No in optional block the wireless communication device may change the status of the second application and may then continue with the operations in block . If the second application has a higher priority i.e. determination block Yes in determination block the wireless communication device may determine whether there is a next display in the list of all viable displays to select. If there is not a next display in the list of all viable displays to select i.e. determination block No in block the wireless communication device may add the first application to a wait queue for a display.

In block the wireless communication device may store status information for all displays of the device. For example the wireless communication device may store within a database or system variables indicators or other descriptive information that indicates the operating requirements e.g. power consumption parameters type of data that may be rendered type of data that may best be rendered etc. display priority or rank e.g. default secondary etc. dimensions or viewable area and operating conditions or functionality indications e.g. broken malfunctioning nominal etc. related to each of the plurality of displays that are connected to or otherwise controlled by the wireless communication device. In an embodiment the status information may be ordered by display priority such as by being ordered in ascending order of user preference or rank. In various embodiments the wireless communication device may store status information for each of the plurality of displays for each of the registered applications. For example the wireless communication device may store individual ranked lists for each of the displays relative to the each of the plurality of applications resident on the computer platform of the wireless communication device.

In block the wireless communication device may poll sensors of the device for information about current conditions. The wireless communication device may include various sensors such as cameras microphones thermistors accelerometers gyroscopes and touch sensing surfaces. The wireless communication device may gather sensor data that indicates environments or usage circumstances that may be used to evaluate the viability of displays of the device and how the user of the device is interacting with the device. For example the wireless communication device may evaluate accelerometer sensor data to identify circumstantial information useful in prioritizing the displays. Using the sensor data the wireless communication device may evaluate various conditions relevant to using the displays such as ambient temperature based on thermistor sensor data ambient brightness based on camera data current device movement or motion based on accelerometer gyroscope sensor data device inclination based on gyroscope sensor data a device altitude based on GPS data user inputs based on touchscreen inputs and the identity of the current user based on camera data e.g. imagery data recorded of current user s face or microphone data e.g. audio data recorded of current user s voice .

In block the wireless communication device may evaluate the viability of displays based on the stored status information and or the polled sensor data. For example based on the stored status information for a certain LCD screen the wireless communication device may assess whether that screen is power hungry or require a significant amount of battery power is operating at a high temperature has certain resolution capabilities e.g. standard definition SD high definition HD etc. has touch sensitive functionalities and or is currently functioning properly e.g. broken etc. . The wireless communication device may compare the stored status information of the various displays to current conditions such as time of day. Further the wireless communication device may compare the stored status information of the various displays to the sensor data such as by comparing stored information indicating the luminous output capabilities of a display to the ambient brightness to identify how well a user might see applications rendered on the display. For example the wireless communication device may compare the current motion data from accelerometers to the viewable area of a screen to identify how useful the screen may be when rendering particular applications while the user is walking running sitting.

In block the wireless communication device may evaluate user interactions with the displays based on the polled sensor data. For example by evaluating detected touch inputs on a touch sensitive screen the wireless communication device may estimate the user s activity related to the various screens. The wireless communication device may determine a currently most used or most popular display based on detected user inputs. The wireless communication device may also perform eye tracking and or head tracking using camera data to identify particular screens that the user is looking at more often. For example the wireless communication device may determine user interaction information that indicates whether a user is looking at any of the plurality of displays based on eye tracking whether the user is looking at any of the plurality of displays based on head tracking and or whether the user is touching any of the plurality of displays. In an embodiment the wireless communication device may evaluate gyroscope sensor data to identify how the device is being held in order to determine its current use. For example if the sensor data indicates the device is being held up the wireless communication device may assess the likelihood that the user is looking at a front facing screen as opposed to a screen on the back of the device. In various embodiments the user interactions with the device may be interpreted over a period of time and thus the wireless communication device may utilize sensor data gathered or recorded and stored in the device during that time.

In block the wireless communication device may re calculate the priority of the displays based on the evaluations such as the evaluated viability of displays and or the evaluated user interaction with displays. For example based on the evaluation of the increased user interactions with a certain display over a period of time the wireless communication device may increase the priority of the certain display e.g. make the certain display the default or priority display . The recalculation or reprioritization operations for the displays may use various weighting schemes rule sets balancing factors models equations and other considerations for determining new priority values for each display. For example based on erratic motion sensor data the wireless communication device may reprioritize a large screen to be the default display so that applications rendered on the large screen are easier to see when the user is jogging. As another example the wireless communication device may reprioritize a default screen to have the lowest priority among the plurality of displays based on status information indicating that the screen requires more power than the device can sustain given the charge remaining on the device s battery.

In an embodiment the priority of one or more of the display in the plurality of displays may be updated or otherwise changed in response to the change of a display priority. For example in response to reprioritizing a first display as the default or most important display the wireless communication device may necessarily reduce the priority of or reprioritize a second display that was the default display. In block the wireless communication device may store the recalculated priorities of the displays such as by updating data records associated with the displays within a database system variables or other data that may be accessible to the arbiter. In optional block the wireless communication device may wait a period such as a predefined number of seconds minutes etc and then repeat the operations beginning in block .

In an embodiment the method may be performed by the wireless communication device during the operations in block described above with reference to . For example the wireless communication device may be configured to reprioritize the displays of the device for a particular registered application based on the evaluations described above plus the registration information associated with the particular application e.g. the type of data to be rendered for the application etc. . In other words each registered application may be associated with a display priority list for all displays of the wireless communication device that may be reprioritized.

As an exemplary illustration a user of the wireless communication device may intend to enter the text input Hello world into the first user interface of the first application. The first user interface is shown to be associated with a first input text Hello wo such as an input typed into the wireless communication device via a touchpad or soft keyboard. The first user interface may be associated with the first input text as the first application was controlling the foreground of the wireless communication device at the time the first input text was received or typed in . The second user interface is shown to be associated with a second input text rld and further is shown to have the focus of the input for the wireless communication device shown in the by the cursor element . The second user interface may be associated with the second input text as the second application was controlling the foreground of the wireless communication device at the time the second input text was received or typed in . In other words in between the wireless communication device receiving the first input text Hello wo and the second input text rld the second application came to the foreground of the wireless communication device and the focus changed from the first application.

In block the wireless communication device may detect a change in control of the foreground or a display from a first application to a second application. For example the second application may be a video call application to which the arbiter sent the flag with the operations in block of or block of . The wireless communication device may also identify and store a time associated with the change in control such as the half second of the day at which the second application gained control of the foreground. In various embodiments the wireless communication device may detect the change by evaluating an operating system table system variable or other stored information that indicates the current controlling application as well as the time at which control was gained by the controlling application. In an embodiment the change in control may be detected based on an interrupt or other signal generated in response to the second application gaining control of the foreground. In an embodiment the change in control may be detected by evaluating a change in a focus indicator e.g. focus may be moved from one user interface to another for the purpose of inserting user inputs .

In block the wireless communication device may identify a first input occurring before the change in control and a second input occurring after the change in control. The wireless communication device may evaluate an input buffer such as a temporary storage location in memory that stores the user input values or actions received by the device over a certain period of time and identify the first and second inputs based on time of receipt information associated with the buffered inputs. For example the received user inputs may be stored in association with the times of receipt and or the application in control of the foreground i.e. having focus at the time of receipt of the user inputs. Alternatively the wireless communication may be configured to use various buffers arrays or other data structures for different applications. For example the wireless communication device may identify the first input as the data stored in a first buffer associated with the previous application to control the foreground and may identify the second input as the data stored in a second buffer associated with the current application to control the foreground. In an embodiment the first input may only be a segment of a user input e.g. a most recently received segment that was received prior to the change in control. For example the first input may be identified as the text input received before the change in control but after a punctuation mark a space symbol a return carriage or other logical divider within a stream of text. In an embodiment the wireless communication device may utilize detected input events such as mouse click touch or keyboard events to identify the time of receiving the first and second inputs. In various embodiments the user inputs may be touch inputs e.g. presses swipes taps etc. text inputs e.g. typed words etc. spoken or verbal inputs e.g. voice commands etc. and or visual inputs e.g. gestures etc. .

The second application may not be considered to be interrupting an on going user input when the second application gains control of the foreground a certain time after the user entered inputs e.g. text voice etc. . Thus in determination block the wireless communication device may determine whether the first input was received within a first time threshold of the change in control. In other words when the time in between receiving the first input and the detected change in control exceeds the first time threshold then the second input may not likely be a continuation of the first input i.e. it may be inferred that the user intended the second input to be associated with the second application . The first time threshold may be a predefined value such as a half second s and or may be based on user preferences. In an embodiment the wireless communication device may compare the predefined first time threshold value to a calculated value representing the difference in the time of receipt associated with the identified first input with the time of the change in control. If the first input was received outside of the first time threshold of the change in control i.e. determination block No in block the wireless communication device may associate the second input with the second application. For example when the first input was received a number of seconds e.g. thirty seconds etc. prior to the second application gaining control of the foreground the wireless communication device may interpret the second input to be intended for the second application.

If the first input was received within of the first time threshold of the change in control i.e. determination block Yes in determination block the wireless communication device may determine whether the second input occurred within a second time threshold of the change in control. In other words when the time in between the detected change of control and receiving the second input exceeds the second time threshold then the second input may be presumed not to be a continuation of the first input i.e. it may be inferred that the user intended the second input to be associated with the second application . The operations in the determination block may be similar to those described above with reference to determination block except that the wireless communication device may use the time of receiving the second input instead of the time of receiving the first to calculate the time window to compare to the predefined second threshold value. In various embodiments the first time threshold and the second time threshold may be the same value.

If the second input was received outside of the second time threshold i.e. determination block No in block the wireless communication device may associate the second input with the second application. However if the second input was received within the second time threshold i.e. determination block Yes in block the wireless communication device may associate the second input with the first application. In other words the wireless communication may determine that user input for the first application was interrupted by the second application taking control of the foreground and so the second input may be associated with the first application. In optional block the wireless communication device may return control of the foreground to the first application. For example via the arbiter the wireless communication device may send a flag to the first application indicating that has priority to control the foreground based on the determination that user input was interrupted.

In various embodiments instead of performing the operations in determination blocks the wireless communication device may be configured to simply compare the time between receiving the first and second inputs with a predefined threshold value. For example once the wireless communication device determines that the first input is received before the change in control and the second input was received after the change in control the wireless communication device may only need to compare the measured time between the two receipts to determine whether the second input may be associated with the second application.

In various embodiments the wireless communication device may utilize various factors rule sets balancing tests weighting schemes and other logic for determining whether received user inputs e.g. voice text gestures etc. are intended for the first or second application. For example in addition to evaluating time measurements as described above the wireless communication device may also evaluate no op touch events and the location of detected touch inputs to determine whether the user intended to change the focus of the foreground of the device corresponding to received user inputs e.g. a stream of typed text . As an illustration the wireless communication device may identify whether a touch input was detected coincident to the second application text box to determine whether a focus change relative to the second input was intentional.

Another technique for disambiguating user inputs intended for a first and a second application may include generating a prompt dialog box that requests or invites additional user input or selection input . illustrates an embodiment display of a wireless communication device rendering a first user interface for a first application a second user interface for a second application coming to the foreground and a prompt dialog box inviting a selection input for disambiguating input.

As an example a user of the wireless communication device may intend to enter the text input Hello world into the first user interface of the first application. The first user interface is shown to be associated with a first input text Hello wo such as an input typed into the wireless communication device via a touchpad or soft keyboard. The first user interface may be associated with the first input text as the first application was controlling the foreground of the wireless communication device at the time the first input text was received or typed in .

The second user interface is shown in to not have any associated input. However the prompt dialog box may include a second input text rld as well as arrow UI elements prompting the user to pick the application that should be associated with the second input text. In particular the first arrow UI element may be configured to associate the second input text with the first application when selected and the second arrow UI element may be configured to associate the second input text with the second application when selected.

In block the wireless communication device may detect a change in control of the foreground from a first application to a second application. In block the wireless communication device may identify a first input occurring before the change in control and a second input occurring after the change in control. In determination block the wireless communication device may determine whether the first input was received within a first time threshold of the change in control. If the first input was received outside of the first time threshold of the change in control i.e. determination block No in block the wireless communication device may associate the second input with the second application. If the first input was received within of the first time threshold of the change in control i.e. determination block Yes in determination block the wireless communication device may determine whether the second input occurred within a second time threshold of the change in control. If the second input was received outside of the second time threshold i.e. determination block No in block the wireless communication device may associate the second input with the second application.

However if the second input was received within the second time threshold i.e. determination block Yes in block the wireless communication device may render prompt information requesting subsequent user selection inputs for associating the second input. For example the wireless communication device may render a pop up dialog box a sound e.g. a musical sample a tone a chirp an automated audible message etc. and or a visual s e.g. a displayed text message a rendered symbol etc. that indicate further user inputs are needed to determine the intended application for the second input. The rendered prompt information may be considered a refinement to the purely time based determination as described above with reference to . In other words the prompt information may only be generated when the wireless communication device determines that the second input was received within a second time window after the second application gained control of the foreground and the first input was received within a first time window before the change of control occurred. In this way the prompt information may only be rendered in situations in which the intention of the user is especially ambiguous i.e. the receipt of the second input is very close in time to either the change in control or the receipt of the first input . In an embodiment when the wireless communication device is configured to render prompt information to disambiguate inputs the first and second time thresholds may represent larger or smaller time windows based on a user preference.

In an embodiment the wireless communication device may render audible prompt information that may indicate the change in control and that may be heard by a user even when he she is not looking at the device. For example when a user is entering input via speech to text or voice command mode into a first application e.g. a notepad application executing on the wireless communication device the user may not be looking at the wireless communication device s display and thus may not see when the second application e.g. a timed calendar pop up gains control of the foreground. So in order to notify the user the wireless communication device may emit a special tone chirp music sound or message e.g. Switching to second application that indicates the change of control or change of focus . In an embodiment when receiving voice inputs e.g. speech to text input voice data during a voice command mode voice data for a phone call etc. the wireless communication device may periodically render background sounds that indicate the application currently in control of the foreground. For example the wireless communication device may emit a first unique background noise or tone while the first application is in the foreground and may emit a second unique background noise or tone while the second application is in the foreground.

In determination block the wireless communication device may determine whether a selection input or user selection input indicating the second input is associated with the first app is received. For example the wireless communication device may determine whether it detects a touch input or other button press corresponding to an arrow UI element on a pop up dialog box that corresponds with associating the second input e.g. the text rld with the first application. As another example the wireless communication device may determine whether it detects a voice command e.g. switch back keep with the first application revert to first etc. indicating the second input is associated with the first application. As yet another example the wireless communication device may determine whether it detects a predefined visual gesture command e.g. imagery captured by a camera that represents the user swiping his hand to a certain side imagery that represents the user making a certain hand signal imagery that represents the user frowning smiling etc. indicating the second input is associated with the first application. In various embodiments the wireless communication device may be configured to process received selection inputs using software methods or routines for image processing facial recognition natural language processing and or other speech analysis. The wireless communication device may further be configured to compare received selection inputs e.g. spoken words on screen gestures etc. to stored libraries or known patterns words images and symbols in order to determine whether the selection input indicates the second input is associated with the second or first application.

In an embodiment the wireless communication device may be configured to receive certain selection inputs such as special voice commands or on screen gestures that disable changes in control. In other words the wireless communication device may receive or record a voice command spoken phrase or physical gesture e.g. hand signal swipe etc. while the first application is in the foreground that informs the wireless communication device and arbiter ahead of time that in no circumstance should the current focus and associated inputs be interrupted. For example during execution of a first application video call in the foreground the wireless communication may record a voice command that indicates that the focus should not be changed until the video call has completed e.g. Stay on call until I m done .

If the selection input indicating the second input is associated with the first application is not received i.e. determination block No in block the wireless communication device may associate the second input with the second application. However if the selection input indicating the second input is associated with the first application is received i.e. determination block Yes in block the wireless communication device may associate the second input with the first application.

In block the wireless communication device may detect a change in control of the foreground from a first application to a second application. In block the wireless communication device may identify a first input occurring before the change in control and a second input occurring after the change in control. In determination block the wireless communication device may determine whether the first input was received within a first time threshold of the change in control. If the first input was received outside of the first time threshold of the change in control i.e. determination block No in block the wireless communication device may associate the second input with the second application. If the first input was received within of the first time threshold of the change in control i.e. determination block Yes in determination block the wireless communication device may determine whether the second input occurred within a second time threshold of the change in control. If the second input was received outside of the second time threshold i.e. determination block No in block the wireless communication device may associate the second input with the second application.

However if the second input was received within the second time threshold i.e. determination block Yes in block the wireless communication device may evaluate the content of the first and second inputs. The content to be evaluated may include the grammar spelling punctuation format context and interpreted meaning of the first and second inputs. The wireless communication device may perform natural language processing speech recognition and or pattern matching routines to interpret the content of the inputs and determine whether the first and second inputs are connected. For example the wireless communication device may evaluate the inputs to determine that the second input e.g. rld is a continuation of the first input e.g. Hello Wo . As another example the wireless communication device may determine that the first input is a spoken input that indicates a final or conclusive statement or word e.g. hold on. and the second input is a different spoken input that indicates a separate communication e.g. Hi are you there . Based on the evaluations the wireless communication device may interpret whether the first and second inputs make sense together or are otherwise appropriate for use with the first application.

In various embodiments the content of the inputs e.g. the grammar wording punctuation format spelling formatting and contextual or interpreted meaning of the inputs may be evaluated by the wireless communication device to determine whether the first input and or second input are related with the first and or second application. The wireless communication may evaluate the inputs to identify partial words and phrases and or whether the inputs include application specific content or formatting e.g. the second input may include the name of the second application or a contact name that is only associated with the second application etc. . For example the wireless communication device may detect when the second input names a business partner whose name is stored for use with the second application e.g. a business email client but not the first application e.g. a script editor app . As another example the wireless communication device may detect when the second input includes slang e.g. lol or other informal abbreviations e.g. no capital letters at the beginning of sentences etc. that may only be used by the user in an SMS messaging application but not in a business email client.

In an embodiment the wireless communication device may further interpret the content of the second input in relation to the format or expected type of data to be used within the second application. For example the wireless communication may evaluate whether the spoken word second input e.g. hello is appropriate or correct for an input element for the second application e.g. does hello make sense entered into a web form text field related to a billing address . As another example if the second input is the name of a city e.g. San Diego the wireless communication device may determine that the second input is appropriate for the text box having focus in the second application.

In block the wireless communication device may evaluate the time between the launch of the second application and the time of the change in control or switch in focus such as by finding the elapsed time between the launch time of the second application and the change in the control. The wireless communication device may interpret the order of the launch of the second application the receipt of the first and or second inputs and the change in control. For example the wireless communication device may evaluate the time of launching a browser app when typed text was received and when the browser app actually popped up to interpret whether the typed text was intended for the browser. In an embodiment the wireless communication device may determine that the second input is less likely to be associated with the second application the greater the time in between when the second application was launched and when the second application takes control of the foreground. In other words when the second application takes a long time to load from a launch time e.g. the time the user clicked on an executable etc. the wireless communication device may receive inputs associated with the first application as the user is multi tasking while waiting for the second application. For example a user who is quickly typing into the first application e.g. a notepad may launch the second application e.g. a browser app while typing and continue typing with the first application while waiting for the second application to fully load and control the foreground. As another example if the second application was launched several minutes ago e.g. ten minutes etc. the wireless communication device may evaluate the second input text as likely being associated with the first application. However if the second application was launched only a few seconds ago then the wireless communication device may evaluate the second input text as likely being associated with the second application.

In various embodiments the wireless communication device may evaluate the recentness and or order of the user s actions to launch the second application. In particular the wireless communication device may evaluate received user inputs on a soft keyboard or buttons whether the user actively initiated the launch of the second application e.g. was it auto scheduled or the result of a user input user actions or inputs in between the launch of the second application and the change in control the time between receiving a user input e.g. button press corresponding with a new screen on the second application and the launch time of the second application and the time between the last entry in a previous screen of the first application and a subsequent button press. As a non limiting illustration based on a detected user input to launch the second application historical information indicating the second application typically takes a significant time to obtain control of the foreground after being launched another detected user input to launch the first application e.g. a phone app receiving typed text inputs e.g. a phone number and an eventual change of control to the second application the wireless communication device may determine that button presses are all tight together and conclude that the user likely intends to start a call with the first application.

In an embodiment the wireless communication device may also evaluate stored historical information e.g. heuristics such as data describing the average launch or load times for various applications resident on the wireless communication device computer platform. Based on evaluating prior experiences the wireless communication device may determine the likelihood that a user may know approximately when the second application will pop up and therefore would have timed his input accordingly. For example the wireless communication device may compare the current time from launch to controlling the foreground for a web browser application to the historical average load times for the web browser application to determine whether the user may have expected the second input text data to be associated with the web browser application.

In determination block the wireless communication device may determine whether the user intended to switch the focus of the foreground based on the evaluations i.e. the evaluated content and or the evaluated launch time such as by using conclusions from the evaluations described above with reference to the operations in blocks . In other words the wireless communication device may use interpretations of the inputs and or the launch time of the second application to infer whether the user meant to provide the second input to the second application. The wireless communication device may utilize various rule sets balancing systems weighting schemes and decision making equations for making the determination. For example based on the evaluation of the language analysis of the first and second inputs that indicates the first input e.g. typed text of hold on . . . is unrelated to the second input e.g. typed text of are you there the wireless communication device may determine the user did intend to switch focus. As another example when the wireless communication device is unable to clearly determine the intended meaning of the language of the first and second inputs e.g. the received inputs are seemingly random characters misspelled using unknown shorthand etc. the wireless communication device may place more emphasis on the evaluation of the time in between launching the second application and the time it gained control of the foreground.

If it is not determined that the user intended to switch input windows based on the evaluations i.e. determination block No in block the wireless communication device may associate the second input with the second application. However if it is determined that the user intended to switch input windows based on the evaluations i.e. determination block Yes in block the wireless communication device may associate the second input with the first application.

In various embodiments the wireless communication device may evaluate the content of the first and second inputs in combination with or in place of the various evaluations of timing information i.e. the operations in determination blocks and block in order to determine the application to which the second input should be associated. For example the wireless communication device may evaluate only the grammar and or word meaning of the first and second typed inputs to determine whether the second input is associated with the first application regardless of the time in between receiving the first and second inputs. As another example the wireless communication device may use the evaluation of time between launch and change in control as one of a plurality of factors in identifying the application associated with the second input. As another example even when the first input is determined to not be within the first time threshold and or the second input is determined to not be within the second time threshold the wireless communication may be configured to evaluate the content of the first and second inputs to determine whether the user intended the second input to be applied to the second application.

In block the wireless communication device may detect a change in control of the foreground window from a first application to a second application. In block the wireless communication device may identify a second input occurring after the change in the control such as a touch input on a user interface. In optional block the wireless communication device may identify a first input occurring before the change in the control. The operations in blocks may be similar to as described above with reference to block however the operations for identifying the first input may be optional as the user may only provide a single input i.e. the second input that needs to be associated by the wireless communication device.

In optional determination block the wireless communication device may determine whether the first input was received within a first time threshold of the change in control. If the first input was received outside of the first time threshold of the change in control i.e. optional determination block No in block the wireless communication device may associate the second input with the second application. If the first input was received within of the first time threshold of the change in control i.e. optional determination block Yes the wireless communication device may determine whether the second input occurred within a second time threshold of the change in control in determination block . For example the wireless communication device may determine whether a user interface element press was detected within a certain number of milliseconds seconds etc. from the change of control to the second application. As another example the wireless communication device may compare the time or timestamp of a detected UI button event with the time that the second application obtained control of the foreground. If the second input was received outside of the second time threshold i.e. determination block No the wireless communication device may associate the second input with the second application in block . For example because a UI element press event was detected a few seconds after the second application gained control of the foreground the wireless communication device may determine the press was intended for the second application.

However if the second input was received within the second time threshold i.e. determination block Yes in block the wireless communication device may identify a user interface UI element of the second application coinciding with the second input e.g. a detected UI touch input . For example the wireless communication device may compare the screen coordinates associated with the second input e.g. a detected UI input having certain x axis and y axis coordinates to the areas of the display that correspond to the various UI elements rendered for the second application. In other words the wireless communication device may identify the soft button text field or other rendered element that the user clicked pressed or otherwise engaged with the second input. In an embodiment the wireless communication device may evaluate raster information or other graphics data to identify the UI element.

In determination block the wireless communication device may determine whether the identified UI element of the second application coincides with a UI element of the first application. For example the wireless communication device may compare the screen coordinates of the identified UI element to all UI elements that were previously in the foreground with the first application. The wireless communication device may utilize a threshold to determine any similarly placed UI elements of the first application i.e. the identified second application UI element may not need to be placed exactly on top of a first application UI element to match . If the identified UI element does not coincide with a UI element of the first application i.e. determination block No the wireless communication device may associate the second input with the second application in block . In other words as the second input e.g. a UI touch input was received within a certain time of the second application gaining control of the foreground but there were no similarly placed UI elements for the first application the wireless communication device may infer the user likely intended to interact with the second application.

However if the identified UI element does coincide with a UI element of the first application i.e. determination block Yes in block the wireless communication device may associate the second input with the first application. In other words as the second input e.g. a UI touch input was received within a certain time of the second application gaining control of the foreground and the first and second applications had similarly placed UI elements the wireless communication device may infer that the user likely intended to interact with the first application. In various embodiments the wireless communication device may utilize various other factors such as time from launch of the second application to determine whether the second input was intended for the second or first application.

As described above in various embodiments multiple applications may be simultaneously executing on the processor of the wireless communication device as background processes or suspended applications while a primary application controls the foreground or display . For example a second application may be suspended or configured to run in suspended mode in the background of the wireless communication device as a first application controls the foreground. Although the suspended applications may not be active e.g. not controlling the foreground any suspended application may become active and come to foreground such as in response to receiving a flag from the arbiter as described above. For example in response to receiving from the operating system a notification event corresponding to a received SMS message the arbiter or arbiter app may notify a first application to control the foreground i.e. the first application is instructed to stay active in the foreground and prohibit a second application from coming to the foreground i.e. the second application is instructed to stay inactive the background .

However inactive applications may still attempt to come to the foreground regardless of the actions of the arbiter. For example a second application that did not receive a flag from the arbiter permitting the second application to come to the foreground may still perform operations to gain control of the foreground. Such non compliant or rogue applications may attempt to override priority determinations of the arbiter based on data or preferences available to the applications but not the arbiter. For example a non compliant application may store local hidden or unregistered configurations information that indicates the application typically obtains control of the foreground at a random time of day. In such a case the wireless communication device may terminate the non compliant applications. In various embodiments such terminations may be performed by the wireless communication device via an arbiter that may be part of the operating system of the wireless communication device or otherwise have administrative privileges that may enable the arbiter to directly control other applications.

In determination block the wireless communication device may determine whether a non compliant application acted to control the foreground such as by coming to the foreground without having received a priority flag from an arbiter. In an embodiment the wireless communication device may make this determination by periodically comparing the identity of the application currently controlling the foreground to the identity of the priority application determined via arbitration operations as described above. In another embodiment the wireless communication device may make this determination by comparing the identity of the application currently controlling the foreground to the identity of the priority application determined via arbitration in response to detecting a change in control or other status change or receiving an unexpected event notification e.g. a signal indicating a switch in focus etc. . If it is not determined the non compliant application acted to control foreground i.e. determination block No the wireless communication device may continue with operations to monitor for and process other event notifications.

However if it is determined the non compliant application acted to control the foreground i.e. determination block Yes in block the wireless communication device may terminate or shut down the non compliant application such as by sending a terminate signal or suspend message to the non compliant application. In an embodiment the wireless communication device via the arbiter may not only terminate the non compliant application shutting it down but may also prohibit the non compliant application from running again. For example during a period e.g. millisecond second etc. after the termination of the non compliant application the wireless communication device via the arbiter may monitor for subsequent attempts by the non compliant application to launch and or control the foreground and may repeat the operations in block . In optional block the wireless communication device may re send the flag to the application having priority such as the priority application determined via the operations described above with reference to or .

A non compliant application may be configured to override suspend messages sent by the wireless communication device such as via the arbiter. For example based on information not available to an arbiter app the non compliant application may ignore a received suspend message or terminal signal in order to maintain control of the foreground. This case may occur when the wireless communication device does not have upgraded software e.g. out of date arbiter routines app or software .
