This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 13 157 959 filed on Jun. 10 2011 status allowed which claims benefit of application Ser. No. 12 186 111 filed on Aug. 5 2008 status abandoned.

The invention generally relates to a system and method of tracking and or organizing email and in particular a system and method for tagging email in Web 2.0 applications and using the tags in tag clouds.

Electronic mail e.g. e mail is a store and forward method of writing sending receiving and saving messages that has become ubiquitous in today s society used for both personal and business applications. Email is a system based on the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP that can be used in a distributed computing environment over many different platforms and network systems. For example email can be useful and is applicable to various mainframe minicomputer or intranet systems allowing users within one organization to send messages to each other in support of workgroup collaboration. Intranet systems may be based on proprietary protocols supported by a particular system vendor or on the same protocols used on public networks.

Messages are exchanged between hosts using the SMTP using software programs called mail transfer agents MTA . Users can download their messages from servers with standard protocols such as the POP or IMAP protocols or using a proprietary protocol specific to Lotus Notes Lotus Notes is a registered trademark of International Business Machines as one example. EMail can be stored on the client on the server side or in both places.

In a typical email exchange several steps may take place in order to have an email exchange. For example the user may select an address from an address book compose an email and then send the email to the recipient. Once the email is sent the MUA Mail User Application formats the message in a usable format such as for example Internet email format and uses the SMTP to send the message to the local MTA. The MTA looks at the destination address provided in the SMTP protocol and the domain name to find the mail exchange servers accepting messages for that domain. The appropriate DNS server responds with a record listing the mail exchange servers for that domain. The message is then sent and stored on the selected mail exchange server. This is typically referred to as point to point email. The recipient can then retrieve the email.

In point to point emails the recipient receives the email directly from his or her mail server. Problematic though is that the recipient can receive hundreds of emails in the course of a day of over another time period. This can add up to thousands of emails over a course of a week or longer. As such it becomes very difficult to organize these emails and determine their importance and or priorities.

In a first aspect of the invention a computing system includes first program instructions to generate tag clouds having tags linked to associated emails in a collaborative application. A computer readable media stores the first program instructions and a central processing unit executes the first program instructions.

In another aspect of the invention a method for generating tag clouds for emails is stored in a central location and accessible to a collaborative community. The method comprises providing a computer infrastructure operable to generate the tag clouds from one or more descriptors provided by authorized users having access to a select group of the emails the descriptors being associated with tags that are linked to the emails.

In another aspect of the invention a computer program product is provided for protecting web applications from malicious attacks. The computer program product comprises a computer readable medium first program instructions to provide authorization to selected users to review emails in a central location second program instructions to generate tags from descriptive words describing content in the emails and place the tags into the tag clouds third program instructions to hyperlink the tags to selected ones of the emails and fourth program instructions to filter the tag clouds. The first second third and fourth program instructions are stored on the computer readable media and executed on a central processing unit.

The invention generally relates to a system and method of tracking and or organizing email and in particular a system and method for tagging email in Web 2.0 applications and using the tags in tag clouds. The invention is particularly well suited to organize emails and determine their importance and or priorities using tag clouds. This can be accomplished within a collaborative environment such as for example in Web 2.0 applications.

More specifically in embodiments email will be sent to a central location which features a subscription model compared to a point to point email system . The subscription model enables the email sender email recipient and or administrator of the Web 2.0 collaborative email site to select the authorized users. The authorized users may in turn tag the emails with such descriptive words which are then converted into tags within tag clouds. In implementation the tag clouds will allow users the ability to easily find relevant emails and as importantly navigate and filter emails amongst hundreds and even thousands or more of emails.

Those of skill in the art will recognize that Web 2.0 is a term to describe World Wide Web technology aimed at information sharing and collaboration. These concepts have led web based communities such as wikis blogs and other social networking sites that encourage user participation. Also a tag cloud is a stylized way of visually representing occurrences of words used to describe tags where a tag is an html encoded link that can be accessed using any number of web browsing applications.

In embodiments the tag cloud is generated in real time and the appearance of one or more words within the tag cloud may change each time a user tags an email with a descriptive word. Once a tag cloud is created from the user assigned words a user may select a word from the tag cloud wherein the word is hyperlinked or otherwise connected to one or more relevant emails. The user can then select the most appropriate email from the list of emails.

As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art the present invention may be embodied as a system method or computer program product. Accordingly the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment an entirely software embodiment including firmware resident software micro code etc. or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a circuit module or system. Furthermore the present invention may take the form of a computer program product embodied in any tangible medium of expression having computer usable program code embodied in the medium.

Any combination of one or more computer usable or computer readable storage device s may be utilized. The computer usable or computer readable storage device may be for example but not limited to an electronic magnetic optical or semiconductor system apparatus device. More specific examples a non exhaustive list of the computer readable storage device would include the following 

In the context of this document a computer usable or computer readable storage device may be any storage device that can contain or store the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system apparatus or device. The terms computer readable storage device and computer readable storage devices do not include signal propagation media such as a copper cable optical fiber or wireless transmission media.

Computer program code for carrying out operations of the present invention may be written in any combination of one or more programming languages including an object oriented programming language such as Java Smalltalk C AJAX JSON e.g. to present a tag cloud on the email client or the like and conventional procedural programming languages such as the C programming language or similar programming languages. The program code may execute entirely on the user s computer partly on the user s computer as a stand alone software package partly on the user s computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server. In the latter scenario the remote computer may be connected to the user s computer through any type of network. This may include for example a local area network LAN or a wide area network WAN or the connection may be made to an external computer for example through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider .

The computing device includes a Tag Cloud Generator module or program code configured to make computing device operable to perform the services described herein. The Tag Cloud Generator can be implemented as one or more program codes stored in memory A as separate or combined modules. In an illustrative example the Tag Cloud Generator is configured to generate tag clouds for tagging emails in Web 2.0 applications.

More specifically the Tag Cloud Generator can generate a tag cloud having one or more user assigned words or other descriptors symbols letters numbers etc. within the tag cloud wherein the user assigned words may be visually distinguishable from one another and connected to the emails e.g. via a hyperlink. By using the tag clouds users have the ability to easily find relevant emails and as importantly easily navigate and filter emails by simply selecting a term or terms in the tag cloud. The Tag Cloud Generator also allows the authorized users to add go delete from and or otherwise edit the tag cloud.

The Tag Cloud Generator can score or weight the words assigned by the users. The score weight is representative of how important or popular a user assigned word is within the collaborative website. Any number of factors may be considered when scoring weighing the words such as the number of times the word is associated with one or more emails associated with a certain topic etc.

In embodiments an interface to the Tag Cloud Generator can present the tag cloud with words tags to the user with the most used or highest scored or weighted words being shown in larger or bolder text for example. More specifically the tag cloud displays the user assigned words differently within the tag cloud based on their importance or popularity within the online community. For example embodiments may change the size color font location etc. of a word to indicate to a user the usage of a word in a plurality of emails. Hence a user presented with a word in red Arial point bold font can infer the word is associated with more emails than a word presented in black Times New Roman 12 point font. Each of the words in the tag cloud may be hyperlinked or otherwise connected to the associated emails for display on the user s computing device.

The Tag Cloud Generator features or is associated with a subscription tool that enables the email sender email recipient and or administrator of the Web 2.0 collaborative email site infrastructure of to select authorized users. These authorized users will have the ability to tag emails within the collaborative site in order to show visually words that have been or are associated with emails. In the case of the email sender the email can include a tag window shown in which allows the email sender to provide a descriptive word or words describing the content of the email at the time of sending of the email. These tag windows can also be displayed to the other authorized users. The Tag Cloud Generator will use the words or other descriptors to generate a tag cloud.

As to the authorized users including the email sender each may have access to review the emails and tag them with descriptive words or descriptors to generate the tag clouds. As such this community of authorized users can tag emails so that the tags can be visually displayed in the tag cloud. In embodiments the tag cloud is generated in real time using the Tag Cloud Generator . That is as the authorized email sender email recipient and or administrator can provide descriptive word or words which can be immediately included in the tag cloud. Once a tag cloud is created a recipient sender or other authorized user may select a word from the tag cloud which is hyperlinked or otherwise connected to one or more relevant emails.

The Tag Cloud Generator also features or is associated with a filtering tool . The filtering tool allows an email user to filter the words to include for example more or less words in the tag cloud. The filter tool can also be configured to highlight words that are above a certain threshold or have other user configurations that enable the email recipient to easily organize certain emails. The filtering tool may also filter based on authorized users. For example the email recipient can filter the tag cloud to include tags provided by only the most trusted users or those users known to have the most knowledge in a certain field that is germane to the email recipient s current search and or needs.

The computing device also includes a processor memory A an I O interface and a bus . The memory A can include local memory employed during actual execution of program code bulk storage and cache memories which provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution. In addition the computing device includes random access memory RAM a read only memory ROM and a CPU.

The computing device is in communication with the external I O device resource and the storage system B. For example the I O device can comprise any device that enables an individual to interact with the computing device or any device that enables the computing device to communicate with one or more other computing devices using any type of communications link. The external I O device resource may be for example the handheld device.

In general the processor executes computer program code such as the DNS Request Validation Service Tool which can be stored in the memory A and or storage system B. While executing the computer program code the processor can read and or write data to from memory A storage system B and or I O interface . The program code executes the processes of the invention. The bus provides a communications link between each of the components in the computing device .

The computing device can comprise any general purpose computing article of manufacture capable of executing computer program code installed thereon e.g. a personal computer server handheld device etc. . However it is understood that the computing device is only representative of various possible equivalent computing devices that may perform the processes described herein. To this extent in embodiments the functionality provided by the computing device can be implemented by a computing article of manufacture that includes any combination of general and or specific purpose hardware and or computer program code. In each embodiment the program code and hardware can be created using standard programming and engineering techniques respectively.

Similarly the server is only illustrative of various types of computer infrastructures for implementing the invention. For example in embodiments the server comprises two or more computing devices e.g. a server cluster that communicate over any type of communications link such as a network a shared memory or the like to perform the process described herein. Further while performing the processes described herein one or more computing devices on the server can communicate with one or more other computing devices external to the server using any type of communications link. The communications link can comprise any combination of wired and or wireless links any combination of one or more types of networks e.g. the Internet a wide area network a local area network a virtual private network etc. and or utilize any combination of transmission techniques and protocols.

In embodiments the invention provides a business method that performs the steps of the invention on a subscription advertising and or fee basis. In this case the service provider can create maintain deploy support etc. the computer infrastructure that performs the process steps of the invention for one or more customers. These customers may be for example any third party computing system. In return the service provider can receive payment from the customer s under a subscription and or fee agreement and or the service provider can receive payment from the sale of advertising content to one or more third parties.

Specifically. illustrates an embodiment of an interface for a Tag Cloud Generator and its representative features. For example the interface can include a tag tab and a people tag discussed with reference to . The tag tab directs the user to the tag cloud and its related functions. These functions can include for example a list of active tags and filtered tag function . The active tags are those words shown representatively at reference numeral . The active tags can be entered by the user directly into the tag cloud at location .

In the words are of different fonts sizes and shapes indicating a weight or usage give to the words or other descriptors e.g. how many times the community has used the word to describe one or more emails. In this non limiting illustrative example the tag cloud graphically shows the more popular words in larger type. Therefore the most used word in is IBM and the least used word is wiki to describe the content of the emails. In this example the user can easily identify emails that contain content associated with IBM such as for example product lists services etc.

By the user selecting IBM in the tag cloud all emails associated with IBM will be displayed to the user as the word IBM has been linked to such emails by the Tag Cloud Generator. That is the words appearing in the tag cloud may be hyperlinked or otherwise connected to a list of relevant emails whereby a user can click on a word appearing in the tag cloud and be directed to one or more relevant emails.

It should be understood that other schemes can also be used such as for example color font type etc. to determine the importance of a word. For example in addition to changing the size color font etc. of a word in a tag cloud embodiments may also change the location of words within a tag cloud to illustrate the importance of one or more words within the tag cloud.

The filter tag associated with the filter tool may be used by the user to filter words such as for example connections etc. This will allow the user to view only certain words above a threshold. For example the word connections can be filtered e.g. removed from the tag cloud if it was used less than two times i.e. below a threshold. In embodiments the filter tag can include a search box for the user to search for certain words that may be associated with content of emails. The filter tag may be controlled by a metering system . The filter can be configured to highlight words that are above a certain threshold or have other user configurations that enable the email recipient to easily organize certain emails.

Referring to at step a user starts the email client. At step the email is composed on the email client. In an optional embodiment at step the sender can choose to tag the email at the stage. The tagging is accomplished with the aid of the Tag Cloud Generator . In embodiments the email sender can provide descriptive word or words which can be immediately included in the tag cloud. Once a tag cloud is created a recipient sender or other authorized user may select a word from the tag cloud which is hyperlinked or otherwise connected to one or more relevant emails.

At step the email gets published on the RSS server as an RSS feed document. At step authorized uses can add additional tags to the email with the aid of the Tag Cloud Generator . That is as the authorized user can provide descriptive word or words which can be immediately included in the tag cloud. At step an RSS feed to the email RSS document is sent to the recipients at which time the recipient can interact with the tagged email at step . Some of the iterations include search emails by a keyword used during tagging. Search emails by a name used as a tag or even add additional tags for later retrieval and or social interaction with additional users.

If the tagging widget is loaded at step the user creates a new tag. At step the tagging widget determines whether the tag is a new tag or an existing tag. This can be done by a look up to a database. If the tag is an existing tag at step the tagging widget retrieves the tag and at step presents the tag to the user. At step the tagging widget records use of the tag. If the tag is a new tag at step the tagging widget captures the tag. At step the tagging widget determines whether there are any additional tags. If not at step the email is posted as an RSS document to the RSS server. If there are any additional tags the process reverts back to step .

If the tagging widget is loaded at step the user creates a new tag. At step the tagging widget determines whether the tag is a new tag or an existing tag. In embodiments the program control checks with a Back End BE component for the creation state of the tag. If the BE component returns an existing state flag the program control retrieves the tag from the BE component at step . At step the tagging widget presents the tag to the user. At step the tagging widget captures the user decision and records use of the tag. Also if the tag is an existing tag as determined at step at step the tagging widget captures the tag. At step the tagging widget determines if there are any additional tags. If yes then the process returns to step . If not the tagging widget updates the email as an RSS document to the RSS server.
