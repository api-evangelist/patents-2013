title: Synchronizing an application on a companion device
abstract: A media server machine may be configured to provide media content within a datastream. This datastream may be provided to a media device that is configured to present the media content on a display. Also, this datastream may contemporaneously contain an “app-sync indicator” for the media content. The app-sync indicator is a data structure that signals the media device to launch an application on a companion device. By providing the app-sync indicator contemporaneously with the media content in the datastream, the launching of the application on the companion device may be synchronized with the media content. The app-sync indicator may specify the application to be launched. Also, the app-sync indicator may specify supplemental content to be presented by the launched application on the companion device.

The subject matter disclosed herein generally relates to the processing of data. Specifically the present disclosure addresses systems and methods to synchronize an application on a companion device.

Media content may be transmitted over a network e.g. a cable television network the Internet or a satellite television network and received by a media device that is communicatively coupled e.g. by a wired or wireless connection to a display. For example media content in the example form of a television show or sports event may be multiplexed into a transport stream and broadcast via the network to one or more media devices within users homes. Examples of such media devices include integrated receiver decoders IRDs personal video recorders PVRs and other set top boxes STBs that may be connected to a display e.g. a television screen a video monitor or other suitable display device . Such media devices may be configured to present e.g. display the media content on the display.

Example methods and systems are directed to synchronization of an application on a companion device. Examples merely typify possible variations. Unless explicitly stated otherwise components and functions are optional and may be combined or subdivided and operations may vary in sequence or be combined or subdivided. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of example embodiments. It will be evident to one skilled in the art however that the present subject matter may be practiced without these specific details.

A media server machine e.g. a computer system or other processing device may be configured e.g. by one or more software modules to provide media content within a datastream. This datastream may be provided to a media device that is configured to present the media content on a display e.g. a primary display . Also this datastream may contain e.g. contemporaneously an app sync indicator for the media content e.g. an app sync indicator that corresponds to the media content . The app sync indicator is a data structure that signals the media device to launch an application on a companion device e.g. a tablet computer or smart phone operable present additional content on a secondary display . By providing the app sync indicator with the media content e.g. contemporaneously in the datastream the launching of the application on the companion device may be synchronized with the media content.

For example the datastream may be a multiplexed transport stream within which the media content is contained within a program stream and the app sync indicator may take the form of a table e.g. an application information table AIT or other table that is also multiplexed e.g. as carousel data into the same transport stream same program stream or both. This table after being received by the media device may cause the media device to generate and send a launch instruction to the companion device. The launch instruction after being received by the companion device may cause the companion device to launch an application e.g. begin executing the application while the media content is being presented on the display by the media device.

The app sync indicator may specify the application e.g. a mobile app to be launched. Also the app sync indicator may specify supplemental content to be presented by the launched application. For example the app sync indicator may specify that a web browser be launched with a particular uniform resource identifier URI e.g. a uniform resource locator URL as input so that the web browser presents supplemental content identified by that particular URI. As another example supposing the media content is a sports event e.g. a baseball game in which a particular team is playing the app sync indicator may specify that a mobile app e.g. corresponding to the particular team be launched to present supplemental content that corresponds to the sports event e.g. information about individual players on that particular baseball team . As a further example where the media content is a sports event e.g. a football game the app sync indicator may specify that a web browser or app be launched to present supplemental content in the form of streaming video that depicts an alternate camera angle e.g. different from a primary camera angle depicted in the media content . Accordingly the supplemental content may be pertinent to the media content may correspond to the media content and may reference the media content while yet being separate distinct independent and different from the media content. Additional details of various example embodiments are discussed below.

As noted in the media server machine may be or include a cable television server satellite television service or both.

The presentation module is be configured to extract the media content from the datastream and present the media content on the display . The detection module is configured to detect one or more companion devices e.g. companion device being moved e.g. by the user to within physical proximity of the media device for example being moved within a threshold distance of the media device e.g. within IR signal range within wireless networking range or within a predetermined distance as determined by geolocation techniques such as by use of global positioning system GPS data and establish one or more communication links with such detected companion devices. In some example embodiments the server module of the media server machine generates the detection module provides the detection module to the media device or both.

The synchronization module may be or include a DIAL client e.g. configured to launch one or more applications on the companion device which may implement a DIAL server and the synchronization module may be configured to generate and send a launch instruction to one or more companion devices e.g. companion devices and . Such a launch instruction may be generated sent or both based on an app sync indicator provided e.g. contemporaneously with media content within a datastream from the media server machine . For example the launch instruction may be generated and sent in response to the fact that the app sync indicator is provided e.g. contemporaneously with the media content. The launch instruction may specify an application to be launched supplemental content to be presented by the application or both. In some example embodiments the synchronization module forms all or part of an application that is stored by the media device and launched e.g. executed by the media device e.g. in response to the presence of the app sync indicator in the datastream in response to detection of one or more companion devices in response to accessing the datastream in response to user input or any suitable combination thereof .

For example the media device may lack the hardware resources e.g. processor speed or memory to execute the application .

The screen may be a touchscreen e.g. a touch sensitive display screen of the companion device . Accordingly while the media device may present media content on the display e.g. a primary display or primary screen the companion device may present supplemental content on the screen e.g. secondary display or secondary screen .

In operation the provision module of the media server machine provides the datastream to the media device e.g. via the network . The datastream may be provided via any one or more data communication technologies e.g. cable television network satellite television network a cellular telephone network Internet protocol television IPV hypertext transfer protocol live streaming HLS over the top OTT streaming or any suitable combination thereof . Operation may include providing the app sync indicator e.g. contemporaneously with the media content to the media device . For example the app sync indicator may be provided with its presentation time e.g. a time at which the media device takes action on the app sync indicator falling within the presentation times of the media content e.g. a range of times at which the media device presents the media content such as the duration of a clip scene or program . As noted above the media device may be configured to present the media content on the display to detect the companion device and to send a launch instruction to the companion device based on the app sync indicator. As also noted above the companion device may be configured to launch the application in response to the launch instruction sent from the media device .

In operation the detection module of the media device detects the companion device e.g. detects the presence of the companion device within IR range wireless networking range or a predetermined threshold distance of the media device . The media device may thereafter establish a communication link with the detected companion device . In some example embodiments prior to operation the media server machine provides the detection module to the media device .

In operation the reception module of the media device accesses e.g. receives reads or retrieves the datastream provided by the media server machine .

In operation the synchronization module on the media device sends a launch instruction to the companion device e.g. via IR signals or a wireless peer to peer network . The launch instruction may be usable by the companion device to launch the application .

In operation the access module of the companion device receives the launch instruction sent from the media device . The launch instruction may reference the application e.g. a browser . In operation the companion module on the companion device in response to the launch instruction launches the application . Since the time between operations and may be perceived by the user as being subjectively short e.g. under one second the launching of the application may be perceived by the user as being synchronized with the presentation of the media content. The application may cause the access module of the companion device to access supplemental content from the web server machine and the application may cause presentation module of the companion device to present the accessed supplemental content on the screen of the companion device.

In operation the server module generates the synchronization module e.g. for the media device .

One or more of operations and may be performed as part e.g. a precursor task a subroutine or a portion of operation in which the generator module of the media server machine generates the app sync indicator.

In operation the generator module embeds a reference e.g. an identifier or a pointer to the supplemental content for the media content into the app sync indicator. For example the embedded reference may be or include a URI e.g. URL that identifies e.g. names locates or both the supplemental content which corresponds to the media content. This reference may be extracted by the media device and included in the launch instruction sent to the companion device which may launch the application with the reference as an input to the application .

In operation the generator module embeds an identifier of the application into the app sync indicator e.g. a name of the application with or without an authentication code . In situations where multiple applications e.g. application are available for being synchronously launched with the media content embedding the identifier of the application into the app sync indicator enables the media device to send one or more launch instructions based on the app sync indicator identifying the application . For example the media device may send a launch instruction that specifies which application e.g. application is to be synchronously launched with the media content. Accordingly the companion device may launch the application based on the launch instruction identifying the application .

Operation may be performed as part of operation in which the generator module of the media server machine generates the datastream. In operation the generator module embeds the application into the datastream. For example the application may be stored by the database and the generator module may access the application from the database and multiplex the application into the datastream so that the application may be provided within the datastream to the media device for subsequent provision to the companion device . Although the app sync indicator and the media content may be provided contemporaneously together e.g. with each other so that the presentation time of the app sync indicator falls within the presentation times of the media content within the datastream the application may be provided prior to the media content and the app sync indicator within the datastream. In such situations the synchronization module of the media device may provide e.g. relay the application to the companion device for storage thereon so that the application may be launched at the appropriate time e.g. in sync with the media content being presented on the display by the media device . As another example the synchronization module may provide a URL from which the application can be obtained by the companion device .

According to some example embodiments the network may be optimized for broadcast of media content while the network may be optimized for interactive selection and presentation of supplemental content. Operation may be performed as part of operation in which the provision module of the media server machine provides the datastream. In operation the provision module provides the datastream via the network e.g. a first network which may be contrasted with the network e.g. a second network . Operation may be performed with or after operation . In operation the provision module provides the supplemental content via the network e.g. the second network . For example the supplemental content may be stored by the database the media server machine the web server machine or any suitable combination thereof and the supplemental content may be provided by the provision module to the companion device e.g. in response to the launching of the application with a reference to the supplemental content as an input parameter . This providing of the supplemental content may be relayed through the web server machine .

Operation may be performed as part of operation in which the reception module of the media device receives the datastream provided by the media server machine . In operation the reception module receives the application embedded in the datastream. This may enable the synchronization module of the media device to provide e.g. relay the application to the companion device e.g. for storage thereon in preparation for launching the application in sync with the presentation of the media content by the presentation module of the media device on the display .

In operation the synchronization module extracts an identifier e.g. an application name with or without an authentication code of the application from the app sync indicator. As noted above the identifier of the application may be embedded in the app sync indicator and may identify the application among multiple applications. Operation may be performed before during or after operation . In operation the synchronization module determines that the application is on a trusted list e.g. a list of trusted applications among which is the application which may have the effect of providing a degree of security checking that only trusted applications are launched on the companion device . According to various example embodiments this determination may be performed based on the extracted identifier from operation performed in response to the application being received in operation or both. The trusted list may be included e.g. stored in the synchronization module e.g. as generated by the server module of the media server machine or provided to the synchronization module e.g. as an update by the media server machine by the database or by the web server machine e.g. via secure sockets layer SSL communication .

In operation the synchronization module provides the application to the companion device for storage thereon execution thereon or both. In some example embodiments the application is provided via a communication link established between the media device and the companion device e.g. an IR or wireless connection . In situations where the application is already stored on the companion device operation may be omitted. Similarly operation may be omitted in situations where the companion device is configured to obtain retrieve fetch or access the application based on the URL provided by the synchronization module .

In operation the synchronization module extracts the reference to the supplemental content from the app sync indicator e.g. the reference that was embedded in operation . For example the synchronization module may extract a URI e.g. URL that identifies the supplemental content to be presented by the application launched while the media content is being presented on the display . Example embodiments that include operation may also include operation . Operation the synchronization module determines that the reference e.g. the URL is on a trusted list e.g. a list of trusted references to supplemental content such as URLs served by the web server machine which may have the effect of providing a degree of security checking that only trusted references to supplemental content are used. This determination may be performed based on the extracted reference from operation performed in response to the app sync indicator being received in operation or both. The trusted list may be included e.g. stored in the synchronization module e.g. as generated by the server module of the media server machine or provided to the synchronization module e.g. as an update by the media server machine by the database or by the web server machine e.g. via SSL communication .

In operation as shown in the synchronization module causes the media device to present a suggestion that the companion device e.g. specifically as the companion device or generically as one of multiple available companion devices present the supplemental content e.g. referenced by the app sync indicator . For example as shown in operation may include operation in which the synchronization module presents a suggestion on the display e.g. by causing the presentation module of the media device to present the suggestion on the display . As another example shown in operation may include operation in which the synchronization module causes the companion device e.g. via its presentation module its companion module or both to present the suggestion on its screen e.g. by sending a prompt to the companion module of the companion device .

According to various example embodiments the suggestion may take the form of a single icon e.g. a single green button that identifies a button or key on a remote control that is configured to fully or partially control the media device by selecting media content for presentation on the display . Such a single icon may indicate availability of the supplemental content for presentation identify a button or key e.g. on a remote control on the companion device or both that is operable to submit an acceptance of the suggestion to present the supplemental content or both.

In operation as shown in the synchronization module receives an acceptance of the suggestion. For example as shown in operation may include operation in which the synchronization module receives the acceptance from a remote control e.g. remote control device that is configured to fully or partially control the media device . The acceptance may be received by detecting that a button or key on a remote control for the media device has been pressed to indicate that the suggestion is accepted e.g. to indicate that the supplemental content is to be presented . As another example as shown in operation may include operation in which the synchronization module receives the acceptance of the suggestion from the companion device . This may be performed by detecting that a button or key e.g. physical or virtual on the companion device has been pressed to indicate that the suggestion is accepted.

In operation the detection module of the media device determines that the detected companion device is on a trusted list e.g. a list of trusted companion devices among which is the companion device which may have the effect of providing a degree of security checking that only trusted companion devices may be used. This determination may be performed based on e.g. in response to the detection of the companion device in operation . The trusted list may be included e.g. stored in the detection module included in the synchronization module e.g. as generated by the server module of the media server machine or provided to the detection module or the synchronization module e.g. as an update by the media server machine by the database or by the web server machine e.g. via SSL communication .

In operation the detection module of the media device establishes a communication link with the companion device e.g. with its companion module . This communication link may be established based on the companion device being brought within IR range within wireless networking range within a predetermined threshold distance of the media device or any suitable combination thereof. In addition this communication link may be established based on the determination in operation that the detected companion device is on the trusted list. Examples of such a communication link include an IR connection wireless networking connection e.g. personal area network PAN connection such as a Bluetooth connection or any suitable combination thereof.

In operation the detection module of the media device detects one or more additional companion devices e.g. companion device . Such detection of multiple companion devices e.g. companion devices and enables the media device to perform operation in which the presentation module of the media device presents a menu of detected companion devices e.g. companion devices and on the display . The menu may indicate that the detected companion devices are available to present the supplemental content. The presented menu in some example embodiments may be limited to only those detected companion devices that are identified on the trusted list of companion devices. The presented menu may enable one or more users e.g. user or user to select which of the detected companion devices should be used to present the supplemental content. In certain example embodiments the selection may be made from the presented menu e.g. by the user navigating presented menu and making the selection using a remote control for the media device . In some example embodiments the selection may be made from one or more of the detected companion devices e.g. by the user pressing a button or key e.g. physical or virtual on the companion device to select the companion device . In such example embodiments operation may be omitted.

In operation the synchronization module of the media device receives a selection that indicates which companion device e.g. companion device from the presented menu is selected for presenting the supplemental content. For example the selection may be received by detecting that one or more buttons or keys e.g. a navigation up key navigation down key or a selection confirmation key on a remote control for the media device has been pressed indicate the selection. As another example the selection may be performed by detecting that a button or key e.g. physical or virtual on the companion device has been pressed to indicate the selection.

In example embodiments that include operations and the sending of the launch instruction in operation may be performed based on e.g. in response to the selection received in operation . For example the selection may identify the companion device as being selected for presentation of the supplemental content and the launch instruction may be sent in operation to the companion device in accordance with the received selection.

In operation the access module of the companion device receives the application from the media device e.g. as a result of the media device in performing operation . The access module may then store the application on the companion device e.g. in memory . According to various example embodiments operation may be performed before during or after operation .

In operation the companion module of the companion device receives a prompt to present the suggestion discussed above with respect to operation . The prompt may be sent from the synchronization module of the media device . In some example embodiments the companion module receives the prompt via the access module of the companion device .

In operation the companion module presents the suggestion on the screen . For example the companion module may cause presentation module to present the suggestion on the screen . As noted above the suggestion may be or include a single icon that identifies a button or key that if pressed would indicate that the supplemental content is to be presented by the application . An acceptance of the presented suggestion may be received by the screen e.g. as a touch input from the user on the identified button or key .

In operation the companion module of the companion device submits the acceptance of the suggestion to the media device e.g. via its synchronization module . This may enable the media device to provide the launch instruction in operation based on e.g. in response to the acceptance of the suggestion. As noted above in operation the access module of the companion device receives the launch instruction from the media device .

In certain example embodiments the presentation of the suggestion and the detection of the acceptance is handled completely by the companion device . In such example embodiments operations and may be performed after the launch instruction is received in operation . In operation the companion module presents the suggestion on the screen e.g. by causing the presentation module to present the suggestion on the screen . Operation may be performed based on e.g. in response to the launch instruction being received in operation . In operation an acceptance of the presented suggestion is received by the screen e.g. as a touch input from the user . In example embodiments that include operation the launching of the application in operation may be performed based on the detected acceptance of the suggestion.

One or more of operations and may be performed as part of operation in which the companion module of the companion device launches the application on the companion device . In operation the companion module causes the application to obtain and store the supplemental content e.g. as identified in the received launch instruction on the companion device . For example the companion module may cause the application to obtain the supplemental content from the web server machine and then store the supplemental content in a memory e.g. a browser cache of the companion device . This may enable the application to be subsequently launched multiple times to present the supplemental content.

In operation the companion module causes the application to initiate a presentation of the supplemental content on the screen of the companion device . For example the application may initiate the presentation within a browser window of the application where the browser window is rendered to the screen . Accordingly since the application was launched based on the received launch instruction which was sent based on the app sync indicator being received contemporaneously with the media content the screen may launch the application synchronously with the media content being presented on the display . Moreover the screen may immediately display the supplemental content contemporaneously with the presentation of the media content e.g. while the media content is presented on the display .

Furthermore the app sync indicator may correspond to the supplemental content . As indicated in the supplemental content may be or include a webpage or streaming video and the supplemental content may be distinct from the media content but still pertinent to the media content . Likewise the supplemental content may be or include a webpage or streaming video and the supplemental content may be distinct from the media content but nonetheless pertinent to the media content .

The correspondence relationship between the app sync indicator and the media content may arise based on the app sync indicator being provided contemporaneously with the media content within the datastream . For example the contemporaneous provision of the media content and the app sync indicator may be within a short time period e.g. as perceived by the user such as within five seconds of each other. A similar correspondence relationship may exist between the app sync indicator and the media content .

The correspondence relationship between the app sync indicator and the supplemental content may arise based on the app sync indicator being or including an identifier of the supplemental content e.g. URI a reference to the supplemental content e.g. a URL or any suitable combination thereof. A similar correspondence relationship may exist between the app sync indicator and the supplemental content .

In certain example embodiments the full functionality of app sync indicator may be implemented by multiple app sync indicators that each perform just a portion of this full functionality. For example a first app sync indicator may identify the synchronization module of the media device and the media device may launch its synchronization module based on e.g. response to this first app sync indicator being provided in the datastream e.g. provided contemporaneously with the media content in a manner similar to that described above for the app sync indicator . This first app sync indicator may contain no information that identifies the application to be launched by the companion device and this first app sync may contain no information that identifies any supplemental content e.g. supplemental content to be presented by the application . In such a situation a second app sync indicator may be provided in the datastream e.g. contemporaneously with the media content . As an example this second app sync indicator may identify the application as well as the supplemental content to be presented by the application . As another example the synchronization module may have or obtain an identifier of the application e.g. as stored data hard coded data or data accessed from the database the media server machine or the web server machine and the second sync indicator may identify only the supplemental content .

According to various example embodiments one or more of the methodologies described herein may facilitate synchronizing the launching of an application on a companion device. Moreover one or more of the methodologies described herein may enable synchronization of such an application launch with the media content being presented on a display. Furthermore one or more the methodologies described herein may facilitate retrieval and presentation of supplemental content via the synchronized application so that the supplemental content is presented contemporaneously with the media content as the media content is presented on the display.

When these effects are considered in aggregate one or more of the methodologies described herein may obviate a need for certain efforts or resources that otherwise would be involved in synchronizing the launching of an application with media content contemporaneous display of supplemental content with media content or any suitable combination thereof. Efforts expended by a user in identifying launching or synchronizing the display of supplemental content on a companion device while media content is being presented by a media device may be reduced by one or more of the methodologies described herein. Computing resources used by one or more machines databases or devices e.g. within the network environment may similarly be reduced. Examples of such computing resources include processor cycles network traffic memory usage data storage capacity power consumption and cooling capacity.

As an example of a use case the media server machine may embed the app sync indicator in an AIT within the datastream which may include a broadcast audio video stream of a live baseball game as the media content and this AIT may reference a webpage e.g. by including a URL to be opened via a browser as the supplemental content . The media device receives the AIT contemporaneously with audio video content that depicts a particular point or event in the baseball game e.g. such as particular player becoming the current at bat player . In response to the AIT the media device may display a green button on the display for 30 seconds after which the button fades away. The green button may be a single icon and may correspond to a green key on a remote control that is operable by the user to fully or partially control the media device and thereby control what is shown on the display .

On the media device if the green key on the remote control is activated during the 30 second period the synchronization module may request from the detection module a list of nearby companion devices e.g. companion devices and . In some example embodiments the green key may be activated after the 30 second period e.g. if the media device registered a listener for the green key and this listener is still active . The detection module may detect those companion devices that are within a threshold distance and configured with the companion module . Such companion devices e.g. companion devices and may be identified in a list e.g. a menu provided by the detection module to the synchronization module . The synchronization module may then display the list on the display which may allow the user to navigate the list e.g. by pressing one or more arrow keys on the remote control and select which of the listed companion devices e.g. companion device should be used to launch and execute a synchronized application e.g. application . In response to a selection being made the synchronization module sends the launch instruction to the selected one or more companion devices e.g. companion device . In some example embodiments no list of detected companion devices is shown on the display and one or more detected companion devices e.g. identified on a trusted list of companion devices may be automatically selected for launching executing a synchronized application e.g. application .

The launch instruction may include the URL of the webpage which may contain supplemental content that is related to the live baseball game. Such a webpage may include one or more links to supplemental content presentable by the application e.g. supplemental content . Examples of such supplemental content include statistics for each team involved in the baseball game options to select alternate camera angles that depict the live baseball game from different angles and an option to select an alternate audio feed for the live baseball game e.g. a radio broadcaster s announcements that describe the live baseball game play by play which announcements may be more informative than the media content of the live baseball game . The user may independently select his chosen option for his companion device without affecting what is shown by the media device on the display and without affecting what the user may select for presentation on her companion device .

Moreover the live baseball game may depict a current at bat player and the webpage may offer supplemental content that refers to the same player e.g. supplemental content . For example the AIT may contain a reference to the player e.g. by name the launch instruction may include the reference to the player and the application may be launched with the reference to the player as input e.g. as an input parameter for starting the application . The reference may be updated when the current at bat player changes e.g. within a new version of the same AIT or in a new AIT embedded in the datastream . Accordingly the media server machine can embed such references into the datastream as events that dynamically indicate changes to the supplemental content for the live baseball game e.g. a change that replaces the supplemental content with the supplemental content . Any one or more of such events may be processed by the synchronization module of the media device . Furthermore processing such an event may cause the synchronization module to transmit additional synchronization signals e.g. metadata similar to an AIT to the companion module on the device to the application e.g. directly or both.

As an example feature according to various example embodiments the synchronization module of the media device may provide the application on the companion device with an instruction to change the supplemental content in response to the user changing the datastream being accessed e.g. receive by the media device e.g. by the user changing broadcast channels to view a different broadcast datastream . For example this instruction to change the supplemental content may be or include a URL of new supplemental content that corresponds to the new datastream. In some example embodiments this instruction may be provided to the companion module on the companion device and the companion module to a may be configured to provide this URL to the application upon its next launch. Accordingly if the application closed and the user changes channels on the media device the application may be launched with appropriate supplemental content that corresponds to the new channel.

As another example feature according to various example embodiments detection of new companion devices may be dynamic and ongoing. Hence a further user e.g. a newly arrived user beyond users and may bring a further companion device e.g. a newly arrived companion device beyond companion devices and into physical proximity of the media device . The media device may detect this new companion device and in response present the green button as discussed above. This may enable a convenient way to flexibly add additional users for displaying supplemental content. For example if the media content is a game show and the supplemental content is a webpage that lets the users and play along on their respective companion devices and one or more additional users may join the game by pressing the green key and selecting their own companion devices for presenting the webpage.

As a further example feature according to various example embodiments the application may be configured to store some or all of the supplemental content e.g. supplemental content presentable by the application store reference e.g. a URL to some or all of the supplemental content or any suitable combination thereof. This ability to store one or more portions of the supplemental content or references thereto may enable the application to present these portions in a flexible manner depending on network performance e.g. data transfer speeds within the network . For example a recipe from a cooking show may be stored by the application for repeated presentation at a later time e.g. days or months after the presentation of cooking show has ended . The application may be configured to determine an expected network performance e.g. always well connected disconnected on weekends or any other pattern of network performance . Based on this expected network performance the application may determine whether a portion of the supplemental content is to be stored or whether a reference to the portion is to be stored. For example if the network performance is expected to be high at a given time but the actual network performance is low the application may store a reference to portion of the supplemental content so that the portion may be accessed at a later time when the actual network performance is high. As another example if the network performance is expected to be high and the actual network performance is also high the application based store the actual portion of the supplemental content e.g. taking advantage of the high network performance . In some hybrid situations the application may initiate storage of both the portion of the supplemental content and the reference to the supplemental content. Moreover the application may initiate storage of one portion of the supplemental content e.g. a recipe from the cooking show and initiate storage of a reference to another portion of the supplemental content e.g. a video of that recipe being made .

In some example versions of this use case the application e.g. a browser on the companion device is configured to communicate with the presentation module on the media device . The presentation module may include a browser or other suitable software that allows the application on the companion device to present some or all of the supplemental content on the display of the media device . Accordingly the user may choose to activate a button labeled send supplemental content to main screen and allow other users e.g. user to experience the same supplemental content. Such activation may cause some or all of the supplemental content to be sent from the companion device to the media device for presentation on the display . In some example embodiments such activation causes a reference e.g. a URL to some or all of the supplemental content to be sent from the companion device to the media device and the media device may obtain e.g. access some or all of the supplemental content for presentation on the display .

Where multiple companion devices e.g. companion devices and are used according to some example embodiments the application to be launched may vary from companion device to companion device. For example the synchronization module may have e.g. stored or obtain e.g. access or receive a profile for each individual companion device. Such profiles may form all or part of a trusted list of companion devices. The profile for a given companion device e.g. companion device may identify the application e.g. application to be launched. In certain example embodiments the profile for a companion device e.g. companion device is or includes a profile of the primary user e.g. user of the companion device.

The machine includes a processor e.g. a central processing unit CPU a graphics processing unit GPU a digital signal processor DSP an application specific integrated circuit ASIC a radio frequency integrated circuit RFIC or any suitable combination thereof a main memory and a static memory which are configured to communicate with each other via a bus . The machine may further include a graphics display e.g. a plasma display panel PDP a light emitting diode LED display a liquid crystal display LCD a projector or a cathode ray tube CRT . The machine may also include an alphanumeric input device e.g. a keyboard a cursor control device e.g. a mouse a touchpad a trackball a joystick a motion sensor or other pointing instrument a storage unit a signal generation device e.g. a speaker and a network interface device .

The storage unit includes a machine readable medium on which are stored the instructions embodying any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein. The instructions may also reside completely or at least partially within the main memory within the processor e.g. within the processor s cache memory or both during execution thereof by the machine . Accordingly the main memory and the processor may be considered as machine readable media. The instructions may be transmitted or received over a network e.g. network or network via the network interface device .

As used herein the term memory refers to a machine readable medium able to store data temporarily or permanently and may be taken to include but not be limited to random access memory RAM read only memory ROM buffer memory flash memory and cache memory. While the machine readable medium is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium the term machine readable medium should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database or associated caches and servers able to store instructions. The term machine readable medium shall also be taken to include any medium or combination of multiple media that is capable of storing instructions for execution by a machine e.g. machine such that the instructions when executed by one or more processors of the machine e.g. processor cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies described herein. Accordingly a machine readable medium refers to a single storage apparatus or device as well as cloud based storage systems or storage networks that include multiple storage apparatus or devices. The term machine readable medium shall accordingly be taken to include but not be limited to one or more tangible data repositories in the form of a solid state memory an optical medium a magnetic medium or any suitable combination thereof.

Throughout this specification plural instances may implement components operations or structures described as a single instance. Although individual operations of one or more methods are illustrated and described as separate operations one or more of the individual operations may be performed concurrently and nothing requires that the operations be performed in the order illustrated. Structures and functionality presented as separate components in example configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components. These and other variations modifications additions and improvements fall within the scope of the subject matter herein.

Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components modules or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules e.g. code embodied on a machine readable medium or in a transmission signal or hardware modules. A hardware module is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain physical manner. In various example embodiments one or more computer systems e.g. a standalone computer system a client computer system or a server computer system or one or more hardware modules of a computer system e.g. a processor or a group of processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.

In some embodiments a hardware module may be implemented mechanically electronically or any suitable combination thereof. For example a hardware module may include dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured to perform certain operations. For example a hardware module may be a special purpose processor such as a field programmable gate array FPGA or an ASIC. A hardware module may also include programmable logic or circuitry that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. For example a hardware module may include software encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by cost and time considerations.

Accordingly the phrase hardware module should be understood to encompass a tangible entity be that an entity that is physically constructed permanently configured e.g. hardwired or temporarily configured e.g. programmed to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. As used herein hardware implemented module refers to a hardware module. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured e.g. programmed each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example where a hardware module comprises a general purpose processor configured by software to become a special purpose processor the general purpose processor may be configured as respectively different special purpose processors e.g. comprising different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor for example to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.

Hardware modules can provide information to and receive information from other hardware modules. Accordingly the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple hardware modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses between or among two or more of the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such hardware modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .

The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed at least partially by one or more processors that are temporarily configured e.g. by software or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured such processors may constitute processor implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions described herein. As used herein processor implemented module refers to a hardware module implemented using one or more processors.

Similarly the methods described herein may be at least partially processor implemented a processor being an example of hardware. For example at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor implemented modules. Moreover the one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a cloud computing environment or as a software as a service SaaS . For example at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers as examples of machines including processors with these operations being accessible via a network e.g. the Internet and via one or more appropriate interfaces e.g. an application program interface API .

The performance of certain operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments the one or more processors or processor implemented modules may be located in a single geographic location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or a server farm . In other example embodiments the one or more processors or processor implemented modules may be distributed across a number of geographic locations.

Some portions of the subject matter discussed herein may be presented in terms of algorithms or symbolic representations of operations on data stored as bits or binary digital signals within a machine memory e.g. a computer memory . Such algorithms or symbolic representations are examples of techniques used by those of ordinary skill in the data processing arts to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. As used herein an algorithm is a self consistent sequence of operations or similar processing leading to a desired result. In this context algorithms and operations involve physical manipulation of physical quantities. Typically but not necessarily such quantities may take the form of electrical magnetic or optical signals capable of being stored accessed transferred combined compared or otherwise manipulated by a machine. It is convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to such signals using words such as data content bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers numerals or the like. These words however are merely convenient labels and are to be associated with appropriate physical quantities.

Unless specifically stated otherwise discussions herein using words such as processing computing calculating determining presenting displaying or the like may refer to actions or processes of a machine e.g. a computer that manipulates or transforms data represented as physical e.g. electronic magnetic or optical quantities within one or more memories e.g. volatile memory non volatile memory or any suitable combination thereof registers or other machine components that receive store transmit or display information. Furthermore unless specifically stated otherwise the terms a or an are herein used as is common in patent documents to include one or more than one instance. Finally as used herein the conjunction or refers to a non exclusive or unless specifically stated otherwise.
