This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 816 662 filed Apr. 26 2013 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Embodiments pertain to operations and communications performed by electronic devices in wireless networks. Some embodiments relate to conversational video sessions occurring over wireless networks.

In typical videoconferencing applications two users receive live video images of each other. In many cases a user may wish to zoom in on a particular feature that appears in the live video image of the other user. Accordingly there exists a need for interactive zooming in a videoconferencing application.

The following description and the drawings sufficiently illustrate specific embodiments to enable those skilled in the art to practice them. Other embodiments can incorporate structural logical electrical process and other changes. Portions and features of some embodiments can be included in or substituted for those of other embodiments. Embodiments set forth in the claims encompass all available equivalents of those claims.

In a video conferencing application a user viewing a scene can performing zooming by selecting an area in the scene then dynamically switching a video feed of the scene to the selected area of the scene. The hardware and software of the video conferencing application can limit the video transmitted to the user to include only the selected area of the scene. Transmitting only the selected area of the scene and excluding the non selected area of the scene from transmission can more efficiently use the available bandwidth of the video conferencing application.

The local user runs the video conferencing application on a local user equipment local UE which can include a laptop computer a cellular telephone or another suitable device. The local UE includes a camera which captures video of the local user during operation and a display which displays video of the remote user to the local user during operation.

The remote user runs video conferencing application on a remote user equipment remote UE . The remote UE also includes a camera which captures video of the remote user during operation and a display which displays video of the local user to the remote user during operation. Both the local UE and the remote UE include circuitry configured to perform two way video conferencing via the video conferencing application .

The local user can zoom into a particular feature or location in the field of view of the remote camera. At the local UE the local user can define a region of interest ROI within a field of view at the remote UE . In the example of the field of view of the remote camera includes the head and upper torso of the remote user while the ROI defined by the local user includes only the head of the remote user . This is but one example the local user can also define other suitable ROIs within the field of view of the remote camera.

Once an ROI is defined the video conferencing application can direct the remote UE to capture video within the ROI . In some examples the remote UE captures video that includes only the ROI and excludes regions outside the ROI and transmits the captured video to the local UE . In other examples the remote UE captures video that includes the full field of view of the remote camera but transmits a video that includes only the ROI and excludes regions outside the ROI.

The local UE receives the video from the remote UE where the received video includes regions within the ROI and excludes regions outside the ROI . The local UE displays the received video on the local display.

In some examples the local user can define an ROI to have an arbitrary size and location within the field of view of the remote camera. In some examples the remote UE remains stationary when the ROI is defined so that selecting an ROI does not move or change the field of view of the remote camera. In some examples the local user can select a new ROI at will. In some examples the remote user can also select an analogous ROI to zoom in on the local user .

In the example of the video conferencing application operates over 3GPP based multimedia telephony services which connect the local UE and the remote UE to each other and to the telephone network. This is but one example other suitable networks can also be used.

The local UE connects to the core network through a radio access network a serving GPRS support node SGSN and or a gateway GPRS support node GGSN . The local UE sends and receives data through a proxy call session control function P CSCF . The P CSCF sends and receives data with a serving call session control function S CSCF . In some examples the S CSCF can send and receive data from an application server AS which can provide supplementary services such as call hold resume call forwarding and multi party calls and others. The S CSCF can send and receive data from other parts of the core network. The remote UE communicates similarly with its own radio access network SGSN GGSN P CSCF S CSCF and AS . The S CSCFs can each communicate with an interrogating CSCF I CSCF . The I CSCF can read and write to a home subscriber server HSS and or a subscriber location function SLF .

Specification document 3GPP TS 26.114 describes the multimedia telephony services over IMS MTSI that allows delivery of advanced multimedia conversational services and content over IMS based networks. This includes specification of media handling and interaction which includes media control media codecs as well as transport of media and control data. A MTSI call uses the Call Session Control Function CSCF mechanisms to route control plane signalling between the UEs involved in the call. MTSI based transmitter UE terminal captures and records video and transfers it to the MTSI based receiver UE terminal over the 3GPP network which decodes and renders the video. In MTSI the session initiation protocol SIP serves as the application layer control protocol to establish modify and terminate conversational multimedia sessions such as video conferences Internet telephony calls and others. Session description protocol SDP based signaling between the sending and receiving terminals allow for offer answer considerations in the media related capability negotiation including codecs bitrates resolutions and others. The transport of media in MTSI is based on the real time transport protocol RTP specified by IETF RFC 3550 over UDP IP.

The resolutions of capture devices and therefore compressed videos are rapidly increasing. For example using the recent High Efficiency Video Coding HEVC standard one can transport and store 4K content as part of an operational product. Cameras having 4 k by 2 k resolution are now widely available. Live streaming video has been demonstrated with resolutions of 8 k by 4 k. Resolutions in terms of numbers of pixels are likely to increase in the future. With these very high resolution contents new usages in video streaming are now possible like interactive zooming features.

The interactive zooming features enable dynamic adaptation of video in terms of bandwidth spatial resolution orientation and so forth. In addition the interactive zooming features can dynamically switch to a user selected area in the video being streamed and can optimize encodings for this purpose.

The device and method discussed herein proposes new media handling and session management features targeted for conversational video services toward enhancing resolutions delivered to the end user when using interactive zoom features. In particular towards addressing the problem described above we propose the capability to signal the information on the user s ROI from the receiving terminal to the sending terminal e.g. as part of the RTCP feedback signaling or RTP header extension. This feature named as ROI based zooming ROIZoom can provide better image quality for the selected region than with a simple graphical zoom since the sending device in this case can use all of the available bandwidth for encoding and transmitting the ROI which can therefore deliver higher bitrates and quality to the receiving terminal.

SDP based signaling between the sending and receiving terminals allow for offer answer considerations in the media related capability negotiation for ROI Zoom e.g. 1 ability to indicate ROI in RTCP feedback and or RTP header extension messages and 2 ability to understand process ROI information and encode video accordingly.

An MTSI client supporting the ROI Zoom feature can offer ROI Zoom in SDP for all media streams containing video. ROIZoom can be offered by including the a extmap attribute indicating the ROI Zoom URN under the relevant media line scope. For instance the ROI Zoom URN can be set as 

In the above example of a media line the number 7 can be replaced with any number between 1 and 14 inclusive.

The ROI Zoom capability can be supported bi directionally or uni directionally depending on how clients negotiate to support the feature during SDP capability negotiations. For terminals with asymmetric capability e.g. the ability to process ROI information but not detect signal ROI information the sendonly and recvonly attributes can be used. Terminals should express their capability in each direction sufficiently clearly such that signals are only sent in each direction to the extent that they both express useful information and can be processed by the recipient. ROI Zoom includes signaling of the current ROI of the receiving user to the sender so that the sending UE can optimally encode and transmit the captured video. When ROI Zoom is successfully negotiated it can be signaled by the MTSI client. The signaling of the ROI Zoom can use RTCP feedback reporting or RTP Header Extensions.

When using RTCP feedback reports the receiving terminal includes the current ROI information of the user in the RTCP reports it is transmitting to the sending terminal. When using RTP header extensions the receiving terminal includes the current ROI information of the user in the RTP packets it is transmitting to the sending terminal. These RTP packets carry video streams in the reverse direction which can be used for bi directional video communications in MTSI.

These different ROI signaling capabilities can be indicated in the SDP offer via different URNs. In some examples one can pick one of these and use a single URN in the SDP capability negotiations. Since RTCP is not always used in video calls and can be turned off this is also part of the SDP negotiation it can be safest to deliver the ROI information as part of the RTP header extensions of the reverse direction video streams for broadest support of the ROI Zoom feature.

Two attributes can be used to define the ROI to be included in RTCP feedback reports or RTP header extensions. One attribute is position which can specifies an upper left corner of the area covered in the original content or can specify another suitable location. The other attribute is size which can specify the size of the area covered in the original content in relative values. For instance an example of position can be 0 0 and an example of size can be 0.33 0.33 . Other suitable values can also be used.

The presence of ROI Zoom should not impact the negotiated resolutions based on SDP imageattr attribute between the sending and receiving terminals. The only difference is that the sending terminal would encode only the ROI with the negotiated resolution rather than the whole captured frame and this would lead to a higher overall resolution and better user experience than having the receiving terminal zoom in on the ROI and crop out the rest of the frame. The sending terminal can potentially indicate ROI as part of the RTP header extension in RTP packets for its forward direction video streams.
