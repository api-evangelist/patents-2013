This Application claims rights under 35 USC 119 e from U.S. application 61 638 188 filed Apr. 25 2012 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was made with United States Government support under Contract No. HSSCHQ 04 C 00342 awarded by the Department of Homeland Security. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to airborne optical sensors and more particularly to domes used to cover airborne optical sensors.

Faceted domes are preferred over single piece domes such as hemispherical domes or hyper hemispherical domes for use as apertures and for housing airborne optical sensors such as infrared countermeasure systems in order to keep costs down. Basically faceted domes are a lower cost solution over the single piece domes. Such domes invariably require protection from direct lightning strikes and from electromagnetic interference EMI . Such domes may be used to improve performance relative to the RE102 test which is a U.S. Department of Defense Military Standard for magnetic field testing and relative to RE103 which is the U.S. Department of Defense Military Standard for Antenna and Harmonic Outputs.

Existing methods apply a layer of conductive material over the faceted domes to protect any housed electronic circuits from lighting strikes and EMI. However this may result in significantly reducing optical transmittal properties.

A faceted dome assembly having improved lighting protection and enhanced EMI shielding is disclosed. According to one aspect of the present subject matter the faceted dome assembly includes a faceted dome and an airborne optical sensor and a gimbal housed in the faceted dome. A conductor disposed substantially within the facets of the faceted dome to provide an enhanced electromagnetic shielding and lightning protection to the electronics in the airborne optical sensor.

The exemplary embodiments described herein in detail for illustrative purposes are subject to many variations in structure and design.

The terms glue bond and epoxy are used interchangeably throughout the document. Also the terms optical sensor and optical airborne sensor are used interchangeably throughout the document. Further the terms wire cage metal cage and metal grid are used interchangeably throughout the document.

Referring now to which illustrate an edge view and a top down view of a wire cage assembly configured to be placed over the faceted dome shown in to provide conductive paths according to an embodiment of the present subject matter. As shown in the wire cage A and B includes ground attachment points to facilitate EMI and lightning protection. The wire cage assembly is made of at least one conductive material. Exemplary conductive materials include a conductive epoxy metal grid wire cage configured to be disposed in the glue located within the mating facet edges and a metal cage configured to be disposed on the glue line of the mating facet edges .

It can be seen in that the shape of the wire cage is configured to be disposed substantially within the facets of the faceted dome to provide an enhanced electromagnetic shielding and lightning protection. It can be further seen that such a wire cage does not affect the optical throughput of the faceted dome . In some embodiments the conductor is made from a material which acts as a faraday cage providing high attenuation conductive properties at low frequency and longer wavelengths. In these embodiments the low frequency is in the range of about 1 to 60 megahertz MHz .

In some embodiments the metal cage is made from a wire having a standard wire gauge range such as American wire gauge AWG ranges of about 1 40. In these embodiments the wire gauge size is chosen to handle a desired current density during EMI and lightning strikes.

Referring now to which a is a graph illustrating test results on the faceted dome such as those shown in without conductive epoxy bonds with conductive epoxy bonds and with the wire cage such as those shown in according to an embodiment of the present subject matter. The graph in shows EMI test results done on the faceted dome . The line in the graph shows EMI test results done on a faceted dome assembled without any conductive epoxy bonds. The line in the graph shows EMI test results done on a reworked faceted dome with conductive epoxy bonds. The line in the graph shows EMI test results done on a hyper hemispheric dome that including a conductive coating. Finally the line in the graph shows EMI test results done on the faceted dome including a wire cage disposed within the facets shown in . It can be seen that the faceted dome including the wire cage provides 40 dB attenuation in the 0 to 10 MHz frequency range and about 30 20 dB attenuation in the 10 100 MHz frequency range.

In the lightning tests the faceted dome with the wire cage disposed within the bond lines was conducted and the test results are as follows 

Those skilled in the art will understand from the above test results that the EMI performance of the faceted dome with the wire cage attached at bond lines improved by as much as 40 dB in the 0 to 10 MHz frequency range. It can also be seen from the above test results that the lightning performance was also successful particularly with a thicker conductor i.e. with 12 AWG.

The above technique takes advantage of physical characteristics of the faceted domes in order to enhance their EMI shielding and lightning protection without compromising the electro optical performance. This is accomplished by disposing a metal cage over the faceted dome wedge and or glue lines to provide the needed shielding to enhance EMI and lightning protection.

The foregoing descriptions of specific embodiments of the present disclosure have been presented for purposes of illustration and description. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the present disclosure to the precise forms disclosed and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the present disclosure and its practical application to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the present disclosure and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. It is understood that various omission and substitutions of equivalents are contemplated as circumstance may suggest or render expedient but such are intended to cover the application or implementation without departing from the spirit or scope of the claims of the present disclosure.
