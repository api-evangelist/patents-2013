This patent arises from a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 831 090 filed on Jul. 6 2010 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 530 578 filed on Sep. 11 2006 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 787 602. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 831 090 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 530 578 are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

This disclosure relates generally to telephone systems and more particularly to methods and apparatus to provide a telephone system configuration interface.

As the sophistication of phone service has increased consumers such as subscribers users have the ability to install multiple phones in a residence or small business. Such phones may be land line telephones i.e. telephones that are hardwired to a telephone network or may be mobile telephones e.g. cellular telephones or the like . Additionally these phones may have multiple shared phone numbers associated with individual phones or each phone may have its own separate private phone number. Further services such as voicemail boxes may be associated with an individual private phone or shared phones.

The numerous combinations of telephones telephone numbers and services must be initially configured to insure that all phone phone number and services e.g. voicemail box options are properly associated with one another. Furthermore as the needs of subscribers users change the telephones telephone numbers and services may need to be reconfigured. In terms of initial configuration a Consumer Voice over Internet Protocol CVoIP product which routes consumer telephone calls over Internet Protocol IP networks requires set up including mapping customer Single Sign On SSO within a household to telephones and voicemail boxes. One challenge is to automate the configuration processes and or the reconfiguration processes while at the same time obeying the business rules for CVoIP and voicemail.

Currently the set up of telephone service voicemail boxes etc. for different users in the same household requires expertise from the service provider. This service is costly in terms of resources and creates antagonism by a customer if the service is inadequate or untimely. Further such service may require information from a customer thereby inconveniencing the customer who must be present when service is initiated. Customers may set up the voicemail and telephone services but currently customers cannot set up voicemail and telephone services specific to a particular user in a household for whom it is desired to have different services or access to different voicemail boxes. That is consumer i.e. home telephone services provide only a single level of access during which full system access is allowed. For example a consumer telephone service conventionally includes only a single login that provides any person logging in with the ability to configure or reconfigure systems and or services. Such a full access type configuration prevents segmentation between users of a particular consumer system. Thus users either have complete and total control over the system or no control whatsoever.

In general example methods and apparatus for a telephone system set up interface are disclosed. In one example a method for providing a telephone related service allowing a telephone subscriber to configure telephone service for multiple users at a single location associated with the telephone subscriber the single location having a plurality of telephones a plurality of phone numbers and a shared voicemail box the multiple users each having a unique account identifier includes visually providing the telephone subscriber an option to specify one of the phone numbers to one of the telephones and visually providing the telephone subscriber an option to assign each of the multiple users exclusive access to at least one of the telephone numbers via their account identifier.

The cellular telephone receives signals from and sends signals to a wireless network while the VoIP phones and send to and receive IP signals from a VoIP network . In this example both the wireless network and the VoIP network are coupled to an IP multi media subsystem IMS core . The IMS is an open standardized operator friendly Next Generation Networking NGN multi media architecture for mobile and fixed IP services. The IMS in this example is a VoIP implementation based on a third generation partnership project 3GPP variant of session initiation protocol SIP and runs over the standard Internet protocol IP . It may be used by telecommunications operators in NGN networks that combine voice and data in a single packet switched network to offer network controlled multi media services. The IMS core is designed to provide Internet services for all customers of the IMS core on different devices such as the VoIP phone in . The example IMS core uses open standard IP protocols allowing the merger of the Internet with cellular systems using cellular technologies to provide ubiquitous access and Internet technologies to provide other services.

In this example the IMS core has an Application Programming Interface API which is an open service access OSA gateway GW providing an interface for different programs exchanging data. For example the OSA GW can support telephone protocols e.g. Parlay or a multimedia communication protocol e.g. session initiation protocol SIP . Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that different cores may be used for the wireless network and the VoIP network .

The example IMS core of includes a call server and a call manager . The call server represents different SIP servers or proxies that are collectively termed CSCF Call Server Control Function . CSCF elements are used to process SIP signaling packets within the IMS core from the VoIP phones such as the VoIP phones and and perform session control. The call manager provides a web services interface to external applications which are used to set profile information and configure customer phones.

The IMS core is in communication with a mediation database server which stores identification and customer account information used by the IMS core . The mediation database server is the master user information database supporting the IMS network elements involved in call processing and sessions. The mediation database server contains profile information manages user authentication and authorization and physical SIP endpoint location information. The profile information includes customer account information such as the identity and number of phone users telephone numbers and voicemail boxes associated with a customer account.

The call manager of the IMS core is coupled via web communication protocols such as hypertext transfer protocol http and or hypertext transfer protocol security https to the world wide web . The IMS core may draw customer instructions from various portals such as a VoIP service provider portal a wireless service provider portal and an Internet content provider portal . Of course other portals may be provided that allow customers to reset their options for the various services. Different customers may access the portals and via web browser devices such as a personal computer . Of course other web browser capable devices such as cell phones PDAs etc. may be used to access the portals and .

The mediation database server also communicates with portals such as portals and to send and receive customer information to and from the portals. The mediation database server communicates with an Internet based multi media support network with a network management system NMS and an operational support system OSS to support functions such as billing network management repairs and servicing. In this example the network management system is the SBC Lightspeed network but other network management systems may be used for supporting Internet based multi media services.

At the initial installation all features relating to the VoIP phones and are associated with the user for the customer premises and are equally accessible to all of the users and who are associated with the customer account.

As will be described below a customer such as the user in the example customer premises may use a set up interface to configure the VoIP phones and as well as the voicemail box and set up separate voicemail boxes for each of the persons and . The set up interface allows many different configurations of phone numbers private and public phones voicemail boxes and greetings and other services to set up the use of the phones and on the customer premises and the access by each of the persons and according to their individual user IDs. The set up interface may also allow the user to grant deny and or restrict access to other telephone features and services for each of the other users and . Depending on the access granted each of the other users and may individually configure phone service for their particular identification information. For example if the user is allowed access to change a voicemail box greeting the user may change the greeting by providing the proper identification information. The configurations are set via the interface which is available on a web browser device such as the computer in by accessing a portal such as the VoIP service provider portal and are storing the configurations in the mediation database for implementation by the IMS core .

The person has private access to the phone and private access to a new configured common voicemail box . The phone has been configured to allow the person and the person to have access to the phone . The phone has been configured to allow access to the common voicemail box for the person . The phone allows access to a new secondary voicemail box for the person . Further different phone services may be enabled for the phones and which are accessible to the different users and on supplying their account information.

The customer interface is a graphical user interface that includes a main menu options area containing different options for other customer services and or display of customer account information. The user interface includes a user selection window . The user selection window includes a name column and an account identifier column . The name column lists the names of the users persons and in the customer premises and the account identifier column lists an account identifier such as an e mail address associated with each person. The interface obtains the user names and account identifiers from the database server via the portal . The name column initially lists the names of the user who is responsible for the customer account and a series of blank name fields . The user may enter the name or names of additional users for example members of the household in the customer premises in the fields blank . These names and their associated account identifiers will be displayed in the account identifier column . A check box allows the customer to select the user name s of the user s who will use the telephones and have access to a voicemail box. The initial set up window area also includes a next button a cancel button and a reset button to navigate throughout the different windows which will be detailed below. Selecting the next button will cause the customer interface to display the next configuration window such as a phone number set up window in . Selecting the cancel button will cause the entered information in the window to be erased. Selecting the reset button will cause the fields to revert to the previous setting. A complete later button allows the customer to complete the configuration at a later point in time.

If the user selects any phone number which will be a shared number a series of configuration windows are displayed as shown in by the customer interface . shows a sharing configuration window which includes an all share option and an assignment option . The all share option configures all the shared numbers to all users in the household. Selecting the assignment option results in the display of a user sharing configuration window as shown in in the customer interface .

The user sharing configuration window in includes a main number user list field a second number user list field and a third number user list field . Initially the main number user list field has a list of all the users associated with the customer account. The user list field and the user list field are each associated with a phone number which the user had previously designated as shared in the phone number set up window in . The user list field is associated with the phone numbers which the user had previously designated as private in the phone number set up window . By using a move button the user may assign a particular user to a particular list field such as the user list field and thereby give that user sharing privileges to that phone. The user list field lists users which will be assigned a private phone.

Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that other features and services including for example long distance service 1 900 numbers ringtones call forwarding and conference calling may be configured for the users such as the users and by the primary account holder such as the user via input screens similar to those in . For example features and services may be made available to a particular user. Other features and services may be made available and the particular user may be given the ability to configure the feature and or service to their own personal preference using their account information. For example if a user is given the option for a different ringtone the user can adjust the ringtone via their customer identification.

After the customer enters the other user names the user names are sent from the portal to the configuration command interface and to the database server via the customer data interface to be stored with the account information block . The configuration command interface then begins with the phone numbers in the account and receives the customer selection from the phone number set up window in to set the phone number as a private phone or a shared phone block . The configuration command interface then determines whether the user has designated a phone as a private phone block . If the phone is a private phone the customer enters the user name associated with the phone in the private phone set up window in for the phone user setup module and for storage in the database server via the customer data interface block . The configuration command interface then determines whether there are remaining phones associated with the customer account block . If there are remaining phones the IMS core loops back to block to record the status of the users of that phone.

If the phone is not a private phone the configuration command interface determines if the customer has selected the option for all users to share the phone from the sharing configuration window in block . If the phone is shared the phone number is set to be shared by all the users associated with the account via the phone user setup module block . If the phone is not shared the configuration command interface reads the input names associated with the phone as entered by the user in the user sharing configuration window in and the phone user setup module configures the phone via the call manager block . After the user or users are associated with a phone the configuration command interface determines whether there are remaining phones to be assigned to users block . If there are remaining phones the configuration command interface loops back to determine the assigned users for the next phone in block .

If all the phones associated with the account have been assigned users and a shared or private designation the configuration command interface accepts the assignment of voicemail boxes to different users for each phone and the voice mail setup module configures the voice mail via the call manager block . The configuration command interface then accepts the user input of a PIN for each voicemail box from the voicemail identification set up window in block . The configuration command interface then accepts the input voice message for the mail box from the voicemail message set up window in and the voice mail setup module configures the voice mail via the call manager block . The customer data interface stores the message in the database server for use by the call manager block . The services setup module then configures other features and or services which have been enabled for the different users via the call manager block . The configuration command interface determines if there are other voicemail boxes block . If there are other remaining voicemail boxes the configuration command interface loops up to block to assign the next voicemail box. If there are no remaining voicemail boxes the configuration command interface terminates the set up process.

The processor is in communication with the main memory including a read only memory ROM and or a RAM via a bus . The RAM may be implemented by Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory SDRAM Dynamic DRAM and or any other type of RAM device. The ROM may be implemented by flash memory and or any other desired type of memory device. Access to the memory space and is typically controlled by a memory controller not shown in a conventional manner. The RAM may be used by the processor to implement the memory and or to store coded instructions that can be executed to implement the example machine readable instructions illustrated in .

The processor platform also includes a conventional interface circuit . The interface circuit may be implemented by any type of well known interface standard such as an external memory interface serial port general purpose input output etc. One or more input devices are connected to the interface circuit . One or more output devices are also connected to the interface circuit . Additional permanent storage may be offered via a mass storage device which may be a hard drive. In the illustrated example a microphone or telephony equipment may be part of the input devices .

At least some of the above described example methods and or apparatus are implemented by logic such as one or more software and or firmware programs running on a computer processor.
