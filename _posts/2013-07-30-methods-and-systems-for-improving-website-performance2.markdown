The present inventions generally relate to website design and hosting and more specifically methods and systems for improving website performance.

An example embodiment of a method for improving website performance may comprise calculating a website quality score for a website which may indicate the website s effectiveness identifying changes to the website s attributes that would improve the website s quality score and modifying the website to include such changes.

An example embodiment of a system for improving website performance may comprise a server computer hosting a website having a URL and an application server computer running a website scoring and improvement module configured to calculate a website quality score for a website which may indicate the website s effectiveness identify changes to the website s attributes that would improve the website s quality score and modify the website to include such changes.

The above features and advantages of the present inventions will be better understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The present inventions will now be discussed in detail with regard to the attached drawing figures which were briefly described above. In the following description numerous specific details are set forth illustrating the Applicant s best mode for practicing the inventions and enabling one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the inventions. It will be obvious however to one skilled in the art that the present inventions may be practiced without many of these specific details. In other instances well known machines structures and method steps have not been described in particular detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present inventions. Unless otherwise indicated like parts and method steps are referred to with like reference numerals.

A network is a collection of links and nodes e.g. multiple computers and or other devices connected together arranged so that information may be passed from one part of the network to another over multiple links and through various nodes. Examples of networks include the Internet the public switched telephone network the global Telex network computer networks e.g. an intranet an extranet a local area network or a wide area network wired networks and wireless networks.

The Internet comprises a vast number of computers and computer networks that are interconnected through communication links arranged to allow the easy and robust exchange of information between computer users. Hundreds of millions of people around the world have access to computers connected to the Internet via Internet Service Providers ISPs . Content providers e.g. website owners or operators place multimedia information e.g. text graphics audio video animation and other forms of data at specific locations on the Internet referred to as webpages. Websites comprise a collection of connected or otherwise related webpages. The combination of all the websites and their corresponding webpages on the Internet is generally known as the World Wide Web WWW or simply the Web.

Prevalent on the Web are multimedia websites some of which may offer and sell goods and services to individuals and organizations. Websites may consist of a single webpage but typically consist of multiple interconnected and related webpages. Menus and links may be used to move between different webpages within the website or to move to a different website as is known in the art. Websites may be created using HyperText Markup Language HTML to generate a standard set of tags that define how the webpages for the website are to be displayed. Such websites may comprise a collection of HTML and subordinate documents i.e. files stored on the Web that are typically accessible from the same Uniform Resource Locator URL and reside on the same server although such files may be distributed in numerous servers.

Users of the Internet may access content providers websites using software known as an Internet browser such as MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER or MOZILLA FIREFOX. A request is made by entering the website s URL in the browser. After the browser has located the desired webpage it requests and receives information from the webpage typically in the form of an HTML document and then displays the webpage content for the user. The user then may view other webpages at the same website or move to an entirely different website using the browser.

Browsers are able to locate specific websites because each website resource and computer on the Internet has a unique Internet Protocol IP address. Presently there are two standards for IP addresses. The older IP address standard often called IP Version 4 IPv4 is a 32 bit binary number which is typically shown in dotted decimal notation where four 8 bit bytes are separated by a dot from each other e.g. 64.202.167.32 . The notation is used to improve human readability. The newer IP address standard often called IP Version 6 IPv6 or Next Generation Internet Protocol IPng is a 128 bit binary number. The standard human readable notation for IPv6 addresses presents the address as eight 16 bit hexadecimal words each separated by a colon e.g. 2EDC BA98 0332 0000 CF8A 000C 2154 7313 .

IP addresses however even in human readable notation are difficult for people to remember and use. A URL is much easier to remember and may be used to point to any computer directory or file on the Internet. A browser is able to access a website on the Internet through the use of a URL. The URL may include a Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP request combined with the website s Internet address also known as the website s domain. An example of a URL with a HTTP request and domain is http www.companyname.com. In this example the http identifies the URL as a HTTP request and the companyname.com is the domain.

Websites unless extremely large and complex or have unusual traffic demands typically reside on a single server and are prepared and maintained by a single individual or entity. Some Internet users typically those that are larger and more sophisticated may provide their own hardware software and connections to the Internet. But many Internet users either do not have the resources available or do not want to create and maintain the infrastructure necessary to host their own websites. To assist such individuals or entities hosting companies exist that offer website hosting services. These hosting service providers typically provide the hardware software and electronic communication means necessary to connect multiple websites to the Internet. A single hosting service provider may literally host thousands of websites on one or more hosting servers.

Some websites may be more effective than others. For example one website may have better data accessibility aesthetic appeal mobile performance sales traffic bandwidth Search Engine Optimization SEO or features e.g. blogs ads video etc. than others. Applicant has determined that presently existing systems and methods do not provide optimal means for identifying the attributes of a website that could or should be improved to increase performance and improving those attributes. For these reasons there is a need for the methods and systems for improving website performance as described herein.

The website quality score may be a function of any of the website s attributes. As non limiting examples the attributes may comprise design attributes e.g. an information accessibility metric indicating how easy it is to locate key pieces of information on the website an aesthetic metric indicating how appealing the website looks to users perhaps as a function of colors layout etc. or a mobile rendering metric indicating how well the website renders on mobile devices . Alternatively the attributes may comprise performance attributes e.g. a sales metric indicating how well the website performs financially a traffic metric indicating how frequently Internet users access the website a SEO metric a loading speed metric a mobile performance metric or a data transference metric .

The website quality score calculation Step may be accomplished by software running on an application server operating to compare the website s attributes against pre determined parameters. For example websites having performance attributes exceeding predetermined values may be given a higher score while those with lower performance attributes may be given a lower score. Design attributes may be compared against pre determined templates known to be successful. Websites having design attributes closer to those of the pre determined templates may be given higher scores. Attributes may be independent of each other or conversely dependent on each other. For example attributes may be positively or negatively correlated e.g. website quality score improvements resulting from a change to attribute may be doubled if attribute is also changed. Or score improvements resulting from changing attribute are diminished if attribute is changed .

Alternatively the website quality score calculation Step may be accomplished by the comparing the website s attributes against with those of other websites. Comparisons may be made between websites hosted with the same or different hosting providers. Where the websites are hosted by different hosting providers software and or scripts running on an application server may run tests or otherwise probe the subject website to determine its attributes and compare with other websites.

In another embodiment all websites may be hosted by the same hosting provider such as GODADDY. This embodiment may take advantage of the hosting provider s unique position as host to these numerous websites. By hosting many websites the hosting provider may access data indicating which websites are more effective than others. For example the hosting provider may identify those websites that process the most transactions have the most sales or are otherwise the most financially successful. The hosting provider also may determine those websites that are top performers perhaps by measuring page load times SEO ranking traffic etc. The attributes of identified high performing websites then may be identified and compared to those of the subject website. In one embodiment websites may be separated by vertical e.g. bike shops law firms restaurants etc. before the comparison is performed thus ensuring that the subject website is compared to websites within the same vertical.

A website quality score then may be calculated Step . As a non limiting example the website quality score may indicate the website s effectiveness and may be a function of its attributes. The website quality score may comprise a metric representing the effectiveness of the website s design. It may provide a way to quantifiably assess quality of website design which may be complex due to the multiple factors involved including but not limited to the following ability to find key pieces of information e.g. price of offered services pants in a clothing catalog aesthetic appeal e.g. effectiveness of color used related to desired action rendering and performance on mobile devices e.g. does the website display properly on an mobile device SEO etc.

The website quality score may comprise any score indicating the effectiveness of the subject website and may comprise any rating or ranking scale known in the art or developed in the future. As non limiting examples the website quality score may range from 0 to 1 1 to 10 0 to 100 and or A to F e.g. grades . Alternatively it may comprise a star rating system or a color rating system e.g. red indicates a poor reputation yellow indicates an average reputation and green indicates a good reputation . As one non limiting example the range for website quality scores may have a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 100 and may indicate a transition from a negative to a positive score when the score exceeds 50 .

In one embodiment software running on an application server may calculate a website quality score Step by sequentially ranking the subject website amongst a plurality of websites according to a particular attribute such as sales volume and assign a score according to the website s percentile rank e.g. a score of 75 if the subject website has higher sales than 75 of other websites . In another embodiment grades may be assigned according to a percentile score e.g. A for 100 80 B for 80 60 C for 60 40 D for 40 20 and F for 20 0 .

Attribute changes that may improve the website quality score then may be identified Step . As a non limiting example aesthetic changes or website features present in high scoring websites may be identified that are not present in the subject website. Software running on the application server may for example generate a temporary modified version of the subject website and re calculate the website quality score for the temporary website. If the score exceeds the prior score the subject website may be modified to include the changed attribute that drove the score increase Step and published to the Internet.

In one embodiment the illustrated methods may be performed before the website is published or otherwise hosted at a URL. In a non limiting example the methods described herein may be performed while the website is being built via a website building software application to optimize the performance of the website prior to publication at a URL. In such a pre publication embodiment the website s files may be stored locally e.g. in a server s memory filesystem and not yet published at a URL but may be accessible by an application server performing the described methods.

The URL may be received Step perhaps at an application server performing the described method by any method of receiving data known in the art or developed in the future including but not limited to receiving the URL via electronic communication. The URL may comprise a fully qualified and functioning domain name propagated through the DNS or alternatively may comprise a temporary internal URL at which the website is temporarily hosted during website development. As a non limiting example a control panel website hosted on the application server may be configured e.g. programmed to receive a URL Step perhaps by displaying a virtual button entitled submit website for review that when clicked by a user such as a website administrator transmits a URL entered in a data field via HTTP protocol that is received by the application server. Attributes of the website to which the URL resolves may then be evaluated for effectiveness Step as described above in relation to website score calculation Step .

The embodiment illustrated in further enables the subject website s administrator to accept or reject website modifications. In one embodiment the website administrator may be presented with a list of suggested changes and incremental website quality score improvements that would result from each change along with options to accept reject changes in bulk or at the level of granularity of individual changes. If changes are accepted the website may be modified accordingly Step .

Higher scoring websites may be identified Step perhaps by searching a database storing website templates in association with their quality scores and or attributes causing such increased quality scores. Alternatively a plurality of websites may be concurrently scored and compared against each other. Specific website attributes driving higher scores may be determined Step perhaps by comparing specific performance attributes e.g. sales load time traffic and concluding that design attributes or features present in the second website and not present in the first website e.g. a blog or video drive the second website s improved score. Alternatively Step may be accomplished by generating temporary duplicate website files and iteratively altering website attributes or features and calculating the resultant change in quality score. If the score improves it may be concluded that the changed attribute caused the improvement.

The example embodiments illustrated herein place no limitation on network configuration or connectivity. Thus as non limiting examples the network could comprise the Internet the public switched telephone network the global Telex network computer networks e.g. an intranet an extranet a local area network or a wide area network wired networks wireless networks or any combination thereof.

Servers and or and or any other server described herein may be communicatively coupled to the network via any method of network connection known in the art or developed in the future including but not limited to wired wireless modem dial up satellite cable modem Digital Subscriber Line DSL Asymmetric Digital Subscribers Line ASDL Virtual Private Network VPN Integrated Services Digital Network ISDN X.25 Ethernet token ring Fiber Distributed Data Interface FDDI IP over Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM Infrared Data Association IrDA wireless WAN technologies T1 Frame Relay Point to Point Protocol over Ethernet PPPoE and or any combination thereof. As non limiting examples the servers could be application communication mail database proxy fax file media web peer to peer standalone software or hardware servers i.e. server computers and may use any server format known in the art or developed in the future possibly a shared hosting server a virtual dedicated hosting server a dedicated hosting server or any combination thereof .

The website may be hosted by any system or method known in the art or developed in the future for website hosting including but not limited to storing the website s files databases and or database tables on a server communicatively coupled to a network perhaps for access by a client running a browser configured to render the website on the client s display. As non limiting examples the website may be hosted on the website owner operator or administrator s computer or server or alternatively by a hosting provider as described in detail above.

The website may comprise any collection of data and or files accessible to a client or server communicatively coupled to the network . As a non limiting example the website may comprise a single webpage or multiple interconnected and related webpages resolving from a domain name each of which may provide access to static dynamic multimedia or any other content perhaps by accessing files e.g. text audio video graphics executable HTML eXtensible Markup Language XML Active Server Pages ASP Hypertext Preprocessor PHP Flash files server side scripting etc. that enable the website to display when rendered by a browser on a client.

The above described methods or any step of such methods also may be performed by an application programming interface API running on at least one server or communicatively coupled to a network . The API may comprise computer readable code that when executed by at least one server or causes the API to perform each method step. The API may comprise a software to software interface that specifies the protocol defining how independent computer programs interact or communicate with each other. As a non limiting example the API may perform each method step through a series of function calls requests for services . The API may comprise any API type known in the art or developed in the future including but not limited to request style Berkeley Sockets Transport Layer Interface TLI Representational State Transfer REST SOAP Remote Procedure Calls RPC Standard Query Language SQL file transfer message delivery and or any combination thereof.

The methods and systems may be used in many ways to improve website performance. In one example use a website administrator may have concerns that the website is underperforming. Perhaps monthly sales for his online bicycle shop are perceived as too low compared to other bike shops and he wants to improve revenue. Using a browser running on a personal computer smartphone or tablet the website administrator may navigate to a control panel provided by his website s hosting provider and enter the URL for his website in a data field and click submit. The browser may transmit the URL perhaps via HTTP protocol to an application server perhaps operated by the website s hosting service provider where the URL is received Step .

The application server then may access data available to the hosting service provider as host of the website such as traffic volume monthly sales and SEO ranking and calculate a website quality score based upon these attributes Step perhaps by averaging the performance of the website s attributes and comparing performance against a plurality of other websites hosted on the same hosting service . For purposes of this example if the website s average performance exceeds 50 of other hosted websites the website may be assigned a score of 50 .

The application server then may determine that the website is in the bike shop vertical perhaps by parsing content e.g. key words and images and determining to a predetermined probability that the website belongs to the bike shop vertical. Alternatively the website administrator may have selected the appropriate vertical from a menu on the control panel.

The application server then may search a website quality score database storing according to vertical websites in association with their quality scores. In the illustrated example therefore the application server would search for and identify other bike shop websites having quality scores higher than 50 Step .

The application server then may determine the attributes of the higher scoring websites causing the better quality scores Step perhaps by comparing specific performance attributes e.g. sales load time traffic and concluding that design attributes or features e.g. a blog or video present in the higher performing websites are not present in the subject website .

The application server then may present the website administrator with options for improving website performance perhaps via the previously described control panel Step . For example he may be presented with the option perhaps via a check box to add a blog along with an indication that adding the proposed attribute would increase the website s quality score to 60 . If the website administrator accepts the suggested change the application server may modify the website Step by installing a blog.
