This patent application claims priority from U.S. Ser. No. 13 150 627 filed Jun. 1 2011 which in turn claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application U.S. Ser. No. 61 401 446 filed Aug. 13 2010.

The technology relates to the creation management and maintenance of electronic patient health care records and more particularly to a system including mobile hand held devices for inputting coordinating and synchronizing patient health care information including billing information in real time and assessing fees based on services.

In recent years there has been an increasing trend in almost all fields of business and in the professions toward maintaining records in electronic form. This form of record retention has several advantages. These advantages include relative ease of updating records creation of electronic files and management of large numbers of records while minimizing manual labor. In addition in many instances the frequency of errors and lost or misfiled records may be reduced significantly in a well managed electronic system. Moreover access to electronic records is facilitated. For example the person seeking to access records may do so remotely by Internet access to a database that often requires a password authentication protocol that allows appropriate users virtually instant access from any location in the world.

In general there is a perception that the health care sector has lagged to some extent in the adoption and use of electronic records as compared to the accounting sector for example. There are many reasons for this lag in the adoption of electronic medical records including for example the upfront costs of conversion to electronic records the need for care givers such as doctors and nurses to be trained and willing to use a system the cost of conversion for smaller doctors offices compatibility between health provider systems and the variety of heath insurance provider systems and the need to comply with patient confidentiality criteria spelled out in the so called HIPAA Statute Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and Regulations promulgated pursuant to the statute.

In an exemplary embodiment of the integrated patient health care and billing coordination system the system includes a plurality of hand held computers in communication with a cloud computing network. The cloud computing network includes a memory with a data base configured to store and update patient health care information. Further upon receiving data input from any one of the hand held computers the cloud computing network synchronizes in real time with all others of the plurality of hand held computers so that users of these may immediately see updated current data. In addition the cloud computing network transmits encrypted electronic digital patient health care information to an in system third party and receives acknowledgment of the in system third party receipt of the information. The cloud computing network monitors fee bearing information exchanged with the third party and automatically assesses a predetermined fee based on fee bearing information exchanged.

In another exemplary embodiment there is provided a multi user automatically synchronized the integrated patient health care and billing system. The system includes a plurality of wireless hand held computers and at least one remote server. The remote server which may be part of a cloud computing system is in communication with the plurality of hand held computers in real time. In addition the remote server has memory including a database configured to store patient health care information. The remote server is also in communication with patient care devices that monitor a patient s condition such as for example oxygen sensors blood pressure monitors cardiac monitors etc. Upon receiving inputted data the server synchronizes patient health care information between the pluralities of portable hand held computers by making newly input patient health care data received from any one of the plurality of hand held computers and or patient care devices substantially immediately available to all others of the plurality of portable hand held computers. Further the remote server may be in encrypted electronic digital communication with a third party transmitting encrypted patient health care information to the third party and receiving acknowledgment of third party receipt of the information. If the third party is an in system third party it has capability to access patient health care information from the database on the remote server. The remote server may also automatically assess a fee based on patient health care information communications with the third party.

In a further exemplary embodiment there is provided a multi user automatically synchronized integrated patient heath care and billing coordination system configured for simultaneous use by a plurality of health care providers. The system includes a plurality of hand held computers configured with graphic interfaces having graphics displayed thereon. The graphics facilitate health care provider access to patient health care information. In addition each of the plurality of hand held computers has wireless communication capability and is in communication with a remote server which may be part of a cloud computing network. The server has memory that includes a database configured to store patient health care information including billing information. Thus the server uploads newly input patient health care information from each of the plurality of hand held computers to the database in its memory in real time and substantially immediately automatically synchronizes patient health care information between the pluralities of portable hand held computers. As a result each of the plurality of hand held computers accesses the most recent updated patient health care information. Further the server has encrypted digital communications with a third party to transmit patient health care information and to automatically assess a fee.

The following non limiting detailed descriptions of examples of embodiments of the invention may refer to appended Figure drawings and are not limited to the drawings which are merely presented for enhancing explanations of features of the technology. In addition the detailed descriptions may refer to particular terms of art some of which are defined herein as appropriate and necessary for clarity.

The term patient health care information as used in the description and the claims of the patent refers to information that may include but is not limited to the information about a patient normally kept in the course of his her treatment by all his her health care providers including nurses physicians therapist and other care specialists data received from patient care devices as well as insurance billing and accounting information relating to the patient s health care. Such information may include but is not limited to prescriptions for pharmaceuticals and other prescribed matter such as prescribed devices care giver notes and charts patient history laboratory test results patient care device data e.g. vital signs including heart rate EKG oxygen sensor and the like which are monitored in real time physician orders for medication and non medication orders to document medications given e.g. quantity dose and time given as well as route of administration oral inter muscular and other documented results. In short the term covers everything that involves documenting the care of the patient. In addition patient health care information includes accounting information such as bills payments received amounts outstanding and insurance information such as health care insurance carrier insurance policy coverage details and the like.

The term hand held computer as used in the description and patent claims refers to a device capable of receiving user input of data transmitting the data to a synchronizing computer and receiving data from the synchronizing computer. The device should also be of a size mass and shape that can be carried with ease by a care giver going about his her duties either in the hand of a care giver or attached to clothing of the care giver or by some other convenient means that does not significantly impede the care giver in carrying out his her duties. Accordingly the term encompasses laptop computers notebook computers tablet computers and tablet PCs. In exemplary embodiments the convenience of a tablet computer exemplified by the iPad product and trademark of Apple Computer Corp of Cupertino Calif. provides some advantages but other tablet computers may also be useful. But other hand held devices may also be included within the term hand held computer. These include but are not limited to cellular phones to the extent that these are smart phones equipped and configured for data entry data retrieval and communication of data to a cloud computing network and or a remote server either wirelessly via WiFi or through a wireless cellular protocol such as the 3G and 4G protocols. Smart phones include for example the iPhone product and trademark of Apple Computer Corp. of Cupertino Calif. or phones using the Android operating system product and trademark of Google Mountainview Calif. or smart phones offered by other parties with other operating systems. In addition small format wireless enabled devices exemplified by the iTouch product and trademark of Apple Computer Corp of Cupertino Calif. are also included within the term hand held computer. 

 Cloud computing refers to Internet based computing that permits resources to be shared among multiple users and across multiple disciplines. Cloud computing offers an advantage in that an electronic coordinated patient health care system using such computing avoids the upfront costs of buying equipment and avoids a substantial amount of the ongoing costs of maintaining hardware equipment while reliability is enhanced due to shared resources that provide backup in the event any one server fails. A description of cloud computing networks may be found at www.Wikipedia.com for example. Because the technology is known further description is not deemed necessary here.

Cloud computing is not the only computing means useful in the electronic coordinated patient health care system technology. As an alternative a remote dedicated server preferably with backup systems may also be used as described here below. The term remote in this context may refer to a computer or server located at the same facility where the hand held computers are in use or at a different location. Of course a remote server might equally be a server that is part of a cloud computing network.

The term patient as used herein is merely for convenience. The systems provided herein are applicable to a variety of facilities such as for example without limitation hospitals assisted living facilities nursing homes and home health care organizations. These facilities may apply different terminology to their clients. For example nursing homes use the term residents not patients. Herein however the two terms are used interchangeably. The word patient should be read and understood more broadly to include the recipient of health care related services and goods which includes nursing home residents. 

The term in system third party refers to a third party that has a contractual relationship complying with HIPAA with an owner operator of the systems according to the inventions so as to permit access to patient data with the facility that operates a hospital or nursing home or assisted living facility or home health agency or hospice or other facility providing health care services but that might not be owned by the hospital or nursing home. An out of system third party may be a supplier with a contract sufficient to permit receiving information from computer system but that does not have a contractual relationship sufficient to input information to the computer system . The out of system third party may receive information from computer system via fax or email. Accordingly an out of system third party has no access to patient health care data except as provided by the system for performing a limited task e.g. to fill refill or discontinue a prescription or to provide another service or product for a patient.

As can be seen from care givers at locations may input data into hand held computer devices through typing dictation speech to text voice recording voice files and video files photos and video recordings via hand held computers not shown and upload these to the computer system . The care givers may also use the hand held computers to download data for printing of selected information from the database and to view information for any selected patient. Patient care devices at locations may automatically transmit patient health care data that is uploaded to the computer system for appropriate storing in database .

In the example shown for ease of system use communications are wireless as far as practicable. Thus hand held computers may communicate with the computer system via WiFi or telephony for example. Patient care devices may have low energy use transmitters such as Bluetooth or RF transmission for example and may transmit directly to the computer system or indirectly via transmission to a nearby hand held computer which in turn relays the data via WiFi for example to the computer system for appropriate updating of the database .

In an exemplary integrated patient health care and billing data coordination system has a plurality of hand held computers which are in wireless communication with a synchronizing computer system . In the illustrated example there are two facilities that are each equipped with hand held computers . Clearly the system is scalable for a plurality of facilities and a plurality of hand held computers at each facility. The synchronizing computer system may be a cloud computer network or it may be one or more dedicated remote servers. The synchronizing computer system includes memory . Thus patient health care information input at any of the hand held computers is uploaded in real time to the memory of the synchronizing computer system . The synchronizing computer system then substantially immediately permits the other hand held computers access to the newly input patient health care information stored in the memory . In addition patient care devices transmit data to the synchronizing computer system or to nearby hand held computers for transmission to computer system . This patient care device data is then immediately synchronized and available to a care giver that might make an inquiry.

Further the synchronizing computer system when prompted either by a care giver input signal or by pre scheduled prompt will communicate through encrypted communications with authenticated also referred to as in system third parties such as pharmacies medical doctor offices insurance companies and other health care service and product providers to the patients. These authenticated third parties in turn may respond to any communications from the synchronizing computer system . Thus for example the synchronizing computer system may contact a pharmacy to place a prescription order for a particular patient. The pharmacy may respond with an acknowledgment and a confirmation that it will fill the prescription. Based on this exchange of communications a fee will be assessed based on the prescription and charged to the particular pharmacy or medical facility for the service of prescription transmittal. In addition the system will automatically update both a patient s billing records for all prescriptions devices treatments and other billable services provided as well as his her insurer s billing records so that a bill may be generated at any time or at predetermined intervals for payment.

In order to comply with all confidentiality requirements including the HIPAA Statute Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 exemplary embodiments provide that communications from the hand held computers to the synchronizing computer system and communications from this system to the third parties should be encrypted. In exemplary embodiments the communications are wireless using a Wi Fi network i.e. a class of wireless local area network based on IEEE 802.11 standards . It is expected that Wi Fi will be updated from time to time and the present coordinated health care system anticipates adaptation of hand held computers and synchronizing computer networks to use the best available Wi Fi platform.

In alternative exemplary embodiments systems such as mobile 3G or the new 4G an all IP packet based system may be used instead of Wi Fi for communications between 3G or 4G enabled hand held devices and the synchronizing computer system . Such systems are becoming available and may provide the requisite speed of data transfer and data security.

In exemplary embodiments the encrypted communications between the synchronizing computer system and the in system third parties may be via the Internet e.g. as email to a server at the third party recipient or via facsimile transmission or by telephony. If the latter then preferably using an automated telephonic system. Likewise any return communications from the in system third party to the computer system and thence optionally to the hand held computers may also be via Internet or by facsimile transmission or via telephone. In the case of an out of system third party this type of party may respond to a care giver or designated party but may not directly interact with the computer system other than to receive an instruction from it via the Internet or via telephony.

Technologies for transmission and storage in memory of encrypted data are well known. Accordingly these encryption technologies will not be discussed in detail. Encryption software may be obtained for example from Cisco Systems San Jose Calif. and VeriSign Mountainview Calif. as well as other companies.

To maintain system integrity and prevent unauthorized access the coordinated patient health care system is protected by requiring authentication of all users of hand held computers and all third parties . Authentication of hand held computer users may be through a password system or through use of biometrics such as a finger print reader incorporated into the hand held device or in communication with it. Authentication of third parties may be achieved through contractual arrangements with the third parties. Thus a contract may limit access to transmitted communications to only those authorized to have access for example pharmacists. In addition passwords may be necessary to access email communications that include patient health care information. Responses should likewise be limited to those representatives of the third parties that are authorized to respond.

As is apparent from the foregoing description one of the features of the coordinated patient health care system is the service of providing needed patient health care information to third parties in a secure manner. The system is monetized by assessing a fee for some services. Thus for example when a prescription is transmitted from the synchronizing computer system to a pharmacy and a confirmation response is received then a fee is assessed for the communication.

In exemplary embodiments fees may be collected in a variety of ways. For example a participating third party such as a pharmacy in the example above may enter into a contract that obligates it to maintain an account with a balance exceeding a minimum balance. For each fee bearing transaction such as a prescription transaction an automatic deduction is made from the account s balance and transferred to the account of the operator of the coordinated health care system . Once the minimum balance is reached the third party automatically replenishes its account. Other financial arrangements are also possible of course such as billing a credit card of the third party pharmacy for each fee bearing transaction. Services such as PayPal trademark of PayPal Inc. of San Jose Calif. .

An exemplary embodiment of the system accrues costs and expenses for all billable goods treatments and services provided for the patient. The system maintains billing entries in a database associated with each patient. Accordingly bills may be generated at any time or at predetermined intervals and provided to the patient and his her insurer as ebills or in hard copy.

Using the hand held computers of an exemplary system a user can make real time updates to a patient s file. Thus for example new diagnoses may be recorded on the hand held. These new diagnoses are automatically uploaded to the synchronizing computer system and are available to other users looking at the patient s file. Similarly hand held users may input information regarding patient allergies lab test results medications medication administration protocols treatments photos of the patient s condition and any other care orders. The availability in the system of this patient and pharmaceutical drug information enables an automatic cross check of any new prescription against known patient allergies and sensitivities as well as a cross check for drug interactions if any with other patient medications. It also permits checking of dosages against pharmaceutical drug information to minimize risks of over under dosage. Accordingly the system reduces a number of risks in patient care.

In exemplary embodiments the hand held computers may be equipped with any of a variety of useful applications programs. For example these applications programs may prompt data input by using interrogatories that the user answers to provide the input. In other embodiments user data input via the hand held computer may be carried out via handwriting or by scribing with a stylus on a touch screen of a hand held computer by voice recording by typing by selecting information from a drop down menu or by dictation. The latter technique may utilize speech recognition products such as Dragon Naturally Speaking a trademark and product of Nuance of Burlington Mass. and the like to allow verbal input to be converted to text. A medical dictionary applications program may also be provided.

In the illustrated coordinated patient health care system the cloud computing network includes several application programming interfaces. Among these is an Internet interface module to enable communications with hand held computers and with third parties a database which constitutes structured cloud memory for storage of all patient health care information and an accounting module that tracks fee bearing activities assesses appropriate fees and maintains accounting records of bills and payments. Further applications programs that are not each separately depicted in may include but are not limited to a Speech Recognition applications program a Calendar applications program a Clock applications program a Credit Card applications program a Wi Fi applications program a Communications applications program a Lexicon applications program a Camera applications program a Dialer applications program a Fax applications program a Hand Writing Recognition applications program a Voice Recording Program a Signature applications program a Calculator applications program a Drug Interaction applications program an EMAR Electronic Medical Records applications program a Photo applications program a Printer applications program a Bar Code Reader applications program a Bluetooth applications program a location based GPS applications program an MDS program a RFID applications program a vascular identification applications program a retina recognition applications program a fingerprint recognition applications program a facial recognition applications program a CAN applications program an Inventory applications program a G L applications program a Billing and Payables applications program an ADT applications program and any required Interface software that is necessary.

The cloud computing network communicates with a plurality of third parties through encrypted communications as explained above.

While cloud computing offers advantages some facilities may prefer to control the computing hardware in house and may elect to purchase or lease its own equipment. illustrates an example of a patient care coordination system that has a remote computer system in communication with a plurality of hand held computers located at a facility as well as a plurality of third parties . In this instance the computer system may be located on the premises of the facility e.g. at the nursing home facility that it services or it may be at a remote location. Further in an exemplary embodiment the computer system has appropriate backup of data to prevent data loss and may also have redundancy in hardware to avoid service interruptions due to potential equipment failures and maintenance downtime.

While not depicted in these exemplary systems may also include patient care devices depicted in the example of and operating as explained with reference to above.

In the example of a user will log in to the exemplary system using predetermined authentication such as a user identification and a password or biometrics or some other means of authentication. The hand held device is then activated and is programmed to provide information to that user allow that user to input data and also to access data specific to that user e.g. health care data regarding a nursing home resident under the care of that particular user . The user may then for example touch the Clock icon which displays actual time of day. This may also produce a pop up menu that lists scheduled activities specific to the user. For example it may list the upcoming rounds of the user listing residents to whom medications and or treatment must be administered and the time for such administration. The central white board icon lists alerts and messages appropriate for the particular care giver user of the system . Thus once the care giver has logged into the system and has been authenticated she can immediately see and review the white board icon to see alerts pertinent to her.

To admit re admit or pre admit a new patient or resident the care giver touches the admissions icon of and selects from the drop down menu of choices that appears as shown in . To admit a new resident she types in required information name medical record etc. as prompted by a form as exemplified in . Some data may be selected from menus like gender or birth date for example. The information is readily saved by tapping a save button as shown in .

To find a particular resident the care giver touches the exemplary resident button on the tool bar of which opens a menu of patient names as shown in . The care giver may then search for a patient by name and or location and room as shown in . The listing of residents may be color coded as shown in indicating resident status. For example those that are in urgent need of care may be shown in red and those that are not urgently in need of scheduled medications and treatments may appear in green. Similarly colors may be used to indicate other status for example occupancy status such as Active LOA in Hospital deceased within a certain time frame or bed not occupied. Color coding may also indicate those residents that missed getting their treatment or medications.

Upon selecting a particular resident touching the chart icon of the hand held computer opens a new screen that includes pertinent health care information and that may include a photo of the resident to minimize any risk of resident mis identification. The screen lists important resident information such as pending or overdue treatments allergies recent test results diagnoses physician data etc. The screen also has a series of side color coded touch tabs as can be readily seen that permit access to more specific patient information such as pharmaceutical treatments PO medical records MAR therapeutic information TX Minimum Data Set MDS and any audit data. Along the bottom of the screen in this example are arrayed additional touch tabs relating to the resident s contacts financials demographics and LOS history. Importantly there is also an edit touch button that permits the care giver to edit any of the resident s health care information as allowed by the system.

Referring back to touching the printer icon permits transmitting information to a printer wirelessly to print out selected information for example a prescription for a resident.

Touching the phone icon pulls up a contact list and permits placing a call text a message or email by touching a desired name or number or email address as appropriate.

Touching the camera icon activates the camera of the hand held computer and permits the user to photograph information for example wounds of a resident.

Touching the books icon permits access to reference materials such as the PDR or other reference selected from the pop up menu.

Touching the clip board allows the user access to notes that a care giver on a prior shift may have left for him her regarding a resident s condition requests or other information.

Touching the calendar pops up the current month or week or day and scheduled activities for that period. Touching the activity provides more information in a new screen or on the same screen.

Touching the alarm light when it is flashing provides an urgent alert. That alert may relate to resident condition fire or other emergency. It may provide a pop up menu for the user to select for example whether to call code blue call 911 etc as necessary.

Touching the coffee cup icon will indicate to all other system users that the user is taking a break.

As personalization in the exemplary graphic display the user may customize the window scene to any of a number of scenes that he she finds pleasing.

The sticky note pads icons may be used or may be an optional item for example and may only appear as necessary or appropriate as alerts to a user.

The medication containers icon may be a live link that directs to the MAR for the patient to shortcut having to go to that information via the chart icon

Optionally the screen may also include a photo display of the user as icon shown in but not for example.

Exemplary embodiments of the automatically synchronized patient care coordination system may provide many advantages over the current systems. For example the coordinated patient health care system substantially replaces paper forms with electronic data that may be accessed in several different ways. This has several resultant benefits including linking medication administration with drug references such as the PDR Physicians Desk Record or similar for immediate check of potential adverse drug interactions inappropriate dose and contraindications. The system provides alerts when drug interactions inappropriate dose and contraindications are determined. Treatment flow records may be linked to patient care reference information. The system might also reduce erroneous billing charges for medication and supplies and assure billing of only the utilized resources including medication and other care delivery products.

Further benefits of exemplary embodiments of the automatically synchronized patient care coordination system include error reduction. The digital font format of information display on the screens of the hand held computers improves legibility over handwriting and should reduce errors. Further a screen for the patient may include a photo of the patient thereby reducing the potential for administering medications or treatment to the wrong patient. Medication may also be depicted pictorially in color thereby reducing the potential for administration of the wrong dose of a medication since tablets and pills are often color coded and or shape configured to indicate the amount of active ingredient. The system may also use the clock applications program for example to provide an alert about an upcoming administration of a medication to a patient as well as a missed scheduled medication. This should then allow appropriate remedial action and proper documentation by requiring explanatory input into the system.

Exemplary embodiments of the automatically synchronized patient care coordination system eliminate duplication and attendant wasted resources. For example once input the patient s primary record may populate all appropriate fields eliminating need to rewrite information once entered. Thus for example resident name room number primary physician allergies diagnoses and medication orders are all entered only once. Further the entry of doctor s orders simultaneously creates several required documents such as for example the Physician s Order form the Medication Administration Record Treatment Records and appropriate supplemental care records. The system may also transmit data to the dispensing pharmacy for prescribed medications.

Exemplary embodiments of the automatically synchronized patient care coordination system support care decision making. For example the system may provide allergy checking with alerts drug interaction checking drug utilization evaluation access to clinical references graphic display of monitored data such as patient resident weight temperature pulse blood pressure reports interpreting compiled data for individual patients residents facility population or other specified data elements. The system may also provide medication related assessments including but not limited to need for pulse monitoring or blood glucose results for determining an insulin dose to be administered. For example the system may also record the direct care given by the Certified Nursing Assistant CNA which is required in the MDS billing. The system may also facilitate a guided narrative summary of care by including a capability to input dictated notes which are converted to text using voice recognition technology.

Exemplary embodiments of the automatically synchronized patient care coordination system support prompt care delivery and appropriate follow up. The system may provide these benefits through alerts for pending care events such as monitoring needs scheduled medications and treatments Lists for specified data elements such as pending lab specimen collection needs or needed vital signs monitoring and Reports to monitor evaluate care pre defined and user defined parameters. Further exemplary systems may provide lists to monitor and support care using pre defined and user defined parameters and provide Care Summaries and change of shift reports utilizing pre defined and user defined parameters.

While examples of embodiments of the technology have been presented and described in text and some examples also by way of illustration it will be appreciated that various changes and modifications may be made in the described technology without departing from the scope of the inventions which are set forth in and only limited by the scope of the appended patent claims as properly interpreted and construed.
