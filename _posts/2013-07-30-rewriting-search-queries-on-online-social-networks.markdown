This disclosure generally relates to social graphs and performing searches for objects within a social networking environment.

A social networking system which may include a social networking website may enable its users such as persons or organizations to interact with it and with each other through it. The social networking system may with input from a user create and store in the social networking system a user profile associated with the user. The user profile may include demographic information communication channel information and information on personal interests of the user. The social networking system may also with input from a user create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social networking system as well as provide services e.g. wall posts photo sharing event organization messaging games or advertisements to facilitate social interaction between or among users.

The social networking system may send over one or more networks content or messages related to its services to a mobile or other computing device of a user. A user may also install software applications on a mobile or other computing device of the user for accessing a user profile of the user and other data within the social networking system. The social networking system may generate a personalized set of content objects to display to a user such as a newsfeed of aggregated stories of other users connected to the user.

Social graph analysis views social relationships in terms of network theory consisting of nodes and edges. Nodes represent the individual actors within the networks and edges represent the relationships between the actors. The resulting graph based structures are often very complex. There can be many types of nodes and many types of edges for connecting nodes. In its simplest form a social graph is a map of all of the relevant edges between all the nodes being studied.

In particular embodiments a user of a social networking system may search for objects associated with the system using a search queries.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may improve the processing of search queries by improving the static scores rankings of objects stored in data stores. When the social networking system retrieves objects from a data store in response to a query the objects may be retrieved based on a pre determined static score or static rank associated with the object which may be based for example on how the objects are indexed . The objects retrieved from all data stores may then be aggregated and scored based on a variety of factors such as for example relevance to the query social graph affinity user history etc. by the social networking system and these final scores or final ranks may then be used to determine which objects are generated as search results that are displayed to the querying user. However this process may be inefficient if the social networking system has to retrieve an excess of objects from the data stores in order to generate a sufficient number of search results. This process could be improved if the static ranks of objects more closely match the final ranks determined by the social networking system when generating search results for a user. This may allow the social networking system to reduce the number of matching objects that need to be retrieved in order to generate a sufficient number of search results in response to a query. In order to improve the static scores of objects indexed in one or more data stores the social networking system may compared the static scores of objects retrieved from a data store with the final scores calculated by the social networking system in order to generate search results for a user and revise or adjust the static scores or the scoring algorithm used to calculate the static scores of the indexed objects so they more closely match the final scores. For example the social networking system may access a set of archived search queries and optimize the static scores of objects retrieved by these queries. This may be done for a variety of queries or query types so that the static scores are optimized to match the final scores as closely as possible for a variety of queries.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may improve the processing of search queries by improving how query commands are generated. When a query is parsed to generate a query command the query command may specify a particular number of objects to retrieve of one or more object types. The number of objects to retrieve of each object type may be specified by parsing configuration parameters of the parsing algorithm used to generate the query commands. The retrieved objects may then be scored ranked and the top N scoring objects may be sent to the querying user. However this process may be inefficient if the social networking system has to retrieve an excess of one or more object types from particular data stores in order to retrieve the top N scoring objects particularly with respect to inefficient use of processing power. This process could be improved if the number of objects retrieved from each data store could be reduced while still retrieving some or all of the objects with the best final scores allowing the quality of the generated search results that are sent back to the user to be maintained. In order to reduce the number of retrieved objects the social networking system may compare the number of objects retrieved from each data store with the final scores for those objects as calculated by the social networking system and revise the parsing algorithm so query commands request fewer objects while still maintaining substantially the same quality of search results. For example the social networking system may access a set of archived search queries and optimize the parsing algorithm based on the final scores of the objects retrieved by these queries. The archived queries may be submitted to one or more data stores which may retrieve a first number of results based the number of objects to retrieve specified by the query commands generated for those queries by the parsing algorithm. Each retrieved object may then be scored to determine a final score rank which may then be compared to the number of objects retrieved to determine whether the number of objects retrieved for a particular object type can be reduced while still retrieving a sufficient number of the top N scoring results. If so then the parsing algorithm is may be revised so that query commands generated in response to particular queries specify retrieving fewer objects or object types.

Profile pages may be hosted by or accessible to social networking system . Profile pages may also be hosted on third party websites associated with a third party server . As an example and not by way of limitation a profile page corresponding to a particular external webpage may be the particular external webpage and the profile page may correspond to a particular concept node . Profile pages may be viewable by all or a selected subset of other users. As an example and not by way of limitation a user node may have a corresponding user profile page in which the corresponding user may add content make declarations or otherwise express himself or herself. As another example and not by way of limitation a concept node may have a corresponding concept profile page in which one or more users may add content make declarations or express themselves particularly in relation to the concept corresponding to concept node .

In particular embodiments a concept node may represent a third party webpage or resource hosted by third party system . The third party webpage or resource may include among other elements content a selectable or other icon or other inter actable object which may be implemented for example in JavaScript AJAX or PHP codes representing an action or activity. As an example and not by way of limitation a third party webpage may include a selectable icon such as like check in eat recommend or another suitable action or activity. A user viewing the third party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons e.g. eat causing client system to send to social networking system a message indicating the user s action. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge e.g. an eat edge between a user node corresponding to the user and a concept node corresponding to the third party webpage or resource and store edge in one or more data stores.

In particular embodiments a pair of nodes in social graph may be connected to each other by one or more edges . An edge connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes. In particular embodiments an edge may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may indicate that a second user is a friend of the first user. In response to this indication social networking system may send a friend request to the second user. If the second user confirms the friend request social networking system may create an edge connecting the first user s user node to the second user s user node in social graph and store edge as social graph information in one or more of data stores . In the example of social graph includes an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user A and user B and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user C and user B. Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular edges with particular attributes connecting particular user nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes . As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent a friendship family relationship business or employment relationship fan relationship follower relationship visitor relationship subscriber relationship superior subordinate relationship reciprocal relationship non reciprocal relationship another suitable type of relationship or two or more such relationships. Moreover although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected. Herein references to users or concepts being connected may where appropriate refer to the nodes corresponding to those users or concepts being connected in social graph by one or more edges .

In particular embodiments an edge between a user node and a concept node may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user associated with user node toward a concept associated with a concept node . As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in a user may like attended played listened cooked worked at or watched a concept each of which may correspond to a edge type or subtype. A concept profile page corresponding to a concept node may include for example a selectable check in icon such as for example a clickable check in icon or a selectable add to favorites icon. Similarly after a user clicks these icons social networking system may create a favorite edge or a check in edge in response to a user s action corresponding to a respective action. As another example and not by way of limitation a user user C may listen to a particular song Imagine using a particular application SPOTIFY which is an online music application . In this case social networking system may create a listened edge and a used edge as illustrated in between user nodes corresponding to the user and concept nodes corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application. Moreover social networking system may create a played edge as illustrated in between concept nodes corresponding to the song and the application to indicate that the particular song was played by the particular application. In this case played edge corresponds to an action performed by an external application SPOTIFY on an external audio file the song Imagine . Although this disclosure describes particular edges with particular attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes . Moreover although this disclosure describes edges between a user node and a concept node representing a single relationship this disclosure contemplates edges between a user node and a concept node representing one or more relationships. As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent both that a user likes and has used at a particular concept. Alternatively another edge may represent each type of relationship or multiples of a single relationship between a user node and a concept node as illustrated in between user node for user E and concept node for SPOTIFY .

In particular embodiments social networking system may create an edge between a user node and a concept node in social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation a user viewing a concept profile page such as for example by using a web browser or a special purpose application hosted by the user s client system may indicate that he or she likes the concept represented by the concept node by clicking or selecting a Like icon which may cause the user s client system to send to social networking system a message indicating the user s liking of the concept associated with the concept profile page. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge between user node associated with the user and concept node as illustrated by like edge between the user and concept node . In particular embodiments social networking system may store an edge in one or more data stores. In particular embodiments an edge may be automatically formed by social networking system in response to a particular user action. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user uploads a picture watches a movie or listens to a song an edge may be formed between user node corresponding to the first user and concept nodes corresponding to those concepts. Although this disclosure describes forming particular edges in particular manners this disclosure contemplates forming any suitable edges in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments each object may correspond to a particular node of a social graph . An edge connecting the particular node and another node may indicate a relationship between objects corresponding to these nodes. In addition to storing objects a particular data store may also store social graph information relating to the object. Alternatively social graph information about particular objects may be stored in a different data store from the objects. Social networking system may update the search index of the data store based on newly received objects and relationships associated with the received objects.

In particular embodiments each data store may be configured to store objects of a particular one of a plurality of object types in respective data storage devices . An object type may be for example a user a photo a post a comment a message an event listing a webpage an application a user profile page a concept profile page a user group an audio file a video an offer coupon or another suitable type of object. Although this disclosure describes particular types of objects this disclosure contemplates any suitable types of objects. As an example and not by way of limitation a user vertical P illustrated in may store user objects. Each user object stored in the user vertical P may comprise an identifier e.g. a character string a user name and a profile picture for a user of the online social network. Social networking system may also store in the user vertical P information associated with a user object such as language location education contact information interests relationship status a list of friends contacts a list of family members privacy settings and so on. As an example and not by way of limitation a post vertical P illustrated in may store post objects. Each post object stored in the post vertical P may comprise an identifier a text string for a post posted to social networking system . Social networking system may also store in the post vertical P information associated with a post object such as a time stamp an author privacy settings users who like the post a count of likes comments a count of comments location and so on. As an example and not by way of limitation a photo vertical P may store photo objects or objects of other media types such as video or audio . Each photo object stored in the photo vertical P may comprise an identifier and a photo. Social networking system may also store in the photo vertical P information associated with a photo object such as a time stamp an author privacy settings users who are tagged in the photo users who like the photo comments and so on. In particular embodiments each data store may also be configured to store information associated with each stored object in data storage devices .

In particular embodiments objects stored in each vertical may be indexed by one or more search indices. The search indices may be hosted by respective index server comprising one or more computing devices e.g. servers . The index server may update the search indices based on data e.g. a photo and information associated with a photo submitted to social networking system by users or other processes of social networking system or a third party system . The index server may also update the search indices periodically e.g. every 24 hours . The index server may receive a query comprising a search term and access and retrieve search results from one or more search indices corresponding to the search term. In some embodiments a vertical corresponding to a particular object type may comprise a plurality of physical or logical partitions each comprising respective search indices.

In particular embodiments social networking system may receive a search query from a PHP Hypertext Preprocessor process . The PHP process may comprise one or more computing processes hosted by one or more servers of social networking system . The search query may be a text string or a structured query submitted to the PHP process by a user or another process of social networking system or third party system .

In connection with search queries and search results particular embodiments may utilize one or more systems components elements functions methods operations or steps disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 503 093 filed 11 Aug. 2006 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 763 162 filed 19 Apr. 2010 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 977 027 filed 22 Dec. 2010 U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 13 732 101 filed 31 Dec. 2012 each of which is incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments social networking system may improve the processing of search queries by improving the static scores rankings of objects stored in data stores . When social networking system retrieves objects from a data store in response to a query the objects may be retrieved based on a pre determined static score or static rank associated with the object which may be based for example on how the objects are indexed . The objects retrieved from all data stores may then be aggregated and scored based on a variety of factors such as for example relevance to the query social graph affinity user history etc. by social networking system and these final scores or final ranks may then be used to determine which objects are generated as search results that are displayed to the querying user. However this process may be inefficient if social networking system has to retrieve an excess of objects from the data stores in order to generate a sufficient number of search results. As an example and not by way of limitation if social networking system retrieves 100 matching objects from a particular data store where each object has an associated static rank and then these 100 objects are scored by social networking system the top five ranked objects might be for example objects having static ranks of 4 12 20 78 and 95. This process could be improved if the static ranks of objects more closely match the final ranks determined by social networking system when generating search results for a user. This may allow social networking system to reduce the number of matching objects that need to be retrieved in order to generate a sufficient number of search results in response to a query. In order to improve the static scores of objects indexed in one or more data stores social networking system may compared the static scores of objects retrieved from a data store with the final score calculated by social networking system in order to generate search results for a user and revise or adjust the static scores or the scoring algorithm used to calculate the static scores of the indexed objects so they more closely match the final scores. As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may access a set of archived search queries and optimize the static scores of objects retrieved by these queries. The archived queries may be submitted to one or more data stores which may retrieve a first number of results based on their static ranks. Each retrieved objects may then scored to determine a final rank which may then be compared to the static rank and the static rank may be modified so it more closely matches the final rank. This may be done for a variety of queries or query types so that the static scores are optimized to match the final scores as closely as possible for a variety of queries. Although this disclosure describes improving static rankings in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates improving static rankings in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may improve the processing of search queries by improving how query commands are generated. When a query is parsed to generate a query command the query command may specify a particular number of objects to retrieve of one or more object types e.g. the number to score for each vertical accessed . As an example and not by way of limitation in response to the text query steph social networking system may generate a query command that requests ten first degree connections of the querying user from a users vertical fifty second degree connections and twenty pages from a pages vertical . The number of objects to retrieve of each object type may be specified by parsing configuration parameters of the parsing algorithm used to generate the query commands. The retrieved objects may then be scored ranked and the top N scoring objects may be sent to the querying user. However this process may be inefficient if social networking system has to retrieve an excess of one or more object types from particular verticals in order to retrieve the top N scoring objects particularly with respect to inefficient use of processing CPU power. This process could be improved if the number of objects retrieved from each vertical could be reduced while still retrieving some or all of the objects with the best final scores ranks allowing the quality of the generated search results that are sent back to the user to be maintained. As an example and not by way of limitation continuing with the prior example it may be possible to generate search results of the same quality i.e. still retrieve substantially all of the top N scoring objects by generating a query command that only requests ten first degree connections twenty five second degree connections instead of fifty and ten pages instead of twenty . In order to reduce the number of retrieved objects social networking system may compare the number of objects retrieved from each vertical with the final scores for those objects as calculated by social networking system and revise the parsing algorithm so query commands request fewer objects while still maintaining substantially the same quality of search results. As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may access a set of archived search queries and optimize the parsing algorithm based on the final scores of the objects retrieved by these queries. The archived queries may be submitted to one or more data stores which may retrieve a first number of results based the number of objects to retrieve specified by the query commands generated for those queries by the parsing algorithm. Each retrieved object may then be scored to determine a final score rank which may then be compared to the number of objects retrieved to determine whether the number of objects retrieved for a particular object type can be reduced while still retrieving the top N scoring results or at least retrieving a sufficient number of the top N results . If so then the parsing algorithm is may be revised so that query commands generated in response to particular queries specify retrieving fewer objects or object types. Although this disclosure describes improving how query commands are generated in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates improving how query commands are improved in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may access a set of queries of the online social network received from one or more users of the online social network. Search queries submitted by users may be saved by social networking system and later retrieved in order to run experiments to optimize the processing of search queries. As an example and not by way of limitation the set of queries may comprise a plurality of archived queries from a plurality of users of the online social network. Experiments using the archived queries may be done for example by having social networking system execute the queries analyze the parsing of the queries and the objects retrieved by the queries and then optimizing particular aspects of the querying process. Although this disclosure describes accessing particular sets of queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates accessing any suitable sets of queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may receive from a querying first user corresponding to a first user node an unstructured text query. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may want to search for other users who 1 are first degree friends of the first user and 2 are associated with Stanford University i.e. the user nodes are connected by an edge to the concept node corresponding to the school Stanford . The first user may then enter a text query friends stanford into query field as illustrated in . As the querying user enters this text query into query field social networking system may provide various suggested structured queries as illustrated in drop down menus . As used herein an unstructured text query refers to a simple text string inputted by a user. The text query may of course be structured with respect to standard language grammar rules e.g. English language grammar . However the text query will ordinarily be unstructured with respect to social graph elements. In other words a simple text query will not ordinarily include embedded references to particular social graph elements. Thus as used herein a structured query refers to a query that contains references to particular social graph elements allowing the search engine to search based on the identified elements. Furthermore the text query may be unstructured with respect to formal query syntax. In other words a simple text query will not necessarily be in the format of a query command that is directly executable by a search engine e.g. the text query friends stanford could be parsed to form the query command intersect school Stanford University friends me which could be executed as a query in a social graph database . Although this disclosure describes receiving particular queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates receiving any suitable queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may parse the unstructured text query also simply referred to as a search query received from the first user i.e. the querying user to identify one or more n grams. In general an n gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sequence of text or speech. The items may be characters phonemes syllables letters words base pairs prefixes or other identifiable items from the sequence of text or speech. The n gram may comprise one or more characters of text letters numbers punctuation etc. entered by the querying user. An n gram of size one can be referred to as a unigram of size two can be referred to as a bigram or digram of size three can be referred to as a trigram and so on. Each n gram may include one or more parts from the text query received from the querying user. In particular embodiments each n gram may comprise a character string e.g. one or more characters of text entered by the first user. As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may parse the text query friends stanford to identify the following n grams friends stanford friends stanford. As another example and not by way of limitation social networking system may parse the text query friends in palo alto to identify the following n grams friends in palo alto friends in in palo palo alto friend in palo in palo also friends in palo alto. In particular embodiments each n gram may comprise a contiguous sequence of n items from the text query. Although this disclosure describes parsing particular queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates parsing any suitable queries in any suitable manner. In connection with element detection and parsing search queries particular embodiments may utilize one or more systems components elements functions methods operations or steps disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 556 072 filed 23 Jul. 2012 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 732 101 filed 31 Dec. 2012 each of which is incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments social networking system may generate one or more structured queries. The structured queries may be based on the natural language strings generated by one or more grammars of a grammar model. Each structured query may include references to one or more of the identified nodes or one or more of the identified edges . This type of structured query may allow social networking system to more efficiently search for resources and content related to the online social network such as for example profile pages by searching for content connected to or otherwise related to the identified user nodes and the identified edges . As an example and not by way of limitation in response to the text query show me friends of my girlfriend social networking system may generate a structured query Friends of Stephanie where Friends and Stephanie in the structured query are references corresponding to particular social graph elements. The reference to Stephanie would correspond to a particular user node where social networking system has parsed the n gram my girlfriend to correspond with a user node for the user Stephanie while the reference to Friends would correspond to friend type edges connecting that user node to other user nodes i.e. edges connecting to Stephanie s first degree friends . When executing this structured query social networking system may identify one or more user nodes connected by friend type edges to the user node corresponding to Stephanie . As another example and not by way of limitation in response to the text query friends who like facebook social networking system may generate a structured query Friends who like Facebook where Friends like and Facebook in the structured query are references corresponding to particular social graph elements as described previously i.e. a friend type edge a like type edge and concept node corresponding to the company Facebook . Although this disclosure describes generating particular structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable structured queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may receive from the querying user a selection of one of the structured queries. The nodes and edges referenced in the received structured query may be referred to as the selected nodes and selected edges respectively. As an example and not by way of limitation the web browser on the querying user s client system may display the sent structured queries in a drop down menu as illustrated in which the user may then click on or otherwise select e.g. by simply keying enter on his keyboard to indicate the particular structured query the user wants social networking system to execute. Upon selecting a particular structured query the user s client system may call or otherwise instruct to social networking system to execute the selected structured query. Although this disclosure describes receiving selections of particular structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates receiving selections of any suitable structured queries in any suitable manner.

No. 13 674 695 filed 12 Nov. 2012 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 731 866 filed 31 Dec. 2012 each of which is incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments social networking system may generate a query command based on a query e.g. a text query or a structured query received from a querying user. The query command may then be used in a search against objects in a data store of the social networking system . In particular embodiments the query command may be provided for a search using search indices for one or more data stores or verticals of social networking system . The query command may comprise one or more query constraints. Each query constraint may be identified by social networking system based on a parsing of the query by a parsing algorithm. Each query constraint may be a request for a particular object type. In particular embodiments the query command may comprise query constraints in symbolic expression or s expression. Social networking system may parse the structured query Photos I like to a query command photos liked by . The query command photos liked by denotes a query for photos liked by a user i.e. which corresponding to the querying user with a single result type of photo. The query constraint may include for example social graph constraints e.g. requests for particular nodes or nodes types or requests for nodes connected to particular edges or edge types object constraints e.g. request for particular objects or object types location constraints e.g. requests for objects or social graph entities associates with particular geographic locations other suitable constraints or any combination thereof. In particular embodiments a query command may comprise prefix and an object. The object may correspond to a particular node in the social graph while the prefix may correspond to a particular edge or edge type indicating a particular type of relationship connecting to the particular node in the social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation the query command pages liked by comprises a prefix pages liked by and an object . Although this disclosure describes generating particular query commands in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable query commands in any suitable manner. In particular embodiments social networking system may generate a query command comprising a weak and WAND or strong or operator SOR . More information on WAND and SOR operators may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 560 901 filed 27 Jul. 2012 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 887 049 filed 3 May which are incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments the parsing algorithm used to generate query commands may comprise one or more parsing configuration parameters. The parsing configuration parameters may specify how to generate a query command for a particular type of query received from a user. The parsing configuration parameters may specify for example instructions for generating a query commands having a specified number of query constraints for a specified number of objects of a specified object type to be retrieved from a specified number of data stores . In other words the parsing configuration parameters may specify the types of objects that should be searched and the types number of verticals that should be accessed. For each vertical accessed the parsing configuration parameters may specify the number of objects to retrieve from each vertical . As an example and not by way of limitation in response to a search query input kais social networking system may generate the following query command 

In particular embodiments social networking system may retrieve objects from one or more verticals that match at least a portion of the query constraints of a query command. Social networking system may access one or more verticals in response to a search query received from a user as specified by the query command. Each vertical may store one or more objects associated with the online social network. The number and type of verticals accessed in response to the search query may be based on the query constraints of the query command. Each vertical may store objects associated with the online social network of the object type specified by the query constraint. As an example and not by way of limitation one of the query constraints of a query command for users social networking system may access a users vertical to identify one or more users who match the query. Social networking system may identify matching objects in any suitable manner such as for example by using one or more string matching algorithms to match the character string with a string of characters associated with each of one or more of the objects. As an example and not by way of limitation in response to a search query input kais social networking system may access one or more users verticals and one or more pages verticals and search the accessed verticals to identify objects e.g. user profile pages or concept profile pages stored in those verticals. Social networking system may submit the following query command to each accessed vertical 

In particular embodiments when searching verticals to identify matching objects social networking system may only identify and score up to a threshold number of matching nodes in a particular vertical . When social networking system retrieves objects from a vertical in response to a query or a particular query constraint the objects may be retrieved based on a static score or static rank of the indexed objects. As an example and not by way of limitation the objects with the static ranks up to the threshold number may be retrieved and further processed for example by a scoring algorithm that may calculate a final score for the retrieved objects based on a variety of factors in order to determine search results to send back to the querying user. Each object stored in a vertical may be associated with a pre determined static score based on a static scoring algorithm. In particular embodiments the pre determined static score of each object may a pre determined ranking of the object for a particular type of query. As an example and not by way of limitation when a structured query comprises friends of Alex which may be a portion of a larger query such as photos of friends of Alex or friends of friends of Alex user nodes corresponding to friends of the user Alex may have pre determined static scores with respect to this structured query. Alex s top three friends may be for example Larry Moe and Joe ranked in that order. Thus when searching a users vertical in response to the query friends of Alex or the query command friends of the users Larry Moe and Joe may be retrieved as the top three objects. When searching a vertical social networking system may retrieve objects based on the static scores of the objects where the objects with the highest best static scores may be retrieved. The threshold number of matching objects may then be scored and ranked by the social networking system . The threshold number may be chosen to enhance search quality or to optimize the processing of search results. As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may only identify the top N matching objects i.e. the number to score or num to score for an s expression in the examples used herein in a users vertical in response to a query command requesting users. The top N objects may be determined by their static scores e.g. ranking based on the current social graph affinity of the user with respect to the querying user of the objects in a search index corresponding to the users vertical . The static scores may be pre determined by social networking system using a static scoring algorithm. However this process may be inefficient if social networking system has to retrieve an excess number of objects from a vertical in order to find the top N scoring objects according the scoring algorithm that determines which objects to send back to a user as search results. As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may access a particular vertical in response to a query and retrieves one hundred matching objects where each object has an associated static rank. A final score may then be calculated for these one hundred objects e.g. based on social graph affinity by a scoring algorithm. The top 5 scoring objects according to the scoring algorithm may be for example objects having a static rank of 4 12 20 78 and 95. This process could be improved for example if the top N objects static rank were the same as the top N objects by final rank. By more closely aligning the static rank of object with the final ranks calculated by the search engine social networking system may be able to reduce the number of matching objects it needs to retrieve and score in order to generate a sufficient number of search results. In particular embodiments the static score of an object may be based on the search query itself. In other words depending on the particular query or query type an object may have a different static score with respect to that query or query type. As an example and not by way of limitation if the number to score is 500 the top 500 objects may be identified. These 500 objects may then be scores based on one or more factors e.g. match to the search query or other query constraints social graph affinity search history etc. and the top M results may then be generated as search results to display to the querying user. In particular embodiments the top results after one or more rounds of rankings may be sent to an aggregator for a final round of ranking where identified objects may be reordered redundant results may be dropped or any other type of results processing may occur before presentation to the querying user. Although this disclosure describes identifying particular numbers of objects this disclosure contemplates identifying any suitable numbers of objects. Furthermore although this disclosure describes ranking objects in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates ranking objects in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may score one or more objects identified as matching a query constraint. The score also referred to as a final score for each retrieved identified object may be calculated in any suitable manner such as for example by using a particular scoring algorithm. Each identified object may correspond to a particular user node or concept node of social graph . When a query command includes a plurality of query constraints social networking system may score the nodes matching each query constraint independently or jointly. Social networking system may score the first set of identified nodes by accessing a data store corresponding to the object type of the identified nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation when generating identified nodes matching the query constraint extract authors term posts liked by social networking system may identify the set of users in the user vertical . Social networking system may then score the users and based on their respective social affinity with respect to the user . For example social networking system of the post vertical may then score the identified nodes of users and based on a number of posts in the list of posts liked by the user . The users and may have authored the following posts liked by the user . If user authored posts user authored posts and and user authored post social networking system may score user as highest since his authored most of the posts in the list of posts liked by the user with and having consecutively lower scores. As another example and not by way of limitation using the prior example social networking system may access a forward index that maps a post to a count of likes of the post. The index server may access the forward index and retrieve counts of likes for each post of the list of posts liked by the user . The index server may score the posts in the list of posts i.e. based on respective counts of likes and return to social networking system authors of top scored posts e.g. top 3 scored or most liked posts as the first identified node. After each appropriate scoring factor is considered for a particular identified node an overall score for the identified node may be determined. Based on the scoring of the nodes social networking system may then generate one or more sets of identified nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may only generate a set of identified nodes corresponding to nodes having a score greater than a threshold score. As another example and not by way of limitation social networking system may rank the scored nodes and then only generate a set of identified nodes corresponding to nodes having a rank greater than a threshold rank e.g. top ten top twenty etc. . Although this disclosure describes scoring matching nodes in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates scoring matching nodes in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may score the search results based on a social graph affinity associated with the querying user or the user node of the querying user . The scoring algorithm used to score retrieved object may use social graph affinity as a factor. Social networking system may determine the social graph affinity which may be referred to herein as affinity of various social graph entities for each other. Affinity may represent the strength of a relationship or level of interest between particular objects associated with the online social network such as users concepts content actions advertisements other objects associated with the online social network or any suitable combination thereof. In particular embodiments social networking system may measure or quantify social graph affinity using an affinity coefficient which may be referred to herein as coefficient . The coefficient may represent or quantify the strength of a relationship between particular objects associated with the online social network. The coefficient may also represent a probability or function that measures a predicted probability that a user will perform a particular action based on the user s interest in the action. In particular embodiments social graph affinity may be used as a factor when scoring search results. As an example and not by way of limitation in response to the structured query Photos of my friends social networking system may generate the query command photos of users and may determine that the search intent of this query is to view group photos showing the user s friends. When scoring identified concept nodes corresponding to photos with the user s friends tagged in the photo social networking system may score photos better based on the querying user s respective social graph affinity e.g. as measured by a affinity coefficient of the user s tagged in the photo with respect to the querying user. Furthermore photos showing more of the querying user s friends may be tagged higher than photos showing fewer of the user s friends since having more friends tagged in the photo may increase the querying user s affinity with respect to that particular photo. Although this disclosure describes scoring search results based on affinity in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates scoring search results based on affinity in any suitable manner. Furthermore in connection with social graph affinity and affinity coefficients particular embodiments may utilize one or more systems components elements functions methods operations or steps disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 503 093 filed 11 Aug. 2006 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 977 027 filed 22 Dec. 2010 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 978 265 filed 23 Dec. 2010 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 632 869 field 1 Oct. 2012 each of which is incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments social networking system may determine one or more revised static scores for one or more of the retrieved objects based on a comparison of the final scores and the static scores of the retrieved objects. The static scores associated with indexed object may be improved by revising the static scores based on experiments run using archived search queries. The archived queries can be parsed to generate query commands which can be submitted to a vertical in order to retrieve a first number of objects based on their static scores. The retrieved objects can have their final scores calculated. The final scores can then be compared to the static scores and the static scores can be modified so they more closely match the final scores. This can be done for a variety of queries so that the static scores are optimized to match the final scores as closely as possible for a variety of queries. In particular embodiments social networking system may revise the static scoring algorithm based on the revised static scores. The static scoring algorithm may be revised to calculate pre determined static scores for objects based on one or more of the revised static scores of one or more of the retrieved objects respectively. In particular embodiments social networking system may revise static scores by determining a difference between the pre determined static score for each object and the calculated final score for each object. Social networking system may then revise one or more of the static scores of one or more of the objects based on the determined differences. As an example and not by way of limitation continuing with a previous example if the top 5 objects by final score according to the scoring algorithm may be for example objects having a static rank of 4 12 20 78 and 95. The static ranks of all the objects may be revised upward so that these objects have static ranks closer to 1 to 5. Note that theoretically the ideal static ranks would be 1 2 3 4 and 5. However because the final scores may be based on a variety of factors such as social graph affinity and user history the ideal static ranks with respect to a first querying user or a first query type may be different than the ideal static ranks with respect to a second querying user or a second query type. Thus the static ranks of objects may be revised to they more closely match the final ranks of objects with respect to a variety of users and query types. Although this disclosure describes revising static scoring algorithms in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates revising static scoring algorithms in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may generate one or more revised parsing configuration parameters based on a comparison of the final scores of the retrieved objects and the specified number of objects of the query constraints. The parsing algorithm may be improved by revising the way query constraints are generated based on experiments run using archived search queries. The archived queries can be parsed to generate query commands which can be submitted to one or more verticals in order to retrieve a first number of objects. Social networking system may then calculate final scores for the retrieved objects and the final scores may then be analyzed to determine whether the number of objects retrieved for any specified object type can be reduced while still retrieving some or all of the top N scoring results. In particular embodiments social networking system may revise the parsing algorithm based on the parsing configuration parameters such that one or more of the specified number of objects of a specified object type is reduced based on the revised parsing configuration parameters. As an example and not by way of limitation for a particular query command s expression generated by the parsing algorithm in response to a particular query social networking system may revise the parsing configuration parameters used to generate that query command so the specified number of objects specified by num to score is reduced while still retrieving some or all of the top N scoring results e.g. retrieving a sufficient number of the top N scoring results to maintain a threshold quality of search results . If the num to score can be reduced then the parsing algorithm or particular parsing configuration parameters may be revised to retrieve fewer objects or object types. The amount that num to score is reduced may correlated directly to processing power consumed by social networking system . As these experiments are run using archived queries social networking system may generate data of score quality versus CPU power or simply num to score and use that data to find a point where for particular queries or query types social networking system is still retrieving sufficient high quality results i.e. high scoring results while significantly reducing the power consumed. In other words it may be worthwhile to sacrifice some search result quality if there is enough savings in processing power. In particular embodiments social networking system may revise the parsing algorithm based on the parsing configuration parameters such that one or more of the query constraints is removed from the query commands generated by the parsing algorithm based on the revised parsing configuration parameters. In particular embodiments social networking system may revise the parsing algorithm based on the parsing configuration parameters such that one or more of the specified number of data stores to access is reduced based on the revised parsing configuration parameters. As an example and not by way of limitation continuing with a prior example in response to a search query input kais social networking system may generate the following query command 

In particular embodiments in response to a query received from a querying user social networking system may generate one or more search results where the search results correspond to the query. Social networking system may identify objects e.g. users photos profile pages or content of profile pages etc. that satisfy or otherwise match the query. Each search result may correspond to a node of social graph . A search result corresponding to each identified object may then be generated. As an example and not by way of limitation in response to the query Photos of Matt and Stephanie social networking system may identify a photo where the user s Matt and Stephanie are both tagged in the photo. A search result corresponding to this photo may then be generated and sent to the user. In particular embodiments each search result may be associated with one or more objects where each query constraint of the query command corresponding to the query is satisfied by one or more of the objects associated with that particular search result. As an example and not by way of limitation continuing with the prior example in response to the structured query Photos of Matt and Stephanie social networking system may parse the query to generate the query command intersect photos of photos of which could be executed to generate a search result corresponding to a photo where the user s Matt and Stephanie who were both referenced in the structured query are both tagged in the photo i.e. their user nodes are connected by tagged in type edges to the concept node corresponding to the photo . In other words the constraints for photos of and photos of are both satisfied by the photo because it is connected to the user nodes for the user s Matt and Stephanie . The nodes identified as matching the query may be scored and possibly ranked and then one or more e.g. a threshold number may be generated as search result to display to the user. Although this disclosure describes generating search results in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating search results in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may send one or more search results to the querying user. The search results may be sent to the user for example in the form of a list of links on the search results webpage each link being associated with a different webpage that contains some of the identified resources or content. In particular embodiments each link in the search results may be in the form of a Uniform Resource Locator URL that specifies where the corresponding webpage is located and the mechanism for retrieving it. Social networking system may then send the search results webpage to the web browser on the user s client system . The user may then click on the URL links or otherwise select the content from the search results webpage to access the content from social networking system or from an external system such as for example third party system as appropriate. In particular embodiments each search result may include link to a profile page and a description or summary of the profile page or the node corresponding to that page . The search results may be presented and sent to the querying user as a search results page. When generating the search results social networking system may generate one or more snippets for each search result where the snippets are contextual information about the target of the search result i.e. contextual information about the social graph entity profile page or other content corresponding to the particular search result . In particular embodiments social networking system may only send search results having a score rank over a particular threshold score rank. As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may only send the top ten results back to the querying user in response to a particular search query. Although this disclosure describes sending particular search results in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates sending any suitable search results in any suitable manner.
