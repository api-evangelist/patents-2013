This application is a U.S. National Phase filing of International Application No. PCT IB2013 050283 filed 11 Jan. 2013 which claims priority to U.S. Application No. 61 586 324 filed 13 Jan. 2012 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

This invention relates to novel salts of 7 2 3 di p tolyl 7 8 dihydropyrido 2 3 b pyrazin 5 6H yl heptanoic acid a process for their preparation and their use in pharmaceutical compositions.

International patent application PCT EP2011 062028 WO2012 007539 discloses certain heterocyclic compounds that are active IP receptor agonists and their use in treating various conditions or diseases affected by the activation of the IP receptor including for example pulmonary arterial hypertension. One of those heterocyclic compounds is 7 2 3 di p tolyl 7 8 dihydropyrido 2 3 b pyrazin 5 6H yl heptanoic acid which has the following structure 

International patent application PCT EP2011 062028 WO2012 007539 discloses a process for preparing 7 2 3 di p tolyl 7 8 dihydropyrido 2 3 b pyrazin 5 6H yl heptanoic acid and the corresponding mesylate salt.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH is a life threatening disease characterized by a progressive pulmonary vasculopathy leading to right ventricular hypertrophy. Exogenous administration of an agonist of the IP receptor has become an important strategy in the treatment of PAH. See e.g. Tuder et al. 1999 159 1925 1932 Humbert et al 2004 43 13 S 24S Rosenzweig 2006 11 609 619 McLaughlin et al 2006 114 1417 1431 Rosenkranz 2007 96 527 541 Driscoll et al 2008 9 65 81. .

A preferred route of administration of salts of 7 2 3 di p tolyl 7 8 dihydropyrido 2 3 b pyrazin 5 6H yl heptanoic acid in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension is pulmonary delivery by inhalation.

The free form of 7 2 3 di p tolyl 7 8 dihydropyrido 2 3 b pyrazin 5 6H yl heptanoic acid has physical properties including poor solubility and stability that give rise to significant technical problems when manufacturing and formulating it for use as a pharmaceutical particularly as an inhalable product for example an inhalable dry powder.

The mesylate salt form of 7 2 3 di p tolyl 7 8 dihydropyrido 2 3 b pyrazin 5 6H yl heptanoic acid is undesired mainly for toxicological reasons not in respect of pure methanesulfonate mesylate salts but rather for certain corresponding sulfonic acid esters that are known to exert genotoxic effects. Such esters can be formed during the synthesis of the drug substance or during the crystallization of the salt or during storage especially if the crystallization solvent contains alcohols such as methanol ethanol or propanol. They can also be formed when alcoholic solvents are used for the preparation of the dosage form.

It has now been found that at least some of issues can be overcome by preparing certain novel salts of 7 2 3 di p tolyl 7 8 dihydropyrido 2 3 b pyrazin 5 6H yl heptanoic acid or at the very least such salts provide useful alternatives to the free form and the mesylate salt form.

The present invention provides certain salts of 7 2 3 di p tolyl 7 8 dihydropyrido 2 3 b pyrazin 5 6H yl heptanoic acid which is an active IP receptor agonist.

7 2 3 di p tolyl 7 8 dihydropyrido 2 3 b pyrazin 5 6H yl heptanoic acid i.e. the free form of compounds as defined in the first aspect or embodiments i vii of the first aspect is one of many heterocyclic compounds with IP receptor agonist activity that the Applicant described in international patent application PCT EP2011 062028 WO2012 007539 .

International patent application PCT EP2011 062028 WO2012 007539 the contents of which is incorporated herein by reference discloses a process for its preparing 7 2 3 di p tolyl 7 8 dihydropyrido 2 3 b pyrazin 5 6H yl heptanoic acid. However for completeness a method for preparing that compound is provided in the Examples section of the present patent specification.

A single crystalline form of 7 2 3 di p tolyl 7 8 dihydropyrido 2 3 b pyrazin 5 6H yl heptanoic acid has been identified but it has been found to be poorly soluble in water and have low stability under light which brings significant technical challenges in formulating the compound especially as an inhalable dry powder.

The mesylate salt of 7 2 3 di p tolyl 7 8 dihydropyrido 2 3 b pyrazin 5 6H yl heptanoic acid has tested favourably for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. However this salt which is non solvated has been found to exhibit a significantly higher dissolution rate compared to the free form. A crystalline form of this salt has been found to entrap a significant amount of solvent in the crystal structure which is only released upon melting. Furthermore and especially importantly as mentioned above certain sulfonic acid esters are known to exert genotoxic effects and great care must be taken to minimise and preferably prevent their synthesis during drug substance production and storage. Consequently the mesylate salt of 7 2 3 di p tolyl 7 8 dihyrdro pyrido 2 3 b pyrazin 5 6H yl heptanoic acid is difficult to formulate especially as an inhalable dry powder.

The Applicant investigated a large number of alternative salts to address the aforementioned issues noted in formulating the compound. Only a small number of alternative salts were generated. Some of these salts were found to have physical properties that are amenable to drug substance development for example in terms of the dissolution of drug substances facilitated routes of manufacturing purification and or can be formulated as inhalable dry powders.

The salt is also characterised by a melting point of 153 C.

Compounds as defined in the first aspect or embodiments i vii of the first aspect are useful as pharmaceuticals. In particular the compounds are suitable as IP receptor agonists and may be tested in the following assays.

Activity of compounds at the IP receptor IP receptor is assessed by measuring cAMP accumulation in CHO cells stably expressing the IP receptor CHO IP using the PerkinElmer AlphaScreen assay. This technology measures the endogenous production of cAMP in a non radioactive luminescence proximity homogenous assay. A biological reaction occurs between streptavidin coated donor beads biotinylated cAMP and anti cAMP acceptor beads bringing the donor and acceptor beads close enough together so that upon excitation a fluorescence signal is produced. On production of endogenous cAMP competition between the biotinylated cAMP and cellular derived cAMP causes a reduction in the fluorescent signal. The reduction in signal is proportional to the amount of cAMP being produced thus it is possible to quantify the amount of cAMP being produced on stimulation with agonist.

Test and reference compounds are prepared at 100 final in 100 DMSO and diluted 1 3 using a Biomek Fx Beckman Coulter . This is followed by an intermediate dilution to give 5 final in assay buffer HBSS containing 5 mM HEPES 0.1 w v BSA . 5 L of 5 final test compounds reference compounds and buffer DMSO control are then transferred to a 384 well white OptiPlate containing 20 L CHO IP cell suspension 15 000 cells well prepared from frozen and plate is incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. A cAMP standard curve is constructed for each experiment concentration range of 10000 nM to 0.001 nM in assay buffer and 25 L of each concentration added to the last two columns of the assay plate. The incubation is terminated by the addition of lysis buffer dHO 0.3 v v Tween 20 containing 20 units mLstreptavidin coated donor beads and biotinylated cAMP pre incubated for 30 minutes and 20 units mLanti cAMP acceptor beads which are added to the lysis buffer just before addition to the assay plate. The assay plate is then incubated at room temperature in the dark for 60 minutes with gentle shaking and read on the Envision plate reader Perkin Elmer .

The raw data of the reference compounds test compounds and controls are converted into cAMP concentrations using the cAMP standard curve in GraphPadPrism GraphPad Software Inc . ECas well as maximal values of the agonist curves are determined using a 4 parameter logistic equation. The maximum response values of all test compounds are determined using the top of the treprostinil concentration response curve.

Antiplatelet agents antiplatelets are prescribed for a variety of conditions. For example in coronary artery disease they are used to help prevent myocardial infarction or stroke in patients who are at risk of developing obstructive blood clots e.g. coronary thrombosis .

In a myocardial infarction the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen rich blood as a result of a blockage in the coronary blood vessels. If taken while an attack is in progress or immediately afterward preferably within 30 min antiplatelets can reduce the damage to the heart.

A transient ischemic attack TIA or mini stroke is a brief interruption of oxygen flow to the brain due to decreased blood flow through arteries usually due to an obstructing blood clot. Antiplatelet drugs have been found to be effective in preventing TIAs. Angina is a temporary and often recurring chest pain pressure or discomfort caused by inadequate oxygen rich blood flow ischemia to some parts of the heart. In patients with angina antiplatelet therapy can reduce the effects of angina and the risk of myocardial infarction.

Stroke is an event in which the brain does not receive enough oxygen rich blood usually due to blockage of a cerebral blood vessel by a blood clot. In high risk patients taking antiplatelets regularly has been found to prevent the formation of blood clots that cause first or second strokes. Angioplasty is a catheter based technique used to open arteries obstructed by a blood clot. Whether or not stenting is performed immediately after this procedure to keep the artery open antiplatelets can reduce the risk of forming additional blood clots following the procedure s .

Coronary bypass surgery is a surgical procedure in which an artery or vein is taken from elsewhere in the body and grafted to a blocked coronary artery rerouting blood around the blockage and through the newly attached vessel. After the procedure antiplatelets can reduce the risk of secondary blood clots.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of sustained irregular heart rhythm arrhythmia . Atrial fibrillation affects about two million Americans every year. In atrial fibrillation the atria the heart s upper chambers rapidly fire electrical signals that cause them to quiver rather than contract normally. The result is an abnormally fast and highly irregular heartbeat. When given after an episode of atrial fibrillation antiplatelets can reduce the risk of blood clots forming in the heart and traveling to the brain embolism .

There is evidence that an IP receptor agonist will inhibit platelet aggregation and thus be a potential treatment as an antiplatelet therapy see e.g. Moncada et al. 1977 1 18 20 . It has been shown that genetic deficiency of the IP receptor in mice leads to an increased propensity towards thrombosis Murata et al 1997 388 678 682 .

IP receptor agonists can be used to treat for example claudication or peripheral artery disease as well as cardiovascular complications arterial thrombosis atherosclerosis vasoconstriction caused by serotonin ischemia reperfusion injury and restenosis of arteries following angioplasty or stent placement.
