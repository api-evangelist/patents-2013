title: Request and response aggregation system and method with request relay
abstract: A system and method for sending and receiving requests and responses, relaying requests, and aggregating requests and responses to and from social networks are described. In one aspect a system user can send a request to recipients chosen by the user as being people or groups most likely to have useful responses to the request. Recipients can respond to the request, relay the request to one or more additional recipients, or both. The other recipients can further respond to and/or relay the request, etc. The system user who originated the request (also referred to as the request originator, or the originator) has control over which other users, if any, can see the request. For example, the originator can specify that the request not be relayed.

People increasingly expect to obtain answers to requests of all kinds quickly online. Search engines become ever more sophisticated yet can only understand what a user typed not what a user really wants to know. One type of request is a question that the user would like answered. For example one may ask where is a good place to play basketball A search engine will provide nearby court locations and or previous write ups about basketball from random strangers who happened to use the word good. Whereas a basketball playing friend would understand what good means to the asker e.g. similarly skilled players wood court and like minded professionals and answer accordingly. Another type of request is for a referral. e.g. to a person or company that provides or is looking for a service. Users would like to receive answers and referrals from people who they view as being most likely to provide useful responses. Also users would prefer to control how or whether recipients of the request can relay the request to other people. For instance the one asking about basketball may want her request to be forwarded by her friends to other like minded knowledgeable people outside of her network. Or she may choose to limit that option such that the question cannot be forwarded. But that level of user control is not available in prior systems. Conventional request and response systems such as Q A and crowd funding sites allow users to send requests to strangers via a public forum. However people typically trust responses from people they know over responses from strangers. Some existing systems allow users to send requests to their social network however the best people to respond are often outside of the user s social network. Other conventional systems that focus on mapping relationships between people do not provide a facility for a user to make requests of specific people known to the user while allowing the user to control how the request and any responses are distributed within a system. In addition there is no such system that also aggregates requests and responses and displays user relationships across internal and external networks. Further there is no such system that parses aggregated requests and responses by external webpages that have been specifically referenced in responses and allows those external web pages to display related requests responses and responders relationships to the viewer.

A system and method for sending and receiving requests and responses relaying requests and aggregating requests and responses to and from social networks are described. In one aspect a system user can send a request to recipients chosen by the user as being people or groups most likely to have useful responses to the request. Recipients can respond to the request relay the request to one or more additional recipients or both. The other recipients can further respond to and or relay the request etc. The system user who originated the request also referred to as the request originator or the originator has control over which other users if any can see the request. For example the originator can specify that the request not be relayed.

All responses are captured in the system and made available to the originator. In one embodiment people relaying requests can add an optional message for the next recipient.

Requests can be sent and relayed to people within the system and outside of the system via various electronic communication platforms including but not limited to text email posts on other networking sites or social networking sites etc. The system receives and interprets responses entered within its own platform as well as responses from platforms outside the system and associates responses with the original requests thereby aggregating responses from different platforms in a single place. Requests can be of any type including but not limited to questions including one or more of text audio and video funding solicitations job leads dating recommendations etc. Responses can be of any type including but not limited to answers including one or more of text audio and video financial commitments money transfers etc.

In an embodiment a unique identifier is used to reference users within the system. Users within the system can be individuals or groups. This identifier routes requests to the referenced user or group.

Processors are part of system and include data processing elements for performing the methods described herein. A user interface is executed by processors to present system users with a way to interact with the system as shown and described herein.

Various entities are shown in . They include a system user another system user and a non system user . The system users and have signed up with the system and access the facilities of the system through the user interface . Non system user is not yet a system user but potentially has relationships and connections to one or more of the system users. System users and non system users may know each other personally and or be connected as friends or colleagues in one or more online networks such as without limitation Facebook and LinkedIn . System users can also be related to non system users when non system users are listed as contacts in a system user s email contact list s e.g. a system user s Google Gmail contact list.

System user is shown with a computer A and a mobile phone B as examples of devices useable to access the user interface . Any other devices not shown here that can access the Internet are equally capable of providing access to the user interface of the system . Similarly system user is shown with a computer A and a mobile phone B and the non system user is shown with a computer A and a mobile phone B.

Many web based Internet based systems can be accessed directly by users and . These web based systems include many systems with application programming interfaces APIs that facilitate actions performed by the system . For example Facebook is a system that may make APIs available to system so that system with user approval can access the user s lists of friends .

The system receives the request made by the originator and stores it in the databases . The system also transmits the request to user s network UN referred to for convenience as UN . UN is one or more networks of the originator as previously described to include fellow system users and fellow members of other networks e.g. social networks and email application contact lists . As described further below the request is transmitted to particular members of UN that have been identified by system user the originator as recipients of the request.

Each of the recipient users of UN receive the request via one or more of their own web applications phone application text messages or email messages. When one of recipient users of UN responds to the request it is transferred to the system which stores the response in the databases . In addition to responding or instead of responding the user can also relay the request provided that the originator permitted relaying. As used herein to relay means to indicate further recipients of the request to whom the relayer wishes to pass the request. When a request is relayed it is transferred from the UN to the system . The system stores relay data in the databases such as the request being relayed or a pointer to the request the identity of the user initiating the relay the user s to whom the request is to be relayed and relationships among all of the involved users. The system relays the request according to the relay information e.g. identities of the relay recipients provided by the user of UN . The system cannot perform a relay if the originator indicated that the request is not to be relayed.

The relay recipients are members of UN s network s UNN referred to for convenience as UNN . UNN is one or more networks of the UN as previously described to include fellow system users and fellow members of other networks e.g. social networks and email application contact lists . Each of the UNN users can choose to respond to the request relay the request or both. The system receives any responses and relays stores all of the data associated with the responses and relays and transmits the responses and relays in a similar fashion to the actions performed by the system on receiving input from the UN . In this instance the relayed request is transmitted to members of UNN s network s UNNN referred to for convenience as UNNN . UNNN is one or more networks of the UNN as previously described to include fellow system users and fellow members of other networks e.g. social networks and email application contact lists . Members of UNNN that are identified in the request relay can respond to the request or relay the request again or both. The system receive any responses and relays from UNNN and store them along with any associates data and aggregates all of the data associated with the originator s request from user . Requests may be relayed to potentially infinite recipients on an ongoing basis. System users through user interface can easily refer to all aggregated data stored in the system database . Unlike existing networks which do not show the complete history of a post and its comments regardless of whether a user upstream of the originating post is a friend or common network member of the originator the entire history of responses to a request is available subject to the privacy settings set by the originator. Another aspect of an embodiment includes a maximum number of requests that can be sent to the system by any one originator over a predetermined time period. Other similar limitations can also be imposed by the system .

Figure is flow diagram of an aspect of a user request process according to an embodiment. The user fills out a request form in the system via the user interface see . Optionally the user enters recipients to whom the system will route the request . The user submits the request form to the system which recognizes the data in the message field as a request . The system creates a request identification ID for the request and stores the request . The request ID is a unique identifier that allows all of the data associated with a request to be linked to that request. The system then executes shorthand commands that the user may have included in the request . As further described with reference to drawings illustrating an embodiment of the user interface the system provides icons that are clickable by the user and shorthand commands to indicate what the user wants the system to do such as to send relay the request to particular recipients categorize the request as belonging to a predefined category etc.

If the received message does not contain a request ID the system determines whether the message contains a user ID in an acceptable format . A user ID is a unique identifier for an existing system user. If the message does not contain a user ID or a request ID the system discards the message . If the message contains a user ID but no request ID the system identifies the message as a request . The request is parsed from the message the system creates a request ID and stores the request and its ID . The system also determines whether the parsed message contains system shortcut commands . If shortcut commands are present the system executes the commands such as categorizations who to send request to etc. at .

If the specified recipients are either connected to the originator or are opted in recipients the system then determines whether a predetermined maximum number of requests per time period have been exceeded by the originator . In an embodiment a predetermined number of requests are set for one originator during a time period. If the number of requests time period has not been exceeded the system determines whether the originator has specified that the request cannot be relayed without originator approval that is whether the request is locked . If the request is not locked the system forwards the request to the specified recipients . If the request is locked the system forwards the request with a no relay unless originator approved provision enabled .

If the number of requests time period has been exceeded the system does not forward the request but sends a message to the originator to inform him or her that they must wait before sending another request .

Aspects of the systems and methods described herein may be implemented as functionality programmed into any of a variety of circuitry including programmable logic devices PLDs such as field programmable gate arrays FPGAs programmable array logic PAL devices electrically programmable logic and memory devices and standard cell based devices as well as application specific integrated circuits ASICs .
