This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 583 630 filed Jan. 6 2012 and titled Apparatus And Method For Viewing Medical Information which is hereby incorporated by reference.

Embodiments of the present invention relate to information systems and more particularly to medical information systems.

Medical images are commonly stored distributed and viewed in digital form using computer technology. Often however electronic medical records regarding a specific individual may exist in many locations. Picture Archival and Communication Systems PACS and other imaging archives have been used to store medical images. In a typical PACS or other digital imaging archive and workflow application image data obtained by imaging equipment such as CT Computed Tomography scanners MRI Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanners Whole Slide Imaging scanners or other imaging sources are stored in the form of computer data files.

A large hospital system may be spread across a wide geographical area and may comprise numerous hospitals and imaging centers. These hospitals and imaging centers may have separate installations of PACS for Radiology and or Cardiology and other distinct imaging archives for Anatomic Pathology Oncology and other imaging specialties referred as ologies that constitute distinct silos of information. The siloed and distributed nature of such disparate imaging systems may impede the efficiency of information retrieval for radiologists cardiologists pathologists or other diagnostic imaging specialists and referring clinicians alike.

Patients often get referred from one hospital to another for various reasons but their imaging studies and reports may not be easily available which may result in unnecessary repeat imaging studies inferior imaging reports and tedious searching of possible prior test results across multiple different PACS.

It would be desirable to provide a standards based platform that links the PACS enterprise and all the other diagnostic imaging archives and provides a unified view of all of a patient s prior tests and reports from across all hospitals and specialties in the system.

In a first aspect the invention provides an apparatus including a computer system programmed to retrieve information from a plurality of data sources the computer system including a plurality of vault query services an adapter for each of the data sources each adapter translating an interface for one of the data sources to a vault query service interface and a cross vault query service providing an interface for data communication between an application program and the plurality of vault query services and a user display for displaying the information retrieved from the data sources in response to a query from the application program.

In another aspect the invention provides a method including entering search criteria into a computer system programmed to retrieve information from a plurality of data sources wherein the computer system includes a plurality of vault query services an adapter for each of the data sources each adapter translating an interface for one of the data sources to a vault query service interface and a cross vault query service providing an interface for data communication between an application program and the plurality of vault query services and displaying the information retrieved from the data sources in response to the search criteria.

In many cases it would be useful to provide access to a comprehensive set of electronic medical records related to a given individual including records that may be widely distributed across multiple entities. In one aspect of the invention this can be accomplished with a system that retrieves information from multiple sources and presents that information on a user display in a manner that facilitates the use of the information by the user. This is referred to as the SingleView system.

The SingleView system can be implemented as a federated system with a true imaging interoperability platform. The SingleView system departs from the previous siloed workflow which separated radiology information systems RIS PACS and 3D imaging to provide an integrated system. The SingleView system can display information in a manner that is patient centric and workflow based.

The SingleView system allows patient exams and records to be visually presented across multiple PACS multiple imaging archives or other Information Systems thereby preventing the repetition of patient records. This reduces the probability of unnecessary patient tests and suboptimal readings of patient reports. SingleView can alleviate these problems and improve workflow since physicians are spending less time per case.

Adapter Provider blocks and provide a way to easily connect PACS to the Vault Query Service. The Vault Query service has a specific interface for communications with both the PACS and the Cross Vault Query Service. Each PACS or diagnostic imaging archive vendor may have a different query interface. The adapter translates the vendor specific interface into the Vault Query Service interface which allows the components to communicate. The provider aspect of the block adheres to a specific software engineering pattern that allows for the addition of new PACS or imaging archive Adapters to the system without modifying the Vault Query Service code.

The SingleView application program also interacts with a rules database and an Enterprise Master Patient Index EMPI or similar database through a cross vault query rules engine . The EMPI service is an internal patient registry that links multiple patient instances together and identifies the instances though a single numeric identifier. An Adapter Provider block decouples the EMPI specific interface from the cross vault query rules engine as well as provides a standard way to plug in new patient registry sources that provide similar functionality as EMPI .

The SingleView application also interacts with a user workstation that is used to enter information requests and to display the requested information for the user. In the embodiment of workstation can also interact with a teleradiology system a cached worklist and a worklist configuration . The teleradiology system utilizes the SingleView framework to query the PACS silo s as a single PACS instance. This allows patients and exams from both internal and external PACS to be displayed on a single radiologist work list regardless of source PACS. The cached worklist component allows for the storage of multiple consolidated views of the PACS silos. The worklist configuration is an application that allows the user to build specific patient and exam queries for the teleradiology system and cached worklist . This application allows the user to build query rules using a standard language and syntax otherwise known as the SingleView query language. The SingleView framework converts the SingleView query language into the PACS or other imaging archive specific syntax.

As shown in the SingleView application can also serve as a platform for development of other imaging informatics related applications. It can for example be utilized for other previously developed applications such as 24 7 Teleradiology and an External Image Management System EIMS .

The third party service third party wrapper service tier includes Single Sign On service an iSite wrapper service and an Enterprise Master Patient Index EMPI service . The Single Sign On service provides the ability for applications to synchronize patient and exam context. Once the user is logged on to a workstation the Single Sign On service captures the user name and tracks which patient and exam the user is viewing for all Single Sign On enabled applications. When the user loads a patient in one application all other Single Sign On enabled applications synchronize based on their patient or exam level integration.

The data tier includes an application management database a patient index database a Single Sign On vault an iSite PACS and an EMPI repository .

The SingleView framework is a unique approach to PACS and diagnostic imaging federation. Rather than attempting to create patient and exam registries the SingleView framework relies on a business rule configuration to create Real Time Virtual Patient Objects RTVPO . Unlike patient and exam registries that require prepopulation of historical data and the registration of new data the SingleView framework contains business rules. These rules are executed when the query is requested and direct the SingleView framework to query the appropriate data sources.

This rules based framework provides a lightweight middleware layer that knows where to look for exams but is unaware of the existence of an exam. The rules based approach of the SingleView framework allows for rapid integration or removal of data sources because historical data migration is not needed. The rules based approach also allows for dynamic rules configuration to meet the organizational needs. Organizations can now agree to federate for a specific purpose or period of time without the need for a timely migration process. A research project that lasts only a few months or a Teleradiology agreement that operates only between the hours of 10 pm and 7 am are now candidates for federation.

The Real Time Virtual Patient Object created by the SingleView framework can be used as a data source by other Information Systems. The SingleView Framework allows for the creation of endpoints such as IHE s XDS and XDS I. The SingleView Framework contains service facades and adapters that simplify interfaces and adapt the interfaces in and out of the framework.

In operation a user can submit a query from a workstation and the system will retrieve relevant information based on the query and display the information on a display that may be located at the workstation. The query may include patient information that will enable the system to find information relevant to a particular patient. Such patient information may include the patient name patient ID number social security number birth date etc.

For the medical facility the integration of the application may provide time efficiency increased accuracy and a decrease in the unnecessary repetition of scans and claim denials leading to facility wide cost savings.

Embodiments of the invention organize relevant clinical information. SingleView essentially creates a Federated PACS and diagnostic imaging archive intelligently matching a patient s Medical Record Number MRN and other demographics with his her other records across the enterprise and presents these in a single view. This imaging centric platform can be integrated directly into a clinical workflow environment providing a platform for imaging interoperability.

In various embodiments a federation engine can be used to aggregate imaging data from across an organization s siloed imaging systems including radiology PACS Oncology PACS Cardiology PACS RIS Cardio Vascular Information System CVIS Oncology Information Systems OIS Dermatology systems Pathology systems and others.

The described system can result in increased clinical efficiency decreased time spent per case and various facets of improved patient care. The system can also provide a robust functionality for identifying duplicate records within and across multiple systems and care venues leveraging the Enterprise Master Patient Index EMPI web services.

Conforming to the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise IHE initiative. SingleView can be implemented using established standards based architectures. SingleView leverages the PIX PDQ Patient Identifier Cross referencing Patient Demographic Query components of the EMPI and uniquely provides a workflow centric imaging interoperability platform that is designed to be vendor agnostic and scalable.

SingleView has been designed to be standards based and although it can leverage the API Application Programming Interface calls from various imaging vendors for the visual controls the application is not tied to one viewer and can be used even with open source viewing platforms.
