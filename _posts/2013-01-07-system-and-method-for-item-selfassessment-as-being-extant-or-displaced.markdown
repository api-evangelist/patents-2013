title: System and method for item self-assessment as being extant or displaced
abstract: A portable item reporting device () is configured to be attached to and in substantial collocation with a portable item (), or to be integrated into a portable item (). The device () includes environmental sensors () to monitor item location, movement, ambient light, sounds, temperature, etc. The device () is configured to store usage expectation data () indicative of historical and/or expected item usage and environments when the item () is in normal use/storage associated with an authorized user (AU). The device () monitors current environmental conditions () surrounding and pertaining to the item. If the current environment () is inconsistent with expected conditions (), the device () assesses that the item () is displaced (), meaning either that the item () is in abnormal use or abnormal storage, or is under the control of an unauthorized user (UU) who is other than the authorized user (AU). Based on the assessment the device initiates a signal () or message () to an authorized user (AU) of the item (), indicating that the item () usage/storage is displaced () or otherwise anomalous ().

This patent application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 584 276 filed Jan. 8 2012 entitled System And Method For Item Self Assessment As Being Lost Misplaced Stolen Or In An Otherwise Anomalous State which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. This patent application claims priority to claims the benefit of and is the U.S. national phase filing of the international filing under the Patent Cooperation Treaty of PCT US13 20587 filed Jan. 7 2013 entitled System And Method For Item Self Assessment As Being Extant Or Displaced which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present disclosure pertains to the fields of sensing and monitoring to computational intelligence and to item tracking.

More particularly the present disclosure pertains to applying computational intelligence to the self monitoring of an item object or device when the device is associated with a particular user to identify usage s or behavior s environmental context s or operational parameter s of the item object or device.

More particularly the present disclosure pertains to attaching local sensor s to a portable item object device or container or embedding local sensor s in a portable item object device or container. The sensors s have suitable associated intelligent processing which is substantially collocated with the portable item object device or container. The sensor s and intelligent processing are configured to determine a likelihood that the item object device or container is lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen or otherwise in a context or use not appropriate for the item object device or container.

Persons routinely carry small portable objects devices items and various kinds of containers or packages about with them. Such portable items include for example and without limitation keys or key chains with multiple keys wallets computers personal digital assistants PDAs cell phones handbags backpacks purses briefcases tools toolkits eye glasses removable items of clothing gloves scarves children s toys and other children s items watches suitcases and valises and similar items. Specific documents and transactional tools such as credit cards debit cards drivers licenses and passports are also routinely carried or transported about either along with within or apart from the other exemplary portable items listed above.

Unfortunately it is a common experience that such items are easily lost or misplaced by an owner or by other authorized or designated users.

In some cases a portable item is misplaced within a home or office environment in the sense that an owner or other user has forgotten where the item was last placed stored or concealed. Thus the item is not actually lost in the sense that the item is still within a domain controlled by the legitimate owner or user and the item may be found again typically when the owner is searching for a completely different item altogether . However to the extent that the location of the item is forgotten so that the item is misplaced it is not accessible to the owner or other authorized user in a timely way.

In other instances an item may be lost away from the home office or other normal place of storage or usage. Often such an item proves to be permanently lost.

In other instances an authorized user actually has an item on person when it should not be on their person. For example an authorized user may remove an item from a workplace when the item is intended to remain at the workplace. Such an item may be said to be wandering.

Compounding the problem of lost items is that certain items may be objects of illicit confiscation by a non owner or other inappropriate or unauthorized person i.e. the items may be stolen. Other times an item may be misappropriated that is picked up by accident by a known associate friend or family member of the authorized user.

In this document the term displaced is sometimes used to describe an item which may be any of lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen. At present the means for identifying and retrieving displaced items are limited and often non technical. The options are to remember where the item is and go back to get it and hope the item is in fact where it s remembered to be to come across the item by accident or hope that some other person finds the item and returns it to its proper owner.

In recent years some technological solutions have emerged. For example some cell phones now come with an application which enables an owner to send a message to the phone from a computer terminal. If the phone is lost the owner can send a message asking the phone to identify its location to the cell phone network. Alternatively a message can be sent to the phone requesting the phone emit an audio signal to identify its location to persons in proximity to the cell phone.

A disadvantage to this technical solution is that it only works for devices for example cell phones or other similarly equipped PDAs which are already configured as communications devices and which are typically configured as expensive multipurpose communications devices. A further disadvantage is that the solution requires that the owner of the communications device actually be aware that the device is lost.

Often a communications device can in fact be lost for a substantial period of time before an owner even notices that the device is missing. During the time interval between when the device is lost and when the owner realizes the device is lost the owner may have traveled a substantial distance from the communications device or failed to take the device with them when needed for some purpose. Further the longer a communications device is lost and particularly if lost outside a home office or other preferred usage location the greater the risk of the device either being stolen or running out of battery power.

Other existing solutions are geared solely towards rigidly defined location determinations usually for items that are in storage or maintained in a confined facility. Such solutions may for example identify when an item or device crosses a specified boundary of a region where the item is supposed to remain. Examples include store security systems which detect when security tags are carried across the threshold of the store. Further an item may well be lost misplaced or even stolen even while still within the defined boundary or geographic area. Such systems are also typically not programmed to vary their expectations of where an item should be located according to changes in time or date. Most critically however these security systems rely at least partly upon sensors which are external to the item in question and also rely upon an artificial intelligence which is not collocated with the item itself meaning the item cannot self determine its state as lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen.

Other existing solutions are geared solely towards items which already have integral to their nature and functionality built in processing capabilities.

What is needed then is a system and method for portable items to have a computational intelligence or artificial intelligence which enables the portable items to self assess that is self identify as being possibly lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or possibly stolen even before an owner has identified that the item is lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen. What is further needed is a system and method for portable items to self assess self identify as being possibly lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen based on criteria which are alternative to or in addition to location criteria.

When location criteria are appropriate what is further needed is a system and method for portable items to self assess self identify as being possibly lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen based on more extended enhanced supplemental or refined location criteria.

What is further needed is a system and method whereby a portable item not only has a computational intelligence by which to self determine that it may be lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen but where the item then self initiates signaling or communications with a legitimate owner or user without requiring any previous prompting from the legitimate owner or user.

What is further needed is a system and method to associate and collocate with portable items which do not conventionally have data processing sensing or communications elements associated with them the necessary technical means sensor s processor and or wireless communications systems for substantially complete and independent self assessment self identification of the item as having lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen state or a state of being extant that is not lost misplaced misappropriated stolen or wandering.

What is further needed is a system and method which is configured to be dynamically adaptable for association with different items.

What is further needed is a system and method which is configured to be dynamically adaptable for the identification of lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen state of an item when the system and its associated physical item are intentionally and appropriately transferred from possession control of a first person to the possession control of a second person where each person typically makes different use of the item or has different usage habits or patterns for the item.

What is further needed is a system and method which is configured to be dynamically adaptable for the identification not only of a possible lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen state for an associated item but also for the identification of a likelihood of other anomalous states usages conditions or environments for the associated item.

This summary is presented for convenience only to provide a brief and necessarily incomplete overview of the present system and method. It should not be viewed in any way as limiting nor is it comprehensive nor should the elements presented in this summary be construed as always being essential to the present system and method. The present system and method is taught and defined in more complete detail and with additional embodiments and features in the Detailed Description presented below and in the appended Claims.

In one embodiment the present system and method may be implemented via a reporting device which combines one or more environmental sensors a processor and communications and or signaling elements. The reporting device is small enough and portable enough to be mechanically attached to or coupled in close physical proximity to and substantial collocation with or to be contained within other portable items including for example and without limitation keys key rings wallets cell phones portable computers recreational devices tools toys purses briefcases and the like. The reporting device is configured to detect environmental data including for example and without limitation motion light sound location temperature and pressure.

A set of comparison parameters generally referred to herein as usage expectations are established in the reporting device either by configuring the device through a computer type interface or by training the device or both. The types of comparison parameters pertain to potential values which may be measured by the environmental sensors including for example and without limitation an amount of motion an amount of ambient light a volume of sound an expected location an ambient temperature and surface pressure on the item. At least some of the types of comparison parameters may be predefined as part of the design of the reporting device.

Defined values and or defined ranges or values for these comparison parameters serve to establish expected values of the environmental data. The expected values or ranges of values may be predefined or may be configured to be defined by an owner of an item on a case by case basis. The user configures the device based in part on an assumption that the portable items will be used in expected ways and in expected environments.

During actual use of the reporting device referred to herein as field use the device is attached to or coupled with an item. During actual use it may turn out that the parameters measured in real time by the sensors of the reporting device fall outside the expected values. In such an event computational intelligence algorithms of the reporting device make an assessment that the associated item may be lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen or that the associated item is otherwise subject to anomalous usage. The reporting device is programmed to then send a message or to then emit a signal indicating that its associated item is not located where typically expected or is not being used as typically expected or is otherwise subject to what appears to be unexpected environment.

In an embodiment when the reporting device identifies the item as very likely being extant present when and where expected the default reporting device response is no response meaning no signal or report. In an alternative response the reporting device may issue periodic indications that it is extant.

In one alternative embodiment the reporting device is so configured so that rather than being designed for attachment to an item the device is physically and or functionally integrated into the item. For example the reporting device may be integrated into a cell phone PDA or personal computer.

In another alternative embodiment the reporting device may be configured to receive a signal or message. The received signal or message may instruct the reporting device to initiate a sensor scan and associated environmental analysis or may instruct the reporting device to emit a return signal or message irrespective of the results of any sensor scan.

In another alternative embodiment a group of reporting devices may be attached to separate items. The reporting devices are configured to maintain constant close range or wireless contact with each other forming reporting device teams. If one or more reporting devices are separated from the team some or all of the other devices are configured to emit alerts or notifications.

In another alternative embodiment determination by the computational intelligence that an item is with some degree of probability being used anomalously may be based on various analyses and interpretations of the sensor data.

These embodiments of the present system and method and other embodiments as well are discussed in greater detail in the detailed discussion presented below and are illustrated as well in the accompanying drawings.

The reporting devices described herein are referred to as portable item reporting devices. In turn Portable Item Reporting Device is referred to herein by the acronym of BIRD. The applicable acronym would seem to be PIRD. but PIRD sounds strange or worse and there are no English synonyms for portable that begin with the letter B. However BIRD sounds beautiful and the letter B looks much like the letter P. Further in both Danish and Norwegian portable is b rbare as well as being b rbara in Swedish so we find the letter B for portable after all.

The features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the detailed description set forth below when taken in conjunction with the drawings. The skilled artisan will understand that the drawings described below are for illustration purposes only. The drawings are not intended to limit the scope of the present teachings system or method in any way.

In some instances specific species within a type of element are identified via a subsidiary secondary number or letter. In some instances different species of a generic element type are labeled with different alphabetic suffixes or series of characters. For example items in general are identified with element number while specific items may be labeled as .W wallet .M musical instruments etc. In some instances different instances of the same element are labeled with different numeric suffixes. For example a first item may be .. while a second item may be . . However variations have been made from these conventions where it serves the interests of clarity.

Similarly different embodiments of a general method may have different numeric suffixes. For example a general method may have different exemplary embodiments . Meth . Meth . Meth etc. In other contexts however suffixes for method numbers may instead be used to identify separate steps within a single exemplary method. For example a method may have individual method steps . . . etc.

The drawings have been labeled with series numbers for example drawings A through N drawings A through H drawings A through E etc.

It will be noted in particular that contain numerous references to elements which are again discussed in greater detail later in the document.

Generally a given element of the present system and method is provided with a consistent reference number or label throughout this document. However selective exceptions have been made where a particular type of element may have two or more distinctive roles or functions in the present system and method.

For example Items which may be lost misplaced stolen and so on are generally labeled as items with specific suffixes for different types of items. A cell phone in its capacity as an item which may be monitored by a BIRD for possible loss or misplacement by a user is labeled as .Act.CP. However a cell phone which is used to itself monitor or configure BIRDs is labeled as a cell phone . In practice a single cell phone may function in both capacities both being monitored by a BIRD and also functioning to configure or control one or more BIRDs .

For another example Briefcases suitcases valises backpacks and similar container items which may be monitored by a BIRD for possible loss misplacement theft and so on have been assigned the general reference label .C along with specific labels for some items for example luggage .C or luggage .LG . However in their capacity as containers for other items and in particular in their capacity to incorporate their own distinctive BIRD elements which monitor for the presence within of appropriate interior items such container items .C are labeled as containers . Here again in actual use a single container briefcase suitcase purse valise backpack and so on may function in both capacities both being monitored by an associated or integrated BIRD and also itself functioning as a specialized BIRD to monitor other items which it contains within itself. Suitable labels .C or are used depending on the context.

Before one or more embodiments of the present teachings are described in detail one skilled in the art will appreciate that the present teachings are not limited in their application to the details of construction the arrangements of components and the arrangement of steps set forth in the following detailed description or illustrated in the drawings.

Similarly while various terms are characterized throughout this document including some in the section on Introductory Terminology presented immediately below it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.

An umbrella term to describe an item which is in a condition an anomalous usage an anomalous state or within or subject to an anomalous environment which is other than normally expected for the item. Conditions associated with the anomaly are generally detected by sensors associated with the item either via a BIRD associated with the item or by being integrated into the item.

In one usage an anomalous item state may be indicative that the item is displaced lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen however in this same usage an anomalous item state may also be indicative of other respects in which an item is in an environment or is being put to use or subjected to conditions which are other than those normally expected for the item.

In an alternative usage an anomalous item state may refer to an item being in an unexpected state exclusive of being displaced. For example anomalous usage may refer to an item which may be extant present when and where it should be and with an authorized user but where the item is being put to an improper or unexpected use . In this usage an item may be both in a displaced state and an anomalous state but each term is exclusive of the other.

For active items those which inherently rely on internal data processing as discussed further above an anomalous state may also refer to an internal operations state or pattern of internal operations state s which is other than that normally expected for the item.

As discussed throughout this document criteria which define normal vs. anomalous for a given item may be established by an authorized user of an item or by recordings of sensor data for the item during a designated training period or by other means or by a combination of means.

Throughout this document reference is made to the authorized user of an item and or the authorized user of the BIRD associated with an item.

The authorized user of an item may be the actual legal owner of the item. That is the authorized user may be the person who purchased the item or received it as a gift or otherwise came into legally and socially recognized possession of the item. The authorized user may also be referred to herein simply as the owner or the user of the item. Typically the authorized user is also the authorized user and owner of the associated BIRD .

In some cases an authorized user may be a person to whom use of an item has been delegated by the item owner or delegated by another authorized control person. In a family for example a parent may authorize use and possession of an item by a child. In some instances the owner delegates control to another authorized user who may be considered a borrower of the item particularly if the delegation of item control is temporary or limited in some other way.

In an organizational setting some items may be owned or controlled by the organization or institution. In those cases possession and control of an item may be delegated to an authorized user by an administrator who has formal control or responsibility for the item .

Throughout this document reference is made to an item being owned and its associated BIRD being configured by the authorized user. It will be understood however that in some cases an item may be owned by someone other than the authorized user. Similarly it will be understood that configuration and some degree of command and control of a BIRD may be shared or divided between an authorized user and an owner or administrator. For example an administrator may have some degree of remote access to BIRD data and or remote control of a BIRD even while the BIRD and associated item are in possession of an authorized user.

Various embodiments of a BIRD are discussed throughout this document. In brief a BIRD is a processing device designed to be substantially collocated with an item and designed to self assess a possibility that the item is extant or in the alternative that the item is displaced lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen or otherwise in an anomalous state.

An item and BIRD in substantial and sustained collocation with each other where the BIRD is functioning or functional and has been configured or is being configured for use with the item. See below for more information.

In the appended claims the term device is synonymous with a portable item reporting device or BIRD discussed in detail throughout this document. Because two or more BIRDs may be part of an item team in the claims a BIRD may be referred to specifically as a first device while a second or additional BIRD in an item team is distinguished by referring to it as a second device. Device may also alternatively or additionally be synonymous with an active item BIRD .Act or ABIRD .Act . The appropriate use of device will be apparent from context.

The present system and method is directed in part towards the self assessment by an item as being in a displaced state that is a state where the item is for example lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen. The latter terms are defined further below in this document. Put another way a displaced item is not appropriately in the hands or under the control of an authorized user and the item is not otherwise in some appropriate and safe place of storage or dormancy.

Other displaced states may be envisioned as well. The present system method may be applied as well to have a BIRDed item self identify or self assess that it is in some other anomalous environment condition state or usage in addition to or in alternative to the displaced anomalous state of the item. In an embodiment the present system and method may enable a BIRDed item to self determine with near certainty that it is in a displaced state or otherwise anomalous state. In an alternative embodiment the present system and method may enable a BIRDed item to self determine a degree of probability that it is in a displaced state or otherwise anomalous state.

The use of the paired terms displaced anomalous is an abbreviated way of indicating the following In some embodiments a BIRD is configured principally to determine that its associated item is displaced. In alternative embodiments the BIRD may be configured to identify other states of anomalous item usage in addition to or in alternative to the item being displaced. In either set of embodiments the pertinent discussions in this document may be applicable.

If an item is not lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen it is extant. Put another way an extant item is either appropriately in the hands or under the control of an authorized user or the item is otherwise in some appropriate and safe place of storage or dormancy. Another way of saying extant might be the word present or the phrase the item is present when and where it is supposed to be typically with the authorized user or otherwise in an expected storage or non use location. However the word present is used in other contexts in this document so the term extant is used to avoid ambiguity.

At points throughout this document distinctions are made between an item being in an extant normal state on the one hand or being in a displaced anomalous state on the other hand.

The use of the paired terms extant normal is an abbreviated way of indicating the following In an embodiment a BIRD is configured to identify its associated item as being extant. In alternative embodiments the BIRD may be configured to identify other states of normal item usage in addition to or in alternative to the item being extant. In either set of embodiments the pertinent discussions in this document may be applicable.

 i Identity generally relates either to the identity of a specific item or the identity of an authorized user or other person. The exact usage will be apparent from context.

 b a set of qualities or behaviors which may be used to characterize the entity for an item a distinctive physical property code mark serial number etc. for a person distinctive biometric signatures or usage signatures or . . .

 c parameters data points data structures and similar mathematical representations used by the BIRD to represent its own identity the identity of its associated item the identity of other items or other BIRDs or a person.

Again the exact usage entity identifying qualities or behaviors or parameters for identity will be apparent from context. For example and with reference to below identity may refer to a set of biometric user identification parameters and iteMetric parameters for a BIRD. In an embodiment a BIRD may be configured with different sets of identification parameters each set being suitable for a different item and or a different authorized user.

In one usage and when referring to the state of an item normal is an umbrella term to describe an item which is in a condition for example a usage a location an internal state or within or subject to an environment which is expected for the item at a given point in time. In such a usage a normal item state may be indicative that the item is extant generally that the item is where it should be when it should be and typically with an expected or authorized user however in this usage a normal item state may also be indicative of other respects in which an item is in an environment or is being put to use or subjected to conditions which are those typically or conventionally expected for the item and for a given user of the item.

In an alternative usage normal may refer to an item being in an expected state apart from or exclusive of being extant that is normal may refer to proper or anticipated item usage apart from the particular location and or user associated with the item. In this usage an item may be both in an extant state and a normal state but each term is exclusive of the other.

For active items items with inherent internal processing abilities see a normal state . may also refer to an internal operations state which is normally expected for the item.

In some cases reference is made in this document to an item and its associated BIRD being in possession of a person. Person is a broader term than any of owner authorized user or borrower. Person is a generic term for any individual who has an item in hand or most recently had the item in hand whether or not that individual is an authorized user. A person may be for example and without limitation 

Throughout this disclosure and in the appended claims reference is made to a possibility that an item is lost a possibility that the item is misplaced a possibility that the item is stolen and so on. Similar language is used with reference to possibilities of an item being in a normal or anomalous state. It is always possible that an item is in some particular state extant lost misplaced stolen extant etc. no matter how small the likelihood. As used herein however possibility should be understood as synonymous with any of notable possibility significant possibility substantial likelihood or even high likelihood. 

The term possibility may also be operationally interpreted as meaning The chance that an item is in a particular displaced state such as one of being lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen is sufficiently high that it is appropriate to alert the authorized user that the item may not be where the user would expect the item to be.

Exact criteria for determining alert or notification thresholds may vary in different embodiments of the present system and method. Different levels of possibility that is different probabilities or ranges of probabilities that an item may be lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen or otherwise anomalous may be associated with different anomaly alert levels AALs discussed further below.

In an embodiment a BIRD may actually calculate numeric probabilities of an item being lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen. In an alternative embodiment the BIRD may not calculate probabilities but may instead rely on various trigger criteria as designated by BIRD logic and or usage expectations to determine when it is considered possible that an item is lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen.

Refers to the capability of a BIRD to identify the item it is associated with as being extant borrowed lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen or otherwise in a normal or anomalous state or environment without any time proximate prior assessment by a human user or by some other third party technology. For example in an embodiment a BIRD is designed to determine that the item with which it is associated is lost before the authorized user of the item may have even noticed the item is missing from his or her possession.

At points in this document it is indicated that it is the item or the BIRDed item which self Identifies or self assesses as being extant including borrowed or displaced lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen or as being otherwise normal anomalous. Properly speaking it is the BIRD which is associated with the item which makes the identification or assessment of the item as being extant normal or displaced anomalous. However in expected use the BIRD is for a sustained period of time substantially collocated with the item for example by attachment via a short tether by some other mechanical coupling ensuring close physical proximity between BIRD and item or by being integrated into the structure of the item . The BIRD and its associated item may be regarded in operation as a combined unit referred to herein as a BIRDed item. Therefore it will be understand that when the BIRD identifies a state of its associated item as being extant or displaced it is the BIRDed item as a unitary entity which has effectively self determined self identified or self assessed as being extant or displaced.

Similarly this document speaks interchangeably of the BIRD as self Initiating an alert signal or message and the associated item as self initiating the alert signal or message.

In summary From the perspective of a user a BIRDed item may be considered as one unit for purposes of state self assessment and signaling even if the BIRD and the item are two physically separate elements which are tethered or otherwise mechanically coupled in substantial and sustained collocation. In some cases as discussed further throughout this document the BIRD and item may be physically integrated into one unit this includes but is not limited to active items .Act for such integrated items it is in fact the integrated item BIRD which self assesses item state and self initiates signaling and messaging.

An item is generally a portable physical object device package or container typically though not always meant to be carried on the person of and or moved along by an owner or authorized user. A very wide range of physical objects may be considered to be items as discussed further below.

In an embodiment the BIRD system discussed herein is used in association with physical items which are generally carried about on or by a person or are readily transportable by a person and so are therefore portable. Typical examples however might include keys a wallet a purse eye glasses a backpack briefcases and luggage various utility and entertainment items children s toys cell phones notebook computers and similar. Additional examples are provided below. See for example G F A C A I B A A D F H and other figures throughout this document. 

Some elements of the present system and method may be applicable as well to larger items for example transport vehicles. See below for a discussion of distinctions between transport vehicles .Tr viewed as items versus personally scaled items .psi .

In an embodiment an item may also be a living entity which is capable of getting itself lost or can be stolen or kidnapped but is not capable of self identifying itself as being lost stolen or wandering. Such living entities may include for example children especially but not exclusively small children adult persons of diminished mental capacity and pets. No disrespect is intended nor any disregard for the dignity or value of life is implied by referring to living entities by a term item which normally designates lifeless entities it is simply for brevity and convenience that the term item is employed throughout this document. A BIRD associated with a living entity may help prevent the wandering or loss of such an entity from a rightful and appropriate guardian.

In general however in this document and unless otherwise noted it may be assumed that a BIRD is typically designed and configured for use with items which are non living. In an embodiment there may be significant design differences between a BIRD intended for reporting on a non living item as compared with a BIRD intended for reporting on a living entity. For example a BIRD specifically intended for reporting on a living entity may be specifically designed and configured to be attached or couple to the living entity in ways which are suitable for personal attachment are physically comfortable and are unobtrusive. Other design differences between BIRDs for living entities versus BIRDs for non living items including types configuration and arrangements of sensors and other operational BIRD components may be desirable as well.

Physical things entities items objects and devices and also various carrying devices and containers such as purses briefcases backpacks or luggage are generally referred to in this document as items . illustrates exemplary items and objects which may be associated with exemplary portable item reporting devices BIRDs .

It will be noted that the classifications of items illustrated in the figure is for convenience only and other classification schemes may be used. Further some items may fall under more than one classification for example a backpack is both a carrying item .C and a recreational item .R .

These items and also many broadly similar items not illustrated typically share the feature of being portable or readily mobile with a person that is readily carried by persons or persons or moved along by a person as with a baby carriage .H etc. . The items shown are exemplary only and the applications of the present system and method are not limited to these items. The present system and method may be used with virtually any items which are portable and potentially lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. or otherwise subject to anomalous usage . .

In addition the present system and method has applications to substantially larger items which while not typically carried by hand or on person are also mobile and may also be lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. or otherwise put to anomalous use . . Such applications may include for example and without limitation applications with cars motorcycles and other forms of transportation.

A BIRD may be connected or coupled with an item by a mechanical connection such as via a BIRD item link or BIRD item connector also referred to as a tether formed of metal wire a cable a string a plastic or polymer or similar connecting material or combinations of the above. The tether may or may not be flexible. The BIRD item mechanical link may take the form of a chain .C . A BIRD may also have a ring or other connecting element such as a clasp or clamp to which a tether may be attached to facilitate mechanical connection with an item . In an embodiment the tether has two ends and is attached at a first end to the device housing sec and can be attached at a second end to the item . In some instances the tether may provide additional functionality as well or item support as well. For example in it is seen that the key chain connecting keys .K to each other also serves as the tether with the BIRD . In an embodiment and while not shown in the figure a ring clasp or clamp or similar may be used to closely and or rigidly couple the item and the BIRD such that the BIRDed item is effectively one structural unit.

In an alternative embodiment rather than a flexible or extended tether per se the connecting element may be a clamp clip or similar device not illustrated which firmly or rigidly attaches the BIRD to the item possibly maintaining the BIRD in direct surface context with the item . An advantage of such an arrangement is that any motion of the BIRD may be more precisely indicative of motion of the rigidly connected item as compared with the case for a loose or flexible tether. Similarly any change of orientation of the BIRD detected by an orientation sensor .N will directly indicate a change of orientation of the rigidly connected item . Another advantage is that sensors of the BIRD such as a camera .C or surface pressure sensor .SP or other contact sensors may more readily determine any loss of contact between the BIRD and the rigidly clamped item . For some items however it may still be more practical or convenient to connect the BIRD and item via a flexible tether.

For simplicity of exposition herein any mechanical connecting element between the BIRD and the item whether a flexible extended tether or a rigid clamp or clip or similar will be referred to herein as the tether .

The ring or other connecting element possibly but not necessarily along with the BIRD item connector may also be referred to as a coupling element. While the ring or other connecting element will generally be structurally part of the BIRD a BIRD item connector may be part of the BIRD or may in some instances be supplied by a user of the BIRD .

In use coupling elements of the BIRD are not always required to maintain practical mechanical connection between the BIRD and an item . For example the BIRD may be placed by the user inside the item as for example if the BIRD is placed inside of a purse .P or wallet .W or other container type of item .C . If the BIRD is contained within the item then this containment maintains in an operational sense the necessary substantial and sustained collocation between the BIRD and the item . However establishing a mechanical connection may still be advantageous to the user for example to prevent or discourage a thief from readily removing the BIRD from a purse .P or to prevent the BIRD from accidentally spilling out of the purse .P .

The coupling element s are configured to support and maintain a substantial and sustained mechanical linkage between the BIRD and the item such that in use the BIRD and the item are substantially collocated which is sustained over an extended time.

In practical terms substantial collocation typically means maintaining close physical proximity or a short distance between the BIRD and the item . Substantial collocation may mean the BIRD and the item are in contact with each other or virtually next to each other as for example a BIRD which is attached to the keychain for a set of keys .K . The BIRD may also be inside the item as for example if the BIRD is placed inside of a purse .P or wallet .W .

In other instances substantial collocation may involve distances of up to several centimeters or inches. In some cases mechanical separations of up to a few feet or yards may even be acceptable. For example a BIRD may be attached to or part of the handgrip on a dog s leash . If the dog presumed to be on the leash manages to run away from an owner taking the leash with it the BIRD is still in sufficient substantial and sustained collocation with the dog to i self assess that the dog is not where it should be or is not in use as expected ii alert the owner that the dog has run away if the owner has not noticed and iii to identify the location of the errant dog. It will be noted however that a BIRD may also be attached to or integrated directly into a pet s collar as well.

 It will be further noted parenthetically that usage expectations for a dog leash or dog collar for a dog which is normally leashed may be configured to indicate that that if the dog is running faster than the owner would ever run there is anomalous usage of the collar or leash though likely a happy dog as well. Usage expectations are discussed further throughout this document. 

In an alternative embodiment the BIRD item link and link elements .C may itself be electrically or optically active as for example with an electrically conducting wire or a fiber optic cable actively sourced with LED or laser light. The BIRD may be configured to determine whether the BIRD item link .C is intact or broken by determining a change in electrical or optical conductivity of the BIRD item link .C . In this way the BIRD may determine if the mechanical connection between itself and the item has been broken. Other means may be employed as well in terms of the structure or design of the link .C and in terms of the connection to the BIRD to determined if a linkage .C is maintained between the BIRD and the item .

The detection of the integrity of the link .C can help prevent both accidental separation of the BIRD from the item and also inhibit or provide an alarm warning in the event of deliberate separation as might be attempted by a person stealing the item . The detection of the integrity of the link .C may be performed in whole or in part by an item link integrity module of the BIRD discussed further below.

In an alternative embodiment separate means may be used to maintain the physical connection of the BIRD with the item and to determine the proximity of the BIRD to the item . For example a mechanical link .C may be employed to maintain the physical connection as described above. However a passive or active RFID tag not shown in may be placed on the item or embedded in the item and the BIRD may periodically ping the RFID tag to determine if the item is still in close proximity to the BIRD .

In some cases such as with a wallet .W a BIRD may be suitably sized and shaped to simply slip inside the wallet .W and so remain with the wallet. Other means of mechanically coupling a BIRD with an item may be employed as well so that the BIRD remains in substantial and sustained collocation with item when the item itself is moved is in motion or is otherwise in use.

It should be noted that a BIRD is typically expected to be used when mechanically coupled with linked to embedded within or integrated into an item that is when the BIRD is in substantial and sustained collocation with its associated item . However in this document for simplicity of illustration BIRDs are only sometimes illustrated as being coupled with or in proximity to an associated item . Even in a figure of a BIRD without an associated item it should still be understood that in operation a BIRD is generally associated with and usually in substantial and sustained collocation with an item .

In an alternative embodiment a BIRD may be physically coupled at different times to different items . Since different items may have different expected uses and or different expected environmental conditions associated with their extant normal states . . the BIRD may be configurable for or programmable with different usage expectations for different items. A user of the BIRD may be able to select which item is attached to the BIRD at a given time or the BIRD may be programmed to use various of its sensors discussed further below to determine which item is attached at a given time.

However in an alternative embodiment it may also be the case that for some applications a BIRD may be employed without an associated or linked item .

At some points in this document an item and its associated BIRD in combination are specifically referred to as a BIRDed item and are represented by a diamond shaped icon. It will be understood that a BIRDed item refers to an item for which its associated BIRD is substantially collocated with the item and the item and BIRD are suitably tethered or otherwise physically configured to maintain their substantial collocation.

The terms or phrases i BIRDed Item a ii BIRD and its associated item or an iii item and its associated BIRD are generally synonymous throughout this document. The only qualification is that a BIRDed item always refers to the BIRD and item as being in substantial and sustained collocation. However at points in this document there are some discussions of situations where an item and its associated BIRD are in fact separated as for example by a thief who forcefully separates the two . Usage of these terms and phrases will be apparent from context.

At some points throughout this document items are simply referred to as items and association with a BIRD is implied by context.

The items shown in are generally passive items .Pass meaning that in typical or common design they usually do not have sensors processors or other electronics. Active items .Act which inherently have processing capabilities and possibly sensors are discussed further below in this document see A and other figures throughout this document . Such active items .Act include cell phones. PDAs and personal computers.

A BIRDed item may be a passive item .Pass physically linked to an associated BIRD or with an integrated BIRD or an active item .Act with an associated external active item BIRD .Act.E discussed further below or an active item .Act with an integrated internal active item BIRD .Act.I discussed further below . When a BIRDed item is specifically includes an active item .Act the combination will be referred to with the reference numbers .Act see below for further discussion.

See F H and associated text for some additional exemplary items . See also and Figs. XYZW for further item examples.

A bird image a Robyn is used at points in this document to symbolize the overall BIRD logic which is the aggregate of general algorithms employed by a BIRD to distinguish an item which is extant normal . . from an item which is displaced anomalous . . .

A sextant an old style navigational tool image is used to symbolize BIRD Navigation that is methods and algorithms associated with enabling a BIRD to identify usage expectations . Usage expectations represent when and where an item should be found and or how the item should be in use in normal usage.

Musical notes on a staff are used to symbolize BIRD song that is methods and algorithms associated with enabling a BIRD to signal message and otherwise respond to displaced anomalous item states . . .

The use in the figures of these different symbols a Robyn a sextant or musical notes should not be construed as suggesting different types of BIRDs nor necessarily different embodiments of BIRDs. Rather the symbols are used to suggest that the figure and the associated discussion may be focused on a particular aspect of exemplary BIRD activity BIRD logic BIRD Navigation or BIRD song .

Where the discussion has a more generalized focus or may have focus on more than one of these elements the Robyn is the default symbol.

See for a further overview of BIRD logic BIRD Navigation and BIRD song . Sec and other figures throughout this document for further discussion of BIRD logic . See C P A F and other figures throughout this document for a further discussion of the usage expectations associated with BIRD navigation . BIRD song and BIRD navigation are discussed further in conjunction with figures throughout this document.

In an embodiment and as elements associated with BIRD logic a BIRD may store and employ one or more data structures data listings data sets or similar referred to as detection contexts and usage expectations . Both detection contexts and usage expectations are discussed extensively throughout this document a preliminary discussion is presented here.

In an embodiment a BIRD has an internal clock timer calendar as well as a location sensor .L both discussed further below . In an embodiment a specified time frame for sensing the environment around an item and impinging on the item may be referred to as a detection context . The time frame may be a specified range of minutes hours days or even longer or shorter periods of time and may be repetitive or otherwise repeating. A time frame may be referred to equivalently as a time range or by similar terminology. For example a first detection context may specify week days while a second detection context may specify weekends. For another example more fine grained detection contexts may be employed to specify week days daytime week day evenings weekend days and weekend evenings. 

In an embodiment more fine grained time distinctions for example hours within a day or daytime vs. evening portions of a day may be a parameter of the usage expectations discussed further below.

In an embodiment the detection context may also contain an indication of an expected location .L where environmental sensing by the BIRD will take place or is expected to take place. In an alternative embodiment expected locations .L for the item are instead considered elements of the item s usage expectations discussed further below.

In an alternative embodiment expected locations .L may be elements of both one or more detection contexts and also of associated usage expectations .

The allocation of locations may be based in part on hierarchical considerations. For example an element or parameter of the detection context may include specifying a relatively larger geographic domain a country a state a metropolitan area referred to below as a daily life location .DL where sensing is expected to take place. Contained within a daily life location .DL may be relatively smaller more localized areas regions and zones .Z and also commuting routes .CR some buildings or other contained home base areas .HB and zones .Z within buildings which may be elements of the usage expectations .

Detection contexts are discussed further below in conjunction with F B and other figures throughout this document.

An expected location .L is one element of an overall expected environment for an item . Expectations for an item s environment or usage may be based on for example and without limitation an historical recording of past item usage or expectations as specified by an authorized user of the item . Expected environments and expected item usage may be part of an authorized user s ExD criteria for an item discussed further below see for example and are formalized in the usage expectations .

In the exemplary embodiment shown in the BIRD is configured with programmed with or has learned or been trained with specific location usage expectations .Loc for its associated item in this case keys .K . Location usage expectations .Loc are one element among others of general usage expectations which indicate that during and throughout some specified time frame a BIRDed item is expected to be subject to some kind of specified environment.

In an embodiment if the BIRDed item has an actual location .L which is within some specified expected location s .L during the specified times and assuming no other competing parameters are programmed into the BIRD then BIRD logic is configured to determine that the BIRDed item is extant . . If the BIRDed item self assesses as being outside the specified expected location s .L during the specified times the BIRDed item self assesses that it may be lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. in other words that the item is displaced . . The current time .T is identified in the figure via clocks which may be the BIRD s internal clock timer calendar .

In the present exemplary instance the BIRDed item may be configured via detection context s and or its location usage expectations .Loc to expect that during the time range . of 0900 hours to 1700 hours the keys .K will be in a designated expected office location .L . This characterizes a first detection context . as illustrated in panels and of .

Note that the keys .K and BIRD are not an element of the detection context . itself. The detection context is rather the expected time range possibly along with the associated expected location .L for the keys .K or possibly the expected time range along with a broader expected location .L not illustrated which includes the specific expected location .L of the office.

During the time ranges . of 1700 hours to 2400 hours and again from 0000 to 0900 hours on a next consecutive day day 1 and day 2 respectively the BIRDed item may be configured to expect that the keys .K will be at a designated home location .L . In an embodiment this defines a second detection context . as illustrated in panels and . Note again that the BIRDed item itself is not an element of the detection context . only the expected time frame and possibly the expected location .L are elements of the detection context. 

In panel at the time of 1600 hours the location sensor .L of the BIRD determines that the keys .K are at the expected office location .L which is also its current location environment .L . Since this is the expected location .L for this time frame the BIRD determines that the item .K is extant . .

In panel at the current time .T of 1600 hours the location sensor .L of the BIRD determines that the item .K is currently at the home location .L which is again its current environment at that time. Since this is not the expected location .L for this time frame the BIRDed item should be at the office .L as suggested by the faded ghostly keys BIRD in the figure the BIRD determines that the keys .K are displaced . .

The BIRD with additional usage expectations may determine that the item .K is specifically misplaced .. and not for example lost .. or stolen .. since it has apparently been left at home. If the item s current location .L were elsewhere then depending on the particular location .L and possibly other factors the BIRD may make a determination that the keys .K may be lost .. or stolen .. .

In panel at the current time .T of 2100 hours the location sensor .L of the BIRD determines that the item .K is at the home location .L . Since this is also the expected location .L for this time frame the BIRD determines that the item .K is extant . .

In panel at the current time .T of 2100 hours the location sensor .L of the BIRD determines that the item .K is currently at the office location .L . Since this is not the expected location .L for this time frame the BIRDed item should be at home as again suggested by the faded keys BIRD in the figure the BIRD determines that the item .K is displaced . .

The BIRD with additional usage expectations may determine that the item .K is most likely misplaced and not for example lost or stolen since it has apparently been left at the office. If the item s current location .L were elsewhere then depending on the location and possibly other factors the BIRD may make a determination that the item .K may be lost .. or stolen .. .

 i expected to be at a particular fairly specific location at a particular time typically a home base location .HB and . . .

This document refers equivalently to i an item being AWOL the item is AWOL or iii the item has an AWOL status Yes.

If an item is not AWOL meaning the item is within an expected location .L during an expected time frame this document refers equivalently to the item having an AWOL status No.

In an embodiment AWOL status is not applicable to large generalized geographic areas such as daily life locations .DL . Rather AWOL status is applicable to more specific expected locations .L for example the authorized user s home office or a frequently used recreational facility which may be referred to as home base locations .HB . Both home base locations .HB and the AWOL status are discussed further below in greater detail in conjunction with .

In an alternative embodiment AWOL status may be applicable to some or all daily life locations .DL as well.

In in both of panels and the item s condition as being AWOL is consistent with the item s state as likely being displaced . . It will be noted that while an item s being AWOL is generally indicative of the item being in some state of being displaced . for example being misplaced or lost an AWOL status is not the only condition that can trigger a displaced state . . Other conditions which lead the BIRDed item to self assess a displaced state . are discussed throughout this document. Moreover an item may be not AWOL that is the item is at an expected location .L during a time frame it should be at that location and still due to other actual environmental or actual usage conditions .U the BIRDed item may self assess as displaced . .

The term environment as used herein is in some respects generally consistent with conventional usage but in embodiments usage of the term environment may be broader in some ways.

The environment of a BIRDed item includes actual environmental phenomena environmental conditions or environmental features which are characteristics of elements of energies emanating from or properties of the physical setting or context surrounding an item or impinging on an item. The label as used in this document may reference any of an item s general actual environment taken as a whole a room for example within which the item resides possibly along with the person in the room who currently has the item on person and or the aggregate of environmental forces or energies actually impinging on the item at any given time.

General environmental conditions .G may include for example and without limitation the ambient visual elements and the ambient light level surrounding the item suggested in by sunlight or the dark of evening and again in below by the sunlight ambient sounds and the ambient sound level the ambient humidity ambient temperature measures intensity frequency etc. of electromagnetic phenomena impinging on the item chemicals in the environment surface pressure on the item ambient radiation air pressure surrounding the item and other properties of the physical setting.

Location Environment as used herein may be somewhat broadened over conventional usage in that the actual location .L of an item may be considered an aspect of the item s environment. Locations .L shown in include a home an office building an outdoor pedestrian walking area and a cafe suggested by the cafe table of below . As discussed further below an item s actual location .L at any given time may be or may not be the same as the expected item location s for that item and at that time.

Time Environment as used herein may also include the current time .T which may be ascertained by the BIRD via its internal clock timer calendar .

Motion Environment as used herein also includes aspects of an item s condition which may be relative or relational to the environment. For example an item s motion .M may not be conventionally considered an element of the item s environment but rather a property or state of the item itself . However as used herein environment would also include the BIRDed item s state of motion .M . This is because as described further throughout this document an item s motion .M may sometimes be employed to help determine if the item is displaced . lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen or otherwise in an anomalous state . . Further since many items are not self propelled an item s motion .M if any is typically imposed on it by an external agent often a person who is carrying using or otherwise transporting the item . As such the item s environment is broadened to include changes in the state or condition of the item which may result from the motion of a user or other environmental factors such as vehicular transport .

Motion .M is suggested in below by the walking movements and likely other body movements of the user carrying the keys .K in her purse in panel and the user with keys in pocket and engaged in seated body movements in panel .

Environment as used herein may also include physiological features or states of persons in proximity to the item particularly if those physiological features or states may be determined by either of i the sensors of the BIRDed item or ii a data transmission from a physiological sensor on the person which can detect the person s physiological features or states.

The term environmental as used for example in the phrase environmental sensor refers to measurable aspects or properties of the environment surrounding impinging upon or influencing an item or its associated BIRD . Environmental may also refer to measures of the environmental condition of the item which result from environmental factors or to measures of those conditions. For example a motion sensor .M is an environmental sensor which measures the velocity acceleration and or torque of an item.

In an embodiment a BIRD is configured or programmed with usage expectations for its associated item which are in alternative to or in addition to the usage expectations .Loc based on expected location .L . Such usage expectations may include in exemplary embodiments expectations for movement .M of the item or an amount of illumination .G impinging on the item .

In an embodiment a BIRD has a motion sensor .M discussed further below in conjunction with and other figures throughout this document . In an embodiment the BIRD s motion sensor .M can detect walking or running .M by the user and is also sufficiently sensitive to detect the smaller body movements .M which people naturally make even when sitting or standing.

In an exemplary application a set of keys .K may generally be carried by an authorized user AU during the user s waking hours or work hours. The user may configure the BIRD with usage expectations indicating that he or she will never set the keys .K down for more than a specified number of minutes during routine waking or work hours. A determination of whether the keys .K are extant . or displaced . may depend in whole or in part on motion detections by the BIRD . For a BIRDed item to self assess as either extant . or displaced . and possibly in a particular state of being displaced . may require some distinctions among motion states.

The BIRD may use motion data to determine if its associated item is being carried held or is otherwise on the person of some individual. This may be referred to as the on person off person status of the item . In an embodiment when a person is in physical possession of an item this may be detected by personal motions .M that people make including walking and running motions. Even when a person is standing or sitting the individual generally does not remain perfectly motionless for any substantial length of time people shift in place as they sit or stand. In addition personal motions .M may include movement of the item when the item is in hand or in some instances worn or used on the person s head . In an embodiment a BIRD processes data from the motion sensor .M to identify item motions .M associated with an item being on person .OnP or to identify a lack of such personal motions .M which may indicate that the item is off person .OffP .

References to an item have a status of on person .OnP typically mean the item is being carried about by some person for example in hand or in pocket or in a purse worn on a wrist or around the neck etc. . Note that on person does not indicate whether the person is an authorized user AU it may be unknown or to be determined by the BIRD whether the person possessing the BIRDed item is an authorized user AU or on the other hand the person is a thief or some other unauthorized user UU who may have misappropriated the item .

In an alternative embodiment a BIRD may employ additional sensor data and or alternative sensor data to determine if an item is on person .OnP or off person .OffP . For example a wallet .W may be subject to pressure when carried in a person s pocket and so a surface pressure sensor .P may detect such pressure. Any item which is carried close to a person s skin for example a wallet in pocket or jewelry may be in proximity to body heat such heat can be detected by a BIRD s temperature sensor .T . Some items may normally or conventionally be carried about outside of a pocket or other personal container if such an item has one or more cameras .C the cameras may be used to search the environment for the face of a user. Other BIRD sensing means may be employed as well to make a determination if the item is on person .OnP or off person .OffP .

An item may have a motion status . An item which is subject to personal motion .M has a motion status of user movement .UM .

An item is stationary .Stat when it is off person .OffP and so not engaged in any personal motion .M . Often this means this item is in fact completely still that is the item is without any motion whatsoever. For example the item may be on a table or in a drawer where the item is not subject to any motion at all unless for example the table is being moved or the drawer is being opened .

For purpose of this document however an item may also be considered stationary .Stat if it is subject to other kinds of motion but the item is not subject to personal motion .M . For example an item which has been left behind typically by accident on public transportation bus train car airline etc may be in motion with the public transport but the item is still classified for BIRD purposes as stationary .Stat since it is off person .OffP .

An item is stagnant .StG if it continuously stationary .Stat off Person .OffP for more than some allowed amount of time referred to as the stationary limit . This typically means the item is not subject to personal motions .M for more than the designated allowed period of time .

It is common that in normal use an authorized user AU may set down an item for a period of time. Keys .K wallets .W purses .P and cell phones .Act.CP are all routinely set down at various times even when substantially in use. For example a user making a purchase at a store may momentarily set their wallet .W down on a counter. A purse .P may be set down on a table for substantially longer periods of time. As part of the usage expectations for an item a BIRD may be configured with parameters indicating the stationary limit that is a maximum amount of time that an item may be set down before being considered stagnant .StG .

In an embodiment the stationary limit that is the duration in time which is indicative of an item becoming stagnant .StG may vary depending on detection context . For example a purse .P may normally be set down on a table or similar surface the entire time it is at home. An appropriate stationary limit at home before the purse .P is considered stagnant .StG may be eight or ten hours or even longer. At an office or other place of employment on the other hand the same purse .P may be assigned by the authorized user AU a stationary limit time before the item is considered stagnant .StG of no more than say one hour. While shopping or running other errands the user configured stationary limit may be at most a few minutes.

In summary an item which is not subject to user imposed movements but has been still or only subject to non personal motions such as transportation motions for less than the allowed time interval that is less than the stationary limit is simply stationary .StaT . An item which remains stationary .Stat or is only subject to non personal motions transportation motions etc. for more than the stationary limit is further considered stagnant .StG . If an item is stagnant .StG that may be a partial indicator that the item is lost .. or misplaced .. as discussed further below .

In an embodiment personal motion status and on person off person status may be combined into a single integrated personal motion status . That is the on person off person status may be fully subsumed by or indicated by the personal motion status . In such an embodiment a personal motion status of user movement .UM is also indicative of a status of on person .OnP . Similarly in such an embodiment a personal motion status of either stationary .StaT or stagnant .StG are both indicative of a status of off person .OffP .

In panel of the authorized user AU is in an outdoor street environment .L . Such an environment may be part of a much larger expected location .L for example a daily life location .DL such as an entire city or larger metropolitan area where the authorized user AU routinely goes about her business. In such wide ranging daily life locations .DL unlike more localized home base locations .HB any definable detection contexts may be very broad in geographic scope and so they may be less than optimally useful in identifying an item as extant . or displaced . . In such daily life locations .HB then motion statuses may be of particular value for a BIRDed item to self assess if it is extant . or displaced . . See below regarding daily life .DL vs. home base .HB locations see above regarding detection contexts . 

In panel as well as in the associated panel discussed below the keys .K may be within the appropriate detection context that is an overall daily life location .DL such as a city whether they are with the authorized user AU walking on the sidewalk or are left behind at a nearby caf . However the motion sensor .M of the BIRD may determine that the keys .K which are carried in the authorized user s handbag are in personal motion .M consistent with being carried on person .OnP of an authorized user AU who is walking through the environment and also consistent with a formal status of user movement .UM . In an embodiment since this is an expected motion status and on person status of the item .K the BIRD determines that the item .K is extant . .

In panel of the authorized user AU is again walking along the sidewalk but she has left her keys .K behind on a table at a nearby cafe. So in panel it is the table and the surrounding cafe which is the BIRDed item s environment while the space through which the authorized user AU is currently walking is not the BIRDed item s environment . The stationary limit for the keys .K is five minutes as established in the BIRD s usage expectations and as monitored by the BIRD s clock timer . The motion sensor .M of the BIRD determines that the keys .K are stationary .Stat and have been stationary .Stat for more than five minutes for about 12 minutes in the figure . Therefore the keys .K are not only off person .OffP but further the keys .K are stagnant .StG . Since this is not the expected motion status in an embodiment an item should never be stagnant .StG the BIRD determines that the item .K is displaced . .

In panel of the authorized user AU is in an office environment .L . Such an environment is typical of a home base location .HB in being relatively compact geographically a location that the authorized user AU visits on a routine basis and possibly a well scheduled basis and a location where the authorized user AU may likely feel it safe to leave and or store various personal items . If an item is left behind in a home base location .HB and so is present in the office location when it should not be the BIRD may determine that the item is displaced . . This is a scenario already discussed above in conjunction with .

However even during times when an item such as keys .K are supposed to be in the office the keys .K may still become displaced . for example misplaced .. misappropriated .. or even stolen .. . The motion sensor .M of the BIRD may self assess if the BIRDed item is in an appropriate on person off person status and or an appropriate motion status . In this way the BIRDed item may self assess as being extant . or displaced . .

In panel the BIRD determines that the keys .K are in personal motion .M consistent with being in the pocket of a very busy active user at a desk and so of course must be on person .OnP and be assigned a status of having user movement .UM . Since as specified in usage expectations this is are expected statuses for the keys .K in the office the BIRD self assesses that it and its associated keys .K are extant . .

In panel the environment .L is again the office. Here however the keys .K are no longer in the authorized user s pocket but rather are lying on edge of the desk. The stationary limit for the keys .K is twenty five minutes as established in the BIRD s usage expectations and as monitored by the BIRD s clock timer .

The motion sensor .M of the BIRD determines that the keys .K are stationary .StaT . Since the keys .K are therefore off person .OffP which is not normally the expected on person off person status for this item in this context the BIRD s clock timer initiates a count of the amount of time that the item has been stationary .Stat .

The stationary limit may be seen to be about twenty five minutes but the amount of time the keys .K have been stationary .Stat may be seen to be about fifteen minutes. Since this is still within the stationary limit the BIRD does not yet self assess itself and the keys .K as being displaced . the item is still considered extant . .

However in a scenario not illustrated once the timer reaches the stationary limit of twenty five minutes the keys .K would be determined to be stagnant .StG . In this instance the BIRDed item may then emit a local signal indicating its state as displaced . . If the authorized user AU meant to place his keys on the desk and wants them there he can deactivate the signal on the BIRD and leave the keys .K where they are. On the other hand if the authorized user AU actually meant to put his keys back in his pocket he is now constructively reminded to do so.

It may be observed that if the keys .K are on the desk and the authorized user AU remains present in the office the keys .K cannot really be viewed as being lost .. or misplaced .. or generally as being displaced . . However it is a practical fact of life that the longer the keys .K or similar items are left lying about especially when the authorized user AU normally keeps the items in pocket the greater the risk that the items may be forgotten covered over with papers etc. In other words the more time elapses the great the risk of the keys becoming displaced . .

In an embodiment the BIRD may self assess its associated item as being at risk of being displaced . . In that event the BIRD may present suitable warnings or alerts to the authorized user AU . In an embodiment a BIRD may employ multiple stationary limits . For example a first shorter time limit may trigger a self assessment that the item is at risk of being displaced . a second longer time limit may trigger a self assessment that the item is now to be considered displaced . .

Some items especially but not exclusively purses .P briefcases .B and more generally container items .C may be off Person .OffP but still subject to transportation motions while still being under the control of the authorized user AU . For example purses .P and briefcases .B are typically set down on a seat or elsewhere in a car while the authorized user AU is driving to various destinations. In an embodiment BIRD logic discussed below throughout this document may employ suitable refinements to adapt for expected transportation motions and expected durations of such transportations motions when establishing logic for such containers items .C and other items which may be deliberately set off Person .OffP by an authorized user AU during transit.

Again with reference to an authorized user AU of the keys .K or other some other item such as a wallet .W may know that she will normally keep the item in her pocket or purse and so shielded from ambient light most of the time. The BIRD s optical sensor .Opt discussed further below may be configured to determine if the item is exposed to light for more than some specified allowed amount of time a light exposure limit not labeled in the figure but again for example five minutes .

In when the keys .K are taken out of pocket or out of a purse .P the coupled BIRD is out of pocket as well since the two are tethered. As long as the keys .K remains exposed to little or no light and assuming no other potentially competing usage expectations indicate otherwise then the BIRD is configured to determine that the item is extant . in pocket or in purse . If the BIRD determines that the item is exposed to light for less than the light exposure limit no alert condition is triggered. However if the BIRD makes a determination that the item has been exposed to light for longer than the light exposure limit for example longer than five minutes an indication for example that the item may have been left behind on a table then the BIRD signals that the item may be displaced . .

In panel the light sensor .Opt of the BIRD determines that the keys .K which are in the purse .P of an authorized user AU are exposed to little or no light. Since this is an expected illumination state for the keys .K the BIRD determines that the keys .K are extant . .

In panel the light sensor .Opt of the BIRD determines that the keys .K have been exposed to daylight for at least five continuous minutes for example the keys have been left behind on a table at a cafe. Since this is not the expected illumination status the BIRD determines that the keys .K are displaced . .

In panel the light sensor .Opt of the BIRD determines that the keys .K which are in the authorized user s shirt pocket are exposed to little or no light. Since this is an expected illumination status of the keys .K the BIRD determines that the keys .K are extant . .

In panel the light sensor .Opt of the BIRD may determine that the keys .K are exposed to room light from a light source not illustrated and have been exposed to illumination for longer than the light exposure limit for example twenty five minutes for example the keys .K have been left sitting on the edge of the desk for more than twenty five minutes. Since this is not the expected state of illumination for the keys .K the BIRD determines that the item .K is displaced . . In this instance the BIRD may emit a local signal indicating its state as displaced . . If the authorized user AU meant to place his keys .K on the desk and wants them there he can deactivate the signal on the BIRD and leave the keys .K where they are. On the other hand if the authorized user AU actually meant to put his keys .K back in his pocket he is now constructively reminded to do so.

In discussions above in conjunction with various exemplary item statuses location status motion status or light status have been employed in exemplary embodiments of methods to determine if an item is extant . or is displaced . . In practice a BIRDed item may be configured to employ multiple aspects of item status location motion light exposure sound exposure temperature and other aspects of the item s assessment of its environment in order to self assess its state as extant . or displaced . .

In practice employing more than one environmental factor and so more than one item status may result in assessments of item state extant . or displaced which are both more reliable and more detailed than that obtained through analysis of just one item status alone. The additional detail may come for example in the form of determining whether an extant item is with a primary authorized user AU or with a borrower or whether a displaced item is lost .. misplaced .. stolen .. misappropriated .. or wandering .. . Specific method embodiments employing multiple item statuses location motion and other factors are presented throughout this document. See for example and other figures throughout this document.

The exemplary criteria discussed above and similar criteria for distinguishing an item which is extant . from an item which may be displaced . lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen may be referred to as ExD criteria . ExD criteria may also include other criteria indicative of other normal states . or anomalous states . in addition to or in the alternative to being extant . or displaced . lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen .

ExD criteria reflect item usage as it might be expressed in plain language by an authorized human owner or user of an item. ExD criteria may also reflect item usage as might be indicated by an authorized user AU via selections of choices readily made via a dialog box on a graphical user interface or similar. So for example an authorized user AU might describe their typical usage of an item when extant . and or in normal use in terms of locations .L where the item is typically used how the user moves about with item expected light exposure expected sound exposure and similar criteria.

ExD criteria can also be understood in terms of general characteristics of an authorized user AU and a user s environment which can impact or influence BIRD sensors . For example different people walk and move in different ways different average speeds different gait etc. which can be detected by a BIRD s motions sensor .M and distinguished by a suitably programmed and configured BIRD microprocessor discussed further below .

Internal to a BIRD ExD criteria must be represented by suitable mathematical or logical representations referred to as usage expectations which in an embodiment are both item specific and user specific. Usage expectations are discussed in detail in and in conjunction with other figures throughout this document . During field operation with an item BIRD logic may process data received from one or more sensors such as the location sensor .L the motion sensor .M the optical sensor .Opt and or other sensors.

The sensor data and processed sensor data .P referred to in aggregation as usage data .U discussed in detail starting in and in conjunction with other figures throughout this document is processed and interpreted by the BIRD logic in combination with the usage expectations .

In an embodiment and as illustrated in ExD criteria as assessed by the authorized user AU may be input by the authorized user AU . The user AU may enter BIRD configuration data into the BIRD via a configuration computer discussed further below in conjunction with . In an embodiment the configuration computer or the BIRD itself are configured with suitable interface algorithms or processing such as dialog boxes calendars maps or data entry wizards to guide the authorized user s input of ExD criteria . Such processing referred to as BIRD Navigation and illustrated in the figure as a sextant may also assist in translating the user s data entry into formal usage expectations .

In an alternative embodiment the ExD criteria may be determined in whole or part by the BIRD itself during one or more training sessions or configuration time periods. During the training periods an authorized user AU not shown uses the item for example her keys .K in her purse in ways designed to train the BIRD to distinguish normal item usage from anomalous item usage . . In this case on board BIRD Navigation possibly augmented at points by BIRD logic on a configuration computer uses the sensor data collected during the training period to determine normal . vs. anomalous . item usage that is ExD criteria .

Whether a BIRD is configured by direct user configuration by training by other means or by a combination of the above an output of the configuration process is a mathematical and or logical representation of the ExD criteria as usage expectations . Three exemplary forms of usage expectations are illustrated in .

These three forms of usage expectations wave functions . matrix representations . and logical relationships . are exemplary only. Persons skilled in the relevant arts will recognize that many forms of mathematical logical functional or symbolic representations may be used to represent expected or anticipated behaviors of an item and or to represent the expected or anticipated sensor data associated with expected anticipated item behaviors. All such representations fall within the scope and spirit of the present teachings system and method.

Sensor data .R is recorded in real time and a suitable history of the sensor data .H is maintained in the memory of the BIRD . As appropriate for purposes of processing the BIRD may represent and or process the sensor data into a variety of processed representations .P such as a waveform . a matrix or other data structure . or summary forms of data . . The real time sensor data .R the historical sensor data .H and the processed sensor data .P are referred to collectively that is as a total aggregate set of data elements as usage data .U .

In an embodiment usage data .U is compared against the usage expectations . In various embodiments different elements of usage data .U that is different sets or subsets of real time data .R historical data .H and or processed data .P may be employed for comparison at various points in time. In an embodiment the usage data .U used for comparison purposes is any or all of real time sensor data .R historical data .H and or processed data .P . If the usage data .U is acceptably close to the usage expectations for the item authorized user AU the BIRD determines that the item is extant . or otherwise in a non anomalous state. This is illustrated in via 

In practical operations it must be specified just how acceptably close the usage data .U must be to the usage expectations . This may be specified in whole or in part in the BIRD logic in the usage expectations themselves in other BIRD configuration parameters or in a combination of all three. Algorithms in support of these determinations are discussed further below throughout this document.

In an embodiment an item may be associated with an authorized user AU . When so associated the item has an authorized user status which may have exemplary values of .AU AU Yes or Authorized user AU . In an embodiment a BIRD may determine whether or not an item is associated with an authorized user AU via iteMetrics . See below and other figures throughout this document for further discussion.

The BIRD maintains a real time monitor of environmental sensor data using its sensors . The BIRD has stored in its memory discussed further below in conjunction with and other figures both general BIRD logic and the usage expectations appropriate for an authorized user AU and the item .K linked to the BIRD . See discussed above .

Sensor data .R is recorded in real time and a suitable history of the sensor data .H is maintained in the memory of the BIRD . As appropriate for purposes of processing the BIRD may represent and or process the sensor data into a variety of representations such as a waveform . a matrix or other data structure . or summary forms of data . .

In an embodiment usage data .U is compared with the usage expectations . In various embodiments different elements of usage data .U that is different sets or subsets of real time data .R historical data .H and or processed data .P may be employed for comparison at various points in time. In an embodiment the usage data .U used for comparison purposes is any or all of real time sensor data .R historical data .H and processed data .P .

If the sensor data varies from the usage expectations for the item authorized user AU AU see beyond some specified threshold the BIRD determines that the item may be displaced . or otherwise in an anomalous . state. The variation threshold for determining a displaced state . or anomalous state . may be specified in whole or in part in the BIRD logic in the usage expectations or in a combination of both.

That the sensor data varies significantly from the usage expectations in this case with a relatively dramatic variation is illustrated in via two plots . . which are visibly very different from each other two matrices . . which have a large differences in data values and a summary real time location value . which does not match the summary location value in a usage expectation . . Algorithms in support of these determinations are discussed further below throughout this document.

In an embodiment an item may be associated with an unauthorized user UU . When so associated the item has an authorized user status which may have exemplary values of .UU UU No or Unauthorized user UU . In an embodiment a BIRD may determine whether or not an item is associated with an authorized user AU via iteMetrics . See below and other figures throughout this document for further discussion.

In an embodiment a BIRD s usage expectations may be shared in whole or in part among different authorized users AU and or different items .

In an embodiment a BIRD which is associated with a single item may be configured with usage expectations suitable for different users of the same item. Panel A of illustrates an exemplary musical instrument in this case a violin .M.V which is used by two different exemplary family members authorized user AU.Classical who is an aficionado of classical music and authorized user AU.Bluegrass who likes to jam it up bluegrass style. The instrument .M.V has an exemplary associated BIRD . In addition to having different musical styles and tastes the two family members AU.Classical AU.Bluegrass may have distinctly different personal usage habits when carrying about the violin .M.V .

For example each family members AU.Classical AU.Bluegrass may play the violin .M.V in different venues at different locations .L . As such expected location .L is one parameter for the usage expectations among others that would be different for the two users though the home or storage location may be the same for both users AU.Classical AU.Bluegrass . The BIRD associated with the violin .M.V can be configured with appropriate respective usage expectations .Classical .Bluegrass for each of the two respective family members AU.Classical AU.Bluegrass . Other usage expectations such as those reflective of movement of the item may be very different for each of the two users as well.

Suitable local input elements discussed below in conjunction with and other figures can be used to put the BIRD into an operational mode for each respective user AU.Classical AU.Bluegrass . Each user based operational mode is configured based on the appropriate respective usage parameters .Classical .Bluegrass for the appropriate family member AU.Classical AU.Bluegrass who is using the violin .M.V at a given time.

The usage expectations .Classical .Bluegrass shown are exemplary only and are expressed in colloquial informal and imprecise terms essentially as ExD criteria for convenience of illustration only. In an embodiment the actual usage expectations employed by the BIRD for internal processing are reflective of the data expected to be sensed by multiple all of the sensors of the BIRD when the violin .M.V is in a non anomalous or extant . state. In an embodiment such usage expectations employed by the BIRD for internal processing are expressed in a variety of mathematical logical or symbolic forms as discussed throughout this document.

However in an embodiment an authorized user AU of a BIRD may be able to specify some or all usage expectations by employing colloquial informal and or imprecise terms that is ExD criteria the BIRD or an associated configuration computer discussed below may employ natural language processing capabilities to transform ExD criteria into the more formal mathematical logical symbolic usage expectations required for internal processing by the BIRD .

In an embodiment sound qualities of a musical instrument .M or any sound emitting item could be a factor either by themselves or in conjunction with other sensor data indicative of other environmental factors in determining if the instrument .M or other item is in a normal . or anomalous . usage state.

In an embodiment a BIRD which is associated with that is mechanically tethered to different items at different times may be configured with usage expectations suitable for each item of the different items. Panel B of illustrates an exemplary user AU.Guitar who plays the guitar and who has two guitars an electric guitar .M.ElectricG and an acoustic guitar .M.AcousticG . Assuming the user AU.Guitar elects to take only one of the two guitars .M.AcousticG .M.ElectricG on the road at a time the user AU.Guitar could switch the BIRD from one guitar to the other as needed.

The BIRD can be configured with appropriate respective usage expectations .ElectricG .AcousticG for each of the two guitars .M.AcousticG .M.ElectricG respectively. Suitable local input elements discussed below in conjunction with can be used to put the BIRD into an operational mode for each respective guitar .M.AcousticG .M.ElectricG . Each item based operational mode is configured based on the appropriate respective usage parameters .ElectricG .AcousticG for the appropriate guitar .M.AcousticG .M.ElectricG to which it will be tethered.

The usage expectations .ElectricG .AcousticG shown are exemplary only. In an embodiment the actual usage expectations are reflective of the data expected to be sensed by multiple or all of the sensors of the BIRD when a guitar .M.AcousticG. .M.ElectricG is in a non anomalous or extant . state. In an embodiment sound qualities of the guitar .M.AcousticG .M.ElectricG or other musical instrument .M or any sound emitting item could be a factor either by themselves or in conjunction with other sensor data indicative of other environmental factors in determining if the guitar .M.AcousticG .M.ElectricG or other item is in a normal . or anomalous . usage state.

Two BIRDS . . may both be used by a common owner. If the two BIRDS . . will be used with items that have substantially similar usage one of the two BIRDs may be configured in whole or in part by copying controlling configuration parameters from the other BIRD. The configuration parameters may include part or all of the usage expectations . Panel C of illustrates an exemplary case of copying configuration usage parameters .Guitar from a first BIRD . associated with an electric guitar .M.ElectricG to a second BIRD . associated with an acoustic guitar .M.AcousticG .

If a user such as AU.Guitar from panel B typically carries both guitars about to her gigs then either the same or substantially similar usages parameters .Guitar are likely to be applicable for both guitars .M.ElectricG .M.AcousticG . Copying usage expectations and other configuration parameters from the first BIRD . to the second BIRD . may offer some convenience in establishing parameters for the second BIRD . . This is particularly true if for example the second guitar .M.AcousticG and associated BIRD . were acquired after the first guitar .M.ElectricG and associated BIRD . .

In an embodiment appropriate usage expectations for each of the two guitars .M.ElectricG .M.AcousticG may be substantially similar but not identical. In that event copying the usage expectations .Guitar from the first BIRD . to the second BIRD . may still be an effective way to establish baseline parameters for the second BIRD . . The guitar player may then employ a variety of methods and means discussed throughout this document to fine tune the usage expectations for the second BIRD . .

Actual transfer of the parameters may be accomplished via a BIRD communications link discussed below in conjunction with possibly in association with other communications means such as a configuration computer also discussed below .

The present teachings system and method are directed in part to a technology based capability to determine if an item is displaced . which may include the item being lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. stolen .. or wandering .. or determining on the other hand if the item is extant . present and or in use when and where expected . In an embodiment these determinations may rely in part on sensor data pertaining to the location of the BIRD and its associated item . A BIRD has a location sensor .L discussed further below in conjunction with and other figures throughout this document.

One dictionary definition of location is a place of settlement activity or residence. In common usage the term location tends to refer to designation of place on a geographic scale such as a home office street street address a building an identifiable outdoor site or geographic coordinates of any of the above location may also refer to presence in a mode of transport such as being located in a car or a train.

For purposes of this document location including both actual location .L and expected location .L includes those meanings but the term is also broadened to include more localized or fine grained position place identifiers. For example a location of an item may include identification of the item as being positioned in a particular room in a home or office or even further identification of the item as being in on a specific desk table cabinet locker or drawer within the mom.

In an embodiment to characterize a BIRDed item as displaced . or extant . and possibly in a particular state of being displaced . requires some distinctions among locations both actual locations .L and expected locations .L so that locations .L are divided into schema categories .

In this document an item s location .L is considered to be a real time geographic attribute of an item referring to where the item is to be found at a given time. For convenience of exposition the location .L is sometimes characterized in terms of a building or room or other localized place designation which may also be an elements of an authorized user s ExD criteria for the item . The item s location .L is one aspect of the item s environment . See for example above and other figures throughout this document. 

The location schema refers to the categories into which locations may be divided for purposes of BIRD logic . In an embodiment an exemplary location schema may include home base locations .HB daily life locations .DL zones .Z commuting routes .CR and out of bounds .OoB locations .OoB . This exemplary location schema as well as other exemplary location schemas are discussed further below in conjunction with the present and other figures throughout this document.

In this document the reference label is used interchangeably to refer to a location schema as a whole and to the categories which define the schema. However see also location status. discussed immediately below.

The location status of an item indicates which particular category from a location schema currently applies to the actual location of the item . Or the location status may indicate which category actually applied to the item at some earlier point in time. For example when an item is in a home base location .HB then an exemplary value of the location status may be HB home base or some other appropriate code for a home base .HB . For another example when an item is in a daily life location .DL but outside of a home base location .HB then an exemplary value of the location status may be DL daily life or similar.

An expected location .L is any geographic designation of a place where an item may be found or is expected to be found. Expected locations .L may be associated with specific context times or context time ranges via definitions of detection contexts and or usage expectations . See for example and other figures throughout this document.

The usage expectations for an item may include location usage expectations .L which may in turn include one or more specific expected locations .L . See for example below and other figures throughout this document. 

Where specific expected locations .L or location designations .L are referenced throughout this document particularly with reference to usage expectations the associated reference label s may still refer to categories in the location schema since such expected locations are often categorized in terms of the location scheme . However in some cases the reference label may be employed instead for example 

 i where a generic but singular indication is intended of a location that is a reference to some specific location .L but without necessarily associating the location with a category from the location schema or . . .

 i where a generic but singular indication is intended of a location that is a reference to some specific expected location .L where a possible association of the specific location .L with some schema category is incidental.

In a BIRDed item happens to be located in a particular home base location .HB and in a particular zone .Z. of the home base .HB . In a discussion where the association of the BIRDed item with a home base zone .HB .Z was a significant factor the location may be referenced for example as .Z or .Z.. In a general reference to the fact that the BIRDed item is at some specific location the location may be referenced as .L. 

A home base location or storage location .HB is typically a building or another localized area or site which is a permanent or semi permanent base of living or operations for an authorized user AU of the item . A home base .HB may also generally be a place where an authorized user AU could store an item or leave the item safely when the item is not in use.

For example a home an office or other place of employment would typically be a home base or storage location .HB . By contrast stores or restaurants that a person visits as a customer or friend s home even if visited fairly often would typically not be a home base. Some locations .L that an authorized user AU might visit on a very routine basis for example the gym where the authorized user AU works out five days a week or a relative s home or the home of a friend where the user sometimes stays overnight might be considered a home base .HB . In some cases a home base .HB might be or might include a well defined relatively localized outdoor location such as the property surrounding a home or office.

In an embodiment of the present system and method a BIRD may specifically enable an authorized user AU to distinguish home base locations .HB which are suitable for item storage from home base locations .HB which are not item storage locations. In an alternative embodiment such distinctions are not available or not needed and any home base location .HB is considered to be a suitable storage location. For simplicity in the discussion below home base location and storage location are assumed to be the same.

Characterized in other terms a home base .HB is a place where a user would typically feel it appropriate to leave a personal item either unattended or in a specific storage bin such as a locker and if the authorized user AU leaves the item out in the open and unattended or in the locker there is little or no likelihood of it being stolen .. . Or at least a theft the item would require a very deliberate concerted effort on the part of the thief for example a deliberate home break in. The home and hopefully the workplace usually qualify as may some other locations .L such as a gym or school where the authorized user AU has a locker or similar.

Characterized in other terms a home base .HB is a localized place typically on the scale of a building a part of a building or a room in which the authorized user AU conducts essential business or personal activities and or has a sustained association and or has a right or authorization to leave personal items on site even when the authorized user AU is not present. In some cases the scale of a home base .HB may be as large as an organizational campus for example a college campus or corporate campus .

Characterized in yet other terms a home base location .HB may be a relatively localized site with relatively predictable and consistent time usage with respect to an item . For example the times when an item is expected to be present in an authorized user s home or the times when an item is expected to be present in an authorized user s place of work may both be fairly well defined and reasonably consistent. Viewed in these time related terms a home base location .HB may not necessarily be defined in terms of item storage. For example a recreational site store or other facility which an authorized user AU generally visits on a scheduled consistent basis may be deemed to be a home base .HB even if the authorized user AU would not store or leave an item in those sites.

In an embodiment a BIRD may be configured to accept more than one class or category of home base locations .HB . Such classes or categories may include for example and without limitation Occupational work home base locations residency home base locations recreational home base locations regularly scheduled home base locations that is home base locations visited on a predictable basis home base locations distinguished based on scale for example campus building section of building shopping home base locations friend social home base locations and others. In an embodiment different classes of home base locations may be distinguished in terms of frequency of visits length of visits regularity of schedule of visits whether or not items may be stored in a class of home base locations and other factors.

In an embodiment one application of home base locations .HB is to help provide a framework in which BIRD logic can assess if the BIRDed item is or is not in a well defined fairly specific location when expected to be. In an embodiment BIRD logic BIRD song and BIRD navigation all discussed throughout this document may all be fine tuned to reflect distinctions among different classes of home base locations.

In an alternative embodiment some or all distinctions among different classes of home base locations .HB may instead be implemented through zones .Z discussed further below.

Throughout this document reference is made at points to an item possibly being in an authorized user s office. The term office should be taken as a shorthand phrase to refer to any place of employment including but not limited to actual offices schools hospitals laboratories other corporate public or government facilities factories and even outdoor environments such as farms or construction sites. For some users such as police firemen paramedics truck drivers airline pilots and others involved in highly mobile occupations one or more office locations .L may relate to a fixed geographic office site or sites and also to a transit patrol or service vehicle. Additional location schemas with appropriate terms may also be defined for such mobile occupations for example one or more patrol areas one or more vehicles etc. . BIRD logic and usage expectations discussed throughout this document may be suitably adapted extended for such addition or extended location schemas .

A daily life location .DL is any location which an authorized user AU may visit or may transit through with some regularity or frequency but with which the authorized user AU does not maintain a central or permanent association. Typical examples of daily life locations .DL include stores which a person visits recreational facilities doctor s offices and other routine but intermittent life activity locations .L . These are locations .L which an authorized user AU may visit more or less frequently but where the authorized user AU typically does not leave personal items behind when the user leaves. At least personal items are not left behind intentionally by the user. One use of the present system and method is to enable items to self identify as having been left behind unintentionally. 

In an embodiment daily life locations .DL may be broadly defined. For example a user of a BIRD may define a broad geographic life area in which the authorized user AU generally lives works and otherwise conducts life activities. Example may include one or more cities one or more counties one or more areas defined by postal codes one or more areas within a specified radial distance of a central location one or more areas within a specified proximity to certain roads etc. In an embodiment daily life locations .DL defined as broad geographic areas usually include or encompass the home base location s .HB .

In an alternative embodiment the authorized user AU of a BIRD may define specific sites such as stores or recreational centers as daily life locations .DL .

In an alternative embodiment the authorized user AU of a BIRD may define two or more distinct specific categories of daily life locations .DL . Each category may be assigned different usage expectations pertaining to whether an item is extant . or displaced . . For example the general geographic area in which a person lives may be a first category of daily life locations .DL stores which are frequently visited may be a second category a school which the user attends may be a third category etc. For another example a user may define a first geographic area which is relatively close to home work school etc. as a first daily life location .DL and then define a somewhat larger more extended geographic area as a second daily life location .DL .

In an embodiment a daily life location .DL may also be understood in terms of physical scale and in terms of time usage. A daily life location .DL tends to be geographically broad large enough to encompass many or most of the routine life activities of an authorized user AU and large enough to have within its boundaries multiple home base locations .HB . In addition and possibly in contrast to a home base location .HB user and item movement within a daily life location .DL may be less predictable on a time basis. That is 

 i on the one hand it is expected that an item will typically remain somewhere within a daily life location in the course of a day or week or other extended time period but on the other hand . . .

 ii . . . if the item is not in a home base location then it may be difficult to predict where exactly the item will be at any given time within the broad geographic domain of the daily life location s .DL . This reflects the possibility that authorized user AU movement and activities may be relatively variable when the authorized user AU is not at home base locations .HB .

A commuting route .CR is any road or public transit route or bike path or even a walking path flight path or boat route that the authorized user AU typically employs or may employ to get around within their general geographic life area .DL or between distinct geographic regions of a general geographic life area .DL .

In an embodiment any road or other travel path within the daily life locations .DL may be designated as potential commuting routes .CR . In an alternative embodiment an authorized user AU may specify that only particular roads or paths with the daily life locations .DL may qualify as commuting routes .CR . In an alternative embodiment one or more commuting routes .CR may be designated as being apart from the daily life locations .DL but as connecting one or more geographically distinct daily life locations .DL .

In terms of BIRD logic a commuting route .CR may be construed as being similar to a home location .HB or to a daily life location .DL the designation and associated logic may depend in part on how the route is travelled and how an item is used along the route .CR . If an item may travel along a commuting route .CR with the user but the authorized user AU typically does not leave the item unattended along the route then for that item and route the route .CR may be designated as daily life .DL but not home base .HB . For certain items and certain routes .CR an item may be one which can be left unattended in a car or bicycle for example . Appropriate BIRD logic for such a commuting route .CR might then be similar to that for a home location .HB .

Whether a commuting route .CR is considered similar to a home base location .HB or to a daily life location .DL which is not a home base special considerations may still apply in terms of BIRD logic . For example the movement of a transport device car train bicycle etc. adds extra motions to the use of an item . This may required filtering or other special processing of data from the motion sensors .M discussed further below to distinguish a user s personal motions .M from transport motions. Further some modes of transport both cars and bicycles for example typically require that a user to keep at least one hand on a wheel or handle bars. This may change how the user would use an item as compared to item usage when not in transit.

For simplicity below commuting routes .CR are sometimes considered simply as part of and included within daily life locations .DL .

Any location which is completely outside of any expected location for an item is considered to be out of bounds .OoB . That is any location which is not a home base .HB not a daily life location .DL and not a travel route .CR is considered out of bounds .OoB .

In an embodiment if an item is not in a home base location .HB or a daily life location .DL the BIRDed item is by default in an out of bounds location .OoB . As such and in an embodiment the location usage expectations .Loc need not include any specific definition of the out of bounds .OoB locations .OoB which rather are defined implicitly in relation to the home base .HB and daily life .DL locations.

In an alternative embodiment the location usage expectations .Loc explicitly define some or all regions that are out of bounds .OoB locations .OoB .

In an alternative embodiment the location usage expectations .Loc may define two or more different categories of out of bounds .OoB locations .OoB which may be used for various item state assessments by BIRD logic .

In an embodiment a BIRD may be configured to subdivide any of a home location .HB a daily life location .DL an out of bounds .OoB region .OoB and or a commuting route .CR into smaller specific units or zones .Z . For example and as illustrated in a home may be subdivided into zones .Z such as a zone for a living room .Z. zones for foyers or parlors .Z. .Z. and a zone for a kitchen .Z. . In an embodiment such zones may be incorporated into usage expectations to indicate expected item behavior in different zones.

For example a usage expectation for keys .K may indicate that when left at home in the evening when the authorized user AU is home as well the house keys .K are typically left sitting in a kitchen .Z. . Such usage of the keys .K is expected. If the keys .K are left stationary .Stat in any other zone .Z in the home then the keys may be misplaced .. .

Each room in an office building or in a school setting or similar institutional settings may also be designated as a zone .Z . This may be particularly helpful for persons engaged in a highly structured usage schedule for example students going from class to class in a school setting . The BIRD may be configured with usage expectations which indicate with substantial precision and only limited allowance for time slippage that the user is expected to be in certain rooms at certain times. If the student leaves an item behind in a class the BIRDed item can detect its lost state .. in a relatively timely manner.

Zones may be defined at varying levels of granularity and subsidiary zones may be defined as well. For example a single room may be partitioned into smaller zones or units.

In an embodiment different terminology as well as different BIRD processing and BIRD logic may be applied to zones of different scales. For example subdivisions of home base locations .HB may be referred to as zones .Z while subdivisions of large geographic areas may be referred to by some other terminology such as regions. For example a daily life location .DL of a county may be subdivided into regions according to cities zip codes or other boundaries specified by an authorized user or suggested by the BIRD based on item usage. For simplicity in this document reference is simply made throughout to zones .Z . 

Absent Without Leave AWOL may be considered a hybrid attribute or item status . It is illustrated above in conjunction with .

In an embodiment a BIRD is configurable with usage expectations which indicate expected usage of an item . These usage expectations may indicate that the item is expected to be within certain expected locations .L at specified times of day and or on specified dates. These expectations typically conform with typical usage by the authorized user AU .

For example an item may be expected to be at home during night time hours and also be expected to be at the office during working hours. The appropriate usage expectations to reflect this may be established by the user or the BIRD may determine them during a training period as discussed further below.

 i an item is within a generally allowed location a home base .HB or daily life .DL location that is the item is within a location where it is allowed to be at some points in time but . . .

A determination of AWOL status may contribute to a determination that an item may be lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. .

In an embodiment AWOL status may be associated exclusively with an item which is stationary .Stat not subject to personal movements and so is off person .OffP . If the item is in on person .OnP then it is either with the authorized user AU or with someone who has accidentally misappropriated the item or it is with a thief. In any of these cases the item is with some person and so is not wholly absent. In other words in this embodiment AWOL status is associated with an item which has been left behind someplace where it should not be or has been taken to where it should not be and has been left in place there. This may include an item which is left behind on a bus train or other public transportation. 

In an embodiment a BIRD is configured to determine AWOL status for its associated item on a simple yes no true false basis. In an alternative embodiment a BIRD may be configured to ascertain multiple different AWOL statuses with variations for whether or not the item is in motion on public transportation for example or stationary .Stat how far the item is from a currently allowed or expected location .L how long the item has been outside the allowed location and other factors.

It will be noted that an item may be generally within the overall daily life location s .DL for the item and possibly even within a home base location .HB and still be AWOL . AWOL status depends not only on location but also on the time s of day the item is expected to be within particular allowed expected locations .L . For example an authorized user AU may normally take an item to work if on some occasion the user accidentally leaves the item at home during the work day then the item is AWOL from the work location. Similarly if the item is accidentally left at work when the user returns home for the evening then during that evening the item is AWOL from home.

Typically people s routines tend to be fairly stable in some respects while varying in others. For example a user may have a life routine which is somewhat similar from one working day to the next but then distinctly different on weekends or other non work days. Additionally some users may travel either occasionally or routinely. A BIRD may be configured with alternate home base location s .HB alternate daily life location s .DL and or alternate commuting routes .CR to be specifically associated with different types of days for example work days vs. weekends or with an authorized user s travel.

See the discussion below of usage expectations FIGS. A F and in particular the discussion of usage expectation groups and context specific expectation groups FIG. D for exemplary associations of different expected locations .L with different times of day or days of the week etc.

The location schema described above based on home base locations .HB daily life locations .DL out of bounds .OoB regions .OoB commuting routes .CR zones .Z and statuses such as AWOL is exemplary only and other location schemas may be envisioned. The location schema described above may be useful for many users with relatively routine or stable life habits people who for example have only one or a handful of well defined home base locations .HB and who tend to spend a very substantial part of their life in a particular larger geographic location .L such as the city they live in and some nearby city where they are employed or go to school . The schema also tends to be appropriate for people with relatively stable or predictable schedules of movement and life activities.

Other alternative location schemas may be more suitable for other users. For example for a person who travels extensively or otherwise has a highly transient lifestyle alternative location schemas may be better suited for characterizing appropriate and inappropriate expected locations .L for an item. Similarly for persons with less predictable or unpredictable schedules an alternative schema possibly with alternate or additional hybrid categories of location and time may be more suitable for distinguishing appropriate vs. inappropriate expected item locations .L and location vs. time. Such alternate schemas may for some users better enable a BIRD and BIRD logic to determine when an associated item is extant . or displaced . . Such alternate schemas fall within the scope and spirit of the present system and method.

Other elements which may be aspects of alternative location schemas include for example and without limitation 

Life doesn t always go exactly according to plans and so neither does the usage of items . In an embodiment an authorized user AU may configure a BIRD with parameters which allow for some imprecision or fuzziness in location determinations. This takes into account that a user s actual life schedule or movements may not be perfectly identical from day to day. The fuzziness parameters may take various forms including for example and without limitation 

In an embodiment a location schema may be based in whole or part on location probabilities. In an exemplary embodiment a first category of locations .L may be based on a location or locations where for some part of a day or week etc. the authorized user s location can be anticipated with certainly very high likelihood or near certainty a second category of locations .L may be based on a location or locations where for some other part of a day the authorized user s location can be anticipated with a fairly high level of probability but a level that is lower than for the first category a third category of locations .L may reflect yet a lower probability of confidence about the user s expected location and so on as additional location probabilities may be characterized in this exemplary location schema .

For example a users presence at one or more home base locations .HB such as at an office or at school or at home may be highly likely for certain parts of the day or week while the user s presence at these same locations .HB may be possible but less likely or less predictable during other parts of a day or week. Similar conditions may apply to various other locations .L within a user s daily life locations .DL or travel routes .CR or even to some zones .Z .

In an embodiment the designation of an expected place .L or expected location .L as a home base .HB is at the user s discretion in configuring the BIRD . Similarly the designation of locations as daily life locations .DL travel routes .CR etc. is ultimately at the user s discretion in configuring the BIRD . See for example below. Similarly the designation of location fuzziness parameters if any is ultimately at the user s discretion in configuring the BIRD .

An BIRDed item may be subject to transportation motions including car motorcycle bicycle train bus airplane and boat movements. An item which is on board a transportation device car train airplane etc. is said to be In Transit. While subject to such motions the BIRD and associated item may also be subject to additional personal motions .M if the item is on person .OnP and possibly in addition if the item is in hand .OnP .

If the item is with the authorized user AU then the item is generally understood to be extant . as well. However an item which is in transit may also be lost .. if for example left behind on a bus train taxi plane etc. misappropriated .. or stolen .. . An in transit item may even be misplaced if for example the authorized user AU has unintentionally left the item behind in a family or business car and another family member or business associate drives off with the item . Identification of an in transit item as also being extant . on the one hand or as being displaced . on the other hand may be accomplished by a BIRD .

Transportation motions may include both large scale transport motions such as accelerations and substantial velocities but may also include the vibratory motions and occasional bumps associated with many forms of transit. Note that in an embodiment and as discussed further below a BIRD may be configured with a vibration sensor .B separate from the motion sensor .M . In an alternative embodiment a single sensor may be configured to function as both a large scale motion sensor .M and a vibration sensor .B .

Because personal motions .M and transport associated vibrations are both small scale motions there is a possibility that these two forms of motion could tend to mask each other. However sensors with sufficient sensitivity and precision if coupled with suitable filtering algorithms may be configured to extract and distinguish user personal motions from transport vibratory motions. For example a BIRD may be configured to distinguish motion frequencies and amplitudes associated with personal motions .M from the frequencies and amplitudes associated with transportation driven movements.

An item and associated BIRD may be subject to other motions as well. Some of these may be transitory such as an item in a desk drawer being subject to motion when the drawer is opened or closed. Other motions may be more sustained and be inherent in certain types of environments for example vibratory motions associated with construction sites. As with transportation motions suitable filtering algorithms may enable a BIRD to distinguish personal user motions from other types of motions which are not driven by a person holding or bearing an item .

The motion schema described immediately above with an item subject to personal motion stationary stagnant and or in transit is exemplary only. Other motion schemas may be employed as well by a BIRD in the alternative or additionally to categorize and identify item motion states which are associated with an item being extant . or displaced . or more generally with an item being in a normal state . of use or in an anomalous state . of use. Such alternative motion schemes may include for example and without limitation 

Item motion is one item attribute among others which may be detected by BIRD sensors and that may be significant in assessing the iteMetrics of an item . IteMetrics are discussed immediately below.

The table has a first column which names various exemplary locations .L which may be associated with an authorized user s daily life but which thereby includes not only the larger formal daily life areas .DL such as cities counties or other large geographic domains but also more localized home base locations .HB and zones .Z .

A second column lists the various respective exemplary schema categories which are associated with respective specific expected locations.

A third column lists locator data which would actually define the location by geographic coordinates or other location data usable by a BIRD s location sensor .L . Shown in Table are exemplary pointers GPS1 GPS2 BEACON1 etc. which would reference data structures in memory that contain the actual formal geographic location data. For example GPS pointers may obtain data for GPS coordinates while BEACON pointers may reference data structures associated with location broadcast beacons .

In an embodiment the expected locations .L may be defined by an authorized user AU along with a designation of appropriate matching schema categories . In an embodiment the BIRD may determine the location boundaries beacons by downloading suitable location coordinates and or location beacon data from databases which associate the expected location labels .L with the locator data . Suitable location databases may include internet based mapping services local building facility location databases maintained by various institutions and other sources. In an embodiment of the present system and method it is envisioned that over time it will become increasingly common for many public and private facilities to maintain location databases and or location beacons which may be compatible with BIRD technology.

In an embodiment a BIRD is configured to use data from its input devices and or environmental sensors to identify recognize or otherwise characterize a person who possesses or most recently possessed the item associated with the BIRD . In an embodiment a BIRD is also configured to distinguish between authorized users AU who are authorized to be in possession or control of the associated item versus other persons who are not so authorized and who are therefore unauthorized users UU .

In an embodiment the BIRD may be configured with additional authorized user AU status values to distinguish among different categories of authorized users AU for example a primary authorized user vs. borrowers and or different individual authorized users AU and similarly the BIRD may be configured with additional unauthorized user UU status values for different categories and or specific persons of unauthorized users UU .

In an embodiment a BIRD may determine whether or not an item is associated with an authorized user AU or an unauthorized user UU via iteMetrics discussed immediately below.

In an embodiment the desired personal authentications characterizations fall into two categories which are broadly distinct though possibly with some functional areas of overlap 

A BIRD logically links the biological identity of an authorized user AU with the item related behavior of an authorized user AU by associating a specific user s biometrics identity with the specific user s iteMetrics behavior .

Both biometrics and iteMetrics are discussed further immediately below. Table shown in presents a side by side comparison of biometrics and iteMetrics .

In the data processing arts when an authorized user AU establishes usage of or control over a data processing device some form of active deliberate personal validation is commonly required. Familiar examples are logging into a personal computer or gaining access to financial accounts via a commercial ATM machine. For example the user may identify himself or herself via a user name or an ATM card and provide further validation with a secret password.

In an embodiment a BIRD employs analogous methods of active deliberate access control for authorized users AU . Controlled access to the BIRD by the authorized user AU is accomplished via active input of user biometrics and may be required at various points or times of active control by an authorized user AU including for example and without limitation 

In an embodiment a BIRD may detect via iteMetric assessments discussed below that it s associated item may be stolen .. or misappropriated .. the BIRD may then request biometric or personal ID input from the current item user. If the user cannot provide the appropriate biometric personal authentication this confirms that the BIRDed item is stolen .. or misappropriated .. .

By means of this controlled access the BIRD ensures that only the authorized user AU can put the BIRD to effective operational use. In addition a BIRD is configured by the authorized user AU to associate or link the user s biometrics with the same user s iteMetrics . Once that linkage configuration is accomplished then each time the authorized user AU logs into the BIRD by inputting biometrics or other login signatures the BIRD has suitable operational expectations for the types of iteMetrics it should be sensing in daily field use.

Deliberate active self authentication by an authorized user AU may be accomplished by a number of biometric means and methods including for example and without limitation user name and or password input to the BIRD handwriting recognition and or biometric authentication of the authorized user AU via fingerprint voice print eye print iris and or retina scan facial recognition or other user distinctive biological signatures. Apart from deliberate changes of a user name or password a general characteristic of biometrics is that they tend to be highly stable over time. Fingerprints do not change iris characteristics and voice prints tend to be substantially stable over time facial appearance changes only gradually over time unless deliberately altered etc.

As discussed in detail below throughout this document a BIRD is configurable with usage expectations which indicate the expected environment and or usage of an item . In an embodiment a set of usage expectations are largely unique to both a particular item and to a particular authorized user AU of the item . Usage expectations may be in whole or in part configured programmed into the BIRD by the authorized user AU or may in whole or in part be auto determined by the BIRD during a training or configuration process.

However established user configuration or auto determination the usage expectations are broadly indicative of the usage of an item by a user. IteMetrics are defined as Those aspects of BIRDed item usage and or BIRDed item environment which can be sensed by BIRD sensors during field use and are likely to be or are reasonably capable of being indicative of the identity of an authorized user AU .

In an embodiment an aspect of item usage and or item environment satisfies this definition even if the aspect by itself is not sufficiently distinctive to indicate the identity of the authorized user AU but may be a contributing element with other usage environmental aspects to indicate the identity of the authorized user AU . In an embodiment the identity of the authorized user AU need not be confirmed with certainty a reasonable likelihood of correct user identification is sufficient to satisfy the criteria. In an alternative embodiment a high likelihood of correct user identification may be required to satisfy the criteria.

For purposes of the appended claims the term iteMetrics is synonymous with the phrase identity related sensed data or substantially similar language. In turn the phrase sensed data as used in the preceding sentence should be understood to mean any of i actual data P obtained derived from BIRD sensors ii data P which may be obtained derived from BIRD sensors and iii a description in usage expectations or similar of the data P which may potentially be obtained derived from sensors .

As a first example one aspect of iteMetrics may be item movement which is reflective of how an item moves as it is carried or held by a person or is otherwise On Person .OnP . As a second example another aspect of iteMetric may be the amount or pattern of light exposure for an item as the user takes the item out of pocket and back into pocket during the course of the day.

As a third example another aspect of iteMetrics may be any biological characteristic of the person who possesses the BIRDed item especially if the BIRD associated with the item has means to monitor that biological characteristic. So for example a person s facial appearance or any profile of the person s head may be an iteMetric provided the BIRDed item in typical use is at least sometimes positioned or oriented so that the BIRD s camera .C can obtain a facial image or head profile.

 By contrast the purely structural or physical properties of an item are typically NOT an iteMetric . For example an item s physical dimensions length height width or an item s weight are NOT iteMetrics . An exception may be if the item s physical dimensions can actually be altered through user action on the item or through user interaction with the item. Note however that iteMetrics are defined as aiding the BIRD in identifying the authorized user AU who has or most recently possessed the item . As a distinct function a BIRD may also be designed or configured to identify and or validate that it is tethered to coupled with the correct item . For purposes of item identification validation structural or physical properties of the BIRD may be relevant. See for example and associated discussion and other figures and discussion throughout this document. Note also that internal operations of the item may be an element of iteMetrics if those internal operations can be modified by the authorized user AU during normal field use of the item. See the discussion of active item .Act in and elsewhere throughout this document. 

As discussed further below iteMetrics tend to be separate from biometrics . Biometric user authentication elements are typically indicative of biological user qualities which require directed deliberate input by a user such as entering a user name and password pressing a finger against a fingerprint scanner or orienting an optical scanner towards the user s eyes. In contrast IteMetrics are typically indicative of user attributes which can be detected passively by a BIRD and when the authorized user AU is more or less ignoring the BIRDed item such as a user s walking gait or a user s tendency to pick up or put down an item .

However some biometrics and iteMetrics can overlap. For example a user may deliberately speak into a BIRD to provide a voice print authentication as part of a user BIRD login process. However in routine use a BIRDed item may also monitor ambient sounds and in the process may monitor for among other things the sound of the authorized user s voice. Similarly a facial image of the user may be used both for biometric authentication of the authorized user AU and for iteMetric determination that the item is still with the authorized user AU .

In an embodiment iteMetrics may in turn be divided into two categories morphIteMetrics and psyIteMetrics.

MorphIteMetrics are data or indicators which can be extracted from BIRD sensor data and which are processed data indicators P of physical or biological characteristics of an authorized user AU . The term morphIteMetrics is short for Morphology Item Metrics since these iteMetrics are based on user morphology. Examples of morphIteMetrics may include for example and without limitation 

The subset of morphIteMetrics which are based on user motion gait hand or arm movements etc. may be referred to as kinIteMetrics for kinetic iteMetrics . The subset of morphIteMetrics which are based on other anatomical or physiological features facial structure fingerprints voice prints iris structure pulse respiration etc. may be referred to as anIteMetrics for anatomical iteMetrics or even more specifically for some elements as metIteMetrics for metabolic iteMetrics . This document however will generally refer broadly to morphIteMetrics.

For a given user some measures of iteMetrics may have a substantial range of variation. For example the pace frequency or stride length of a user s gait can vary. However in an embodiment a BIRD is configured to identify qualities which may remain substantially the same over time. For example while stride length or frequency may vary a user s average stride length or frequency may be substantially predictable over a sufficiently extended period of time. More generally suitable signal processing protocols and statistical metrics may be devised to extract reasonably reliable signature s of a particular user s morphIteMetrics.

PsyIteMetrics are data or indicators which can be extracted from BIRD sensor readings and which are indicators of an authorized user s habitual tendencies with respect to an item . The term psyIteMetrics is short for Psychological Item Metrics. Examples of psyIteMetrics may include for example and without limitation 

Much of this item sensor data can be characterized through a variety of different statistical profiling measures all of which may be indicative of a user s tendency to use an item in certain ways. Sensor data used as a basis for determining these derived psyIteMetrics may include location motion light sound and temperature sensing as well as possibly other sensor data .

PsyIteMetrics for a BIRDed item may also vary depending on the usage context. For example a user may keep an item in pocket most of the time while at home while the same item may be frequently out of pocket and in hand in the work place. These psyIteMetrics may be identified during a configuration process or training period for an item as discussed further below.

It will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant arts that in general different degrees of precision may be assigned to different types of morphIteMetrics and to different types of psyIteMetrics . Data processing by the BIRD which draws on a multiplicity of morphIteMetrics and psyIteMetrics will generally result in more reliable indicators of whether a current item user is or is not an authorized user AU of an item .

It will also be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant arts that in relative terms it may take a shorter amount of time for a BIRD to obtain reliable readings for morphIteMetrics for example a few seconds to a few minutes for a person s walking characteristics compared to relatively longer periods of time for a BIRD to obtain reliable readings for many psyIteMetrics .

During configuration a BIRD is configured with appropriate biometrics or other login signatures associated with the authorized user AU .

In normal extant . non anomalous use a BIRD and its associated item will have an authorized user AU who has most recently identified itself to the BIRD via biometrics or via routine login user name password etc. . If the BIRDed item is On Person .OnP current iteMetrics will be indicative of a certain usage of the item which will preferably reflect a likelihood that the item is currently on the person of the authorized user AU . If the BIRDed item is off person .OffP it is resting on a table or in storage etc. the general iteMetric usage particularly the psyIteMetrics will preferably be consistent with the usage expected of the item for the authorized user AU and the most recent morphIteMetrics will be indicative that the item was in control of the authorized user AU .

In other words under normal conditions the user authentication established via biometrics and the sensed identify established via iteMetrics should be consistent with the same authorized user AU . Any disparity suggests a possibility of a displaced . or anomalous . state of the item as discussed further throughout this document.

The user authentication identification schemas discussed above and presented in are exemplary only. Additional and alternative user authentication identification means methods and schemas may also be employed consistent with the present teachings system and method. In general and in an embodiment a BIRD may employ input means sensors sensors data and processor to 

 i authenticate an authorized user AU through active user input and interaction for authentication purposes 

 ii to maintain substantially real time on going identification of the authorized user AU as long as the BIRDed item is on the person off or in appropriate proximity to the user 

 iii to maintain in memory the most recent authentications and identifications even if the BIRDcd item is no longer in proximity to the user and

 iv to compare the on going identification of the current user or most recent user against the identity of the most recently authorized authenticated user to determine whether or not the two are the same.

In an embodiment a BIRDed item is configured to self assess if it is in a state of being extant . or is instead in an item state of being displaced . . As discussed above and discussed in greater detail in conjunction with figures throughout this document in an embodiment such self assessment is based on a comparison by the BIRD between usage data .U and usage expectations .

In an embodiment in comparing usage data .U with usage expectations BIRD logic may rely in whole or in part on a determination of Item statuses . An item status is a determination of some particular condition of the BIRDed item in relation to its environment . For example an item s condition of being on person .OnP or off person .OffP may be one status of the item. Similarly the item being in one condition of motion from among user movement .UM stationary .StaT or stagnant .StG may be an item status . AWOL status yes or no is yet another status . An item s location as being at a home base .HB in a particular zone .Z being in a daily life location .DL or out of bounds .OoB may be yet another applicable status determination . An item s association with an authorized user AU or unauthorized user UU is another status determination .

Other statuses may be envisioned as well including for example and without limitation whether an item is or is not subject to an expected temperature range whether the item is or is not subject to an expected level or pattern of light exposure whether the item is or is not subject to an expected level or pattern of sound exposure and so on.

Item statuses may also be indicative of internal item operating conditions especially for active items .Act typically processor based items discussed further below in this document. For example an active item .Act may have an on off status a status of being logged into a network or not logged into a network a status associated with linking to expected network IP addresses or not and so forth.

Informally an item status may be thought of as some kind of fairly particular well defined condition in which the item is or has been for some time such as carried on person or not in personal motion .M or not with a particular person or not. The term status is used in this document for such determinations to distinguish from conditions as a term that is generally applied to the environment. So this document refers to environmental conditions meaning the environment surrounding or impacting upon the item and to item statuses as indicative of a relationship between the item and its environment .

It will be noted that in some instances more than one item status may apply and or one item status may encompass another. For example an item may be in a daily life location .DL and also be within a home base location .HB within the daily life location .DL . Similarly an item which is stagnant .StG is also stationary .Stat . In an embodiment it may be the more limited or localized status which is indicative reflective or determinative of an item s condition as extant . or displaced . . For example a BIRDed item which is stagnant .StG is more likely to self assess as displaced . than if the same BIRDed item is merely stationary .StaT but not stagnant .StG .

In an embodiment personal motion status and on person off person status may be combined into a single integrated personal motion status . In such an embodiment a personal motion status value of user movement .UM is also indicative of a status of on person .OnP . Similarly in such an embodiment a personal motion status of either stationary .StaT or stagnant .StG are both indicative of a status of off person .OffP .

In an embodiment a BIRD may rely on several general statuses of an item to determine item states such as if the item is extant . on the one hand or lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen on the other hand. is a data flow diagram illustrating the evolution from raw sensor data to item status data to item states as the BIRD of a BIRDed item self assesses the item state.

State self assessment begins with on going real time collection of raw sensor data which may include for example and without limitation location data motion data light data image data sound intensity data sound quality data temperature data environmental chemical data moisture and humidity data pressure data and other forms of data as well. Collection of sensor data by BIRD sensors is discussed in association with figures throughout this document.

Raw sensor data is analyzed by the BIRD s processor to generate processed sensor data .P . Processed sensor data .P may include various forms of derived data which may include for example and without limitation statistical values maximum and minimum values trend detections pattern analysis correlations threshold crossings identifications of environmental entities waveform construction and analysis and various determinations of iteMetrics . For further discussion see for example A B A A and other figures throughout this document.

In an embodiment specific item statuses may be arrived at by comparing specific elements of usage data .U against corresponding specific elements of usage expectations . In an alternative embodiment specific item statuses may be arrived at by comparing specific elements of usage data .U against general item usage parameters which may be elements of or partial elements of usage expectations . In an alternative embodiment specific item statuses may be arrived at by direct extraction of specific values or ranges of values from usage data .U .

Several exemplary item statuses have already been discussed above see and are discussed further below as well see for example L A G A C D G B and other figures throughout this document . Item statuses may include for example and without limitation AWOL status on person off person status motion statuses location status which may entail characterization of the location as home based .HB daily life .DL out of bounds .OoB travel routes .CR and or zones .Z or similar characterizations and item association with an authorized user AU or unauthorized user UU based on iteMetrics .

Other statuses may be envisioned as well for example based on comparisons between for example and without limitation actual light conditions and expected light conditions actual ambient sound conditions and expected ambient sound conditions actual ambient temperatures and expected ambient temperatures actual atmospheric conditions and expected atmospheric conditions actual item use and expected item use actual item internal operations states and expected item internal operations states.

In an embodiment some or all item status determinations are expressed in terms of a single outcome from among several possible discrete outcomes AWOL or not AWOL on person off person personal motion stationary stagnant authorized user AU or unauthorized user UU and so on . In an alternative embodiment multiple outcomes may be applicable but the outcomes may be prioritized in terms of significance for example an item which is stagnant .StG is also stationary .StaT but the stagnant status .StG will generally be prioritized.

In an alternative embodiment some or all item status determinations may be expressed in terms of weighted likelihoods or probabilities of several possible discrete outcomes from among a set of possible discrete outcomes. In an alternative embodiment some or all item status determinations may be expressed in terms of a specific numeric value or ranges of values indicative of probabilities likelihoods correlations degrees of pattern matching or other factors with continuous ranges or valuations.

In an embodiment BIRD logic may rely upon the outcome of a single category of item status assessment in order to assess the current item state . In an alternative embodiment BIRD logic may rely upon the outcome of multiple different categories of item statuses in order to assess the current item state . Flow charts of exemplary methods of BIRD logic as well as exemplary tables of BIRD logic .T are presented in conjunction with E E F H below. BIRD logic is discussed in conjunction with other figures throughout this document as well.

Exemplary resulting item states are discussed immediately below as well as in conjunction with other figures throughout this document.

If a BIRDed item is able to make the self assessment of being extant . or especially displaced . before the authorized user AU notices a possible problem then the BIRD can signal or notify the authorized user AU that the item is displaced . . In an embodiment a confirmation that an item is extant . is typically not required. 

In the discussion immediately below item states both extant . and displaced . are characterized both in terms of 

 ii a likely or typical mental state of the authorized user AU in relation to the item for example an item is lost or misplaced if the user does not know where the item is located .

Note that objective environmental conditions associated with extant . and displaced . states are discussed further below in this document in conjunction with and other figures throughout this document.

Of course A BIRD cannot detect and identify the purely mental states of an authorized user AU . However a BIRD associated with an item is configured to identify objective item statuses including possibly internal item statuses for active items .Act which likely indicate that the item as a whole is in some extant state . or displaced state . lost misplaced stolen misappropriated wandering . In turn the displaced states . are likely to be associated with and very likely induce certain distinctive and typically negative mental states in the authorized user AU . The sooner an item is restored to an extant . state the more likely that the authorized user AU is restored to a more positive state of mind.

The systems and methods taught in this document pertain in part to the identification of the external and internal environmental item conditions which enable a BIRD to self assess based on those conditions certain associated item states . However as an aid to understanding the likely colloquial statements of associated human mental states reflective of or responsive to human knowledge of various item states are included below as well.

Put another way if an item is extant . the item is present or in place or located or in use where it would be expected to be present placed or located or in use at a given time.

Put another way an extant item is in an environment or subject to an environment consistent with the environment it is expected to be in or expected to be subject to at a given time. In field use this typically means the item is with the authorized user AU when the authorized user AU expects to have the item in hand on person .OnP or in close proximity.

An item s possible state of being extant . on the one hand and the possible displaced states . of being lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. stolen .. or wandering .. are mutually exclusive states. It is a purpose of a BIRD to determine with a useful degree of reliability the probability that an item is extant . on the one hand or displaced . or otherwise in an anomalous . state on the other hand.

The term extant may refer both to an item being with a primary authorized user AU and also to the item being with an authorized secondary user or borrower discussed immediately below . Where a specific distinction of the primary authorized user AU is intended the state may be referred to as extant primary user .. . 

 Another possible English term for extant might be present. That is an extant item is present when and where it s expected to be and or present with an appropriate user. Because the term present is used in other ways and in other contexts throughout this document the term extant was chosen to avoid ambiguities. 

Lost .. An item whose whereabouts are unknown which is not in possession of an authorized user AU and is generally not anywhere within any of its expected localized usage or storage locations .L also referred to as home base locations .HB see below . The user may have left or dropped the item just about anywhere and in fact the item is sitting someplace which is nowhere near where it s supposed to be. I don t know where it is and I sure hope I didn t leave it at the restaurant . . . or the bowling alley . . . or on the bus . . . 

Misplaced .. An item whose whereabouts are unknown and which is not in possession of an authorized user AU but which is somewhere within any of its standard localized usage or storage locations a home base location .HB . For example the item is around the home or office or other expected place but the user has forgotten where. I don t know where it is but I m sure I left it around the house someplace. 

Misappropriated .. An item in possession of an unauthorized users UU but typically a user who is known to the authorized user AU and who has obtained the item without ill intent. For example someone else perhaps family friend or a co worker picked up the item likely by accident. Did my husband take my keys again 

Stolen .. An item in possession of an unauthorized person typically though not always a person who is unknown to the authorized user AU and who has obtained the item with deliberate illicit intent. Stolen generally means the same thing as criminal theft of the item. An example is an item taken by a total stranger for purposes of unauthorized use sale of the item etc. Hey where is my wallet oh no that guy who bumped into me on the elevator . . . 

Wandering .. An item in possession of an authorized user AU but being carried about at a time or at a place where the authorized user AU should not have it. An example is an item normally meant to be used and stored in some institutional setting a work location for example which the user has accidentally carried outside the setting for example the user has taken the item home . Daddy were you supposed to bring this thing home . . . . This thing the one with the funny picture and the letters that say R A D I O A C T I V E . . . 

Generally and in an embodiment the displaced item states . characterized above are mutually exclusive. However in an alternative embodiment some displaced item states . may be mutually coexistent. For example for an item which may be subject to shared use by two or more co workers the same item at one and the same time may be identified as being misplaced .. with respect to a first authorized user AU who wants to use the item now on the job while being identified as being wandering .. with respect to a second authorized user AU who has taken the item home by accident. The BIRD associated with the item may be configured to detect both states and to alert both authorized users AU appropriately.

The item states listed above extant . borrowed .. lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen cover some exemplary possible usage states for an item but the list is not exhaustive. Another state is discussed below as well In Transit. Other item states may be characterized as well and such other states may be identified by systems and methods within the scope of the present teachings.

In an embodiment a BIRD is specifically configured to discriminate among different states of item displacement . that is to distinguish between an item being lost .. being misplaced .. being stolen .. being misappropriated .. wandering .. etc. In an embodiment BIRD song is configured to provide different types and levels of messages and local signals as well as other possible responses depending on the type of item displacement . which it identifies.

An authorized owner or user of an item may himself herself become lost as in traveling into an unknown location or taking a mistaken route while on a trip. However this is typically not the intended meaning of lost as used in this document. Lost as used in this document typically refer to the state or condition of an item in relation to an authorized owner or user. So if an authorized user AU take a wrong turn on a road trip but still has their keys .K and wallet .W with them then the owner may be lost but the keys and wallet per se are not lost.

In an embodiment an authorized owner may configure a BIRD to expect an item to travel a certain route at a certain time. There are at least two possible signaling scenarios which may ensue 

 i If the authorized user AU loses the item the BIRD may determine that the item is not along the expected route and is not traveling with the user at the expected time the BIRD may then initiate a signal that the item is lost .. .

 ii The user may retain possession of the item but the user himself herself becomes lost for example taking a mistaken route while in the car . The item per se is not actually lost since the authorized user AU has it in hand. However since the authorized user AU is driving on the wrong road the item itself is not on the expected route at the expected time. As a result the BIRD may still identify the item as being lost .. . The resulting signal from the BIRD to the authorized user AU may still be helpful to the user by alerting him her of being personally lost assuming the user hasn t noticed that already.

As noted above ExD criteria reflect item usage as it might be expressed in plain language by an authorized human owner or user of an item. ExD criteria may also reflect item usage as might be indicated by an authorized user AU via selections of choices readily made via a dialog box on a graphical user interface or similar.

The particular ExD criteria for an item being extant . or in the alternative for being displaced . lost misplaced misappropriated stolen or wandering will vary from one item to another and also from one authorized user AU to another. However some broad ExD criteria are likely to be widely applicable to many items and many authorized users AU providing a general framework for a BIRD s extant displaced analysis. These general criteria may be a partial basis for exemplary designs algorithms for BIRD logic . They can also be helpful both in preconfiguring a BIRD at the factory with default values for usage expectations and in guiding an authorized user AU in configuring a BIRD or fine tuning BIRD configuration with usage expectations .

It will be understood that the exemplary general ExD criteria presented immediately below are by no means exhaustive nor are they definitive. Alternative different or additional criteria may be applicable depending on the particular item particular usage particular authorized user AU or users and particular environmental contexts. presents Table with a partial and abbreviated summary of the generalized ExD criteria discussed here. In conjunction with the ExD criteria exemplary elements of possible associated BIRD logic are presented below as well.

Extant . is a state where the item is where it s supposed to be and or in use by an authorized user AU when expected. If the BIRD does not identify the item as possibly being in a state of being displaced that is the item is not lost .. not misplaced .. not stolen .. not misappropriated .. and not wandering .. then the BIRD generally identifies the item as being extant . .

An item may be identified by its associated BIRD as being extant . if it is within a daily life location .DL including a home base location .HB or along an allowed commuting route .CR the item is in user movement .UM or stationary .StaT but is not stagnant .StaT the item is not AWOL and the item is currently with or most recently with an authorized user AU possibly including a borrower .

ExD criteria which may be defined by an authorized user AU may include for example and without limitation the home base locations .HB and daily life locations .DL the allowed time stationary limit before an item is considered stagnant .StaT in a given detection context and the detection context time ranges which in turn affect BIRD AWOL determinations .

 i the item is in a daily life location .DL but it is not located within a known established home base storage location .HB for the item or possibly not located within an established zone .Z for the item or the item is in an out of bounds location .OoB 

 ii the item shows indications of not being in possession of any person when it should be in possession of some person preferably an authorized user AU typically the item is stagnant .StG and

 iii the most recent user of the item was the authorized user AU . If this last condition is not met the item is more likely misappropriated .. or stolen .. see below. 

More concisely an item may be lost .. if it is stagnant .StG while away from any home base storage location .HB .

For example if the authorized user AU leaves an item behind in a store or restaurant the item is likely to remain in place stationary in a location which may be within the daily life domain .DL but is not a home base storage location .HB . The item is now effectively lost .. .

Overall personal motion .M or lack of personal motion is not the only possible signature or indicator of an item being lost .. . Inappropriate exposure to light and or sound may also be indicators that the item is not in possession of a person when it should be in possession of a person. For example an item which is exposed to light when it should generally be in the user s pocket and so shielded from light may very well be lost .. . Other iteMetrics may be indicators as well. The authorized user AU may characterize ExD criteria which are the basis for iteMetrics and in particular may be the basis for psyIteMetrics which in an embodiment generally reflect the authorized user s habitual or typical usage of an item . The ExD criteria once formalized may be in whole or in part a basis for usage expectations .

Misplaced .. is a state where the item is around the home or office or other expected home base storage location .HB but the user has left the item lying around for longer than the stationary limit that is the item is stagnant .StG or the item is someplace in the wrong zone .Z within the home base .HB . Either condition suggests the user has forgotten where the item is.

Appropriate ExD criteria may include characterizations by the authorized user AU of zones .Z as detection contexts within the home base locations .HB stationary limits for an item within the home base zones .Z and other aspects of expected item usage within the zone bounded detection contexts .

 i it is located within a known established home base location .HB and or storage location .HB for the item but

 ii the item shows indications of not being in possession of any person that is the item is not being carried on person .OnP when it should be in possession of some person preferably an authorized user AU and the off person status .OffP exceeds an allowed time the stationary limit .

 i it is located within a known established home base location .HB and or storage location .HB for the item 

 ii the item is not being carried On Person .OnP at a time when that is considered normal for the item for example in the evening or at night when the authorized user AU and the item are both at home and the item is expected to be off person .OffP for an extended time but . . .

 iii the item is located in an inappropriate zone .Z within the home base .HB for example the item should be stored in the kitchen but the item is instead in the living room or the garage etc. that is the item is AWOL with respect to the zone .Z it should be in.

Another exemplary indicator that an item is misplaced is that the item is present in the home when it should be in the office and so the item is AWOL from the office the item is also most likely stationary .Stat as the authorized user AU is at work and so not carrying or using the item . Possibly the authorized user AU forgot to bring the item to work. 

Motion can also be characterized in terms of personal motion .M probabilities which may be an aspect of psyIteMetrics . In an embodiment an authorized user s ExD criteria may include estimates of the percentage of time he or she is likely to keep an item on person .OnP versus the percentage of time the item is likely to be kept off person .OffP .

Motion or lack of motion is not the only possible signature or indicator of an item being misplaced .. . In an embodiment inappropriate exposure to light and or sound may also be indicators that the item is misplaced .. . Sec for example the discussion of light sensing and possible hiding or coverage by a newspaper or magazine associated with eye glasses .S.G set down on a table or desk in below. By way of ExD criteria an authorized user AU can estimate how likely he or she is to keep an item in pocket or in a purse as opposed to keeping the item out where it is exposed to light.

An item may be misappropriated .. that is inadvertently borrowed by a friend family member or colleague or an item may be stolen .. taken by an unauthorized person with intent to steal .

In many settings such as work or home similar items may be left lying about such as keys .K or cell phones .Act.CP . In a work setting essentially identical items that is items identical in appearance such as certain tools or devices may be left lying about. It is possible for a family member or coworker to inadvertently pick up an item intending to pick up a first item which should be under their control and instead picking up a second different but similar looking item instead. The item which is actually picked up the wrong item for that person has not really been stolen but it has been misappropriated or inadvertently borrowed.

A stolen item of course is one which has been outright deliberately taken by someone who has no business removing the item. A BIRDed item may self identify as possibly being either stolen .. or misappropriated .. if 

 i the item shows indications of being in possession of some person as may be indicated for example by movement of the item detected by BIRD motion sensor .M discussed further below but

 ii the BIRD detects iteMetrics which are not consistent with those normally associated with the use of the item by the authorized user AU .

The BIRD may also self identify the item as possibly being stolen .. or misappropriated .. if the item is stationary .Stat but the iteMetrics associated with the most recent holder or user of the item are not consistent with those associated with the authorized user AU .

In an embodiment a BIRD associated with a single particular item may be configured for different respective iteMetrics associated with different respective users. It may further be expected that a particular user should be using the item at certain times or dates. If the BIRD detects that an authorized user AU is making use of the item but at a time or date when the particular user should not be using the item the BIRD may be configured to still report the item as misappropriated .. .

In additional to user identity criteria other criteria may be employed as well as a basis for a stolen .. or misappropriated .. state. These include location criteria and various item usage criteria. Such criteria as defined by an authorized user AU may be an aspect of the ExD criteria which may be translated by various means discussed further below into usage expectations .

Some items may by user designation be subject to relatively strict expectations that the item remains exclusively within a designated home base or storage location .HB either all the time or at least during certain specific dates or hours . For example some items associated with a workplace are often expected to remain within the workplace and not go home with the employees. An example might be a laptop computer or other PDA personal digital assistant which is carried around in an office or other work setting but is meant only for that setting and nowhere else. Some items are even more restricted and meant to be used only within a designated building or setting or designated rooms within a larger facility. Such specific location boundaries may be established through zones .Z . For such restricted items which are not meant to wander outside of the designated facility or setting there is no daily life location .DL beyond the designated home base s .HB and or designated zone s .Z .

Wandering .. With a restricted item it can happen that an authorized user AU of the restricted item may still inadvertently take the item outside of its allowed location s . Particularly if the restricted item is small enough to carry inside a pocket or even inside a briefcase or purse an authorized user AU of such an item may slip the item into a pocket and wind up carrying it home without even realizing it. Such an item may be said to be improperly removed or wandering .. . Other terms may be employed as well. The authorized user AU is inadvertently carrying the restricted item from the limited home base location s .HB and or zone s .Z where the restricted item is supposed to be.

In an embodiment a BIRD may be configured through the use of suitable algorithms and usage expectations to identify a restricted item which is wandering .. . A restricted BIRDed item may self assess as possibly being wandering .. if 

 iii the item is outside of its home base location s .HB or even outside of a specific zone s .Z within the home base location s .HB .

Typically an authorized user AU or an authorized system administrator will determine if an item should be designated as one which may be wandering .. . Such a determination may be an aspect of the overall ExD criteria for the item .

Borrowers are authorized users AU with limited or restricted control rights for an item such as time and or location limits on usage. A primary authorized user AU may determine which persons if any are authorized to be borrowers of an item . Such determinations are part of the authorized user s ExD criteria . An item which is with a borrower but is otherwise extant is considered to be borrowed .. .

From the standpoint of BIRD sensor determinations both item theft and item misappropriation share significant common characteristics. In both cases the iteMetrics detected by the BIRD are not consistent with those of the authorized user AU . As such it may not always be possible to immediately distinguish the two states with as high a probability level as may be possible with other item state discriminations. In such circumstances a BIRD may be configured to present signals and or messages consistent with a partly ambiguous notification of the item as being either misappropriated .. or stolen .. .

However various contextual analysis and misappropriated vs. stolen MvS heuristics may enable a BIRD to distinguish with varying confidence levels a stolen item from a misappropriated item. Several exemplary MvS heuristics and or contextual analysis tools are described here and are summarized in Table of . It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that these MvS heuristics are exemplary only and other such heuristic or contextual analysis tools may be envisioned within the scope of the present teachings system and method.

A purse snatching or similar snatch and run theft of a BIRDed item directly from an authorized user AU may be distinguished by one or more characteristics including for example and without limitation i an abrupt acceleration of the stolen item as the item is being grabbed ii an abrupt and distinctive change of iteMetrics from those characteristic of the authorized user AU and or iii defined panic movements by the snatching individual such as a fast run rapid changes in direction rapid arm movements including rapid and repeated thrusting of arms or raising and lower of arms characteristic of a run. If a BIRD detects based on these and similar heuristics that it and its associated item may have been snatched the BIRD may be configured to emit loud and distinctive alerts of its stolen state .. . This may enable others in the vicinity of the BIRDed item both law enforcement and good Samaritan bystanders to intercept and thwart the purse snatcher.

It should be noted that if a BIRDed item is a member of an item team discussed further below see then purse snatching may also be detected in whole or in part by abrupt removal of the item from the vicinity of the item team .

A pick pocket episode the removal of an item by a thief from the pocket or purse of an authorized user AU may be distinguished by one or more characteristics including for example and without limitation i prior identification of the item as being in pocket as indicated by a combination of motion sensing and possibly other sensing for example surface pressure sensing on the item substantially zero illumination on the item muffled sound detection etc followed by ii detection of removal of the item from the pocket iii immediately following a sudden change in iteMetrics such as the user s gait characteristics iv near immediate placement of the item back in a pocket or other enclosure but possibly with different pocket characteristics for example a different amount of surface pressure or different level of reduced illumination .

Other possibly more subtle heuristics may be employed as well. For example if an authorized user AU removes an item from a pocket he or she may well elevate the item close to chest or face level for usage a thief however may immediately slip the item back into a waist level pocket. More generally the BIRD may be programmed with characteristic movements associated with pick pocket activity based on motion studies conducted with the assistance of experienced pick pockets in order to identify those motions associated with pick pocketing.

Here again if a BIRD detects that it and its associated item may have been pick pocketed the BIRDed item may be configured to emit loud and distinctive alerts of its stolen state .. . If an item is a member of an item team discussed further below see then pick pocketing may also be detected in whole or in part by a removal of the item from the vicinity of the item team at a pace which is slower than that for a purse snatching.

In an embodiment a BIRD is configured with iteMetrics for an authorized user AU . In an embodiment a BIRD may also be configured with data indicative of some iteMetrics for some known associates of the authorized user AU .

For example consider an item which is commonly taken home and stored at home. A BIRD associated with the item may be configured to store data for iteMetrics of other family members who live at the same home. Or consider an item which is commonly used at the workplace and stored at the workplace. A BIRD associated with the latter item may be configured to store data for iteMetrics of colleagues in the same workplace. The selected stored iteMetrics may be those which pertain to the walking gait and typical arm movements of the various users that is morphIteMetrics . Other user iteMetrics may be employed as well.

In operation if the BIRD detects iteMetrics which are i other than those of the authorized user AU but ii are associated with a known associate the BIRD may be configured to flag the item as being misappropriated .. .

If the BIRD detects iteMetrics which are i other than those of the authorized user AU and further ii are not associated with a known associate the BIRD may be configured to flag the item as being stolen .. .

If an item is inadvertently taken by an associate colleague family member friend of an authorized user AU it is likely the unauthorized possessor will eventually notice they have an item they should not have. A thief on the other hand has deliberately taken an item that does not belong to the thief. Therefore the longer an item is with an unauthorized users UU the more likely it is that the item was stolen rather than misappropriated. A BIRD may be configured so that upon initial determination that an item may be misappropriated .. or stolen .. the BIRD will assign a higher probability or weighting to the item being misappropriated .. . After a longer time the BIRD may be configured to assign a higher probability or weighting to the item being stolen .. .

Similarly there is at least some general probability that a known associate of an authorized user AU will tend to share roughly the same geographic daily life space .DL as the authorized user AU . On the other hand a thief may tend to inhabit any geographic area which may or may not be generally the same as that of the authorized user AU . Therefore the further an item is displaced . from the daily life areas .DL of the authorized user AU the greater the likelihood that the item is stolen .. . If an item is at or in transit within a location that the item is never found at this indicates a higher likelihood that the item has been stolen .. . Implementing this embodiment may entail configuring the BIRD to maintain an internal database of actual locations .L where the item has been used occasionally in the past even in the out of bounds .OoB locations .OoB .

It will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant arts that a variety of heuristics and rules of thumb may be employed and combined in various logical and probabilistic ways to arrive at some general determination as to whether an item is misappropriated .. on the one hand or on the other hand has been stolen .. .

If an item is outside of any preferred storage location usage location or transit shopping recreational location that is the item is out of bounds .OoB this may also be indicative of the item being stolen as well. However since users will sometimes travel outside of preferred storage usage transit locations .L travel outside of such locations .L should not necessarily trigger a stolen state. BIRD configuration options enable users to determine such factors as how long an item must be out of bounds .OoB before a stolen state .. is determined and also to what extent other usage factors in addition to location determine that the item may be stolen .. or is still considered extant .. .

Certain iteMetrics for example those pertaining to user gait and other movements may tend to be indicative of the age of a person for example either that the person is a child or is elderly. Consider an item which is normally in possession of a teenager or adult of middle years. If iteMetrics indicate that an item is in possession of either a child or elderly person this may be more likely to be consistent with misappropriation than with deliberate theft .. .

Active items .Act inherently have processing capabilities and possibly sensors. Active items .Act may include cell phones PDAs and personal computers see and other figures throughout this document. Active items .Act may have particularly distinctive signatures of use such as the call phone numbers called the locations of cell phone numbers called types of web sites visited or even types of games played on a device and so on. IteMetrics may be devised which analyze the usage of an active item .Act to determine general usage characteristics by the authorized user AU . Once the active item .Act has been misappropriated .. or stolen .. if the subsequent iteMetrics are even partially consistent with that of an authorized user AU this increases a possibility that the item has been misappropriated .. while iteMetrics that are wholly inconsistent with an authorized user AU indicates an increased possibility of theft .. .

Certain geographic areas may be associated with higher crime rates if an item was transferred from an authorized user AU to an unauthorized users UU in such a high crime area this may contribute to an assessment that the item may have been stolen .. . If the item transfer from authorized user AU to unauthorized users UU occurred in a social context with a very high density of persons as may be determined for example by BIRD visual or sound analysis this may suggest an environment conducive to activity by a pick pocket. Alternatively if the item transfer occurred in an environment of very low people density and also darkness for example an isolated street at night this may also suggest a possibility of a mugging or theft. In the latter case a mugging victim who is left unconscious may benefit from an automated alert by the BIRD to police of the possibility of a personal attack. 

In an embodiment a combination of the item not being in use as expected and also the item not being subject to expected environmental conditions may be a stronger indicator of the item being stolen than either unexpected usage or unexpected environment alone. More generally a combination of heuristics possibly weighted as to importance may be a more reliable indicator of stealing vs. misappropriation than any one heuristic by itself.

These MvS heuristics and similar ones may be integrated into either or both of general BIRD logic or item user specific usage expectations both discussed further below.

In an embodiment a BIRDed item may have multiple authorized users AU who all have equal levels of authorization for control and use of the item . In an alternative embodiment a BIRDed item may have one or more authorized users AU who have primary and or maximum authorization for control or use of the item and the BIRDed item may also have one or more classes of authorized users AU with lesser or reduced authorizations for use or control of the item . In an embodiment a BIRD may be configured to recognize multiple different users. The BIRD may also be configured to store multiple different user specific usage expectations reflective of both different usage patterns and or different control levels for various users.

In an embodiment a BIRD may be configured with two or more classes or categories of usage expectations with the classes being applicable to different users. For example different categories of usage expectations may define different geographic areas .L home base locations .HB daily life locations .DL out of bounds .OoB and zones .Z of varying scopes these usage expectations may be assigned as appropriate to different authorized users AU .

In an embodiment a BIRD may have at least two categories of authorized users AU among them being i owners lenders primary authorized users AU and ii borrowers.

An owner may understood in the conventional sense as a person or persons who purchased the item associated with the BIRD or a person who received substantially enduring lawfully recognized possession and control of the item through some transaction other than a purchase for example receiving the item as a gift . In a corporate or organizational context an item and associated BIRD may have an authorized administrator who functions in proxy for the corporate owners. In the present context an owner may also be considered to be a lender who may lend the item to a borrower. The owner of an item or any person who can authorize the lending of the item may also be referred to as a primary authorized user AU .

A borrower may also be understood in the conventional sense as a person or persons who have received from a primary authorized user AU lender or owner a limited right to possess and control an item . The possession and control of the item is typically limited by agreement or conventional understandings which may be reinforced via the associated BIRD . For example the limited right s of a borrower may extend for a limited period of time and or may entail other limits such as on the types of uses to which the item may be put the locations .L to which the item is allowed or authorized to be taken etc. In organizational or business contexts a borrower may be an employee a lessee an item renter and so on. Borrowers of an item may also be considered to be secondary authorized users AU or temporary authorized users AU .

In an embodiment an owner lender primary authorized user AU of an item may have access to BIRD operations which enable or authorize the lending of the associated item . These operations may include authorizing configuration of the BIRD for use by the borrower using for example the exemplary configuration methods listed below and setting limits on the use of the borrowed item by setting custom borrower associated usage expectations for the BIRD . For example the lender may be able to limit the time period during which the BIRD will consider the borrower to be a valid user or the lender may limit the geographic areas into which the borrower may take the item . Other limitations may be envisioned as well.

A BIRD may be configured to permit use and control of its associated item by a borrower. presents Table which summarizes several exemplary methods of BIRD configuration for use by a borrower which are also discussed immediately below.

In an embodiment an authorized user AU lender of the BIRDed item specifically configures the BIRD with suitable usage expectations for the borrower. This may be accomplished in any of several ways. Usage expectations for a borrower may be transferred from a first BIRD .Borrower s principally associated with an item .Borrower s belonging to the borrower to a second BIRD .Lender s associated with a second item .Lender s belonging to the lender.

Data transfer of usage expectations may be accomplished via various means and methods discussed further throughout this document. One method for example would be to upload the usage expectations from one BIRD to another via a configuration computer . In an embodiment direct data transfer between two BIRDS may also be accomplished via wired or wireless means. See for example panel C above and below. 

In an embodiment the first item belonging to the borrower may be of a very similar type to the second item belonging to the lender. For example the lender may be lending a tennis racket .R to the borrower. The borrower may already have a tennis racquet of her own. In this case usage expectations associated with the borrower s tennis racquet may be programmed into a BIRD associated with the lender s tennis racquet. These same item or similar item usage expectations may therefore provide a substantially complete and accurate picture of how the borrowed item will be used by the borrower. In particular both morphIteMetrics and psyIteMetrics copied from the borrower s own tennis racquet may be suitable for a different borrowed tennis racquet.

In an alternative embodiment the first item belonging to the borrower may be of a substantially different type than the second item belonging to the lender. For example the lender may again be lending a tennis racket .R to the borrower. However the borrower s usage expectations which will be copied to a BIRD associated with the borrowed tennis racquet .R may be taken from a BIRD associated with the borrower s wallet .W . These different item usage expectations may provide only a partial picture of how the borrowed item .R will be used by the borrower. For example Elements of the borrower s morphIteMetrics which pertain to how the borrower generally walks may be applicable to both a wallet .W and a tennis racquet .R . However elements of the morphIteMetrics which pertain to how the borrower would move on a tennis court may not be applicable either the borrower may never carry her wallet .W On Person .OnP on the tennis court or the borrower would keep her wallet .W in a pocket while on the tennis court but not keep her wallet in hand. Similarly some elements of psyIteMetrics may be applicable in transfer from a wallet to a tennis racquet while others may not.

In an embodiment when a lender configures a BIRD .Lender s with transferred usage expectations which are taken from a BIRD .Borrower s owned by the borrower the lender indicates which elements of the borrower s usage expectations are applicable.

In an embodiment a borrowed item may be configured by the borrower to recognize the borrower s iteMetrics . The configuration by the borrower is done via a training session using methods substantially the same or similar as those employed to train the BIRD for normal use by a primary authorized user AU . In an embodiment the BIRD .Lender s must first receive authorization from an authorized primary user before permitting a borrower to train the BIRD .Lender s for the borrower s iteMetrics. See A B D I and other figures throughout this document for a discussion of BIRD training sessions.

In an embodiment a lender may elect to authorize an item .Lender s for generic borrowing. This may occur for example in a home base context such as a person s home or a place of employment or similar. When an item .Lender s is to be available for generic borrowing the associated BIRD .Lender s is configured so that any person may use the item .Lender s but most likely with various limitations on the usage. For example a BIRD .Lender s may be configured so that any person may use its associated item .Lender s but only within a limited geographic range of a central location. Or for another example the BIRD .Lender s may be configured so that any person may use its associated item .Lender s but only for a limited period of time in an embodiment the time clock or count down on the limited usage would commence when the BIRD .Lender s detects via iteMetrics that a user other than the primary authorized user AU has put the item .Lender s into use.

In an embodiment a lender may elect to authorize an item .Lender s for generic borrowing similar to that discussed above but only for a limited class of users. In this application the BIRD .Lender s associated with the item may be configured similarly to the configuration described immediately above but with additional limitations based on iteMetrics . For example in home use a BIRD .Lender s may be configured so that an item .Lender s may be borrowed by adults or teens but not children if the BIRD .Lender s detects iteMetrics such as motion signatures indicative of the item .Lender s being in possession of a child the BIRD .Lender s may signal that the item is misappropriated .. rather than borrowed .. .

In embodiment the class of allowed borrowers configured into the BIRD .Lender s may be identified based on the iteMetrics of the associated item . In an alternative embodiment the class of allowed borrowers may be identified based on supplemental signatures such as active electronic magnetic etc. organizational identification ID cards or other ID technologies which may be possessed by authorized borrowers. In an embodiment a BIRD .Lendcr s may be suitably designed and configured to receive and recognize signals from such identification technologies.

It should also be noted that not all embodiments are listed in the table. For example lender s items .Lender s a lender s BIRD .Lender s a borrower s item .Borrower s and a borrower s BIRD .Borrower s all discussed above in conjunction with FIG. N are not listed in the table for FIG. O .

It should also be noted that an element of the present system and method may often be understood in terms of more than one embodiment. For example a particular item such as a briefcase . B may be understood as one or more of 

The labeling applied to the briefcase .B in any given context within this document will depend on the primary role or function in which the briefcase is being described in that context. Similar considerations apply to other elements discussed throughout this document. For example a cell phone may be labeled as when being described in its use and capacity as a phone to receive voice messages text messages or similar data or as a phone used to control or configure other BIRDed items .Act.CP when being described in terms of its structure or function as an active item .Act .FFP in its capacity as a BIRDed item which is free from a person .IT in its capacity as an item team member and so forth.

Introduced above in conjunction with were detection contexts . See also B B C and other figures below for additional discussion of detection contexts . Generally and for many common items in common use it may be expected that item usage by an authorized user will vary significantly at different times of day or different days of the week or based on different locations or based on other contextual factors. For example an item which is in use during the day but in storage at night is obviously subject to completely different uses during those two different time frames.

Expected item usage is reflected in usage expectations discussed throughout this document. The purpose of a detection context is to characterize a time frame milieu setting circumstance or surrounding in which item usage is likely to be broadly consistent or to have broadly consistent patterns.

The broadly consistent item usage or similarly broadly consistent patterns of item environment are captured by one or more sets of usage expectations . In an embodiment and within a given detection context a BIRD will generally have one or more associated sets of usage expectations . The usage expectations contain parameters indicative of various specific aspects of expected usage of an item or expected item environment. The combination of a detection context and the associated usage expectations provide the BIRD with a basis to compare actual usage data .U against how an item is anticipated to be used. The details of defining detection contexts and usage expectations and methods for real time comparison of usage data .U against usage expectations are discussed throughout this document.

In step . of the method the BIRD makes an environmental assessment identifying the environmental values necessary to select the appropriate detection context among several already defined detection contexts . For example if the detection contexts are defined strictly in terms of detection context time ranges the BIRD will assess the current time .T .

In step . and based on for example the current time .T the BIRD will ascertain the appropriate detection context . Suppose for example one detection context has been assigned for daytime hours and another detection context for night hours. If the current time .T is during the day for example 0900 hours the BIRD identifies and loads the daytime detection context .

In an embodiment the detection context has been configured to contain a listing of associated usage expectations or sets of usage expectations . In step . the BIRD loads into working memory .M.D the appropriate usage expectations or sets of usage expectations .

In step . the BIRD proceeds with routine field use that is monitoring and assessment of the environment as per exemplary methods discussed in association with A D A H E B E and numerous other figures throughout this document.

Broadly stated a detection context identifies or characterizes a setting or domain within which a BIRD will engage in detection of the environment which impinges on the BIRDed item . In many instances it may be natural and practical to parameterize one or more detection contexts as initially done above primarily in terms of a time range with several different detection contexts spanning the full time when the item might be in use or in storage. In such embodiments expected locations .L may be specified exclusively in the associated usage expectations .

For example it may be the case that item usage will vary significantly at night when the authorized user may be at home and sleeping as compared to daytime usage. In such cases at least two detection contexts may be defined one for daytime hours and one for nighttime hours. Suitable separate sets of usage expectations may then be defined and associated respectively with the daytime detection context and the nighttime detection context .

In an alternative embodiment a detection context may specify a combination of i an expected time range when a BIRDed item will be in some kind of use or storage and ii one or more associated expected location s .L for the use or storage. The expected location s .L may be fairly localized for example a home base location .HB or a zone .Z within a home base or it may be a broader geographically larger daily life area .DL .

In an alternative embodiment a detection context may be specified strictly in terms of expected locations .L with associated time frames if any be an element of the usage expectations to be associated with the detection context .

However in alternative embodiments a BIRD may use more fewer or different parameters to characterize the overall context in which environmental detection takes place.

In an embodiment a BIRD may be configured with two or more detection contexts some of which are subsets of others. For example the authorized user AU may specify default detection contexts which refer only to time for example specific daytime hours or nighttime hours . However the authorized user AU may also specify additional subcontexts which include locations .L . The applicable BIRD logic may then indicate in pseudocode form 

Generally and for many common items in common use it may be expected that item usage by an authorized user will vary significantly at different times of day or different days of the work or based on different locations or based on other contextual factors. However for items and or for some authorized users AU it may be determined that one set of usage expectations is broadly applicable across all time frames and across all locations. In such cases the applicable detection context may essentially be all times all places. An all place all time all contexts detection context may be referred to for convenience as the universal detection context.

As noted above a detection context broadly establishes a domain where item usage is expected to be consistent while usage expectations characterizes expected item usage or expected environment within the domain. In some embodiments of the present system and method there is a possible advantage of segregating detection contexts from usage expectations as logical entities and as software or firmware etc. based data structures 

By defining the usage specification s separately from the detection context s it is possible to mix and match usage expectations with detection contexts as appropriate. For example various different sets of location usage expectations may prove to be applicable in various combinations to different time based detection contexts . For another example different sets of iteMetrics reflecting physiological and or habitual aspects of item usage by an authorized user AU may be applicable in various combinations to different detection contexts . For a particular example of the latter if an item may be used by more than one authorized user AU the BIRD may first determine the detection context and then load particular usage expectations for those user s AU who are authorized for the current detection context . For still another example there may be established separate sets of usage expectations for home environments versus work environments. An authorized user AU may have multiple homes and or multiple work environments. The BIRD may first determine based on detection context determinations if the item is in any of the home environments or any of the office environments the BIRD may then load appropriate usage expectations .

However the distinction between detection contexts and usage expectations is made in part for convenience of exposition and explanation in this document. In various embodiments such distinctions may or may not be reflected in BIRD logic actual algorithms program logic data structures or computer code used to implement the present system and method.

In embodiments it may be the combination of data elements of detection contexts and data elements of usage expectations that provide BIRD logic with the data or parameters against which to compare actual item usage as indicated in field use by usage data .U . In various embodiments of the present system and method elements which may sometimes be an aspect of detection contexts may in other embodiments be aspects of usage expectations . For example in various embodiments of the present system and method expected locations .L may be an element of either detection contexts or usage expectations or both.

More generally in some embodiments of the present system and method elements of what are identified herein as detection contexts and usage expectations may be merged into unitary data structures logic or similar or may instead be spread or divided over more than two data structures or elements. Thus the use of two data structures detection contexts and usage expectations to ascertain or define an expected environment for a BIRDed item is exemplary only and should not be construed as limiting in various embodiments more or fewer data structures may be employed.

Moreover any characterizations in this document of certain data elements or parameters as being part of detection contexts or usage expectations should be construed as exemplary only and should not be construed in any way as limiting.

In and B discussed below as well as in other figures through this document several exemplary BIRD hardware embodiments are presented. The embodiments shown are exemplary only and other hardware embodiments may be envisioned within the scope and spirit of the present teachings systems and method. Throughout this document various method and software embodiments are described in terms of these exemplary BIRD hardware embodiments. After reading the descriptions of these exemplary BIRD hardware embodiments it will become apparent to a person skilled in the relevant art s how to implement the invention using other BIRD systems and or architectures.

In discussion and figures throughout this document a BIRD is generally referred to by the label number employed for example in . It will be understood that most such references may refer to the exemplary BIRD hardware illustrated in but may also refer to other BIRD hardware configurations such as those illustrated in B and other figures throughout this document.

An exemplary internal schematic architecture for a portable item reporting device BIRD is illustrated in .

The BIRD includes one or more processors such as processor . The processor is configured for processing instructions retrieved from memory retrieving data from and storing data to memory retrieving data from other elements and possibly other elements of the BIRD processing the retrieved data based on the instructions performing arithmetic and logical operations on the retrieved data making decisions based on the results of arithmetic and logical operations transmitting control instructions to other elements and possibly other elements of the BIRD and such other processing and operations as may be necessary or useful to coordinate and control the BIRD and to generally implement the teachings system and method described herein. The processor may include specialized modules including for example and without limitation modules for signal processing image processing natural language processing sensor control sensor data correlation parallel data processing neural network processing and other specialized data processing.

The processor is connected to a communication infrastructure e.g. a communications bus cross over bar or internal network referred to for convenience as the bus . The bus enables coordinated activity and data communications by the other internal elements of the BIRD with the processor and possibly directly with each other as may be necessary or useful to implement the teachings system and method described herein.

The BIRD also includes a main memory .M for storing operating instructions operating parameters real time dynamic sensor data R historical data H and processed data P which is generated by applying suitable algorithms to the real time and historical data. The real time and historical data discussed throughout this document is generated in whole or in part by the environmental sensors discussed further below. In an embodiment the main memory .M may be implemented with two or more different types of memory including for example and without limitation 

Persons skilled in the relevant arts will recognize that the types of main memory .M described above and their uses are exemplary only. Alternative or additional types of main memory .M may be employed as well to implement the teachings systems and methods described herein.

In an embodiment time and date data used for various analysis and monitoring purposes is generated by an internal clock timer calendar element . In an alternative embodiment clock timer calendar data may be obtain from other sources such as external time and date feeds received through radio frequency links . For purposes of simplicity any time date calendar data generated by the BIRD or received by the BIRD from such external data sources will also be referred to as the clock timer calendar element .

The environmental sensors are used to gather data about the environment surrounding and or containing the BIRD about the interaction of the BIRD with that environment and about the influence of the surrounding environment on the BIRD . The environment as understood here includes any persons in proximity to the BIRD including but not limited to any person authorized user AU or otherwise who may be in possession of the BIRDed item .

Shown in are a variety of environment sensors which may be employed with the BIRD . It should be understood that not all BIRDs will necessarily employ or embody all sensors . In different embodiments various subsets of the sensors shown may be sufficient to implement the methods described in this document and additional sensors not shown may be employed as well.

While the list below identifies sensors in terms of the environmental data they are configured to detect some sensed environmental phenomena may be determined by the BIRD via the applicable sensor s working in conjunction with the processor . For example voice identification language identification and or speech to text may be accomplished by an audio sensing element such as a microphone .M in conjunctions with the processor . The microphone .M and processor then effectively function in combination as the audio content sensor AC . Similar considerations may apply to sensing and identification of other environmental phenomena such as identification of objects or persons via image analysis camera .C or video camera .V plus processor and so on. In an embodiment however some or all sensing elements may have their own dedicated and integrated microprocessors not shown rendering such sensing elements capable of partial or complete sensor or data analysis independent of the main BIRD processor .

In the discussion below the sensors are listed in the singular. However a BIRD may have more than one sensor of the same type which may for example be positioned in multiple locations on an exterior body of the BIRD for enhanced environmental monitoring.

For convenience in this document an audio intensity sensor .AI and or an audio content sensor .AC may be referred to generically as an audio sensor A . In an embodiment the BIRD s microphone .M may serve as the audio sensor A .

As with the optical sensor .Opt described below an electromagnetic sensor .E may be configured primarily for detection of electromagnetic wave intensity. In an alternative embodiment the electromagnetic sensor .E may be configured for additional electromagnetic wave analysis such as spectrum analysis or polarization analysis. The electromagnetic wave sensor .E may also be configured or configurable for selective sensing at specific frequencies or frequency bands within its overall bandwidth.

In addition even items which are typically not electrical in nature may have sensing elements integrated into them which can provide additional data to the BIRD . For example a hardcopy book .E with an integrated BIRD may have a sensing element designed to determine when the book s cover is opened or closed or even to identify the page to which the book was last opened.

In an alternative embodiment a BIRD may be designed or configured with only local location sensors .L for use with items which are expected to remain within a specific campus or building. For example a BIRD may contain a comprehensive image database for a given building or region. The BIRD may also employ an image sensor .C .V both discussed further above and below and then use the BIRD s processor to compare i real time images of the environment around an item with ii images in the image database. Based on the comparison the processor may make location determinations.

A generalized or geographic location sensor .L may include for example and without limitation sensors integrated into or interacting with the Global Positioning System GPS or similar satellite systems sensors which determine location based on triangulation with cell phone towers sensors which determine location based on dedicated local wireless data streams from buildings or wireless computer networks and sensors which determine location based on interpretation of image data from the surrounding environment .

In an embodiment a BIRD may employ a first separate sensor for determining geographic locations .L such as street locations or building locations and a separate second sensor for more fine grained location determinations such as a particular room .L or even a particular place .L desk table floor location etc. within a particular room. The exact degree of granularity in location determination between the geographic sensor versus the fine grained sensor may vary in different embodiments. In an alternative embodiment a single location sensor .L may be employed to make location determinations at all geographic scales down to and including location measurements specified to within inches or centimeters.

In an embodiment a BIRD may employ only a single form of RF based location sensing such as GPS or cell phone signal cell phone tower based sensing. In an alternative embodiment a BIRD may be capable of more than one more of form of RF based location sensing with a second or third form providing either redundancy or backup. For example if a BIRD is primarily configured for GPS based location determination with a suitable GPS sensor .L the BIRD may employ location sensing based on cell phone tower triangulation as an additional or backup form of location sensing again with a suitable cell phone based sensor .L .

A BIRD will normally obtain location data in conjunction with various RF sources such as GPS systems triangulation with cell phone towers or other RF broadcast sources of location information. A BIRD and its associated item may however be in an environment where such RF sources are blocked for example in a parking garage or inside a building which blocks such RF signals . In an embodiment the BIRD may employ alternative means for making at least approximate location determinations. For example the BIRD may combine i a last known location as determined for example via GPS with ii recent motion data velocity and acceleration from the motion sensor .M in order to calculate a current location.

In an embodiment the BIRD may also have an image database and or sound database stored in memory the images being recorded during a training period or being pre configured at a factory or from some other suitable location image database. The images and sounds may be of locations .L where the BIRD is typically used and may also be images and sounds associated with common environments. For example the BIRD may store images and sounds associated with parking garages restaurants and other well known public environments.

If conventional RF based location information is not available the BIRD may compare currently obtained images and sounds with the stored images and sounds. By making a match between current and stored images sounds the BIRD may be able to identify at least a type of environment to which it is exposed for example a parking garage a restaurant etc. . If the BIRDed item is lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. or stolen .. then by transmitting such an identification to an authorized user AU the BIRDcd item may assist the user in identifying the item s current location. For example the authorized user AU may know of a restaurant or parking garage that he or she recently visited and can investigate if the lost misplaced item is in that location. 

In an embodiment the BIRD may be configured to identify well known public corporate icons indicative of certain commercial establishments brands on nearby cars etc. Such identifications may further contribute to assisting an authorized user AU in determining the location of an item which is lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. or stolen .. .

 Motion For purposes of this document and unless context clearly indicates an actual time change of position the phrases motion of an item or state of item motion or similar terms and phrases refer not only to actual movement time changes in position but also to states where the item may not be subject to any movement at all either with respect to the general environment the room a building the earth with respect to a person who possesses the item or is in proximity to the item or both . Similarly for purposes of this document and unless context clearly indicates a preferred meaning the motion of a person or a person s movement refers to any of when the person is engaged in motion time changes in position when a person is engaged in movements in place while standing seated or lying down and to when a person may be completely without motion.

 Stationary items vs. Motionless items An item is considered stationary .Stat when it is not subject to personal motions .M and so is presumed to be off person .OffP . The item is considered stationary .Stat even if while off person .OffP it is subject to other motions such as transportation motions. An item is considered motionless only if its velocity relative to the earth is zero or in plain language if the item is completely still.

In an embodiment a BIRD may have an RFID interrogator .RFID configured to transmit an encoded radio signal to interrogate an RFID tag on a nearby object. The tag receives the message and responds with its identification information. Applications of a BIRD s RFID technology are discussed further below. See for example A G and other figures throughout this document. 

In an embodiment the BIRD may have an RFID sensor .RFID implemented as a distinct hardware module for example with a microchip s which implements the RFID interrogator capabilities. In an alternative embodiment RFID sensing interrogation may be accomplished by suitable configuration of the BIRD s other components such as using the processor to transmit receive RFID signals via the communications interface and remote transceivers .

There is potentially some overlap between a motion of an item and a vibration of an item. However in this document the motion of an item is generally understood as reflecting either a change in location resulting from the transport of the item from a first location to a second location or at least a more localized change in item position on the order of a few centimeters or inches which is indicative of bodily movement by the person holding or carrying the item. This may include either or both of the person moving from one location to another or a result of the person staying in one place but shifting position as for example movement while seated . As noted above motion may also broadly refer to lack of motion that is an item s state of rest.

Vibration is generally understood as reflecting the influence of a nearby source of oscillatory mechanical vibration which may be transmitted to the BIRDed item through an intermediate carrier of mechanical energy such as a table on which the item is resting .

In practice a BIRD may employ a single sensor which can operation as both a motion sensor .M and vibration sensor .B or the BIRD may employ two separate sensors for each respective type of sensing. For purposes of this document however a distinction is made between sensing of item motion and the sensing of item and or BIRD vibration s .

Data may be delivered from the sensors to the processor to memory or to other BIRD elements on any of several timing basis including for example and without limitation 

Other sensor data generation timing criteria may be envisioned as well within the scope and spirit of the present system and method.

In an embodiment it is desirable to obtain data from the sensors in some standard units also known as scientific units which typically are readily understood by humans skilled in the relevant arts and or are parseable by computer code written by humans skilled in the relevant arts. For example a motion sensor .M should deliver data normalized to such units as meters second or meters second 2 or their English unit equivalents. A location sensor .L should provide spatial coordinates normalized to standard metrics of latitude and longitude typically degrees minutes and seconds . A sound sensor .AI should provide sound intensities in units such as sones phons or dBs etc. Similar considerations of standard or established units apply to measures of intensity of other environmental phenomena including for example and without limitation torques and other angular measures frequencies wavelengths light intensities temperatures radiation levels and other environmental qualities and magnitudes.

Sensors as electronic or optical devices typically deliver initial data as low level signals electrical or optical which then requires some kind of additional processing to render the data in standardized or scientific units. In general such low level processing of sensor signals is not a concern of this document and is not addressed in this document. It is presumed that in the BIRD sensor signals will be translated as necessary into values associated with appropriate scientific units either by a dedicated processor or other electronics associated directly with each sensor and or by the BIRD s processor .

Therefore any references in this document to unprocessed sensor data raw sensor data or simply sensor data without further qualification generally refers to sensor data which is directly indicative of specific environmental phenomena data item location velocity acceleration torque ambient sound intensity ambient light intensity ambient temperature etc. but where such data has in fact been translated from low level signals into appropriate scientific units or suitable data structures which inherit such units to represent the sensor data for further processing.

For purposes of this document a still image from a camera .C a video recording from a video camera .V or a recording of sounds by an audio content sensor .AC would also be considered to be unprocessed sensor data or raw sensor data or simply sensor data . This is true even if some degree of processing has been applied following the actual data acquisition for purposes of data compression noise reduction or similar clean up of the image audio signal.

By contrast processed sensor data P is sensor data which has been subject to further analysis refinement and or distillation. Processed sensor data P may include for example and without limitation maximum value determinations minimum value determinations and threshold crossings statistical analyses of sensor data trend detection within the data pattern detection within the data data correlation analysis data waveform construction and waveform decompositions Fourier wavelet unless these are provided directly by the sensor or its associated dedicated processing elements spectral analysis facial recognition or other structure object recognition regarding image data voice recognition language recognition and other environmental recognition based on sound data and in general any level of mathematical or symbolic processing of sensor data and or synthesis of data from two or more sensors designed to extract some kind of integrated interpretation or understanding of the environment impacting an item .

The raw environmental data collected by the sensors may be referred to generally and interchangeably as sensor data sensor readings or environmental readings . The term sensor data is generally understood to mean either or both of current real time data R as identified by the BIRD s sensors or real time data plus stored historical data H . The intended meaning is generally clear from context.

Where real time sensor data only is specifically intended it is referred to as such real time sensor data .R .

Where historical sensor data only is specifically intended it is referred to as such real time sensor data .H . Historical sensor data .H may be may be stored on the BIRD for example in an environmental data log in BIRD memory .

Various values may be derived from the baseline sensor data both real time and or historical . Such values are referred to a processed sensor data .P processed sensor values .P or simply processed values .P . As already noted above processed values .P include for example and without limitation max values min values and threshold crossings averages and other statistical analyses of sensor data trend detection within the data pattern detection within the data data correlations waveforms and waveform decompositions facial recognition or other structure object recognition of image data voice recognition language recognition and other environmental recognition based on sound data.

Usage data .U Usage data .U is any data which is indicative of a person s use of the BIRDed item or indicative of the environment around the BIRDed item during item storage. Usage data .U may be sensor data historical and or real time only processed sensor values .H only or an aggregation all or some of that is subsets of of sensor data and processed sensor values .P .

See Table .T of below for a summary of the different types of sensor data .R .H .P and usage data .U .

The BIRD is generally intended for use as a portable item and so requires a portable source of power. In an embodiment the BIRD has two sources of power a battery .S which may for convenience be viewed as the BIRD s standard battery .S and a secure emergency battery .E .

The battery .S may be any one of numerous well known battery types such as a lithium ion cell or similar. It is generally intended to be lightweight and relatively long lasting. In an embodiment the battery .S is contained within or on the BIRD through any kind of conventional battery bay such that the battery .S is readily accessibly and readily replaced by a user of the BIRD .

The emergency battery .E may also be any type of well known battery source with again a typical design goal of lightness and being a long lasting power source. However in an embodiment the emergency battery .E is distinguished in that it is placed within the BIRD so that it cannot be readily accessed or removed by the user. For example emergency battery .E may be scaled within the BIRD so that the emergency battery .E can only be removed by effectively destroying the physical structure of the BIRD . Alternatively the emergency battery .E may be contained within the BIRD in such a way that the emergency battery .E can be accessed and removed but only with substantial and time consuming mechanical effort by a user. In an embodiment the removal of multiple screws or the application of a specially designed tool may be required to remove the emergency battery .E . In an alternative embodiment the emergency battery .E can only be removed by actions which essentially result in the total destruction of the BIRD or its crucial operating components. For example the emergency battery .E may be so attached to a main BIRD motherboard or primary circuit board not shown in the figures which houses the BIRD processor and memory so that removal of the emergency battery .E entails removal and or destruction of the motherboard itself. 

Configured in this way for difficult removal by a user the emergency battery .E serves several purposes. First it is a backup battery which is always in place if the standard battery .S should lose power or otherwise fail. Second in the event that the BIRD is stolen typically along with the item attached the BIRD a thief cannot readily or quickly disable the power within the BIRD because the emergency battery .E is difficult to access and remove. As a result when an item is stolen the attached BIRD will remain powered and therefore will remain able to determine its state as stolen .. and will further remain able to appropriately signal its state as stolen .. .

More generally in an embodiment the secure emergency battery .E is a secondary power source which is substantially hardened against removal tampering disabling or destruction by any action short of substantial damage to or destruction of the BIRD as a whole. This ensures that while the primary battery .S is available for ready removal or replacement by a user the secondary power source cannot be readily disabled in the event the BIRD and its associated item are in the possession or control of an unauthorized users UU .

A power monitor and charging element is coupled to the battery .S and to the emergency battery .E . The power monitor monitors the status of both batteries and automatically switches from the standard battery .S to the emergency battery .E if the power fails for any reason from standard battery .S . The emergency battery .E even when not in use may still slowly discharge over time. Therefore the power monitor also maintains a low rate charging process charging the emergency battery .E from the standard battery .S or from an external power source not shown as necessary. The power monitor and charging element is also configured to charge the standard battery .S from an external power source not shown such as wall current via a power port magnetic power coupling or other electricity transfer device not shown .

In an embodiment the power monitor may also be used to create a secure power down feature for the BIRD . In the event that the BIRDed item is stolen .. it is desirable that the BIRD remain powered on in order to make a determination of the item s state as possibly being stolen .. . This in turn requires that the BIRD cannot be readily powered down or deactivated by a thief. To ensure this the BIRD may require a special user input to turn power off. The power monitor may for example be configured to require to power down the system a special input from local I O interface discussed further below via the bus . The special input may take many forms including for example and without limitation a special key sequence entered via local input .L a code entered via a touch sensitive display .D a fingerprint or retinal scan entered via biometrics .B or a voice print identification entered via a microphone .M . In an embodiment a BIRD s audio sensor A may double as a microphone. In an alternative embodiment the audio signaling element .A may also serve as either of the audio sensor A or microphone .M or both.

Internal power lines are used to transfer electricity from the batteries .S .E to other elements throughout the BIRD .

Other sources of power may be used in place of or to supplement the batteries .S .E . Such sources may include for example and without limitation solar power provided by solar power converters on the outside of the BIRD or power received via radio frequency communications for example in an RFID system .

An item link integrity detection module may be employed to determine the structural integrity of the mechanical tether coupling .C between the BIRD and the item . The detection module reports if the mechanical tether .C is damaged or broken. This determination may be made based on for example the response of an electronic path or circuit which is threaded through or embedded within the mechanical link .C .

If the item itself contains electronics for example an active item .Act such as a personal computer a cell phone or similar the determination may also be made in whole or part based on a signal directly from the item .Act via a tether .Act with suitable signal transmission elements within.

In an embodiment the item link integrity detection module or in the alternative an additional item identity module not shown in the figure may have a capability to validate or partly validate that a particular intended item is connected to the BIRD . If the item is itself processor based or otherwise configured to provide data then the tether between the item and the BIRD may be configured to support data transfers between the item and the BIRD .

However even for items which are not processor based and which may have no electrical or data processing components of any kind a number of methods may still be employed by the BIRD to at least partly validate if a correct item is attached. These methods may include for example and without limitation 

In an embodiment a low voltage or low current may be sent through the tether with suitable contacts on the item to determine an electrical resistance or electrical impedance of the item. Other electrical properties of the item may similarly be determined as well. It may be determined in this way whether the item has an expected resistance or impedance. If not an incorrect item may be attached to the BIRD .

In an alternative embodiment an electrically conductive tag or strip for example an adhesive strip with a metallic coating on one side may be attached to an item . The BIRD s tether may be configured with suitable contacts or other electrical sensors to determine if the BIRD is attached to the item . A more detailed discussion of exemplary such embodiments is presented below in conjunction with .

When the BIRD signals a displaced anomalous item state . . or needs to otherwise signal or alert an authorized user AU a variety of signaling elements may be employed. These may include for example and without limitation local signaling elements such as an audio signaling element .A for example a speaker an optical signaling element .P such as an LED and a vibrator .V . More detailed signaling may also be done via a display .D .

In some embodiments local signaling may be accomplished in whole or in part via a connection with some other local device such as a cell phone or PDA via a wired communications port or a wireless connection mediated via transceivers . Communications port may be for example and without limitation a USB or Firewire port or an Ethernet port or other modem or high speed communications port. The communications port may also be used to upload program updates and or data into the BIRD and may also be used to transmit stored data to an external data processing system such as a configuration computer .

Remote signaling as well as other data communications may also be accomplished via one or more remote communications transceivers which may include for example and without limitation a cellular transceiver .C 3G 4G WiMax or LTE a WiFi IEEE 802.11 transceiver .W a Bluetooth transceiver .B and other transceivers .T . The BIRD is provisioned with any necessary antenna s to enable wireless communications.

Internal control of the local signaling the remote communications transceivers and the ports is managed and maintained by a communications interface module . The communications interface module allows software and data to be transferred between the BIRD and external devices such as a configuration computer .

Local user input output with the BIRD may be accomplished via several elements including for example and without limitation 

Several other input features discussed further below see such as the Power button the Temporary Deactivate False Alarm button the Good Samaritan button and the Panic button may be implemented via any of the local input device .L for example as mechanical buttons virtual buttons or other input elements of the display .D or speech recognition elements of the microphone .

The biometrics sensor .B may be for example a fingerprint scanner or a retinal scanner. The biometrics sensor .B may be used to validate that an authorized user AU is in possession of the BIRD both when data or commands are being input into the BIRD and when the BIRD has made a provisional determination that the BIRDed item may have been lost .. or stolen .. .

Local inputs such as the biometrics sensor .B the display .D and the local input .L may be controlled via a local input output interface module . The local input output interface forwards graphics text and other data from the internal bus or from a frame buffer not shown for display on the display .D .

Certain hardware components of the BIRD may function in multiple capacities. For example a touchscreen display may function in the role of the display .D the local input .L and the fingerprint scanner .B . Similarly a camera .C in addition to having various environmental sensing applications may also function as a biometrics scanner .B by providing retinal imaging or even fingerprint imaging. In an embodiment personal identification data collected via the biometrics sensor .B may be used as an element of algorithms to determine anomalous . or non anomalous device usage. In that sense the biometrics sensor .B may be considered to be a part of the environmental sensors as well.

In an embodiment it is desirable to make the BIRD as physically small and lightweight as possible with the additional goal of reducing power consumption. Therefore in an embodiment a display .D may be omitted altogether and a local input .L may comprise a very minimal set of buttons or other BIRD surface elements sufficient for minimal control such as turning the BIRD on and off. In such embodiments field control or modification of BIRD configuration or functionality by the authorized user AU may be minimal.

In an alternative embodiment field control configuration of the BIRD may be accomplished by a wired or wireless interface between the BIRD and a device used as a portable configuration computer see . For example a cell phone see or tablet computer may function in the field as a configuration computer which may interface with the BIRD via the ports or the communications transceivers . In an embodiment this may minimize or eliminate altogether the need for the local I O interface and or for the biometrics .B display .D microphone .M and or local input .L .

In an embodiment the BIRD may communicate with the portable configuration computer such as the cell phone via the standard cellular network or other established network system. In an alternative embodiment a cell phone or other portable configuration computer is configured with a dedicated transceiver element for local communications with the BIRD . For example a WiFi or Bluetooth transceiver in the cell phone may be configured to communicate with the BIRD s WiFi .W or Bluetooth .B transceivers. A single cell phone may be configured to communicate with multiple BIRDs associated with items belonging to the authorized user AU .

In the event the authorized user AU loses or misplaces their cell phone or the cell phone is stolen provision made be made for the BIRD to communicate with other communications devices such as a borrowed cell phone or tablet computer. Suitable security protections for example password protections would be put in place to ensure the security of the BIRD . As discussed further below in conjunction with active devices a cell phone may itself be configured with BIRD elements and functionality in anticipation of possible cell phone loss misplacement or theft. 

In addition to the main memory .M already discussed above in an embodiment the BIRD may have additional forms of memory or secondary memory .S . However due to considerations of minimizing the BIRD s size weight and or power consumption in an embodiment the secondary memory .S may be omitted.

In embodiments where secondary memory .S is employed the secondary memory .S may be used to store transitory programs to store data for removal to other processing systems and for similar purposes. The secondary memory .S may include for example and without limitation cache memory .S.C a flash drive optical drive or hard disk drive .S.F another removable storage element or drive .S.R or an interface .S.N such as a slot or port for a removable storage unit .RSU .

As will be appreciated the removable storage unit .RSU includes a computer usable storage medium having stored therein computer software and or data. Examples of such may include a program cartridge and cartridge interface such as that found in video game devices a removable memory chip such as an erasable programmable read only memory EPROM or programmable read only memory PROM and associated socket and other removable storage units .RSU and interfaces .S.N which allow software and data to be transferred from the removable storage unit .RSU to the BIRD .

In this document the terms non transitory physical storage medium tangible computer program medium tangible computer usable medium and similar terms are used to generally refer to media such as the removable storage drive .S.R or to flash memory an optical disk or a magnetic disk installed in the flash optical hard disk drive .S.F or to removable storage units .RSU . The terms the terms non transitory physical storage medium tangible computer program medium tangible computer usable medium and similar terms may also refer to hard drives optical disks flash memory and similar tangible data storage media which may be connected to or inserted into a configuration computer . Since the configuration computer can in turn be coupled to the BIRD as discussed further below see the non transitory physical storage medium tangible computer program medium tangible computer usable medium and similar terms can be directly or indirectly coupled to the BIRD via the configuration computer . These tangible computer program products provide software to BIRD . The current system and method is directed in part to such computer program products.

Computer programs also referred to as computer control logic are stored in the BIRD s main memory .M and or secondary memory .S and or in the removable storage units .RSU . Computer programs may also be received via the communications interface . Such computer programs when executed enable the BIRD to perform the features of the present system and method as discussed herein. In particular the computer programs when executed enable the processor to perform the features of the present system and method. Accordingly such computer programs represent controllers of the BIRD .

In an embodiment where the invention is implemented using software the software may be stored in a computer program product and loaded into the BIRD using the removable storage unit s .RSU or via the flash optical hard drive .S.F or via removable storage drive .S.R or via the communications interface . The software may also be loaded into the BIRD via a configuration computer as discussed further below in conjunctions with . The control logic software when executed by the processor causes the processor to perform the functions of the present system and method as described herein.

In another embodiment the present system and method is implemented primarily in hardware using for example hardware components such as application specific integrated circuits ASICs . Implementation of the hardware state machine so as to perform the functions described herein will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art s .

In yet another embodiment the invention is implemented using a combination of both hardware and software.

The elements of a BIRD described above are exemplary only. Other BIRDs may be envisioned which employ less hardware more hardware or alternative hardware elements as necessary or helpful to implement the methods and algorithms described throughout this document.

A BIRD is configured to store data values data ranges data variations and data patterns generally in the form of usage expectations which are emblematic of the BIRDed item as the BIRDed item is put to normal or typical usage by a particular authorized user AU . The usage expectations embody environmental data reflective of typical item usage and or storage by the authorized user AU and are stored in the BIRD itself.

In operation the BIRD compares usage data .U reflective of the BIRDed item s environment against the expected environment as captured in the usage expectations . In general the sensors are employed to collect the real time environmental data .R over extended time intervals ranging from minutes to hours days or even weeks or longer. The environmental data is further analyzed to determine real time ranges variations and patterns in the data yielding processed data .P . The environmental data reflective of typical usage by the authorized user AU is stored in the BIRD itself as historical sensor data .H .

The BIRD is configured so that it can maintain a real time monitor of the environmental data. In use the BIRD maintains a substantially continuous or periodic monitor of the environment and assesses the state of its associated item in relation to the environment. If the usage data .U varies significantly from the conditions embodied in the usage expectations then the BIRD determines that displaced anomalous usage . . of the item may be in progress. The BIRD then initiates a signal to an appropriate party typically an owner or other authorized user AU of the item that displaced anomalous usage . . may be in progress.

The details of this process and particular applications are discussed further below. Particular applications including determining when anomalous usage . indicates that an item linked to BIRD may be lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. .

In an embodiment many or all of the sensors employed by a BIRD can operate in a pure observer mode meaning they are configured simply to passively receive appropriate types of energy from the environment and transduce that energy into meaningful electrical signals for further processing. Examples of such sensors include for example and without limitation location sensors .L motions sensors .M various optical sensors .C .V .Opt audio sensors .AI .AC temperature sensors .T and others.

In some embodiments a BIRD may include sensors which actively interrogate the environment transmitting energy and or signals into the environment and then analyzing energy which is reflected back to the BIRD by the ambient environment. Such sensors may include for example and without limitation sonar .S and radar .RR .

In some cases observer sensors may at least at times be augmented with energy emitting elements. For example optical sensors .C .V .Opt or general electromagnetic sensors .E such as infrared sensors may determine that the environment around the BIRD is dark meaning the environment has insufficient RF energy for clear detection by the sensors . In an embodiment the BIRD may be configured to emit appropriate energy to illuminate the environment for the benefit of the sensors . For example a BIRD may use an integrated light source not shown or integrated infrared source not shown to provide any needed illumination for optical sensors .C .V .Opt or general electromagnetic sensors .E . In combination with the energy emitting elements for example light sources sensors which are otherwise strictly observer sensors become interrogator sensors.

Since interrogator sensors emit energy as part of their operations they can be a drain on BIRD power. In an embodiment and for various reasons including limiting power consumption a BIRD may be configured to only activate or use interrogator sensors under specified conditions. For example BIRD logic and or usage expectations discussed in detail further below may specify that interrogation sensors are only to be activated if other sensors observer sensors first provide some indication that the BIRD and its associated item may be in a displaced anomalous state . . .

The sensors integrated into the BIRD need to have sufficient resolution and sensitivity to implement the methods described herein. At the same time since the BIRD is generally intended for field use with small portable items other goals in selection or design of the sensor technologies employed include small size light weight and low power consumption. For a BIRD configured for typical consumer use it will also generally be desirable to maintain relatively low cost to the consumer which in turn requires low costs for parts. The resolution and sensitivity and the sensors incorporated into a BIRD s design will reflect appropriate trade offs between sufficient resolution and sensitivity needed for the methods described herein along with the goals of light weight small size and manageable costs.

A BIRD s RFID sensor .RFID sensor may have multiple applications some of which are discussed here. Additional applications or elaborations of these applications are discussed elsewhere throughout this document 

In addition even if the tether does contain active link integrity electronics the electronics may determine that the integrity of the connection is broken. That is the tether and the item link integrity detection module may determine that the item is no longer mechanically coupled to the BIRD . In that event the BIRD may still determine via the RFID interrogator .RFID possibly in conjunction with the item link integrity detection module whether the item is still in substantial spatial proximity to the BIRD .

Applications for sensing other nearby objects including item teams discussed further below see for examples and containers which are configured to sense for expected contents also discussed further below see for example .

Because a BIRD may be in field use for an extended period of time it is preferable to configure the BIRD to minimize power consumption. Several methods may be employed to limit power consumption by the BIRD .

Certain categories of environmental monitoring may be turned off or reduced in frequency based on data regarding other types of environmental sensing. For example it may be that image capture is only required when an item is in motion and or changing location. A BIRD s motion sensor .M may report that the item is not in motion or only in limited motion or the location sensor .L may report that the item is in substantially the same place for a period of time. In response to such data from the motion sensor .M or location sensor .L the BIRD may be configured to reduce a frequency of image capture by a camera .C or video camera .V or even to power down the camera s .C .V altogether. Similarly if the motion sensor .M determines that no motion or minimal motion is taking place such that the item s location cannot substantially change the location sensor .L may be shut down or put in reduced power mode until substantial motion is again detected.

Other such power saving optimizations may be envisioned as well linking an activity level of a first sensor to values of environmental data reported by a second sensor.

Another power saving option is controlled frequency of sensor monitoring. The BIRD may be configured so that certain selected sensors may be powered down for a period of time effectively reducing the frequency of usage but also reducing power consumption when the BIRD is in locations .L where those sensors and their data are not applicable. Some sensors may not be employed altogether in certain locations .L . Similarly if battery power is low priority may be allocated to those sensors deemed most likely to produce a determination of extant normal item state . . vs. displaced anomalous item state . . while other sensors are shut down.

In an embodiment a BIRD may be configured to be coupled with or integrated into items which are typically expected to remain in one place and not be in use by a person for extended periods of time. For example a BIRD may be integrated into a book .E which is expected to remain on the book shelf most of the time. In a very reduced power mode the BIRD may monitor only for item motion. If and when motion is detected the BIRD may fully power up and monitor the book s environment to determine if the book s usage for example the location is consistent with the book s expected usage. Because the BIRD is normally in a very lower power dormant mode when the book is on the shelf the BIRD may be able to monitor the book .E for an extended period of time. This can help ensure that the book does not wander away in the hands of an unauthorized reader.

Persons skilled in the relevant arts will recognize that some existing technologies embody various combinations of some of the elements described above for a BIRD . For example most or all of the processing related elements processor memory clock calendar timer and possibly others are found in contemporary personal computers laptop computers tablet computers and cell phones. Buses some types of sensors and communications elements are also found in contemporary personal computers cell phones and similar devices.

However various design considerations and resulting hardware implementation details which are not specifically illustrated in may serve to distinguish a BIRD from other processor based technologies.

In an embodiment a BIRD is intended to be attached to or embedded within items which are physically small such as keys .K wallets .W various personal accessories .S and similar.

In order to maintain convenience for users it is therefore desirable that a BIRD typically be scaled in both size and weight to these small personal portable items. While this does not impose any specific size constraints persons skilled in the relevant arts will recognize that it is often desirable to make a BIRD at least as small as if not smaller than a typical cell phone. It is similarly desirable to make a BIRD lighter in some case drastically lighter than a cell phone and to have less power consumption than a cell phone as well.

The expected manual manipulation by human hands of different technologies imposes or at least encourages certain design considerations as well. For example cell phone users frequently employ their phones for texting or messaging as well as for the use of various cell phone applications. The extensive manipulation of the cell phone s user interface for these purposes tends to impose a minimum size requirement such that a cell phone is at least large enough for convenient keying in of text. By contrast and in an embodiment the user of a BIRD may be expected to make less frequent use of the user interface features which in turn lends itself to BIRD designs which may be substantially smaller than a cell phone . In an embodiment it is desirable to make a BIRD substantially smaller than a cell phone .

Longevity of battery life is an additional design goal. Depending on anticipated usage it may be desirable for the BIRD power source .S .E to last for a full day several days or even several weeks. Low heat output is another desirable goal for a BIRD .

The goals of small size and small weight as well as the goal of preserving battery life may yield specific hardware embodiments of a BIRD which omit one or more elements discussed above in conjunction with . Elements which may be omitted in some embodiments may include 

In an embodiment the secure emergency battery .E and or the power monitor may be omitted as well although this entails some tradeoffs in BIRD security and reliability. Similarly the item link integrity detection module may be omitted again with some trade offs in device functionality.

These broad high level design goals for example small size light weight low heat generation extended battery life impose further specific design constraints on a BIRD . In an embodiment each specific element of the BIRD must be designed with a view towards small size and low power. This means that in an embodiment a BIRD may actually employ a processor and memory which run at slower speeds and have reduced processing capabilities as compared with the processor memory of contemporary laptop computers tablet computers PDAs or cell phones. Reduced speed and reduced processing capabilities are associated with small size light weight reduced power consumption and low heat generation.

Similarly the sensors employed on a BIRD may generally require significantly lower resolution and or lower sensitivity than those employed on most contemporary personal computers cell phones and similar devices. For example a BIRD may include an optical sensor .Opt or camera .C . The optical sensor .Opt or camera .C is used to determine light levels and or surrounding physical environments as recorded visually for an item associated with the BIRD . In an embodiment it is advantageous for the optical sensor .Opt employed to be a camera .C so that the BIRD can record specific images of the environment surrounding an item . However for purposes of the BIRD even relatively low resolution images may be sufficient to compare a presently imaged environment with a previously captured image environment representing an expected environment for the item . Therefore a low resolution camera .C may be employed saving on size weight and power consumption. In an alternative embodiment a camera is not employed at all. Rather the optical sensor .Opt is a much simpler photosensitive element configured primarily to determine ambient light levels surrounding an item .

In another example a BIRD may employ a motion sensor .M which may for example be an accelerometer to determine the speed and acceleration of an item physically tethered to the BIRD . The purpose of the motion sensor .M is to compare a present that is current speed or acceleration of the item with an expected speed or acceleration. The determinations necessary for such comparisons may often be approximate or within general ranges. For example it may be desirable to determine if an item is approximately stationary or being used at approximately a typical human walking speed or being used at a typical human running speed or being transported in an automobile. For such comparisons and such general ranges of speeds or accelerations measurements of speed or acceleration may have a substantial degree of error and still be useful. As such a relatively compact low cost low resolution motion sensor .M may be sufficient for some embodiments of a BIRD .

Similar considerations may apply to measurements of other environmental factors such as ambient moisture via moisture sensor .U ambient temperature and or device temperature for active items discussed further below determined via temperature sensor .T and even for the location sensor .L and other sensors as well. As such in various embodiments the sensors of a BIRD may be smaller lighter less expensive less heat generating and of lower power consumption than the sensors which may be employed for other contemporary processor based devices such as computers and cell phones.

In an embodiment then a BIRD is a specialized processing device designated principally for the identification of environmental data and for the determination of an extant normal . . or displaced anomalous . . environment of an item associated with the BIRD . In an embodiment the environmental data sensed and recorded by the BIRD need only be of such accuracy or precision as to enable a meaningful comparison between a present environment of an item and the expected environment of the item . Such comparisons may be approximate or fuzzy in nature and still be useful to determine if an item s usage environment is normal or anomalous . .

In such embodiments a BIRD only has a processor memory sensors and other elements which are sufficient in processing abilities speed resolution data storage and program code storage and similar design parameters to implement the normal anomalous item detection algorithms and methods described throughout this document.

As such in various embodiments the specific architectural design of a BIRD may employ components which are reduced in functionality and power compared with generally analogous components employed in general purpose personal computers cell phones personal digital assistants and similar technologies. In such embodiments a BIRD differs significantly from the typically higher powered faster heavier and more voluminous requirements associated with general purpose personal computers cell phones personal digital assistants and similar technologies.

However the precise component and functionality power requirements of BIRD technology may vary in different embodiments.

In an exemplary embodiment referred to for convenience as a first minimal signal processing configuration a BIRD may employ only a location sensor .L . In such embodiments normal . vs. anomalous . item usage may be distinguished in whole or in part based on a comparison between the present item location and the expected item location. In such embodiments the demands on the processor and memory may be minimal compared with the requirements of a BIRD with additional sensing capabilities. As such the size power capabilities speed and weight of the processor and or memory may be minimized.

In an alternative exemplary embodiment referred to for convenience as a second minimal signal processing configuration a BIRD may employ only an optical sensor .Opt and or a sound sensor A sufficient for basic discrimination of light intensities or sound intensities. In such embodiments normal . vs. anomalous . item usage may be distinguished in whole or in part based on a comparison between ambient light intensities or sound intensities and expected light or sound intensities. In such embodiments not only can the optical sensor .Opt or the audio sensor A be functionally minimal but the demands on the processor and memory are minimal compared with the requirements of more advanced signal processing. As such the size power capabilities speed and weight of the processor and or memory may be minimized.

In an alternative exemplary embodiment referred to for convenience as an advanced signal processing configuration a BIRD may employ a camera .C or video camera .V and or a sound sensor A configured for voice and or language recognition. Such sensors may also accomplish basic discrimination of light intensities or sound intensities as well. In such advanced signal processing configurations normal . vs. anomalous . item usage may be distinguished in whole or in part based on a comparison between ambient visual features faces buildings other items in the environment or ambient sound qualities language particular voices or even music or other sound identification versus the expected visual or sound qualities. Such advanced signal processing embodiments require more advanced technologies than a simple optical sensor .Opt or minimal audio sensor A limited to sound intensity detection. The demands on the processor and memory increase as well due to the requirements of more advanced signal processing.

In an alternative embodiment a BIRD may employ elements not found in contemporary personal computers tablet computers cell phones PDAs etc. For example some sensors which may be employed on some BIRDs such as an air pressure sensor .AP surface pressure sensor .SP temperature sensor .T moisture humidity sensor .U sonar .S radiation sensor .RN chemical sensor .CH and other sensor are not typically found on cell phones personal computers PDAs or similar. These sensors and others and the environmental data they collect may be gainfully employed to determine extant normal . . or displaced anomalous . . device usage and or normal anomalous device contexts.

In an alternative embodiment some of the extant normal . . vs. displaced anomalous . . item environment detection algorithms and methods described herein may be implemented using processing systems and sensors associated with active items .Act such as personal computers laptop computers tablet computers cell phones PDAs and similar devices. The implementation of these BIRD algorithms in these devices may enable these devices to function as a BIRD for purposes of self determining if the item computer cell phone etc. is in an extant normal state . . of usage or is in an displaced anomalous state . . of usage. This is discussed further below in conjunctions with and in conjunction with other discussion throughout this document of active items .Act .

However even these existing processing systems personal computers laptop and tablet computers cell phones etc. may benefit for usage as active items from additional hardware elements distinctive to a BIRD . For example the redundant and security oriented power features described herein are just one BIRD element among others that may be integrated into these other processing devices.

Additionally while BIRD algorithms may be implemented in whole or in part on laptop and tablet computers cell phones PDAs and similar devices these devices are generally not suitable for use as BIRDs to be associated or coupled with other items. This is at least because personal laptop and tablet computers as well as cell phones and other PDAs have their own independent uses in view of at least this they are not suitable for being physically coupled with and substantially collocated with other items for extended periods of time. In addition personal laptop and tablet computers and also cell phones and PDAs typically have a size weight power consumption requirements and other hardware configuration aspects which make them substantially less than optimum for use as BIRDs . Similar considerations may apply to other hardware elements of the BIRD .

In general a processing system is characterized not just by a list of generic hardware components but rather in terms of a constellation of specific components with carefully selected hardware design parameters suitable for both the external usage of the system and for the internal processing requirements of the system.

In some embodiments for typical personal consumer usage the BIRD is itself meant to be an inexpensive small light weight low power consumption device comprised of its hardware components in conjunction with suitable algorithms to determine whether an associated item is in extant normal . . or displaced anomalous . . usage. The BIRD is constructed using a particular choice of components among multiple similar components or similar types of components which may be available for example a variety of processors are available on the market as are a variety of memory types . The BIRD is designed so that the particular choices of components provide an optimum balance between 

 ii the processing requirements and supporting element requirements for determining and signaling extant normal . . vs. displaced anomalous item usage . . or contexts.

The processing system is further determined by a particular configuration arrangement and connection of the components which is substantially optimized to achieve the specified set of operational behaviors and usage features.

For the BIRD the choice configuration and arrangement of components including but not limited to those components which may be similar to though not necessarily the same as those employed in other processing systems is tailored to provide for the substantial optimization of the BIRD for the purposes and uses described herein. Thus even if a generic list of BIRD components appears to be substantially the same or similar between the BIRD and some other processing technologies it is the particular hardware configuration and its substantial optimization for use as a BIRD which contributes at least in part to distinguishing the BIRD from the other processing technologies.

In alternative embodiments a BIRD may benefit from a processor memory or sensors which have greater capabilities or requirements than the analogous components typically employed for laptop computers or cell phones. This may be particularly true for BIRDS which are configured for specialized items used in industrial contexts or BIRDs configured for use with large or heavy portable items .

Further distinctions between the BIRD and the other processing technologies are apparent based on other BIRD optimizations including but not limited to 

BIRD algorithms and methods are described throughout this document and are by themselves distinctive and distinguishing features of the present system and method even when employed with or integrated into existing processing technologies computers cell phones PDAs etc. as may the case with active items .Act discussed further below. See and other discussion of active items throughout this document. 

The BIRD .RC shares many elements in common with the BIRD illustrated in and a detailed discussion of these elements will not be repeated here. However certain differences between the embodiment shown in and the embodiment .RC of the present figure are discussed immediately below.

A BIRD .RC may have a reduced configuration for any number of reasons including reduction in cost reduction in size reduction in weight and reduction in power consumption. Depending on the specific intended applications of a BIRD a BIRD .RC may have all the hardware components needed to enable the BIRD .RC to effectively distinguish when an item is extant . versus when an item is displaced . lost misplaced stolen misappropriated or wandering or otherwise in an anomalous state . . In an embodiment such a reduced configuration BIRD .RC may be suitable to self determine extant normal item states . . from displaced anomalous item states . . within limited or designated environmental contexts.

A BIRD .RC may have a relatively limited set of sensors . In the BIRD .RC has an audio intensity sensor .AI a location sensor .L a motion sensor .M an optical sensor .Opt configured to detect light intensity but not to capture pictures or motion images and a temperature sensor .T . In alternative embodiments other combinations of sensors may be employed. The BIRD .RC has fewer sensors than the exemplary BIRD illustrated in . For example the BIRD .RC does not have an audio content identification sensor .AC and does not have a camera .C or video camera .V . In such a hardware embodiment the BIRD logic and usage expectations will be configured to make determinations of extant normal item states . . or displaced anomalous item states . . using the available sensor data .

The BIRD .RC still has a secure emergency battery .E and a power monitor module configured for various power management and control operations. In an embodiment and with certain inherent trade offs in BIRD reliability under some circumstances either or both of the secure emergency battery .E or power monitor may be omitted.

The BIRD .RC omits ports such as a USB or Firewire port and instead relies entirely on a remote communications transceiver such as for example a WiFi connection .W or a Bluetooth connection .B to link to external digital devices. In an alternative embodiment one or more ports may be part of the BIRD .RC but wireless linkages WiFi .W Bluetooth .B and so on may be omitted entirely.

In the embodiment shown in the BIRD .RC retains capability for local signaling and remote reporting via remote the communications transceivers . In an alternative embodiment a BIRD .RC may be configured with only one of either the local signaling elements or the remote communications transceivers but not both. In such embodiments the BIRD .RC will be capable of one of local signaling or remote reporting but not both.

In an embodiment the BIRD .RC may have a reduced set of local interfaces as compared with the interfaces illustrated in . For example the BIRD .RC illustrated in omits a display .D. In an embodiment most or all of the elements of local interfacing may be omitted in such an embodiment control of the BIRD .RC may be achieved by interfacing with the BIRD .RC from a configuration computer cell phone or similar via remote communications transceivers .

In an embodiment the BIRD .RC with a reduced configuration may enable the use of a processor and or memory with less power as measured by appropriate metrics as compared with the processor and or memory of the BIRD embodiment illustrated in .

The BIRD .RC shares many elements in common with the BIRD illustrated in and a detailed discussion of these elements will not be repeated here. However certain differences between the embodiment shown in and the present figure are discussed immediately below.

The BIRD .RC may be configured with a reduced set of BIRD software a stripped down BIRD logic and or a minimal operating system both discussed further below so that the BIRD .RC does not require DRAM memory .M.D . Rather the BIRD .RC may be designed to support all processing within an on board processor cache memory .PCa which is structurally part of the processor . Lacking conventional DRAM main memory .M may consist of just one or both of NVRAM .M.N or ROM EEPROM Flash memory .M.R or some other form of non volatile memory for sustained storage of the BIRD operating system including BIRD logic and usage expectations .

Environmental sensors may be confined exclusively to sensors which require no input power or external power for operation such as piezoelectric sensors or a microphone or a purely passive locationing system .L.Pass which may for example rely on position data received from local environment position beacons . Such sensors may have reduced resolution or other lesser capabilities compared with actively powered sensors. In such a hardware embodiment the BIRD logic and usage expectations will be configured to make determinations of extant normal item states . . or displaced anomalous item states . . using the available sensor data.

Such sensors which require no external power may have the additional advantage that part of the signal power they generate may be siphoned off to provide power for other elements via power extraction lines and a power extraction storage distribution unit . Power may also be extracted from the antenna and possibly from a secondary antenna .RFID used for received RFID communications. Additional power may be extracted from one or more alternate power sources .A including for example and without limitation a photovoltaic material not shown covering a substantial portion of the BIRD s outer casing see a motion based power source not shown in addition to motion sensor .M or a source not shown which generates power based on a heat differential such as a differential between room temperature air and body heat. The BIRD .RC may also have a battery .S not shown however the use of various supplemental power sources .A .RFID may enable the use of a smaller lighter battery than that employed by the exemplary BIRD of .

Similarly a deliberate choice of a lightweight low power consumption communications interface for the BIRD .RC may entail eliminating USB Firewire ports and or some or all modes of local signaling and or some or all modes of remote communications transceivers . For example in an embodiment the BIRD .RC employs only RFID communications via an RFID communications transceiver .RFID . In an alternative embodiment a BIRD may have no remote communications transceivers which may limit the BIRD to local signaling only but which also reduces the BIRD s cost weight and power consumption.

In an embodiment the BIRD .RC may have no local interfaces or controls relying entirely on communications for the authorized user AU to control or configure the BIRD .RC . In an alternative embodiment a very small or limited set of controls such as for example dip switches .DS may be provided.

In an embodiment the BIRD has an exterior outer body housing or casing . The casing may be composed of a variety of materials well known in the art including various metals metallic alloys plastics ceramics polymers or other materials or combinations of materials. In an alternative embodiment the BIRD may be substantially implemented using a thin flat card similar to a credit card in such embodiments the surface of the card may be considered to be the casing . Sensors may be either internal to or external to that is surface mounted on the BIRD s casing . Some sensors such as for example an optical sensor .Opt camera .C or a chemical sensor .CH will necessarily have at least some component which is either at or in substantial proximity to or otherwise coupled with an exterior surface of the BIRD . For example an optical sensor .Opt or camera .C requires a means for exterior light to reach the active sensing photosensitive element s and similarly a chemical sensor .CH requires a means for environmental chemicals to reach the active sensing chemically responsive elements. Other types of sensors such as some types of location sensors .L or a motion sensor .M may be interior to BIRD or may be substantially coplanar with or mounted on an exterior surface of the BIRD or casing . Four such exterior sensors are illustrated in .

In an embodiment the BIRD may also have sensor bays for holding and retaining various sensors . The sensors bays may be either surface mounted or interior to the BIRD . The sensor bays permit the BIRD to be configurable with different sensors which may be attached or removed by a user. The exemplary BIRD illustrated in has seven sensor bays on the side illustrated. The sensor bays may be of various sizes and shapes and use varying types of mechanical and or electrical connectors to accommodate sensors of varying sizes and or sensing power or resolution. Shown in are three different exemplary sizes of sensor bays standard sensor bays S enhanced sensor bays E and a major or multipurpose sensor bay M .

The BIRD also has a BIRD item tether or BIRD item connector already discussed above and used to link or help link the BIRD with an item . See also below for further discussion of an exemplary tether .

Shown in are exemplary input output and control elements for the BIRD . The elements shown are exemplary only and should in no way be construed as limiting.

Local I O Shown in the figure are the local input .L which may for example be a keyboard or button type input the display .D and biometrics .B for reading fingerprints retinal or iris scans or similar. In an embodiment the local input .L and display .D may be a combined element as for example a touch screen display. A BIRD may also have a microphone .M not shown in the figure though in an embodiment an audio output element .A may serve dual function as a microphone.

Power On Off Also shown is a power on off switch complete with an exemplary stylish bird logo. As discussed above powering down the BIRD may require in addition to use of the power switch entry of a confirmation code or other user authentication for example in the form of a password entered via the local input .L in the form of a voice confirmation entered via a microphone not shown or an audio sensor A doubling as a microphone and which may be confirmed by voice recognition technology and or audio password recognition or in the form of biometric confirmation such as a fingerprint iris scan or retinal scan entered via the biometric sensor .B . In an embodiment powering on the BIRD or utilizing some of its features may require user confirmation authentication as well.

In an embodiment the BIRD has a Temporary Deactivate False Alarm button . In an embodiment this one button may instead be partitioned into two separate buttons. The user may employ the Temporary Deactivate button when the user knows that the BIRDed item will be deliberately and temporarily used in an anomalous manner. The use of the Temporary Deactivate button prevents the BIRD from signaling a false alarm. In an embodiment upon pressing the Temporary Deactivate button the BIRD may again require the user to provide confirmation or authentication for example in the form of a password entered via the local input .L in the form of a voice confirmation entered via a microphone or the audio sensor A and which may be confirmed by voice recognition technology and or audio password recognition or in the form of biometric confirmation such as a fingerprint entered via the biometric sensor .B .

The False Alarm button may be employed by the user to silence the BIRD in the event that the BIRD mistakenly diagnoses or signals an anomalous state . . Here again in an embodiment upon pressing the False Alarm button the BIRD may require the user to provide confirmation or authentication in the form of a password a voice confirmation or in the form of biometric confirmation such as a fingerprint.

In an embodiment the BIRD has a Good Samaritan button or GSB . The BIRD has internal methods discussed briefly above and in further detail below to determine and to signal when the item associated with the BIRD is likely in a state or condition of being displaced . . However these methods no matter how reliable cannot be guaranteed to work with 100 reliability in all circumstances and at all times and so may sometimes fail to detect a displaced anomalous state . . . Further in some embodiments the displaced item determination method s may require some time interval to determine that the item is displaced . .

If the displaced item determination methods do not work in a particular case or if the methods are delayed in determining that the item is displaced . a nearby person a good Samaritan may still intervene and help. Suppose that the BIRD is connected with an item which has been lost in a public place. If the good Samaritan typically a total stranger to the authorized item owner finds the item for example keys .K or a wallet .W lying around unattended and out of place the good Samaritan will likely assume that the item is lost. The good Samaritan if familiar with BIRDs will also recognize the attached BIRD with its Good Samaritan button . In addition suitable labeling may be provided on the BIRD to guide the uninitiated good Samaritan.

The good Samaritan can simply press the GSB . The GSB is preprogrammed so that when pressed it triggers appropriate signaling activity by the BIRD . Appropriate signaling activities are discussed further below but may include sending a lost item message to the appropriate item owner s cell phone e mail or similar or signaling a Lost Anomalous Reporting Center see below . The lost item message may include location information if available to the BIRD so that the item owner can find the lost item .

In an embodiment a Panic button is intended for use in the event that the authorized user AU of an item has an encounter with a person who is not a good Samaritan. For example if the owner of a purse .P wallet .W or keys .K encounters a purse snatcher or other thief the owner may have the time to press the Panic button on the item being pulled away. Alternatively the owner of the stolen item may simply press the Panic button on another BIRD which remains in their possession after a first item is stolen or snatched. The Panic button may be programmed with a variety of responses including automated signals or messages to local police emission of loud warning alarms or messages to draw the attention of sympathetic and brave bystanders etc. Alarms and other audio messages may be emitted by local signaling such as a speaker .A .

If the user s BIRDs have been configured to be members of an item team then in an embodiment activating the Panic Button on one item may trigger alarms and other suitable responses from all members of the item team . In this event a thief attempting to escape will a stolen item will quickly find himself herself carrying a stolen item which draws a great deal of attention as well as carrying an item which may continuously report it s location to suitable authorities. Items teams and item team members are discussed further below in this document in conjunction with A B and other figures as well.

The Panic button may also be programmed for use in medical emergencies such as a heart attack and is useful as long as the user has sufficient awareness of an onset of illness or injury to actually press the button.

Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the exemplary input output and control elements shown in may be implemented in a variety of ways. In an embodiment for example some or all of such elements as the on off switch the Temporary Deactivate False Alarm button the GSB and the Panic button may be implemented as mechanical buttons or switches or similar. In an alternative embodiment some or all of the same buttons or the functionality associated with such buttons may be implemented as virtual buttons or similar virtual control widgets on a touch screen display. In an alternative embodiment some or all of the same functionality associated with such buttons may be implemented through voice command of the BIRD . Other methods and means of mediating user control of and interaction with the BIRD may be envisioned as well via other user interface schemas within the scope of the present teachings system and method.

More generally a BIRD or an active item .Act see may have sensors which are structurally placed or positioned in relation to the main body of the BIRD or active item .Act in such a way as to optimize acquisition of environmental data suitable for determination of extant . or displaced . states. In addition a BIRD may have an casing which is shaped in such a way that no matter how the BIRD is oriented sensing elements are optimally positioned for data acquisition.

In an exemplary embodiment not illustrated a BIRD may have a shape of the outer body such as a sphere or cube. In an embodiment and depending on the cost of optical sensors .Opt or cameras .C numerous optical sensors or cameras .C may be directly situated on the outer body of the BIRD with a substantially uniform and or broadly dispersed distribution. In an alternative embodiment numerous optical receptors such as fiber optic strands with lenses at their first ends may be embedded in the sphere or cube with a substantially uniform and or broadly dispersed lens distribution along the surface of the outer body of the BIRD . The second ends of the fiber optic strands may connect to an optical receptor or camera .Opt .C within the BIRD .

In field use the BIRD may be placed in a container item for example a purse .P or toolkit .TK which may be left partially open by the authorized user AU . Assume that the BIRD is positioned within the container in such a way that some area of its surface is exposed to the exterior environment. Then no matter how the BIRD is oriented within the container and because of the substantially uniform or broadly dispersed distribution of optical receptors along the outer surface the BIRD is likely to have available to it optical sensor data of the environment beyond the purse. Similar considerations may apply to other kinds of sensors such as an audio sensor .AI .AC a temperature sensor .T and other sensors .

A BIRD may also employ additional elements not illustrated to optimize sensor exposure especially in closed or semi closed containers or environments. Such additional elements may include for example and without limitation 

BIRD . illustrates an exemplary stand alone BIRD which may be the same or similar in design and configuration to the BIRDs illustrated in already discussed above. The BIRD is shown tethered to a generic hand held item .D via a chain .C . The combination of a BIRD and an item tethered together or integrated into a unit is referred to as a BIRDed item .

In this particular figure the first BIRDed item . that is the generic hand held item .D and the BIRD . are shown as being approximately to scale with the BIRD . being roughly the same size as the hand held item .D which may for example be a typical hand held item.

In an alternative embodiment a standalone BIRD . may be substantially smaller than many hand held items as suggested by the smaller BIRD . again drawn approximately to scale with the generic hand held item .D . Such a BIRD . may have less available surface space and so fewer available surface interface controls than a larger BIRD . . Such a BIRD . may still have available extensive control features but some of these may be accessed via a configuration computer or cell phone as discussed further below see for example . 

For some authorized users AU and some items a smaller BIRD . may be desirable for a number of reasons including considerations of being lighter less expensive less obtrusive taking up less space in the authorized user s pocket and other reasons as well.

BIRD . is an exemplary small or narrow design which may also be referred to as a slimline credit card style or compact BIRD . . Such a design may be distinguished by being thinner or lighter than other BIRDs . . Such a design may have a somewhat reduced feature set as compared with some other BIRDs . for example by having fewer sensors or lower resolutions sensors fewer communications ports less memory a smaller or more compact display or local input .L and so on. Such a slimline BIRD . may be especially suited for use in relatively tight confines such as within a wallet .W .

It should be noted however that with continued advances in technology and miniaturization the designs functionality and features of a larger BIRD . and smaller and or slimmer BIRDs . . may converge with time at least to some extent.

In an alternative embodiment a BIRD may be incorporated into the physical structure of an item to be monitored or reported on by the BIRD for example a BIRD . incorporated into a briefcase handle or elsewhere in briefcase .C or a BIRD . incorporated into the structure of a tennis racket .R or a BIRD . may be incorporated into the structure of an umbrella .S or a BIRD . may be incorporated into the cover or spine of a book or other printed reading matter.

BIRD technology may also be incorporated into items which are already processor based such as computers cell phones and other personal digital assistants PDAs . This is discussed further below in conjunction with pertaining to active items .Act and in conjunction with other figures throughout this document.

Panel P of illustrates elements associated with the method. The item is assumed to have a projection component surface or contact area .G to which an electrically conducting element may be attached. For example the item may have a handle or grip .G . A segment of such a grip .G is shown in Panel .

An exemplary electrical conducting element is an item validation marker .IVM which may be distributed to a user of a BIRD for example as part of the overall package of items when a BIRD is sold to a consumer . In an embodiment the item validation marker .IVM may be a thin rectangular strip of material which has two sides i a first side with an attachment means .IVM.A which in an embodiment may be an adhesive material and ii a second side with an electrically conductive coating .IVM.C which may be composed of known electrically conducting materials such as copper iron aluminum silver or alloys of these and other metals or other conducting materials. In an embodiment sandwiched between the first and second sides .IVM.A .IVM.C of the strip .IVM may be a non conducting base or substrate such as a flexible polymer or similar material not shown. In alternative embodiment the substrate is not present and the adhesive material .IVM.A is applied directly to a conducting material .IVM.C .

The BIRD may also be configured with an element for attachment to the item for example an item collar .IC . In an embodiment the item collar .IC is itself electrically non conducting but has two electrically conducting pads .ID.E each of which is physically separate from the other. Each of the two conducting pads .IC.E is connected to a separate conducting wire .W which is part of and runs along the length of the BIRD s tether . In the figure only the electrically conducting wires .W .W are shown see also panel any associated non conducting insulator or sleeve of the tether is not illustrated. At the far end of the tether also not shown in the figure the two wires .W are connected to the BIRD s item link integrity detection module discussed above in conjunction with .

In panel P the item validation marker .IVM is attached to the item . For example the marker .IVM may be wrapped around the grip .G of the item with the adhesive side .IVM.A attached to the item and the conducting side .IVM.C externally exposed.

In panel P the item collar .IC is attached to the item validation marker .IVM in such a way that the conducting pads .IC.E face interior to the grip .G . Consequently the conducting pads .IC.E are in contact with the conducting side .IVM.C of the item validation marker .IVM . A closure or attachment means not shown ensures that the item collar .IC is securely attached to the grip .G and will not readily or casually slip off the item validation marker .IVM .

Panel P illustrates an exemplary configuration of the BIRDed item when the item collar .IC is attached to the item in normal use. The two conducting wires of the tether extend from the BIRD to the item grip .G . An electrical current i generated by the BIRD can make a round trip through the tether in one direction into one conducting pad .IC.E through the item validation marker .IVM into the other conducting pad .IC.E back down the tether and back to the BIRD . The BIRD s item link integrity detection module not shown in the figure see can detect the integrity of the current flow and so detect that the item remains tethered to the BIRD .

Panel P illustrates an exemplary configuration of the BIRD and item when the system has experienced a rupture in the integrity of link between the BIRD and item . For example if a thief steals the item the thief may attempt to prevent the BIRD from assessing the change in item state by physically separating the BIRD and item . This may involve tearing the tether between BIRD and item. The rupture in link integrity is represented by the break b in the tether . The break b interrupts the flow of current i . The interruption of current flow may be detected by the BIRD s item link integrity detection module . The module can then trigger the BIRD to generate an alarm or signal.

Panel P shows another view of an exemplary item validation marker .IVM . In this view the marker .IVM has an attached smart chip .SM . The smart chip .SM may include non volatile RAM NVRAM or other storage means which can be configured to include specific data about the item . With the smart chip .SM attached to the item a tethered BIRD may be able to read specific data about the item and verify that the correct item is associated with the BIRD .

Panel P shows another view of an exemplary item validation marker .IVM . In this view the marker .IVM is composed of multiple elements Z . . . Zn each with a different impedance. In the illustration there are three elements Z Z Z in parallel with three different impedances. Each parallel element Z Z Z is separated by an insulating element not illustrated . In an embodiment the item collar .IC not illustrated in panel has multiple electrodes which are configured and arranged so as to read the impedances of the separate elements of the strip. By employing for different items different item validation markers .IVM with different impedance elements it is possible to impedance code an item to give each item a substantially unique identifying encoding.

The elements and methods described immediately above in conjunction with for enabling a BIRD to determine the integrity of its link with an item and possibly to further identify the item or aspects of the item based on an identity encoding attached to the item are exemplary only and should in no way be construed as limiting. Variations may be envisioned on both the item validation marker .IVM and the item collar .IC such variations falling within the teachings and scope of the present system and method. Other methods and technologies such as radio frequency tagging of the item and radio frequency monitoring by the BIRD may be employed. Other methods may be envisioned as well within the teachings and scope of the present system and method.

 ii establishing numerous other operational parameters which may control aspects of BIRD usage in daily life.

Systems and methods for establishing usage expectations as per item i are discussed throughout this document see for example A F A B A I A C A B D G and other figures throughout this document.

In an embodiment various hardware elements and software parameters of the BIRD in addition to usage expectations are configurable to fine tune BIRD operations as per item ii immediately above. Configuration may be accomplished through any number of user interface means including for example and without limitation uploading configuration parameters into the BIRD via a configuration computer or configuring the BIRD through configuration dialog boxes displayed on the BIRD s display .D .

One set of elements which may be configured are the BIRD s sensors . illustrates an exemplary Sensor Configuration Dialog .

The Sensor Configuration Dialog includes for example a first set of data entry fields . used to configure the motion sensor .M . The Sensor Configuration Dialog also includes a second set of data entry fields . used to configure the air pressure sensor .AP .

The illustration in of only a single configuration dialog box pertaining to a single set of BIRD hardware features the sensors is exemplary only and should not be construed as limiting. Numerous other aspects of the BIRD s hardware and operations may be configurable as well including for example without limitation 

Persons skilled in the relevant will appreciate that in some embodiments of the present system and method there may be some overlap or interaction between establishing usage expectations and establishing other aspects or parameters involved in configuring BIRD operations.

The present system and method associates an item which is typically a conventional portable object of some kind with a BIRD . To put the present system and method into use it may be necessary to first configure the BIRD with various control and reporting parameters. During a configuration phase of the present system and method an authorized user AU or other person authorized to control an item such as an administrator establishes the necessary BIRD operating parameters. Once the configuration is complete the item and associated BIRD may be put to use in the field for general use by the user or authorized owner.

In an embodiment the distinction between configuration and field use is really more a distinction of time rather than location. The BIRD must first be configured a process which may include taken the BIRD and associated item out to wherever the item is normally used or stored. Following the training period any usage of the BIRD whether in a home base .HB storage location or in a daily life location .DL or even in an out of bounds location .OoB constitutes field use.

Configuration entails preparing the BIRD to effectively monitor the item for an item state of extant normal . . or displaced anomalous . . . Field use entails putting the BIRD to work as an active portable item reporting device.

In an embodiment a BIRD once configured can modify and update its configuration during field use. In such an embodiment BIRD configuration may be an ongoing process either continuous or intermittent which is coincident in time with BIRD field use.

Configuring a BIRD may entail setting a variety of parameters which control or influence BIRD operations. Included in BIRD configuration is the establishment of usage expectations discussed in conjunction with which distinguish between extant normal item behavior . . versus displaced anomalous item behavior . . .

In an embodiment the BIRD is configured with parameters which define expected sensor readings and or expected ranges of sensor readings and or expected data values that will be yielded in the field by sensor readings and processed sensor values .P . The expected sensor readings which are embedded in the usage expectations reflect the expected behavior s use s and or environment s of an item .

Expected behaviors uses environments include for example and without limitation those associated with the item when the item is extant . that is when the item is present or located when and where it s expected to be.

In an alternative embodiment of the usage expectations the BIRD is configured with parameters which define expected sensor readings and or expected ranges of sensor readings and or expected data values for one or more displaced anomalous . . behaviors of an item . Displaced anomalous . . behaviors users environments include for example and without limitation the behavior environments of the item when the item is lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. . In an alternative embodiment configuration of the BIRD via usage expectations is based on both extant normal item environments . . and on displaced anomalous item environments . . .

In step the authorized user AU either logs directly into the BIRD via a BIRD user interface element or the user may connect to the BIRD via an external configuration device see below and then log in to the BIRD . Logging in entails the authorized user AU validating his or her identity to the BIRD via such means as a user name and password or via a biometric signature .

In step the user configures the BIRD via entry of suitable parameters such as usage expectations and other parameters. The user may enter such data via dialog boxes and software wizards and others which may be implemented by BIRD Navigation voice interface direct code entry upload of configuration files and similar means. Exemplary means and methods of entry of configuration data by a user are discussed further below in conjunctions with D F A B A I A C and elsewhere through this document.

In an embodiment however step entails establishing future expected values for usage data .U in total referred to as usage expectations based at least in part on the authorized user s anticipated or planned use of the item . For example if the authorized user AU as part of his or her ExD criteria anticipates carrying the item about to certain expected locations .L or within particular geographic boundaries .L the expected sensor readings for location .Loc will be based on those ExD locations or boundaries.

In an embodiment a BIRD may be configured to determine anomalous usage . based on readings from a single sensor such as a location sensor .L or a motion sensor .M . However data from a single sensor may be ambiguous in the sense that single sensor data may not always be a reliable indicator of an extant normal item state . . or a displaced anomalous item state . . . To gain a more reliable determination of whether an item is extant . or is displaced . lost misappropriated misplaced wandering stolen or otherwise in an anomalous state . it is desirable to make extant normal state . . versus displaced anomalous state . . determinations based on interpretations of data from multiple sensors as discussed further below.

In an embodiment future expected sensor readings ranges and or processed values that is usage expectations are based at least in part on an historical record of past usage of the item by the authorized user AU . is a flowchart of a second exemplary method for an owner or other authorized user AU to configure a BIRD based on deliberate scheduled historical recording of item usage. Such a period of deliberate scheduled training of the BIRD is referred to as a training session or a training session.

In step the user tethers physically connects or links the BIRD to its associated item . If the BIRD is structurally integrated into an associated item then this step is not necessary.

In step the user initiates configuration monitoring by the BIRD . Configuration monitoring entails monitoring of the environment by the BIRD s sensors as would also be done in routine daily field use of the BIRD and associated item . However in a configuration monitoring mode the BIRD is primed to use the sensor data so obtained in order to identify or help identify appropriate usage expectations . As part of setting the BIRD in configuration monitoring mode the user may indicate whether the identification will proceed according to either of steps or . In an embodiment steps and represent alternate configuration modes which cannot be done at the same time. However analysis results from both modes may contribute to the definition of usage expectations . In an alternative embodiment both steps and may be performed concurrently.

In step the user engages in normal or routine daily life activities with normal or routine usage of the item . The user specifically makes sure that the item is NOT lost misplaced misappropriated stolen or wandering during the period of time required for configuration. The period of time may vary being as little as a few hours or even less time in some cases up to several days or weeks. Generally a longer period of time allows the BIRD to obtain more extensive data for analysis. This step may substantially contribute to the identification of usage expectations for item location .Loc as well as helping define other appropriate usage expectations .

IteMetrics In step the user engages in use of the item in defined specific usage contexts. For example the user may indicate to the BIRD that the item will be used while the user is walking indoors or that the item will be used while the user is seated indoors etc. The user then proceeds to use the item in the manner or context indicated. The BIRD then collects sensor data pertaining to the indicated item usage. This step may substantially contribute to the identification of iteMetrics as well as helping define other appropriate usage expectations .

In step the BIRD analyzes sensor readings from the training period also known as a training period to arrive at suitable item usage expectations . Regarding methods steps and exemplary embodiments of the associated BIRD analysis are discussed in conjunction with A C and A below as well as in conjunction with other figures throughout this document.

A BIRD will typically need initial configuration by its authorized user AU or other authorized party such as a system administrator. In some cases a BIRD may effectively monitor the state of its associated item for an indefinite period of time based on the initial configuration. In an alternative embodiment however a BIRD may be configured to continually refined and update usage expectations either automatically or with intermittent user input and BIRD user interaction. The updates may be based on additional data acquired from routine extant non anomalous use of the item by the user but may also be based on data acquired during displaced anomalous item use . . . More generally there may be occasions when the BIRD provides alerts or messages the user of possible anomalous use . . The user may then confirm anomalous use . or signal the BIRD that the anomaly report was itself erroneous. In an embodiment such user feedback to the BIRD enables the BIRD to further refine or fine tune usage expectations .

Method begins with step . In step the BIRD is physically coupled to the item . If necessary the user also logs in self identifies to the BIRD via a user name password or biometric identification or similar.

In step the owner or authorized user AU initiates environmental monitoring by the BIRD . In an embodiment this may be accomplished automatically when the BIRD is powered on. In an alternative embodiment environmental monitoring commences upon a specific designated user input action via an interface element or a remote command via communications interface . In an alternative embodiment environmental monitoring commences automatically upon login step .

In step the BIRD employing sensors and other internal data processing elements and possibly other elements maintains ongoing environmental monitoring as the user goes about his or her general life activities. The activities may entail movement to various locations .L and movement within various locations .L . The BIRDed item may at times be on the person of or in close proximity to the authorized user AU during parts of this time and at other points in time such as when the BIRDed item is in storage the BIRDed item may not be on the person of or in proximity to the authorized user AU .

In step the BIRD emits a local alert and or transmits suitable notification if sensed environmental conditions that is usage data .P suggest a likelihood that the attached item may be lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. stolen .. wandering .. or otherwise in some anomalous usage . . The notification is received by an owner of the item or by another authorized party through any number of means and methods discussed further below.

In step discussed immediately above the user may log in to the BIRD that is self identify and authenticate via a user name password or biometric identification . In an embodiment certain login requirements are hard coded into the BIRD and cannot be changed by the authorized user AU . In an alternative embodiment the requirements for login in may be determined by the user via configuration settings. Possible login options include for example and without limitation 

A user may have multiple different items each with an associated BIRD . Logging into each BIRD on a frequent basis may prove to be an inconvenience for the user. In an embodiment items may be part of item teams discussed further below in conjunction with and other figures throughout this document. One or more BIRDs may function as a principal reporting item .PRI of the item team see for more on principal reporting items .PRI . In an embodiment a user may login to all BIRDs of the item team by logging in through the principal reporting item .PRI . The principal reporting item .PRI may be configured to notify all other BIRDs of the team that the identify of the authorized user AU has been properly validated.

As per step of method discussed above a BIRD may be directly configured by the user with parameters which define expected usage data .P based on data from the sensors for expected behaviors or expected uses of an associated item .

Configuration may be accomplished in whole or in part directly via the local I O of the BIRD . However configuration of the BIRD may also be accomplished in whole or in part via a remote programming device which is coupled with the BIRD .

Appropriate configuration parameters some of which are discussed further below may be uploaded into the BIRD from the configuration device via the BIRD communications link . The same upload process and path may also be used to upload required software upgrades into the BIRD . The same BIRD communications link may also be used to download stored data from the BIRD to the configuration device . Note that while the BIRD is shown in the figure with an item attached in an embodiment an item need not be attached to the BIRD during the processes of data upload or data download.

Appropriate parameters may be entered into the PC through a variety of means including but not limited to configuration dialog boxes for example elements and others discussed in part above and further below.

As discussed above in conjunction with the use of a configuration computer for BIRD configuration may support or enable BIRD embodiments with reduced size weight and power consumption due to reduced user interface hardware functionality on the BIRD itself.

In an embodiment initial BIRD configuration which may entail substantial setup and a relatively elaborate user interface may be done via a larger configuration computer with a larger display keyboard etc. while relatively minor fine tuning and field adjustment of the BIRD may readily be done via a cell phone or similar. In an alternative embodiment all configuration of the BIRD may be done via a cell phone or similar small readily portable processor based device.

As per step of method the BIRD presents and or transmits notification if environmental conditions as reported by the sensors suggest a likelihood that the attached item may be displaced . lost misplaced misappropriated stolen wandering or otherwise in some anomalous usage . or anomalous context. The notification is targeted towards an authorized owner or authorized user AU of the item or to another authorized party.

The BIRD includes local signaling elements already discussed above which are used by the BIRD to provide local indications and warnings to persons in immediate proximity to the BIRD of possible displaced anomalous item usage . . or condition. In the local signaling elements are illustrated as being external to the BIRD but this is primarily for purposes of illustration in an embodiment the local signaling elements are an integrated element of the BIRD structure though in an alternative embodiment some or all local signaling elements may be part of an auxiliary or secondary structure or device not shown .

The BIRD includes remote communication transceivers already discussed above which are used by the BIRD to provide remote messaging and reports for example to an authorized user AU of the item or to other appropriate authorities of possible displaced anomalous item usage . . or condition. In the remote transceivers are illustrated as being external to the BIRD but this is primarily for purposes of illustration in an embodiment the remote transceivers are an integrated element of the BIRD structure though in an alternative embodiment some or all local signaling elements may be part of an auxiliary or secondary structure or device not shown .

In an embodiment the reporting system relies upon one or more dispersed wide area network WAN systems such as for example and without limitation the internet a cell phone network the plain old telephone system POTS cable network systems or possibly a dedicated corporate government or other institutional intranet. The WAN enables communication between the BIRD and remote reporting facilities and elements via communications links which may include either wired or wireless elements or both.

The reporting system may include communications devices or data processing devices which belong to the authorized owner or other authorized user AU of the BIRD and its associated item . Such communications devices or data processing devices receive notification of anomalous item behavior and may include for example and without limitation a cell phone a personal computer and a notebook computer tablet computer or other PDA .

The reporting system may also include a Lost Anomalous Reporting Center LARC . A LARC may be for example a conventional lost and found at a public facility a police station a private security facility a fire station or similar institutional or organizational reporting center which is equipped to address and resolve issues of lost misplaced misappropriated wandering stolen and or otherwise anomalous items.

The reporting system may also include anomalous item servers AISs which are configured to receive and process data pertaining to lost misplaced misappropriated stolen wandering or otherwise anomalous items.

The reporting system may also include a link or links to members .IT of item teams . Items teams item team members .IT and item links are discussed further below in this document in conjunction with A B and other figures as well.

Anomaly signals or reports may have an associated anomaly alert level AAL which indicates a probability that the alert is valid. For example anomalies may be rated on a color coded scale red yellow orange blue or similar or on a numeric scale for example 5 for certainly or near certainty of anomaly 4 3 and 2 for progressively less probable and 1 for some risk of anomaly . The intensity type and duration of signaling of reporting may be determined in part based on the AAL. The selection of target for an alert or report for example whether or not to notify a LARC may be based in part on the AAL. This reduces a risk of hammering the authorities with erroneous alerts of lost items. Alternatively all alerts may be reported to a LARC but with the associated AAL as well. Suitable filtering of alerts by AALs may be done at the LARC . 

Both terms may refer to a relatively specific description of how an item is actually being used by a person whether an authorized user AU or otherwise or has been used in its substantially immediate short term history for example the past minute the past ten minutes the past hour etc. or the state of the environment in which the item is found or the environment to which the item is subject either at the current moment or in its substantially immediate short term history.

Alternatively both terms may refer to a relatively specific description of how an item may be used or is expected to be used in the future or to a relatively specific state of the environment in which the item is expected to be found or the environment to which the item may be subject in the future.

An item s usage data .U is based on sensor data and or processed sensor data .P and is based on an item s actual item usage conditions which typically vary over time and which may or may not reflect usage by an authorized user AU .

An item s usage expectations embody a collection of expected item usage conditions for different times dates and expected locations .L assuming item usage by an authorized user AU . That is usage expectations are based on the item s expected usage assuming the item remains substantially under the control of an authorized user AU . 

Usage expectations typically refer to environmental conditions which are expected to surround an item and or to environmental forces or phenomena to which an item may be subject when the item remains substantially under the control of the authorized user AU or remains in appropriate storage as would be expected by the authorized user AU . Environmental conditions may include for example and without limitation the locations s .L in which an item is found or used the temperature ranges .G to which the item is subject the ambient light and or sound levels .G to which the item is subject velocities .M which the item may experience accelerations .M to which the item may be subject and other environmental factors .G chemical radiological and similar to which the item may be subject. Multiple examples of usage expectations are provided in conjunction with below as well as with other figures throughout this document.

As already discussed above an owner or other authorized user AU of a BIRD may establish usage expectations for the BIRD . In an embodiment the usage expectations are determined by the user based on the user s specific ExD criteria . The ExD criteria are general criteria for when the item is to be considered extant . or otherwise in normal use versus when the item is to be considered displaced . that is lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen or otherwise anomalous . . In an embodiment BIRD navigation discussed further below assists in the translation of the user s ExD criteria into formal usage expectations .

In an alternative embodiment the BIRD s usage expectations are identified in whole or in part by the BIRD itself via algorithms or processing provided by BIRD Navigation based on sensor data identified during periods of BIRD training.

In the figure the ExD criteria are illustrated in a box with a dotted line indicating that these are informal or plain language identifications of how an item is expected to be used and or how the item may be displaced . . The formal criteria employed by the BIRD the mathematical logical or other symbolic representations employed by the BIRD to distinguish extant normal states . . versus displaced anomalous item states . . are the usage expectations . In an embodiment the ExD criteria form a basis for defining usage expectations . The authorized user AU may enter ExD criteria which are translated in step via BIRD algorithms BIRD Navigation into usage expectations or the authorized user AU may directly enter usage expectations via the configuration computer . In an embodiment a BIRD is configured with BIRD Navigation suitable for identifying usage expectations based on the authorized user s ExD criteria .

During a training period the BIRD and its associated item are always in some environment with the user AU being careful to engage in normal item usage and or normal item storage. In for simplicity only the environment is illustrated without the presence of the user AU or item . BIRD sensors captures date regarding environmental phenomena which impinges on the BIRD from the environment . In step during a training period and based on the data from BIRD s sensors the BIRD Navigation identifies substantially real time or time proximate environmental conditions and usage conditions for the item .

In an embodiment step of process corresponds to step of method discussed above in conjunction with . In an embodiment step corresponds to steps through of method discussed above in conjunction with .

After the BIRD is configured the user AU keeps the BIRD tethered to the appropriate item . The user AU then goes about life activities as normal. While the user AU no doubt intends not to lose the item misplace the item have the item stolen etc. such events may occur. In step throughout the day and night BIRD logic methods and algorithms discussed in detail throughout this document compares the real time usage conditions .U against expected usage or environmental conditions as embodied in usage expectations . In step and based on the comparison the BIRD logic makes a determination of whether its associated item is extant . or displaced . or more generally whether the item is in a normal state . or anomalous state . .

If the determination is that the item is in a displaced state . or anomalous state . then in step the BIRD issues signal or reports of the displaced anomalous state . . and may take other response actions as well. The algorithms and methods associated with these responses are associated with BIRD song discussed further below.

In an embodiment a BIRD may employ numerous methods algorithms system services software modules hardware modules API s user interfaces internal system interfaces multi component system layers and or other service resources to implement the teachings systems and methods described herein. Exemplary methods algorithms services modules etc. are described throughout this document. In an embodiment and for purposes of system description these method algorithms services modules and similar internal BIRD resources may be grouped or categorized in a variety of ways.

An exemplary summary description of some BIRD methods algorithms services and modules is presented in . The summary is for purposes of teaching and clarity of exposition only and should in no way be construed as limiting.

 ii expectations of values for derived or integrated data products that is processed data P which can be distilled extracted or otherwise synthesized from raw sensor data .

In aggregate and in an embodiment the stored data or parameters which are representative of expected item usage are referred to as usage expectations . In an alternative embodiment usage expectations may take the alternative or additional form of representations of sensor data indicative of expected sensor data when the associated item is not subject to normal or conventional use storage.

The term navigation in conventional use is typically associated with location and motion only that is navigation conventionally refers to where something or someone is located or how something or someone is moving at a particular time. As understood and defined in this document however the term navigation is broader and may refer to for example and without limitation elements of 

BIRD logic is broadly synonymous with the computational intelligence of a BIRD and is implemented through instructions stored in memory running on the BIRD s processor in conjunction with other BIRD hardware all of which are discussed throughout this document.

. . . to identify whether the current state of the item is extant normal . . or is displaced anomalous . . .

At points throughout the figures BIRD logic is illustrated symbolically by the image of a bird a Robyn .

As discussed above a BIRD may alert a user to potentially displaced states . or anomalous states . through local signal emitted via the BIRD s local signaling or through messages transmitted via communications transceivers to another local device such as a cell phone or an item attached to person .ATP see . Control of such local signaling is implemented in part or in whole via local BIRD song which is discussed inter alia in association with and other figures throughout this document.

As also discussed above including in conjunction with above a BIRD may alert an authorized user AU or other appropriate authorities to potentially displaced states . and or anomalous states . through remote reporting which entails messages transmitted via communications transceivers to remote devices . Control of such remote reporting is implemented in part or in whole via remote BIRD song which is discussed inter alia in association with and other figures throughout this document.

In an embodiment exemplary method may require that suitable usage expectations have previously been defined and stored in the BIRD as discussed in association with various figures throughout this document.

In an embodiment exemplary method may require that when the BIRD is first obtained by a user for example upon or shortly after purchase the user configures or programs the BIRD with a suitable personal identification signature see above . For example the user may provide a keyed in or spoken password or a biometric signature such as a thumbprint facial image or retinal scan . The BIRD retains the signature in memory . Thereafter the BIRD may request or require user identification either upon activation or at some regular interval to be programmed for example once per day or once per week . In this way the BIRDed item may authenticate an authorized user AU . More than one authorized user AU may be programmed into the BIRD and the identification step discussed below may be optional.

Method begins with step which in an embodiment may be performed substantially simultaneously with step . Steps and are associated with step of method already discussed above in conjunction with . Steps and entail identifying for the BIRD both the authorized user AU and also the item associated with the BIRD . In an embodiment a user may identify himself or herself to the BIRD via a variety of authentication mechanisms or biometric determinations as discussed elsewhere in this document. The user may also identify the item to which the BIRD is attached.

In alternative embodiments either or both of steps and or may be optional or may need to be performed only infrequently. For example a user may log in to a BIRD upon initial use and also identify the item with which the BIRD is associated. Following the initial login user authentication the BIRD may be configured to not require further user authentication or item identification for prolonged or indefinite periods of time provided only that the BIRD does not assess any kind of displaced anomalous item states . . . In an alternative embodiment the BIRD may be configured so as to require the authorized user AU to refresh his or her authentication and item identification at periodic intervals.

In an alternative embodiment the step of item identification step is either not needed at all or is an entirely automated process 

In an embodiment in step the BIRD identifies the expected environmental condition s usage s and or usage expectations for an associated item . This step is applicable if more than one detection context has been defined for the item . For example in an embodiment multiple usage contexts may be defined based on time range and expected location .L . The BIRD may then identify the current time .T and current location .L to determine the appropriate detection context and then load the appropriate matching usage expectations for example from long term storage in NVRAM .M.N in general operating memory .M.D .

In an alternative embodiment multiple usage contexts may be defined based on time range only with expected locations .L if any instead being an element of the usage expectations . In such an embodiment the BIRD may identify the current time .T to determine the appropriate detection context and again load the appropriate matching usage expectations .

This step is also applicable if the BIRD has been configured for use with more than one item and or more than one authorized user AU . In this case the BIRD may store different sets of usage expectations associated with the different users and or items . Identifying the appropriate usage expectations entails identifying the usage expectations suitable for the current authorized user AU and item as determined in steps and above . If the BIRD is configured with usage expectations for only a single item and a single authorized user AU step may still entail loading the usage expectations from a long term storage for example NVRAM .M.N or secondary memory .S into higher speed volatile memory such as DRAM .M.D .

In step the BIRD initiates or continues real time environmental monitoring and or usage monitoring for its associated item receiving real time sensor data .R see below from sensors . Step is associated with step user initiates monitoring by BIRD and step routine item use storage of method discussed above in conjunction with .

Steps and all discussed immediately below are associated with step of method discussed above in conjunction with . Step of method broadly entails normal use of the item by the authorized user AU and or normal storage of the item but in either case with the possibility of the item becoming displaced . or otherwise changing to an anomalous item state . .

Steps and described immediately below entail storage and processing of sensor data . In an embodiment these two steps may be mutually interdependent and may occur substantially in parallel or in rapid alternation. This is indicated in the flowchart by the dual direction arrows between the two steps .

In step the BIRD populates and or updates an internal environmental data log and or usage pattern database see below based on the sensor data .R received in step . The database is maintained in the BIRD s memory see for example and other figures throughout this document and stores historical sensor data .H and processed sensor data .P in aggregate the stored data constitutes usage data .U .

In step the BIRD analyzes current and or recent historical environmental sensor data to generated processed data .P . Analysis may take a variety of forms including for example and without limitation 

The mathematical calculations of step based on the raw environmental sensor data yield processed environmental data values .P . See and in particular method Meth and other figures throughout this document for further discussion.

Based on the comparison the BIRD determines if the usage data .H for the item are in conformance with or fall within boundaries or parameters specified for expected item conditions usage . Analysis and comparison are done by the BIRD s processor . In an embodiment step applies and encompasses the BIRD logic . See E E F G and other figures throughout this document for exemplary BIRD logic associated with step . See also figures throughout this document for discussions of sensor data analysis.

The application of BIRD logic may determine the that current usage data .H for the item is in conformance with or fall within boundaries or parameters specified by the usage expectations resulting in the BIRDed item self assessing a state of being extant normal . . . In this event method may continue with a return to step further environmental monitoring. Optionally for example at timed intervals the method may first proceed to step where a message signal or report is sent indicating that there are no signs of item displacement anomaly . . . The method then proceeds from step to step further environmental monitoring.

The application of BIRD logic may determine the that current usage data .U for the item is not in conformance with or does not fall within boundaries or parameters specified by the usage expectations . This results in a self assessment by the BIRDed item of being in a state which is displaced . or otherwise anomalous . . In this event the method proceeds to step where self initiated reporting by the BIRD occurs.

By self initiated reporting is meant a report or signal transmitted from or produced by the BIRD only in response to its own self assessment in step without any preceding time proximate prompt by the authorized user AU owner or other third party device. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the BIRD may receive time proximate data from third party devices for example location data from GPS systems or other sources. However in an embodiment no third party device is required for data analysis or assessment that the item is displaced anomalous . . . The displacement anomaly . . assessment is made solely by the BIRDed item and in that sense the subsequent reporting or signaling by the BIRDed item is self initiated.

In step a report or message is sent by the BIRD and or a local and or remote signal is issued by the BIRD indicating that its associated item may be displaced . or otherwise in an anomalous context or usage . . See for example discussion associated with B C B and other figures throughout this document.

If in step a determination is made that the environment of the item or the usage of the item is potentially displaced anomalous . . then the method may also proceed to step in addition to or possibly in place of step . In step the BIRD initiates other procedures for displaced states . lost misplaced misappropriated stolen wandering or other anomalous item states . . Some of these procedures may be internal such as for example and without limitation 

From steps and or the method typically proceeds back to step continued environmental monitoring. In an embodiment this continued environmental monitoring may include monitoring for a renewed authorized user AU login authentication indicating that the authorized user AU has regained possession of and control over the BIRDed item .

In an alternative embodiment steps and may include discrimination of the anomaly alert level AAL already discussed above which indicates the estimated probability by the BIRD that the alert that is the determination of anomalous item behavior . is valid.

Steps and implement elements of BIRD logic and BIRD song performing the necessary computational methods and algorithms on the BIRD s processor based on data from the sensors data stored in memory instructions stored in memory and possibly data from other BIRD elements such as the item link integrity detector the clock calendar time and possibly other elements as well.

In an embodiment determinations of a displaced anomalous item state . . as per step of method above may fall into one of two categories 

 1 Determinations based on a substantially instantaneous or short term event or state change. Such a determination by BIRD logic might entail for example receiving data from the BIRD s location sensor .L indicating that the associated item is outside of a specified region or boundary even briefly or receiving data from the BIRD s motion sensor .M indicating that the associated item is in motion at a time or place when where the item should not be in motion.

 2 Determinations based on a pattern of environmental conditions which occur over a period of time or a duration of time typically a recent period duration of time. Such events may be related to location or movement for example the item being outside a specified geographic region home base .HB or daily life .DL regions for more than a designated period of time. However such longer term determinations of displacement or anomaly . . may also be based on iteMetric events or changes including for example and without limitation 

In some cases a non transitory sustained variations or changes in sensor data from a baseline normal condition to some other condition may be required to be indicative of displaced anomalous item state . . .

By a recent period of time is meant a time frame reflective of an item s usage or environment dating from the current moment or the substantially current time .T into the substantially immediate past. For example a BIRD may analyze historical sensor data .H for the immediate past minute the immediate past five or ten minutes or the immediate past hour. Determinations of whether an item is in the correct location or is subject to expected user movements .M or whether the item is subject to expected intensities of light or sound .G may typically be made based on analysis of sensor data from within relatively short time frames these time frames may range from a few seconds into the past up to an several hours into the past. Analysis of BIRD sensor data based on such time frames permits a relatively timely identification of whether an item may be lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. .

For certain other types of analyses a self assessment of whether an overall daily pattern of item usage is consistent with established daily item usage pattern .P .AU of an authorized user AU may require somewhat longer times frames such as eight hours a day or even several days prior. Analysis by BIRD logic of BIRD sensor data for such longer time frames hours to days may identify an item as possibly lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. even when short term few minutes to an hour analysis failed to make such a determination.

The exemplary modules shown may be implemented through software stored in the BIRD s memory and running on the BIRD s processor or through a variety of dedicated BIRD processors or though one or more specialized subprocessors of a single processor or through a combination of the processor and firmware or through a combination of the above or through any other suitable processing means. The processing modules serve to implement the steps of exemplary method discussed above in conjunctions with the steps of other methods of BIRD Navigation . BIRD logic and BIRD song disclosed throughout this document and to implement other methods which may be appropriate or suitable for the BIRD .

 i environmental conditions which are expected or typical of an attached item which is in an extant normal state . . and or . . .

 ii environmental conditions which are expected or typical of an attached item which is in a displaced anomalous state . . .

In an embodiment the expected environmental conditions module receives usage expectations for expected environmental conditions for an item . In an alternative embodiment the expected environmental conditions module may also implement some elements of BIRD navigation . For example during a training or training session the expected environmental conditions module may use reporting from the real time monitoring module and conditions analysis modules both discussed below to establish appropriate usage expectations for an item or to modify usage expectation previously provided by an authorized user AU .

In addition to receiving and or establishing the usage expectations the expected environmental conditions module may perform additional data processing as well. Such processing may include for example and without limitation 

The details of such processing parsing if any by the expected environmental conditions module may vary in different embodiments of the present system and method and may depend in particular on highly specific coding implementations.

Current Expected Usage CEU In particular and in an embodiment the expected environmental conditions module may extract from the usage expectations a subset of data or data structures referred to as current expected usage CEU . While usage expectations may provide extensive data pertaining to expected sensor data at various times and or in various places current expected usage may include only data pertaining to expected sensor readings for the current time .T and or the current location .L . To extract the current expected usage may also rely on time date data .D from the clock calendar as well as data from various sensors such as the location sensor L .

In an alternative embodiment any determination of the current expected usage may be performed by the conditions analysis module or by the comparison and assessment module both discussed immediately below. In an alternative embodiment any determination of current expected usage may be distributed over several modules.

The real time monitoring module receives real time sensor data .R from the sensors and also current expected usage from the expected environmental conditions module . Current expected usage may be employed by the real time monitoring module for purposes of filtering and consolidating sensor data . The real time monitoring module also passes current sensor data .R to a data storage and management module which stores the data in an historical and environmental data log . An exemplary historical and environmental data log is discussed further below in conjunction with . As can be seen the real time monitoring module implements steps and of method .

A conditions analysis module implements step of method . The conditions analysis module receives current sensor data .R and historical sensor data .H and also the current expected usage . The conditions analysis module analyzes the received data .R .H in view of the data requirements for the usage expectations and the current expected conditions and processes the received data to generate processed sensor data .P . Sec method Meth of for further discussion of such sensor data processing.

The conditions analysis module passes usage data .U which includes the current and historical sensor data and also analyzed sensor data .P back to the expected environmental conditions module which may use the data to update or validate usage expectations . The conditions analysis module also the usage data .U to a comparison and assessment module .

The comparison and assessment module in addition to receiving the usage data .U also receives the usage expectations from the expected environmental conditions module . The comparison and assessment module also receives clock calendar time data .D . Using its combined inputs the comparison and assessment module applies BIRD logic to compare the usage data .U against the usage expectations for the item thereby implementing step of method . The comparison and assessment module thereby determines if the BIRD and its associated item are most likely in an extant normal state . . of usage or instead most likely in a displaced anomalous state . . of usage. In response to these determinations the comparison and assessment module generates usage state notifications USN indicating an extant normal state . . or a displaced anomalous state . . of usage and any details for example the type of displacement . which are determined by BIRD logic based on the sensor readings.

A response module receives the usage state notifications from the comparison and assessment module . Based on the notifications the response module generates appropriate signals alerts or messages which can alert an item owner or other authorized party or system of the state of the BIRDed item . As can be seen the response module implements steps and of method .

The response module may be linked with or include a reporting module which can generate more detailed reports and or historical reports on the usage of an item . The reporting module may also draw upon data from data storage and management module . The reporting module may incorporate or support elements of BIRD song .

In an embodiment a BIRD has BIRD Navigation which implements various algorithms designed to determine or to assist an authorized user AU in determining appropriate usage expectations for the BIRD and an associated item . Several exemplary embodiments of such algorithms are discussed elsewhere in this document see for example and and associated discussion below as well as other figures throughout this document. A learning module may be coupled with the conditions analysis module . The learning module may employ the exemplary algorithms discussed herein as well as other algorithms adaptive heuristics neural network technologies and or pattern discernment technologies to identify trends or usage expectations of the BIRDed item . These recognized trends or usage expectations may then be employed by the conditions analysis module and the comparison assessment module in order to further refine the recognition of extant normal . . and displaced anomalous . . usage of an item .

A security biometrics module may be employed to implement elements of step of method including identification or recognition of an owner or other authorized user AU of the BIRD and its associated item . The security biometrics module may also work in conjunction with the response module to implement appropriate security procedures in the event that the BIRD determines the item may be in a displaced state . or other anomalous state . .

The above indicated modules are exemplary only. Additional modules or alternative modules with additional or alternative configurations additional or alternative modes of data exchange and with additional or alternative modes of operation may be employed consistent with the present teachings system and method as disclosed throughout this document. The overall scope of the processing performed by the BIRD logic modules may be different than more limited than and or broader than the scope described in the exemplary embodiment above.

In particular the BIRD processing modules may also include additional processing modules or submodules of the modules illustrated in and associated with 

It will be understood that the processing modules may include among other elements one or more logic modules one or more memory access modules one or more arithmetic modules and one or more advanced mathematical operations modules not illustrated in . These logic memory access arithmetic and advanced mathematical operations module s may be apart from but in communication with one or more of the modules illustrated in or embedded within or included as part of one or more of the modules illustrated in .

In conjunction with discussions of BIRD logic and other teachings systems and methods throughout this document reference is made herein to an expected authorized user AU of an item . In many cases an item has a single possible authorized user AU typically the owner of the item or a person granted some kind of institutional authority to use the item for some extended period of time. In such cases the expected authorized user is the same as the sole authorized user AU .

In other instances however an item may have more than one authorized user AU . For example there may be shared ownership of the item . For some particular item the appropriate usage expectations may indicate that any authorized user AU may be allowed to use the item at any time. In this case the expected authorized user AU may be any of several users.

For some other item the appropriate usage expectations may indicate that a first authorized user AU should be using the item at certain times while a second authorized user AU is allowed to use the item at other times. In this latter case the expected authorized user is time dependent and so typically detection context dependent and may be the particular authorized user AU who is allowed to use the item at a given time or in a particular detection context .

In an embodiment a BIRD may be configured to allow for usage of the item by users with limited control rights over the item or users who are allowed to use the item only for limited periods of time. As discussed above in conjunction with such users may be referred to as borrowers. At certain times and or in certain contexts as indicated by the usage expectations the expected authorized user may be a borrower of the item .

In conjunction with discussions of BIRD logic and other teachings systems and methods throughout this document reference is made herein to an ambiguous item state . . In an embodiment an ambiguous item state . is to be understood in terms of a design choice in the programming of BIRD logic .

In an embodiment BIRD logic may be configured so that for any and all possible sets of available usage data .U the BIRD will arrive at either 

 i some specific determination of a single item state for example extant . borrowed .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. lost .. stolen .. wandering .. or some other specific defined state or

 ii determinations of two or more possible well defined states with a calculated probability for each state where the total probabilities may add up to one 1 . In this latter case in an embodiment the BIRD may base a choice of response action BIRD song if any on the item state assigned the highest probability.

However in an alternative embodiment BIRD logic may be configured so that for some possible sets of available usage data .U the BIRD does not arrive at any definitive or highest probability item state . For purposes of the present system and method an ambiguous item state . is defined as an item state for which the BIRD does not arrive at any definitive or highest probability item state .

For a number of possible item contexts it may be desirable to configure the BIRD to possibly arrive at an ambiguous item state . within those contexts.

One likely context for an ambiguous item state . is when usage data .U indicates that the item is On Person .OnP and further is on the person of the authorized user AU but the item along with the authorized user AU is in an out of bounds location .OoB . For such a context the designer or programmer of BIRD logic faces a possible puzzle 

In summary while the designer programmer of the BIRD has any of several options for programming the BIRD logic there is an inherent puzzle in the case where the item along with authorized user AU is out of bounds .OoB . The out of bounds locations .OoB are defined or indicated by the authorized user AU via usage expectations as places where the item and user normally will not be. Intuitively then if the item and authorized user AU together are out of bounds .OoB this is an unexpected usage of the item . At the same time in real life usage the authorized user AU may or may not have deliberately chosen to take the BIRDed item out of bounds .OoB .

In view of these considerations the programmer designer of a specific embodiment of BIRD logic may elect to have such a state On Person .OnP of authorized user AU but out of bounds .OoB be assessed as ambiguous . . Responsive to such an assessment the BIRD may be further configured with a variety of responses. In an embodiment a response is to have the BIRD actively query the user. The query or queries may attempt to assess for example and without limitation 

 i Whether or not the authorized user AU has deliberately taken the BIRD with associated item to a location which is out of bounds .OoB and . . .

 ii whether or not this is an exceptional state of affairs or whether the usage expectations should be modified to reflect a changed definition of daily life .DL vs. out of bounds .OoB locations.

In an embodiment a possible response to an ambiguous item state . is to have the BIRD send an appropriate signal or message to a Lost Anomalous Reporting Center . Other responses may be envisioned as well.

The above provided example of an ambiguous item state . is exemplary only. In various embodiments other item states may be construed by BIRD logic as being ambiguous . . In an embodiment user configuration options for the BIRD may enable an authorized user AU to configure the BIRD regarding which types of item usages or contexts may be regarded as ambiguous states . . In an embodiment various probabilities may be assigned both to specific item states and to a further possibility that the item state is ambiguous . . If the probability of an ambiguous state . crosses a designated threshold or if the probability of the ambiguous state . is higher than the probability of any other specific item state then the item state is construed as ambiguous . .

As already discussed above see for example BIRD logic includes methods and algorithms for comparing item usage data .U against usage expectations in order to self assess if the BIRDed item is in a state of being extant . or normal . versus being a state of being displaced . lost misplaced misappropriated stolen or wandering or some other anomalous state . .

In an embodiment implementations of BIRD logic may entail comparing specific elements or subsets of item usage data .U against corresponding elements or subsets of the usage expectations . The outcome of such comparisons yields one or more item statuses . An item status may be in any of several forms including for example and without limitation 

Based on results of a single item status or based on multiple item statuses BIRD logic may then self assess an overall state of the BIRDed item .

An item can have multiple item statuses . Each status is associated with either some particular kind of data which may be sensed by an environmental sensor or by a relation among several kinds of data which can be sensed by one or more environmental sensors .

More generally an item status indicates some aspect of the relationship between the item and its environment . In an embodiment the particular value .V of an item status at any given moment in time .T may be determined by a comparison between appropriate usage data .U and the corresponding elements of usage expectations . In an embodiment the determination of item statuses is an element of step of exemplary method sec above .

As elements of method . Meth illustrates several exemplary types .T of item statuses . Each exemplary item status type .T is illustrated with a specific exemplary set of possible item status values .V . In a particular value the outcome of a comparison as discussed below is underlined.

 See above for a discussion of location schemas . A first exemplary type of item status .T is location status which is based on actual item location .L compared against item expected location s .L . For example the current location .L may be compared against the item s allowed home base locations .HB daily life locations .DL and zones .Z which are defined in the usage expectations .Loc see above and below .

The result of the comparison is a specific value .V for the location related item status indicating if the BIRDed item is in a home base location .HB a daily life location .DL a zone .Z within a home base .HB or daily life .DL location or in an out of bounds location .OoB . It will be understood that in an embodiment out of bounds locations .OoB are determined as any locations that are not home base or daily life locations .HB .DL . 

A second exemplary item status type .T is a determination as to whether the current user of the item or the most recent user of the item is an authorized user AU . Such an authorized user status determination may typically require employing multiple aspects of usage data .U to arrive at iteMetrics which are part of the overall usage data .U . See above for a discussion of iteMetrics . The current or most recent iteMetrics are then compared against the iteMetrics stored in the usage expectations . See below. The result of the comparison is a specific value .V for the authorized user item status indicating if the current user of the BIRDed item or the most recent user is an authorized user AU .

A third exemplary item status type .T is a determination of whether or not the BIRDed item is absent without leave AWOL . This again entails obtaining the current location information .L as well as the current time .T and comparing the data against the AWOL criteria in the usage expectations . See again note that AWOL criteria may be defined explicitly or implicitly in the usage expectations . Based on the comparison a value .V is obtained for the AWOL status as either Yes the item is AWOL or No the item is not AWOL .

A fourth exemplary item status type .T is a determination .OP of whether the BIRDed item is on person .OnP or off person .OffP . This determination entails comparing various usage data .U which in an embodiment may be motion data against the BIRD s criteria for whether an item is on person .OnP or off person .OffP . Based on the comparison a value .V is arrived at for the on person off person status . Note that in an embodiment appropriate on person off person criteria may be an element of BIRD logic rather than an element of usage expectations . In an alternative embodiment such on person off person criteria may be an element of usage expectations . In an alternative embodiment aspects of on person off person criteria may be distributed between BIRD logic and usage expectations . 

In an embodiment and as noted above personal motion status and on person off person status may be combined into a single integrated personal motion status . In such an embodiment a personal motion status of user movement .UM is also indicative of a status of on person .OnP . Similarly in such an embodiment a personal motion status of either stationary .StaT or stagnant .StG are both indicative of a status of off person .OffP .

Similar considerations apply to determining values .V for other types .T of item statuses such as determining whether or not an item is in transit or not in transit In Transit status or whether an item s temperature is in bounds of a specified range or too high or too low Temperature status .

The item statuses shown in are exemplary only and should in no way be construed as limiting. Numerous other item statuses may be envisioned including for example and without limitation those related to velocity values and ranges acceleration values and ranges torque values and ranges light intensity values and ranges sound intensity values and ranges humidity or moisture values and ranges indoors versus outdoors in hand or not in hand in vehicle or not in vehicle in a container item or not in a container item in storage vs. in use on vs. off for electrical items values or ranges of values for various internal processing statuses for active items .Act values or ranges of values for biometric determinations results of item usage pattern comparisons results of item usage correlation comparisons and results of other comparisons as well.

It will be noted that a single type of sensor data may be employed in the determination of multiple types .T of item statuses . For example an item s location .L may be employed both in the determination of its location status as currently being in a home base .HB daily life .DL or out of bounds .OoB location .HB .DL .OoB and also in whether or not the item is AWOL though the latter determination also requires comparison of time elements as well . Similarly motion measurements may be employed in determination of whether or not the item is on person off person and whether or not the item is in transit or not.

Further a single form of sensor data such as light intensity data temperature or sound intensity data may be employed in multiple ways for example in the form of single value comparisons to determine if the value is in a specified range or in the form of waveform data to determine if a pattern of values over time has been consistent with previously established patterns contained in the usage expectations .

The method . Meth begins with step . In step the method identifies the applicable types .T of item statuses . These may be determined for example based on the item statuses employed in a table .T of BIRD logic. Exemplary BIRD logic tables .T are presented in C F and H. Applicable types .T of item statuses may also be determined in other ways for example from the usage expectations or via a listing of status types .T associated in memory with computer code for BIRD logic algorithms.

From step the method . Meth proceeds to step . In step a first item status type .T is selected for evaluation.

In step appropriate usage data .U for the current item status type .T is obtained. The data .U may be obtained for example from the Historical Environmental Data Log see above .

In step the usage data .U obtained in step is compared against the matching usage expectations or other appropriate comparison criteria for the current item status type .T . For example for location status the BIRDed item s current location .L is compared against definitions of daily life home base and zone locations .HB .DL .Z indicated either in the usage expectations and or the detection context data .

For another example for authorized user status determination the iteMetrics obtained from the usage data .U are compared against the iteMetrics for the authorized user AU stored in the usage expectations . Similar comparisons may apply to determining AWOL status on person off person status and other statuses which may be applicable.

Based on the comparison of step a status value .V is determined for the current type .T of item status. For example and as indicated by underlined values .V in FIG. A the current location .L for the BIRDed item may be a home base location .HB and or the current user may not be an authorized user AU or the item may be AWOL and so forth.

In step it is determined whether all item status types .T which are currently applicable have been processed. If all types .T have not yet been processed the method returns to step for the selection of another type .T of item status for analysis. If all types .T have been processed the method continues to step .

In step the previously identified values .V for the item statuses are applied in order to assess the current item state . The assessment may be accomplished for example by comparing the determined values .V for the item statuses against a BIRD logic table .T . Exemplary BIRD logic tables .T are presented in C F and H below. Other means and methods may be employed as well.

The method . Meth may repeat on a substantially continuous basis or at defined time intervals to continually update both the item statuses and the resulting self assessed item states .

BIRD logic provides criteria and or methods to execute steps and of exemplary method above . Specifically BIRD logic provides criteria and or methods to compare usage data .U against usage expectations to determine if an item is on the one hand extant . or borrowed .. or otherwise in a normal state . or is on the other hand displaced . lost misplaced stolen misappropriated wandering or otherwise in an anomalous state . .

In an embodiment the association between a set of sensed environmental statuses and a consequent resulting self assessment of item state constitutes an aspect of BIRD logic .

Both and present the same thirty six status state clusters in other words the same exemplary substantive embodiment of BIRD logic but with the clusters ordered differently for purposes of reader comprehension 

The exemplary BIRD logic table .T is presented in these two different forms v1 and v2 as an aid to understanding only the exemplary BIRD logic is identical in both versions of the table. Both versions of the table v1 and v2 are referred to below simply as the table .T . Corresponding status state clusters are labeled with the same cluster number 1 2 3 . . . 36 in each table v1 and v2 .

The table .T lists exemplary possible item states extant . lost .. misplaced .. wandering .. stolen .. etc. which may be self assessed by an exemplary BIRDed item . At any given time the BIRDed item may self assess a variety of environmental statuses or attributes associated with the item as either sensor data detected directly by the BIRD s sensors or as determined by processing sensor data to obtain processed data .P . The final determination of an extant normal . . or displaced anomalous item state . . will typically entail comparing the usage data .U which includes the status determinations against the usage expectations .

For example the BIRD determines not only the item s current location which can typically be determined from sensor data but also assesses whether the item is in a home base location .HB a daily life location .DL or is out of bounds .OoB . The latter determination requires parameters established via the usage expectations which define the home base .HB daily life .DL and out of bounds .OoB locations. Similar considerations apply to assessing whether an item is merely stationary .Stat or is stagnant .StG and to assessing iteMetrics these determinations require comparing the item s usage data .U against parameters found with the usage expectations .

The item statuses listed in the table .T are exemplary only and should not be construed as limiting in any way. For a given item at a given time the associated BIRD may determine 

For example for an authorized user AU working a conventional 9 to 5 work day an item may be AWOL if it is at the user s home between the hours of 0900 and 1700 when it should be with the user at work. Similarly the item may be AWOL if it is at the user s office when it should be home with the user in the evening.

In an embodiment IteMetrics may in turn be divided into morphIteMetrics which may be determined on a relatively short term basis for example seconds a minute or a few minutes and psyIteMetrics which may require longer term analysis a few minutes to a few hours . Thus determinations based only on morphIteMetrics may be quicker but less reliable while determinations based on both morphIteMetrics and psyIteMetrics may take longer but be more reliable.

For simplicity and brevity of exposition the exemplary BIRD logic shown in does not distinguish between general iteMetrics vs. morphIteMetrics and or psyIteMetrics . However persons skilled in the relevant arts will appreciate that in an alternative embodiment the logic in the Table .T may be refined based on such distinctions.

If an item is on person .OnP the BIRD may attempt to assess the item as being carried by an authorized user AU or not being carried by an authorized user AU based at least on the item s morphIteMetrics psyIteMetrics may be taken into account at well. If the item is off person .OffP then present morphIteMetrics which in an embodiment depend on personal movement may not be available.

However in an embodiment the BIRD may identify through iteMetrics that an item is or is not associated with an authorized user AU even when the item is off person .OffP . In an embodiment the BIRD makes this determination by associating the item with the most recent iteMetrics when the item was on person .OnP .

In an alternative embodiment the BIRD may make this determination based on a combination of i the most recent morphIteMetrics when the item was on person .OnP and ii the relatively recent psyIteMetrics which may span both the current off person time period and a preceding on person time period.

In an embodiment a BIRDed item may use BIRD logic to self assess its state as being extant . including borrowed .. lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. stolen .. or wandering .. based on a combination of item statuses .

The logic table .T lists thirty six possible combinations of assessed item states with respect to the exemplary item statuses listed above. These thirty six combinations are a consequence of possible combinations of 

In an embodiment each of the thirty six distinct combinations results in BIRD logic providing one of 

When the BIRD assesses an extant displaced item state this document refers to flagging the item as extant . lost .. misplaced .. stolen .. etc. These possible assessments by BIRD logic are discussed in further detail immediately below.

It will be noted that in the table .T of exemplary BIRD logic the thirty six distinct clusters of logic combinations are identified or labeled by a number. These cluster numbers are placed adjacent to the location field for convenience only and do not refer to thirty six different locations rather each bracketed number refers to the cluster as a whole that is to the combination of four item statuses along with the self assessed item state associated with the cluster.

Four of the thirty six states result in an assessment that the item is extant . meaning generally that the item is located where it is expected to be either with the authorized user AU or in storage and or is in use as expected to be when it is expected to be in such location and or use and also that the item is associated with an authorized user AU .

In an embodiment the determination by BIRD logic of an extant item state . may be understood as a comparison between the item s usage expectations and the item s usage data .U . The usage expectations define the expected locations .L associated with the item the expected iteMetrics associated with the item and the parameters for AWOL status and for stagnancy .StG for the item. The usage data .U provides both the raw and processed environmental data which are compared against the usage expectations . The four extant states . in the table .T of exemplary BIRD logic are 1 5 13 and 17. In these states the BIRDed item self assesses 

In an alternative embodiment a self assessment by the BIRDed item that the item is extant . may also entail determining that the BIRDed item is in an appropriate zone .Z at an appropriate time.

In an alternative embodiment a self assessment by the BIRDed item that the item is extant . may also entail determining based on appropriate data from sensors that the item is being used in an appropriate way or manner.

In an embodiment the self assessment that the item is extant . may include a determination that the current authorized user AU is a borrower of the item so that the item is borrowed .. .

Three of the thirty six states result in an assessment that the item is misplaced .. meaning generally that the item is located in a home base location .HB but that possibly the item has been left lying around where it should not be or when it should not be within the home base .HB . In this event possibly the authorized user AU has either forgotten the item or cannot recall where he or she last left the item . 

In an embodiment the determination by BIRD logic of a misplaced item state .. may be understood as a comparison between the usage expectations and the current usage data .U . The three misplaced states .. in the table .T are 7 9 and 11. In these states the BIRDed item self assesses that all of the following statuses apply 

In brief the BIRDed item self assesses as being misplaced because it is at a home base location .HB and is associated with an authorized user AU but the item is either at the home base and so is AWOL at the wrong time and or is lying about longer than it should be.

In an alternative embodiment the BIRDed item in self assessing its misplaced state .. may either ignore or place a lower weighting on the iteMetrics and or the identity of the most recent user. For example it is possible that an item becomes misplaced in a home or office because someone other than the authorized user AU has picked up the item and moved it to and left the item in a zone .Z other than the zone expected by the authorized user AU .

Four of the thirty six states result in a self assessment by the BIRDed item that it is lost .. meaning generally that the item is located outside of a home base location .HB and that the item is off person .OffP of and is not under the control of an authorized user AU and further that the item is likely not in the deliberate possession of or under the knowing control of any person.

In an embodiment the determination by BIRD logic of a lost item state .. may be understood as a comparison between the usage expectations and the current usage data .U . The four lost states .. in the table .T are 21 23 33 and 35. In these states the BIRDed item self assesses that all of the following item statuses apply 

In brief the BIRDed item self assesses that it is lost .. if the item is outside of a home base location .HB was last associated with an authorized user AU but is stagnant .StG .

It will be noted that in two of these item state cases numbers and the item is AWOL as well. In an embodiment these cases may never actually be flagged or identified by the BIRD because prior to such identification the BIRD will flag the item as either wandering .. or wandering lost .. .. in accordance with state cases and . In an alternative embodiment either the BIRD does not signal the user in state cases or or the BIRD does signal the user but the user overrides the alert or warning and the BIRD again signals the user for state cases or as applicable.

In general terms an item is wandering .. if that the item is on the person of or under the control of an authorized user AU but the authorized user AU has inadvertently carried the item to a location where he or she does not actually intend to take it. Or at the very least for a wandering item the authorized user AU has carried the item to a location where the user normally does not intend to take it. In an embodiment upon being alerted by the BIRD of the item s wandering state .. the authorized user AU may have the option of cancelling the alert effectively telling the BIRD that a change of plans is in effect. In an embodiment the cancellation response by the authorized user AU may only be effective for a limited period of time or on a single occasion. In an alternative embodiment the BIRD may employ the cancellation as part of a learning process to redefine the item s usage expectations .

In table .T four of the thirty six states result in an assessment that the item is wandering .. . In an embodiment the assessment by BIRD logic of a wandering item state .. may be understood as a comparison between the usage expectations and the current usage data .U . The four wandering states .. in the table .T are 3 15 27 and 31. In three of these states 3 15 and 27 the BIRDed item self assesses that all of the following statuses apply 

In brief the item is being carried about by an authorized user AU but the item is being carried in a place where the item should not be at that time.

In the fourth wandering state .. state 31 the item is out of bounds .OoB and AWOL and the item is also off Person .OffP and so stationary .StaT but not yet stagnant .StG further the item was most recently carried about by the authorized user AU .

In the exemplary BIRD logic of the table .T it is assumed that these item statuses of cluster indicate the user has recently carried the item to the out of bounds location .OoB and so the item is wandering .. . It will be noted however that state 31 may never actually be flagged by the BIRD since normally state 27 is likely to be flagged first. That is in an embodiment any time the authorized user AU carries the item to an out of bounds location .OoB the BIRD may alert the user that the item is wandering .. .

Six of the thirty six states result in an assessment that the item is misappropriated .. meaning generally that the item is in possession or under control of an unauthorized user UU but the unauthorized user UU is not a thief for example the user may be a family member or colleague who picked up the item and has retained it for some time by accident perhaps mistaking it for a similar item which does belong to them .

In an embodiment the determination by BIRD logic of a misappropriated item state .. may be understood as a comparison between the usage expectations and the current usage data .U . The six misappropriated states .. in the table .T are 6 8 10 12 22 and 24. In these states the BIRDed item self assesses that all of the following statuses apply 

In brief the item is at a home base .HB or daily life .DL location was recently with an unauthorized user UU and is not moving. Under these circumstances the exemplary BIRD logic of the table .T assumes that the item is presumed not stolen .. because it seems unlikely that a thief would leave the item lying around in a home base location .HB . Rather a thief would keep moving with the item until the thief was well clear of the home base location .HB . Similarly the exemplary BIRD logic assumes that the thief would not leaving the item lying around for an extended time stagnant .StG in a location which may be close to the home base that is a daily life location .DL .

In an alternative embodiment the statuses of clusters and the item is stagnant .StG in a daily life location .DL other than a home base location .HB may be construed at least initially as ambiguous . with respect to whether the item is misappropriated .. or stolen .. .

In an embodiment these misappropriated clusters and may never actually be flagged or identified by the BIRD because prior to such identification the BIRD will first flag the item as either misappropriated .. or stolen .. as soon as iteMetrics suggest the item is with an unauthorized user UU .

In an alternative embodiment the BIRD may first flag the item as possibly misappropriated .. or stolen .. as soon as an unauthorized user UU is detected however once the item becomes stationary .Stat or stagnant .StG and depending possibly also on item location .L the BIRD may refine its assessment from misappropriated stolen .. .. to simply misappropriated .. .

In an embodiment twelve of the thirty six item status combinations result in an item state assessment that the item is either misappropriated .. or stolen .. this means in general terms that the item is in possession or under control of an unauthorized user UU who may either be a thief or may on the other hand be a person who is not a thief but who picked up the item and retained it by accident.

In an embodiment the determination by BIRD logic of a misappropriated stolen item state .. .. may be understood as a comparison between the usage expectations and the current usage data .U . The twelve misappropriated stolen states .. .. in the table .T are 2 4 14 16 18 20 26 28 30 32 35 and 36. They fall into three categories or sets.

States 2 4 14 and 16 constitute a first set of possible misappropriated stolen states .. .. . In this first set of states the BIRDed item self assesses that all of the following statuses apply 

In sum the item is on person .OnP of an unauthorized user UU . The AWOL status is not relevant to this determination.

States 18 and 20 constitute a second set of possible misappropriated stolen states .. .. . In this second set of states the BIRDed item self assesses that all of the following statuses apply 

States 26 28 30 32 34 and 36 constitute a third set of possible misappropriated stolen states .. .. . In this third set of states the BIRDed item self assesses that all of the following statuses apply 

In brief the item is outside of any home base .HB or daily life .DL location and is with an unauthorized user UU . Under these circumstances the exemplary BIRD logic of the table .T self assess the BIRDed item as either being misappropriated .. or stolen .. .

A further assessment of whether the item is most likely misappropriated .. or stolen .. may be made by the BIRD based on additional logic which while part of BIRD logic is not illustrated in the tables .T of . Once an item as been flagged as misappropriated stolen .. .. MvS Heuristics discussed above in conjunction with may be applied to determine a likelihood that the BIRDed item is either misappropriated .. or stolen .. .

One of the thirty six states result in an assessment that the item is either wandering .. or lost .. meaning generally that if the item is in possession or under control of any person then that person is an authorized user AU but the item is definitely not where it s supposed to be.

In an embodiment the self assessment by BIRD logic of a wandering lost item state .. .. may be understood as a comparison between the usage expectations and the current usage data .U . The wandering lost state .. .. in the table .T is 19. In this state the BIRDed item self assesses that all of the following statuses apply 

In brief the BIRDed item is outside of any home base location .HB was last with an authorized user AU is AWOL not where it s supposed to be at the current time .T and is stationary .Stat . This could indicate the item is simply wandering .. meaning that it s with the authorized user AU who has temporarily set the item down but still has the item under control or it could indicate that the item is lost .. if the user has set it down and moved on without it.

If the item remains stationary .Stat long enough to become stagnant .StG then the state of the item switches to case and the BIRDed item self assesses as being lost .. .

In an embodiment some combinations of item statuses may be construed by BIRD logic as being ambiguous states . . The ambiguous clusters in the table .T are 25 and 29. In these clusters the BIRDed item self assesses that all of the following statuses apply 

In brief the item appears to be with an authorized user AU since it s either on person .OnP or it s off Person .OffP for an amount of time within an allowed stationary limit and was last with the authorized user AU and the time is such that the BIRDed item is not expected to be in a home base location .HB so the item is not AWOL but the item is outside of any place where it s expected to be at all because it s out of bounds .OoB .

A plausible interpretation of this state of affairs is that the authorized user AU has decided to venture outside of his or her normal hunting grounds. However in an embodiment under these circumstances the BIRD is configured to determine that the current state of the item is an ambiguous state . .

In an embodiment the BIRD is configured to immediately alert the user as to the ambiguous state . and to query the authorized user AU as to whether the item state is acceptable or not. If the user signals that the item state is acceptable the BIRD may be configured to not issue further alerts or notifications . In an embodiment the BIRD may offer one or more prompts or other user interface interactions to determine if the BIRD should modify the usage expectations on either a temporary or permanent basis. In this case the BIRD may engage in active learning in the field about changes in item usage and or user behavior.

In an alternative embodiment the BIRDed item may be configured to delay for some period of time before alerting the user to the ambiguous state . . Other responses by the BIRD may be envisioned as well.

Table .T is a listing of exemplary status state data clusters where each cluster . . . pairs a unique constellation of item statuses with a resulting self assessed item state extant . or any of multiple possible states of displacement . . In an embodiment BIRD logic employs such item status item state clusters to self assess a state of an item . In turn the item statuses are arrived at by comparing BIRD usage data .U against usage expectations for the BIRDed item .

For example an item s current location from sensor data may be compared against defined home base .HB daily life .DL and out of bounds .OoB locations which in an embodiment are defined in usage expectations to determine if an item is currently in a home base location .HB a daily life location .DL or is out of bounds .OoB .

Similarly whether an item is or is not AWOL is determined by comparing sensor location data .Loc one element of usage data .U against expected item location data which in an embodiment is contained in usage expectations .

Similarly whether iteMetrics indicate an item is currently with an authorized user AU or not is determined by comparing usage data .U against iteMetrics which would be expected for the user as defined in usage expectations .

Similarly whether or not an item is currently On Person .OnP is determined by comparing usage data .U against current usage data .U which be expected when the item is on person .OnP as defined in usage expectations . In an embodiment the appropriate usage data .U may be data related to personal user motion .M . In an alternative embodiment other forms of usage data .U may be employed to determine if the item is or is not currently on person .OnP .

Table .T is exemplary only. The usage data .U which includes sensor data and processed sensor data .P required for the data analysis inherent in table .T are exemplary only. Similarly the elements of usage expectations which may be required by a BIRD to implement the data assessments and analysis inherent in table .T is exemplary only. Similarly the choices of item statuses location category on person off person personal motion AWOL status and iteMetrics employed in table .T are exemplary only.

In alternative embodiments other item statuses other types of usage data .U and other usage expectations may be employed in addition or in the alternative. Similarly the pairings between item statuses and the assessed item states shown in table .T are exemplary only and reflect an exemplary set of criteria for BIRD logic . In alternative embodiments other pairings may be employed and other item states and or additional item statuses may be envisioned as well.

In alternative embodiments BIRD logic may take into account various factors or conditions not addressed in exemplary table .T such as item motions accelerations vibrations etc. associated with personal transportation or public transportation. In an embodiment such motions may be addressed through filtering of sensor data to distinguish personal motions .M from transportation motions. In an alternative embodiment additional logic may be employed to address potential ambiguities in distinguishing personal motion .M from transportation motions.

Method . Meth begins with step . In step the BIRD identifies the current time and date .T and also the current expected authorized user AU based for example on the most recent biometric login .

In step the BIRD extracts from the usage expectations the current expected usage CUE parameters which are required to determine if the BIRDed item is extant . or displaced . . The current expected usage CUE parameters extracted from the usage expectations may include for example and without limitation the current expected home base .HB or daily life location .DL and out of bounds .OoB locations .OoB for the BIRDed item AWOL criteria and iteMetrics for the current authorized expected user. In turn the iteMetrics may include parameters pertaining to expected item movement expected item light exposure expected item sound exposure expected item temperature and any other environmental factors which can be detected by BIRD sensors and which are indicative of normal or expected usage of the item by the user. In an embodiment the out of bounds .OoB locations .OoB may be defined implicitly with reference to the home base .HB and daily life .DL locations.

The next four steps through are data assessment steps. They all entail comparing data collected from the sensors and collected into usage data .U against the usage expectations . The result of each assessment is some specific determination as discussed immediately below of an item status .

In step the BIRD compares its current location data .Loc against the expected location data for location categories home base daily life and possibly zones and determines if the item is in an expected home base .HB or daily life .DL location or if the item is out of bounds .OoB .

In step the BIRDed item determines if it is On Person .OnP in hand in pocket in a purse or backpack which is itself being carried on person etc. or not. In an embodiment this determination is made by detecting whether or not the item is subject to motions associated with being on a person. In an alternative embodiment the determination of whether or not the item is On Person .OnP may be made based on other sensor readings.

In step the BIRD determines if the item is absent without leave AWOL . An AWOL determination is specific both to a particular expected location .L and a particular time frame when the item should be within that particular location that is a detection context . The item is AWOL if 

 i even though the item may be within the bounds of the daily life locations .DL and so is within some generally allowed locations and . . .

 ii the item is not within the particular expected location .L in which it should be located at the current time .T .

In an embodiment expected locations .L with which reference is made for purposes of being AWOL may be home base locations .HB . In an alternative embodiment various specific expected locations .L within the daily life locations .DL which are other than or in addition to home base locations .HB may be suitable as a basis for AWOL assessments.

In step the BIRD employs iteMetric determinations . If the item is currently on person the BIRD determines if the current user is an authorized user AU . If the item is currently off person the BIRD determines if the most recent user is an authorized user AU .

In step the BIRD utilizes the determinations resulting from steps to . Specifically the BIRD uses the following four determinations of item statuses 

Based on these determinations of specific item statuses the BIRD identifies a corresponding item state status cluster in a stored table of BIRD logic . For example the BIRD may identify a corresponding item cluster that is one cluster from among clusters numbered 1 36 in the table .T discussed above in conjunction with . The BIRD identifies a single item state status cluster which corresponds to the four currently identified statuses of the BIRDed item as obtained in steps to .

In step the BIRD obtains from the item state status cluster determined in step a specific assessed item state . This assessed item state can then serve as a basis to determine responses by BIRD song .

In an embodiment the method then repeats throughout field use returning to step at least one of steps or at functionally useful intervals which may be multiple times per second at least once every few seconds or once per minute or at other designated time intervals . It will also be understood that while various item status determinations location category on person off person personal motion AWOL status authorized user AU or unauthorized user UU are shown in particular sequences these determinations may in different embodiments be made in different orders or may be made in whole or in part in parallel with each other.

FIGS. E E and E present a flow chart . Meth of a third exemplary method of BIRD logic . Due to the size of the flow chart . Meth and for clarity of illustration only the chart has been divided into three sections . . and . on FIGS. E E and E respectively. All three sections . have in common the root flow chart steps and .

For simplicity the influence of AWOL criteria absent without leave criteria has not been included in exemplary method . Meth . It will be understood that in an embodiment the influence of including AWOL criteria in item state assessments is the following items which might otherwise be extant . may if AWOL be assessed by the BIRD as misplaced .. or wandering .. this is generally reflected in the item status state clusters in Table .T discussed above which does take into account AWOL assessments. Also in some embodiments and depending on other factors as well items which might otherwise be construed as misappropriated .. may instead if AWOL be more likely to be assessed as stolen .. .

Because AWOL criteria have been omitted from FIGS. E E and E no wandering states .. are identified in the flowchart . . However some potential wandering states .. are identified further in the discussion below.

With reference to FIG. E method . Meth begins with step . In step the BIRD identifies the current time and date .T and also the current expected authorized user AU based for example on the most recent biometric login .

In step the BIRD extracts from the usage expectations the current expected usage CUE which are required to determine if the BIRDed item is extant . or displaced . . The CUE parameters extracted from the usage expectations may include for example and without limitation the current expected home base HB .HB and daily life DL .DL locations for the item and item metrics for the current authorized expected user. In turn the iteMetrics may include parameters pertaining to expected item movement expected item light exposure expected item sound exposure expected item temperature and any other environmental factors which can be detected by BIRD sensors and which are indicative of normal or expected usage of the BIRDed item by the user.

In an embodiment extraction of appropriate CUE parameters from the usage expectations will also include the extraction of AWOL criteria . However as noted above AWOL criteria are omitted from exemplary flow chart . Meth for purposes of conciseness.

The method proceeds to step . In step the BIRDed item determines whether the item is with an allowed location such as a home base location .HB or a daily life location .DL . In an embodiment not illustrated in the figure the determination of the allowed location may include a determination of whether the item is in and allowed zone or within some other defined allowed area.

If in step is determined that the item is within an expected home base location .HB then the method proceeds to step . At this point since the item is within a home base location .HB the item cannot be lost .. and cannot be wandering .. . However the item may still be any of extant . misplaced .. misappropriated .. or stolen .. .

In step the BIRD determines if the item is on person .OnP any of in hand in pocket in a purse or briefcase or backpack which is itself being carried on person being worn on person etc. or not. In an embodiment this determination is made by detecting whether or not the item is subject to motions associated with being on a person. In an alternative embodiment the determination of whether or not the item is on person .OnP may be made based on other usage data .U .

If in step it is determined that the item is on person .OnP then the method . proceeds to step . At this point since the item is on person .OnP it cannot be that the item is misplaced .. . However the item may still be any of extant . misappropriated .. or stolen .. . In step the BIRD analyzes current and recent iteMetrics . The method then proceeds to step .

In step the BIRD determines if the iteMetrics are consistent with the expected authorized user AU . If the answer is yes then the BIRD proceeds to step where the BIRDed item self assesses itself as being extant . . The item is extant . since the item is in a home base location .HB is on person .OnP and is on the person of an authorized user AU .

If in step the BIRD determines that the iteMetrics are not consistent with the authorized user AU then the method proceeds to step . In step the BIRD assesses that the item is either misappropriated .. or stolen .. . The method then proceeds to step . In step the BIRD applies appropriate MvS heuristics to determine the relative likelihood that the item is misappropriated .. versus the item being stolen .. . Exemplary MvS heuristics for such a determination are discussed above in conjunction with .

Returning to consideration of step In step it may be determined that the item is off person .OffP . For example motion detection may determine that the item is stationary .Stat and therefore off person .OffP . At this juncture it may be that the item is extant . misplaced .. or misappropriated .. .

If in step it is determined that the item is off person .OffP the method proceeds to step . In step a determination is made as to whether or not the item is stagnant .StG .

An item is stagnant .StG if it is off person .OffP for longer than an allowed period of time the station limit . The stationary limit is specified in the usage expectations and may vary widely depending on the item itself the usage to which the item is put by an authorized user AU and the time of day and setting. For example a set of keys .K or a wallet .W may be expected to be stationary for many hours at a time when these items are at home in the evening. On the other hand the same items that is the keys .K or the wallet .W maybe expected to be on person .OnP all the time or substantially all the time when in use during the day by the authorized user AU .

During the day then the stationary limit for the item may be zero minutes or perhaps just a few minutes. For example the usage expectations may indicate that the keys or the wallet may be set down for just a few minutes at a time during the day for example for up to three minutes. If the keys .K or the wallet .W are set down and are stationary .Stat for any longer than three minutes then a determination is made by the BIRD that the item is stagnant .StG .

If in step a determination is made that the item is stagnant .StG then the in the item is assumed to no longer be extant . but may be misplaced .. or misappropriated .. . The method proceeds to step which entails an analysis of iteMetrics for the item. It will be noted that current morphIteMetrics cannot be analyzed since the item is off person .OffP . But recent morphIteMetrics can be analyzed along with recent and current psyIteMetrics .

From step the method proceeds to step . In step a determination is made as to whether the iteMetrics are consistent with those expected for the authorized user AU .

If in step a determination is made that the iteMetrics are consistent with the authorized user AU then in step the BIRDed item self assesses itself as having been misplaced .. . In other words the item is in a home base location .HB and is with or associated with an authorized user AU but the item has been left lying about for longer than expected. On this basis the BIRD assesses that its associated item is misplaced .. .

If instead in step the iteMetrics are not consistent with the authorized user AU the method moves to step were the BIRD assesses that its associated item has been misappropriated .. that is the item is with an un authorized user AU who is not likely to be a thief since the item is still in a home base location .HB .

Returning to step if a determination is made in that the item is not stagnant .StG the item may be extant . or may be misappropriated .. . The method proceeds to step which entails an analysis of iteMetrics for the item. It will be noted that current morphIteMetrics cannot be analyzed since the item is off person .OffP . But recent morphIteMetrics can be analyzed along with recent and current psyIteMetrics .

From step the method proceeds to step . In step a determination is made as to whether the iteMetrics are consistent with those expected for the authorized user AU . In the iteMetrics are consistent with those expected for the authorized user AU the method proceeds to step where the BIRDed item assesses itself as being extant . . If instead in step a determination is made that iteMetrics are not consistent with the authorized user AU then in step the BIRDed item self assesses as being misappropriated .. .

As noted above the illustrated steps of method . omit consideration of an item s possible AWOL status . An item is AWOL if it is in a home base location .HB but at a time when the item should not be in that location.

If in step the BIRDed item determines that it is in a daily life location .DL which is not a home base location .HB then the method continues with step . In step a determination is made as to whether or not the item is on person .OnP for example any of being in hand in pocket worn on the person s body in a purse or briefcase which is being carried by the person in a backpack which is being carried by the person etc. . In an embodiment this determination may be made by evaluating whether or not the item is subject to personal motions .M . In an alternative embodiment other usage data .U in addition to or in alternative to motion data may be used to make the determination of whether or not the item is on person .OnP .

If in step a determination is made that the iteMetrics are not consistent with the authorized user AU than the method proceeds to step where the BIRDed item self assesses as possibly being misappropriated .. or stolen .. . From step the method proceeds to step where the BIRD employs MvS heuristics to assess the relative likelihood that the item is misappropriated .. versus the likelihood that the item is stolen .. . Various exemplary MvS heuristics for making such a determination are presented above in conjunction with .

With reference now to FIG. E and so with reference to part of method . Meth consideration again returns to step of the method. In step the BIRD may determine that the item is not in a home base .HB or daily life .DL location so that the item is out of bounds .OoB . In that event the item may be lost .. misappropriated .. or stolen .. or the state of the item may be an ambiguous state . .

Upon the determination in step that the item is out of bounds .OoB the method proceeds to step . In step the BIRD determines whether its associated item is on person .OnP or not. In an embodiment this determination may be made via the motion sensors .M and a determination of whether the item is subject to personal motion .M . In an alternative embodiment motion sensing may be augmented and or replaced by other forms of sensing and other means of determination as to whether or not the item is on person .OnP .

In step the BIRD may determine that the item is on person .OnP . In this case the item may be misappropriated .. stolen .. or the state of the item may be ambiguous . . The method proceeds to step which entails an analysis of current and recent iteMetrics and from there to step . In step a determination is made as to whether or not the iteMetrics are consistent with the authorized user AU .

If in step the BIRD determines that the item is with the expected authorized user AU the method proceeds to step where a determination is made that the item state is ambiguous . . Step is followed by a step .

Formally step is not part of BIRD logic . Rather step is an element of BIRD song associated with either of step or step of method discussed above in conjunction with . Step it is discussed here for convenience of exposition. In step the user is queried by the BIRD . Because the item is out of bounds .OoB the BIRD may query as to whether the user has inadvertently gone out of bounds .OoB with the item or whether there has been a temporary change of plans or whether the daily life area .DL should be modified for example expanded . In other words the BIRD queries the authorized user AU to determine what the state is of both the item and the user. The BIRD may employ such a query process as a basis to modify usage expectations .

If in step the BIRD determines that the iteMetrics are not consistent with the authorized user AU the method proceeds to step were determination is made that the item is either misappropriated .. or stolen .. . The method then proceeds to step where the BIRD applies MvS heuristics to determine a relative likelihood of the item being misappropriated .. versus the item being stolen .. .

Returning to step a determination may be made that the item is off person .OffP meaning the item is stationary .Stat . In this event the item state may be lost .. misappropriated .. stolen .. or an ambiguous state . . From step the method proceeds to step where the BIRD determines whether or not the item is stagnant .StG .

If the item is stagnant .StG the item may be lost .. misappropriated .. or stolen .. . The method proceeds to steps and where iteMetrics are analyzed and a determination is made as to whether the iteMetrics are consistent with the authorized user AU . It will be noted that current morphIteMetrics typically cannot be analyzed since the item is off person .OffP . But recent morphIteMetrics can be analyzed along with recent and current psyIteMetrics .

If in step the iteMetrics are consistent with the authorized user AU the method proceeds to step were the BIRDed item self assesses as being lost .. . This assessment is made because the last person in possession of the item was the authorized user AU but the item is stagnant .StG as well as out of bounds .OoB this indicates that the item has been left out of bounds .OoB by the authorized user AU for longer than an allowed period of time.

If in step the BIRD determines that the iteMetrics are not consistent with the authorized user AU the method proceeds to step were determination is made that the item is misappropriated .. or stolen .. . The method then proceeds to step where the BIRD applies MvS heuristics to determine a relative likelihood of the item being misappropriated .. versus the item being stolen .. .

Returning to step the BIRD may determine that the item is not stagnant .StG meaning that while the item is off person .OffP it has been stationary .Stat for no more than some allowed period of time. The item may be misappropriated .. stolen .. or in an ambiguous state . .

The method proceeds to steps and where recent iteMetrics are analyzed and the BIRD determines whether the iteMetrics are consistent with the authorized user AU . It will be noted that current morphIteMetrics typically cannot be analyzed since the item is off person .OffP . But recent morphIteMetrics can be analyzed along with recent and current psyIteMetrics .

If in step a determination is made that the iteMetrics are not consistent with the authorized user AU then the BIRD determines in step that the item is misappropriated .. or stolen .. . The method again proceeds to step were determination is made of the relative likelihood of the item being misappropriated .. versus the item being stolen .. .

If in step the BIRD determines that the iteMetrics are consistent with the authorized user AU the method proceeds to step where a determination is made that the item state is ambiguous . . Step is followed by a step .

Formally step is not part of BIRD logic . Rather step is an element of BIRD song associated with either of step or step of method discussed above in conjunction with . Step it is discussed here for convenience of exposition.

In step the BIRD implements an off person ambiguity response. In an embodiment and because the item is in fact off person the BIRD may be designed with a number of user configurable options for the off person ambiguity response. For example the user in advance of this event may be able to configure the BIRD from among the following options 

 i do nothing for some period of time on the possibility that the authorized user AU will again pick up the item at which point the BIRD can query the user as per step discussed above 

 ii emit a local signal to alert any nearby person authorized user AU or otherwise that the BIRDed item requires attention 

While not shown in FIGS. E E it will be understood by persons skilled in the art that in an embodiment upon self assessing a current state as per steps the method then repeats throughout field use returning to at least one of steps or at functionally useful intervals which may be multiple times per second at least once every few seconds or once per minute or at other designated time intervals . It will also be understood that while various determinations are shown in particular sequences these determinations on person off person personal motion such as stagnancy .StG location category iteMetrics and others may in different embodiments be made in different orders with suitable rearrangements of branching and decision making or may be made in whole or in part in parallel.

In method . Meth FIGS. E each of steps and entails an analysis of current and or recent iteMetrics . Each of these steps is immediately followed by a step which determines whether or not the iteMetrics are consistent with the expected authorized user AU .

Similarly step of method . Meth may also entail analyzing recent iteMetrics to determine if the analyzed iteMetric data is or is not consistent with the authorized user AU .

The analysis of recent iteMetrics in turn entails a retrieval by the BIRD of usage data .U current and recent real time sensor data and processed data .P which may be pertinent to identifying or helping to identify either of 

Such iteMetric data may include for example and without limitation motion data which may be indicative of a user s walk stride or body motions while seated or standing motion data which may be indicative of hand or arm motions or even head motions voiceprint data facial recognition data and other biometric data which may be available to the BIRD .

Such iteMetric data is continually collected and stored by the BIRD in step of exemplary method discussed above in conjunction with . The iteMetric determination by the BIRD then entails comparing 

 i usage data .U the collected real time and recent data and also the processed data .P against . . .

In an embodiment user stride parameters such as stride length or stride frequency may be compared against expected stride length and stride frequency for the authorized user AU . In an alternative embodiment recently recorded real time voice prints may be compared against stored voice prints for the authorized user AU . In an alternative embodiment stored facial patterns for the authorized user AU may be compared against recently recorded real time facial patterns. Based on how close the match is in each case the BIRD can make an estimate as to whether or not the item is currently with or was recently associated with the authorized user AU . In an embodiment various BIRD parameters perhaps referred to as iteMetric match tolerance parameters may be adjusted to establish how closely the real time readings must match with the stored iteMetrics in order for an identity match to be assessed by the BIRD .

It is noted above in conjunction with exemplary method . that typically it is not possible for the BIRD to assess current morphIteMetrics while the BIRDed item is off person .OffP . This is because being off person .OffP the BIRDed item cannot detect personal user motions associated with morphIteMetrics .

In some embodiments however there may be exceptions to this. The BIRDed item may be off person .OffP but still in sufficient substantial physical proximity to a person whether an authorized user AU or otherwise associated with the item . In this case a BIRD s camera .C may be able to identify a person based on facial imaging or the BIRD s video camera .V may be able to identify personal motions .M through motion analysis. Similarly the BIRD s audio content sensor .AC may be able to perform voice identification. Other BIRD sensors may also be employed to assess morphIteMetrics even when the BIRDed item is off person.

By contrast psyIteMetrics typically can be analyzed by the BIRD in real time even when the BIRDed item is off person .OffP . This is because in an embodiment the amount of time an item remains off person .OffP is itself an element of or a parameter of psyIteMetrics .

In an embodiment self assessment by the BIRD of its associated item as being lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. or on the other hand extant . are probabilistic. Because of that determinations by the BIRD of the item as being lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. may overlap. That is the BIRD may determine that its associated item is in some significant probability likely in a state of being at least one of lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. . The BIRD may be further configured to determine more specific probabilities associated with each state for example High probability of the item being misplaced Intermediate probability of being lost . As a result in some embodiments the sum of such numeric probability calculations for lost .. misplaced .. stolen .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or extant . states may add up to more or less than 100 .

In an embodiment numerically precise probability calculations may not always be feasible or realistic so probabilities may be determined and presented by the BIRD in general or range oriented terms possibly with associated general terminology for example Very High. High . Intermediate Possibly Lost. Possibly Misplaced etc. .

In an alternative embodiment the BIRD may not calculate numeric probabilities at all but may instead rely on various trigger criteria as designated by usage expectations to determine when it is considered possible that its associated item is lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. . Generally once the BIRD determines that it is possible that its associated item is lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. the BIRD will initiate alert and or reporting measures to notify the user or other person s of the item s anomalous state . .

In various embodiments various forms of sensor data may be desirable for BIRD operations. These include for example and without limitation time data item location data item motion data and data pertaining to a variety of other forms of environmental influences such as light sound temperature and others.

In some instances desired forms of environmental data may be unavailable for any number of reasons for reasons of cost weight or reduced power usage a BIRD may be configured with fewer sensors than might ideally be employed or sensor data may become unavailable for example because a BIRD sensor s are unable to obtain a desired form of data. For example a BIRD may be in a location where it is shielded from GPS and other forms of location data or an external source of location data may suffer a breakdown of some kind. 

In an embodiment a BIRD may be configured with alternate or fallback means of determining whether its associated item is extant . or displaced . .

For example in an embodiment a BIRD is configured to determine if an item is extant . or displaced . based in whole or in part on location data .Loc . Conventional external sources of location data as already noted may for some reason be unavailable. In this case a BIRD may employ alternate means to determine if there is a significant likelihood that the item is within or is outside of desired boundaries. In an embodiment the BIRD may rely on velocity data a combination of speed and directional information to determine a total distance the BIRDed item has travelled since the last time a location could be identified based on external data. There may be a maximum distance that the item is allowed to travel in any direction. For example an item may have a specified allowed radius of travel. Any travel beyond that specified distance is identified by the BIRD as meaning that it and its associated item are out of bounds .OoB .

Similarly some items may have usage expectations which indicate the item is always kept within some specific facility or building or on the grounds of the facility or building. Such an item may never in proper usage be transported by car or other rapid transit. If the BIRD detects accelerations above a designated acceleration that is at motor transport levels rather than human transport levels this may also trigger a determination that the item is out of bounds .OoB .

Above are presented general criteria for distinguishing a number of displaced item states lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. stolen .. and wandering .. both from each other and from the extant item state . . Persons skilled in the relevant arts will appreciate that these states are sufficient to characterize the possible conditions or usage states of many items commonly used by people in many of the contexts in which items are normally employed in daily life. As such these items states and the systems and methods disclosed herein for self assessment of such states by a BIRDed item are sufficient to significantly assist an authorized user AU in rapidly identifying and possibly ameliorating a possible displaced state . of an item.

At the same time both the extant . and displaced . states defined above and the criteria for distinguishing such states are exemplary only and are by no means exhaustive. Persons skilled in the relevant arts will appreciate that for some items with special uses for some users with special or unusual usage habits and for some possible usage contexts it may be necessary to define additional or alternative displacement states .

It may also be beneficial to subdivide the state of being extant . into two or more distinct categories of extant states . . That is for a single item and a single user it may be beneficial to define two or more distinct states of normal usage or two or more distinct conditions of an item being present when and where it should be. For example an item may be extant and in use extant but dormant or extant and in storage. In turn it may be possible to distinguish and identify two or more distinct sub states of extant and in use.

It may also be necessary to characterize alternative or additional item statuses which can be detected by BIRD sensors or derived from BIRD sensor data in order for a BIRDed item to self assess such alternative states of displacement . or to self assess additional states of being extant . or to make self assessments in certain locations .L or detection contexts . Such additional or alternative states of being extant . or displaced . fall with the scope and spirit of the present system and method. Equally alternative or additional statuses for distinguishing extant . and displaced . states also fall within the scope and spirit of the present system and method.

Even certain conventional detection contexts and usages may not be fully addressed in all respects by the exemplary methods presented in this document. For example ascertaining an item s state as extant . or displaced . and which state of displacement . with a high confidence level while the item is in transit with a person as the person is driving or on public transit may present additional requirements with respect to creating processed data .P from raw sensor data . In an embodiment a BIRD may be assisted in such determinations by automotive data and other travel data which may be provided via RF signals or other means from a car or other transit suitably equipped with an internal data distribution node. Person s skilled in the relevant arts will recognize that such additional BIRD data derivations and concomitant state self assessments represent appropriate extensions of the methods described herein and fall within the scope and spirit of the present teachings system and method.

The exemplary BIRD Logic of Table .S may be desirable in some embodiments and or uses of a BIRD for example where one or more of the following factors apply 

Put another the item and its usage are amenable to detection contexts defined in terms of stable time ranges and expected locations .L . Consequently there are significant parts of the day relative to the total duration of day when the BIRDed item can readily self assess whether or not it is AWOL .

It should also be noted that the limited sensor capabilities alluded to above need not be a permanent state of affairs. In an embodiment a BIRD may have sufficient sensor capabilities to engage in the more extended self assessments of BIRD logic table .T of above. However if some sensor capabilities are temporarily unavailable or deliberately reduced for example for reasons of power conservation the BIRD may be able to switch to the small BIRD logic of Table .S.

BIRD logic Table .S has six clusters of item status state data. Each status state cluster in the table lists 

In an embodiment the association between a set of sensed environmental statuses and a consequent resulting self assessment of item state constitutes an aspect of BIRD logic . The item statuses listed in Table .S are exemplary only and should not be construed as limiting in any way.

Logic Table .S lists six possible combinations of item states with respect to the exemplary item statuses listed above. These six combinations are a consequence of possible combinations of 

The detection contexts and or the usage expectations for the item define the allowed location categories associated with the item and also the parameters for AWOL status and also identify the stationary limit .

The BIRD s usage data .U for the item provides both the raw and processed environmental data which are compared against the detection contexts and or associated usage expectations to make item status assessments .

Cluster ID numbers S. S. S. S. S. S. It will be noted that in the table .T of exemplary BIRD logic the six distinct clusters of logic combinations are identified or labeled by a letter number combination.

Two of the six clusters result in an assessment that the item is extant . meaning generally that the item is located where it is expected to be either with the authorized user AU or in storage or is in use as expected to be when it is expected to be in such location and or use.

The two extant clusters in Table .S of exemplary BIRD logic are S. and S.. In these clusters the BIRDed item self assesses that 

One of the six clusters cluster S. results in a self assessment that the BIRDed item is misplaced .. . In cluster S. the BIRDed item is not AWOL so the item is where it should be when it should be but it has been off person .OffP for longer than the stationary limit and so is stagnant .StG . This suggests the user has put the item down and possibly forgotten about the item .

One of the six clusters cluster S. results in a self assessment that the BIRDed item is either extant . or wandering .. . The item is AWOL meaning the item is not where it is supposed to be at the current time .T but the item is on person .OnP . For purposes of this small BIRD logic when the item is on person .OnP it is presumed that the person is an authorized user AU .

Since the item is on person .OnP it may be extant . . However since the item is not where it s supposed to be the person may have taken the item where it should not be meaning the item is wandering .. .

Suitable BIRD song may be devised to alert the user to the extant wandering state . .. of the item and to seek appropriate responses from the user.

One of the six clusters S. results in a self assessment that the BIRDed item is either wandering or lost .. . The item is AWOL meaning the item is not where it is supposed to be at the current time .T and the item is off person .OffP but not yet stagnant .StG .

Since the item is not where it s supposed to be the person may have taken the item where it should not be meaning the item is at least wandering .. . Since the item is off person .OffP it may be lost as well but since the stationary time limit has not expired the item is not yet stagnant .StG the user may simply have set the item down briefly.

Suitable BIRD song may be devised to alert the user to the wandering lost state .. .. of the item and to seek appropriate responses from the user or other persons near the possibly lost item.

One of the six clusters S. results in a self assessment that the BIRDed item is lost .. . The item is AWOL meaning the item is not where it is supposed to be at the current time .T and further the item is off person .OffP and stagnant .StG .

Since the item is not where it s supposed to be and has been left lying about longer than expected the item is stagnant .StG the BIRD logic Table .S self assesses the item as being lost .. . Suitable BIRD song may be devised to alert the user to the lost state .. of the item via remote reporting and possibly to seek appropriate responses from other persons near the lost item.

While not illustrated in a simple application of the small BIRD logic in Table .S can readily be envisioned. A user say a student has a cell phone .Act.CP with integrated BIRD technology .Act . The cell phone .Act.CP is configured with the student s class schedule and also with the location of the classrooms.

Suppose the student leaves the cell phone .Act.CP behind while leaving the class. The integrated BIRD technology .Act will shortly recognize that i the cell phone .Act.CP should no longer be in the classroom and ii the cell phone is lying around stationary .Stat and or stagnant .StG . These conditions correspond to clusters S. and S. of Table .S. The cell phone .Act.CP with its integrated BIRD technology .Act may have BIRD song responses which may include for example and without limitation i Sending an e mail or text message to the student s computer ii Sending an e mail or text message to a LARC and or iii emitting a local signal to alert other students to the lost phone. Since according the Platonic theory education leads to morals the nearby students may be relied upon to return the cell phone .Act.CP either to the appropriate owner or at least to the school s lost and found.

Method . Meth begins with step ... In step .. the BIRD identifies the current time and date .T and also the current expected authorized user AU based for example on the most recent biometric login .

In step .. the BIRD extracts from the usage expectations the current expected usage CUE parameters which are required to determine if the BIRDed item is extant . or displaced . . The current expected usage CUE parameters extracted from the usage expectations include principally the current expected location and suitable AWOL criteria the time or time range when the item should be in the current expected location if any.

In step .. the BIRDed item compares its current location data .Loc against the expected location data .Loc and determines if the item is outside of the expected location .Loc AWOL status Yes or if the item is within the expected location .Loc AWOL status No .

In step .. the BIRDed item determines if it is on person .OnP which may be any of in hand in pocket worn on person in a purse or backpack which is itself being carried on person etc. or not. In an embodiment this determination is made by detecting whether or not the BIRDed item is subject to motions associated with being on a person. In an alternative embodiment the determination of whether or not the item is on person .OnP may be made based on other sensor readings.

If in step .. a determination is made that the item is on person .OnP the method proceeds directly to step ... If in step .. a determination is made that the item is off person .OffP the method proceeds first to step ...

Step .. applies to an off person .OffP item . In this step the BIRDed item determines if it has been stationary .Stat for more or less than stationary limit . The stationary limit is specified in usage expectations . If the item has been stationary .Stat for no more than the stationary limit the item is simply stationary .Stat . If the item has been stationary .Stat for more than the stationary limit the item is not only stationary .Stat it is also stagnant .StG .

In step .. the BIRD utilizes the condition determinations resulting from steps .. .. and .. regarding AWOL status on person off person status and if applicable stationary or stagnant status . Based on these determinations of specific item statuses the BIRD identifies a corresponding item status state cluster in a stored table of BIRD logic . For example the BIRD may identify a corresponding item status state cluster that is one cluster from among clusters labeled S. S. S. S. S. S. in a table such as Table .S discussed above in conjunction with . The BIRD identifies a single item status state cluster which corresponds to the currently identified statuses of the BIRDed item as obtained in steps .. .. and ...

In step .. the BIRD obtains from the item status state cluster determined in step .. a specific assessed item state . This assessed item state can then serve as a basis to determine responses by BIRD song .

In an embodiment the method then repeats throughout field use returning to step at least one of steps .. .. or .. at functionally useful intervals which may be multiple times per second at least once every few seconds or once per minute or at other designated time intervals . It will also be understood that while various item status determinations on person off person AWOL status stationary or stagnant are shown in particular sequences these determinations may in different embodiments be made in different orders or may be made in whole or in part in parallel with each other.

The exemplary BIRD Logic of Table .S may be desirable in some embodiments and or uses of a BIRD for example where one or more of the following factors apply 

The latter situation may occur if the authorized user AU anticipates using the BIRDed item over a wide geographic area possibly with limited ability to specify expected geographic boundaries .L . For example if the authorized user AU is either on vacation or business travel possibly with a very loose or flexible schedule the authorized user AU may be able to specify by way of ExD criteria I and my BIRDed items will be someplace in Brazil but other than that location cannot be anticipated. In turn Brazil is such a large area that location related assessments of item state may be of limited practical value.

 Possibly the authorized user AU may be able to specify some detection contexts with expected location information .L for example evening nighttime hotel locations and associated detection contexts but daytime plans may be so fluid that separate detection contexts for the days and associated usage expectations may not include expected location information .L . 

Under such circumstances however the authorized user AU may still be able to specify various aspects of usage expectations . For example the authorized user AU may be able to specify or has previously established his or her personal iteMetrics and may also be able to specify the stationary limits for various items . The exemplary BIRD logic of Table .S of may be applicable in such circumstances.

It should also be noted that the limited sensor capabilities alluded to above need not be a permanent state of affairs. In an embodiment a BIRD may have sufficient sensor capabilities to engage in the more extended self assessments of BIRD logic table .T of above. However if some sensor capabilities are temporarily unavailable or deliberately reduced for example for reasons of power conservation the BIRD may be able to switch to the small BIRD logic of Table .S.

BIRD logic Table .S has six clusters of item status state data. Each status state cluster in the table lists 

In an embodiment the association between a set of sensed environmental statuses and a consequent resulting self assessment of item state constitutes an aspect of BIRD logic .

The item statuses listed in Table .S are exemplary only and should not be construed as limiting in any way.

Logic Table .S lists six possible item states outcomes with respect to the exemplary item statuses listed in the table. These six combinations are a consequence of possible combinations of 

The usage expectations for the item define the iteMetrics as well as the stationary limit which distinguishes between stationary .StaT and stagnant .StG .

The BIRD s usage data .U for the item provides both the raw and processed environmental data which are compared against the usage expectations to make item status assessments .

Cluster ID numbers S. S. S. S. S. S. It will be noted that in the table .S of exemplary BIRD logic the six distinct clusters of logic combinations are identified or labeled by a letter number combination.

Two of the six clusters result in an assessment that the item is extant . meaning here that the item is associated with authorized user AU or is in use as expected to be when it is expected to be.

The two extant clusters in Table .S are S. and S.. In these clusters the BIRDed item self assesses that 

In principal the item could be with the authorized user AU but still be wandering .. . However since location determination is excluded from this embodiment of BIRD logic no attempt is made to indicate a wandering state .. .

One of the six clusters cluster S. results in a self assessment that the BIRDed item is either misplaced .. or lost .. . In cluster S. the BIRDed item was last associated with the authorized user AU but has been lying still for longer than the station limit and so is stagnant .StG . This suggests the user has put the item down and possibly forgotten about the item or left it behind someplace.

Three of the six clusters clusters S. S. and S. result in a self assessment that the BIRDed item is either stolen .. or misappropriated .. .

The item is either associated with an unauthorized user UU or was last associated with an unauthorized user UU and is now either stationary .StaT or stagnant .StG . Whether on person .OnP or off person .OffP the association with an unauthorized user UU is taken to indicate theft or misappropriation.

While not illustrated in the figure methods the same or substantially similar to those discussed above . Meth . Meth . Meth . Meth may be used by the BIRD to apply the BIRD logic of Table .S to the process of BIRDed item state self assessment. Suitable adaptations to the methods above will of course be made in view of the specific item statuses which are employed or omitted by Table .S relative to the statuses employed by the related methods above.

Method . Meth discussed above in conjunction with is generally applicable. The item statuses to be identified in step will be the authorized user status and the combined on person off person and personal motion statuses. The actual current statuses will be determined as per steps and by comparing the current usage data .U against expected data values indicated by usage expectations . Once all status types are processed with resulting specific status values step assesses the current item state by looking up the values in BIRD logic Table .S.

A Hardware Drivers layer contains software necessary to support the initialization operations and interaction of the BIRD s hardware including the processor main memory .M the clock calendar timer the various environmental sensors the power monitor the communications interface the item link integrity detection hardware the local I O interface and secondary memory .S . In an embodiment sensors may be added to and removed from the BIRD in real time for at least this reason the BIRD OS may be capable of loading and unloading appropriate hardware driver software in real time into the hardware driver layer . The Hardware Driver layer may also establish or maintain memory addresses interrupts and or other means or data structures required for accessing and controlling the BIRD s hardware.

A Hardware Resource Management layer may provide a variety of general BIRD system services including for example and without limitation management of storage media management of the display .D and or other local inputs .B .L .M allocation management control and protection of memory file management process management and multitasking support for having more than one process run in parallel interprocess communications virtual machine implementations exception handling and interpretation of user inputs via local inputs . The Hardware Resource Management layer may establish memory addresses interrupts or other means or data structures required for accessing its own low level services for mediated access to hardware and the hardware drivers and also for accessing modules and services provided by other operating system elements as described immediately below.

Together the Hardware Drivers layer and the Hardware Resource Management layer provide services which are generally analogous to those provided by device drivers and BIOS services associated with contemporary computers. These hardware oriented functions support the services and artificial intelligence features which may be provided elsewhere in the BIRD operating system as described immediately below and throughout this document.

In an embodiment the BIRD OS includes a variety of system services which may be loaded or run from the main memory .M or the secondary memory .S . The system services may run on the processor . One or more of the system services may also be implemented via dedicated processors or specialized modules within the processor . The system services may in turn utilize services provided the BIRD Resources Management layer or directly from the hardware drivers .

In an embodiment system services operations may be accessed through application programming interfaces APIs . Some exemplary APIs are discussed below in this document see for examples . In an embodiment some or all system services may only be private and so only available internally within the BIRD that is the services may only be utilized by other software integral to the BIRD itself. In an alternative embodiment some or all system services may be accessible in whole or in part to third party software and or to external processors accessing the BIRD via external ports transceivers or other interfaces .

In addition the Usage expectation Access Interpreter may provide other services related to usage expectations including for example and without limitation 

In an embodiment some algorithms or elements of the latter services identifying appropriate usage expectations based on sensor readings may instead be apportioned in part or in whole to the BIRD logic layer of the OS .

In either case active items .Act or processor enhanced passive items an active item BIRD .Act may be configured to modify item capabilities or access upon a determination that the item is in some kind of displaced state . or anomalous state . . For example upon a determination that a cell phone .Act.CP may be stolen .. the active item BIRD .Act may shut down calling capabilities until the current user can verify access rights for example via biometric identification or a password . Upon a determination that a briefcase .C may be stolen .. the active item BIRD .Act may activate a feature to automatically lock the briefcase if unlocked to begin with requiring the user to enter a correct lock combination or use a key to open the briefcase.

The processing required for such control features may be provided through the operating system s Item Control and Security services .

In an embodiment a BIRD may be configured to interface with various network services see for examples as well as with other BIRD in an item team . As such the BIRD faces risks of exposure to computer viruses and also exposure to various hacking attacks. BIRD Security may provide firewall and antivirus services to limit such system vulnerabilities. BIRD Security services may provide API function calls for implementing these security features or for regulation of the firewall anti virus features by an authorized user AU .

In an embodiment the BIRD Security services may utilize and or be utilized by other BIRD services such as Third Party Control User Identity Management and other services.

The BIRD may be configured to authenticate the identity of an authorized user AU at predetermined intervals or points in time for example such as the beginning of each day before an item is removed from the home . During the course of a day or other time interval the BIRD may also be configured to re authenticate that the BIRD and associated item are still with the authorized user AU . User authentication is discussed in conjunction with and other figures throughout this document.

User authentication may occur through device interface biometrics DIB such as password validation via typing or speech fingerprint or eye scan biometrics .B facial recognition via the camera .C and voiceprint identification via the microphone .M . User Identity Management services may provide services algorithms and APIs in support of user authentication and the associated hardware biometrics .B the camera .C the microphone .M etc.

In an embodiment ongoing real time user validation may also be accomplished via iteMetrics as discussed in conjunction with and other figures throughout this document. User Identity Management services may provide software support in the form of pattern recognition algorithms motion analysis algorithms facial recognition algorithms and other algorithms and APIs for both morphIteMetrics and psyIteMetrics . User Identity Management services may also provide interfaces to any specialized hardware processing elements in processor or other dedicated BIRD processors which support iteMetrics.

In support of its services User Identity Management services may in turn draw upon resources from other system services such as the Usage Expectation Access Interpreter module Sensor Data Relay and Control DSP Neural Network Advanced Math and other services as well.

Other system services not illustrated may be envisioned as well. For example in an embodiment a dedicated module may be dedicated to management of BIRD user interface biometrics .B thereby supporting the recognition of authorized users AU via fingerprints voiceprints image recognition or iris scans etc. In an alternative embodiment biometrics management may be an element of one or more other modules such as Sensor Data Relay and Control Item Control and Security User Interface Control or User Identity Management .

In an alternative embodiment BIRD song may also provide for signaling reporting and or other response to an extant normal state . . . BIRD song may be supported by various system services including BIRD Security Item Control and Security Remote Message System Third Party Control Item Team Interface and Management Active Item Interface and Management and others.

A BIRD may contain numerous system services software routines hardware functions and hardware and software operations as discussed here in conjunction with and elsewhere throughout this document. In an embodiment either all of these services routines functions and operations or a subset of these services routines functions and operations may be made accessible to third party computer programmers and their computer programs . Such access to BIRD services routines functions and operations may enable third party programmers to provide additional alternative or enhanced software for the BIRD .

As is well known in the art access to the services routines functions and operations of a computational system is generally provided through a public application programming interface API . Such a public API may come in the form of documented function calls which may be employed in third party programs written in such languages as C Java and other languages well known in the art. Such programs once loaded into BIRD memory or linked to the BIRD via for example a configuration computer may control some BIRD operations via the API function calls.

The BIRD s Public API is the collection of internal system services software routines hardware functions and hardware and software operations which are made available for use by third party computer programmers and their computer programs. For example some or all of the exemplary function calls shown in respectively as well as other functions algorithms methods and routines taught throughout this document may be part of a BIRD s public API .

In an embodiment other elements of BIRD operations made be made available via the public API as well. For example a table of BIRD logic such as the exemplary Table .T of FIGS. B and C or BIRD data structures or BIRD internal code for implementing such a logic table made also be made available for modification or enlargement enhancement via the public API either via direct memory access or via suitable BIRD API function calls.

A BIRD user interface module may contain the necessary code routines and functions to support these user interface operations and requirements.

In an embodiment a BIRD is a substantially dedicated device meaning it functions principally or exclusively for the self determination of an associated item as extant normal . . or displaced anomalous . . . In such an embodiment most or all of the necessary BIRD software components may be fully integrated into the BIRD operating system . Part or all of the operating system software may be stored in and or loaded from NVRAM .M.N or ROM EEPROM Flash memory .M.R .

Or as discussed in detail below in this document an active item BIRD .Act may be coupled with or be an integrated element of an active item .Act . In such embodiments some or all elements of the BIRD OS may be integrated into an operating system otherwise associated with the active item .Act . In an alternative embodiment of an active item .Act some or all elements of the BIRD OS may be implemented as application software running on top of the native active item operating system. In particular in an embodiment some or all elements of BIRD logic may be implemented as an application program running on top of the general native active item .Act operating system.

Usage expectations were introduced above see for example C and P and are discussed further here and below in conjunction with and other figures throughout this document. In an embodiment it is a combination of BIRD logic and the BIRD s usage expectations which are typically specific both to a particular authorized user AU and a particular item which determine in part the analyses and comparisons made by the BIRD in steps and of the exemplary method see above .

In an alternative embodiment the usage expectations may define item use item environment or environmental influences when the item is subject to anomalous or unexpected usage.

Usage expectations for an item may be expressed in the form of numeric data or parameters a data structure symbolic parameters values logical expressions algebraic and or Boolean representations waveforms or matrix representations distributed data systems holographic neural network etc. or any other symbolic formalism which may be used to represent any of 

 i a typical or likely external environment for an item which may include among other elements both the location or boundaries of the environment and the time when the item may be expected to be in the environment 

 ii typical or likely environmental forces or phenomena which may impinge on the item again possibly with time frame boundaries or other associated time parameters 

 ii a typical or likely manner of usage of the item again possibly with time frame boundaries or other associated time parameters or . . .

 iii a typical or likely internal condition or state of operations of the item again possibly with time frame boundaries or other associated time parameters .

In the alternative or as an adjunct usage expectations may also be designated as representing a possible anomalous environment anomalous usage or anomalous internal state condition . for an item.

In embodiments where usage expectation represents a typical or likely item environment usage condition or state then the following may apply during field use of the BIRDed item 

Actual detected environment usage conditions are generally reflected in usage data .U discussed throughout this document. Any usage data .U which falls outside the scope indicated by the usage expectations may indicate the item is lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. or possibly that the item is being used in some inappropriate manner or is otherwise anomalous . .

Usage expectations are typically programmed into a BIRD during a training period also referred to as a training period but may also be modified during item usage and monitoring.

In an embodiment the location usage expectations .Loc may include listings of one or more specific expected locations .L or expected regions .L which the authorized user AU routinely visits or expects to routinely visit with the item and or locations .L where the item may be routinely stored. These locations .L typically include both home base locations .HB and daily life locations .DL as well as possibly zones .Z .

In an embodiment location usage expectations .Loc for each location .L may include various types of location and sensor data pertinent to the authorized user AU and the item including for example and without limitation 

Name Descriptive location name for the benefit of the authorized user system administrator and similar parties.

Type Home base location .HB daily life location .DL zone .Z see above for further discussion and in alternative embodiments possibly other additional or alternative location types.

Definition Type How the location is defined. Various types of data and data structures may be employed to define a location including for example and without limitation perimeter definitions based on geographic coordinates of border vertices perimeter definitions based on radial distances from a central coordinate references to various maps place names building names and other location definition means as well.

In an embodiment a location may be defined with reference to a distinctive location identification signal or beacon which may be emitted by RF devices at certain locations. See integration with data streams below for further related discussion.

Coordinates The coordinates or other data which actually define the location. Shown in are data pointers JHC JHC JDL to suitable data structures not shown but stored in BIRD memory which actually contain the location coordinates.

Zone Definition If the location is divided into zones .Z a data pointer to a data structure again not shown but stored in BIRD memory which defines the boundaries of the zones.

Days The day s of the week when the item and or the authorized user AU with the item may be found within the location .L . In an embodiment not illustrated additional parameters may be used to indicate additional factors such as days when the item may only be in storage in the location .L or days when the item may only be in use within the location .L and not in storage etc. Shown in is an exemplary day format where the days Sunday through Monday are numbered from 1 to 7. The format is exemplary only and other formats may be employed as well.

Times The time s of the day when the item and or the authorized user AU with the item may be found within the location .L . In an embodiment not illustrated additional parameters may be used to indicate additional factors such as times when the item may only be in storage in the location .L or times when the item may only be in use within the location and not in storage etc. Show in is a time format where the days Sunday through Monday are numbered from 1 to 7 and the corresponding times on those days are expressed in 2400 hour format. The format is exemplary only and other formats may be employed as well.

Expected usage parameters .P .G pertain to expected general item usage .P or expected patterns .G of item usage which in an embodiment may be viewed also as an element of psyIteMetrics also discussed further below . In an embodiment these usage parameters .P .G may include for example and without limitation 

 Time Flex The Times field discussed above specifies the hours or time range when the item is expected to be within a given location. The Time Flex may be used to indicate a fudge factor or some flexibility in the time range particularly at the ends of the indicated time range . For example if the item should be within a given location for one hour say from 1200 to 1300 hours then a 10 time flex would indicate a possible variability of six 6 minutes at either end of that time range . That is the item might arrive within the location up to six minutes early or six minutes late and might leave that location up to six minutes early or six minutes late.

Flex Min An alternative way of specifying the flexibility at either end of the time range only specified in specific number of minutes rather than a percentage.

Max Step Out Time The Times field discussed above specifies the hours when the item is expected to be within a given location .L . In real life usage an authorized user AU may take an item outside of a given specified usage location for some periods of time. The Max Step Out Time indicates the maximum time in minutes or some other specified time units that the item may be outside the expected location .L . In an embodiment the Max Step Out Time may indicate a total number of minutes during a time frame. In an alternative embodiment the Max Step Out Time may indicate a maximum contiguous period of minutes.

Stagnancy Indicates how long the item may be off person typically meaning stationary .Stat or not subject to personal user motions before the item is identified as being stationary .Stat for too long a time. This provides the value for the stationary limit discussed above in conjunction with and other figures. In the value of 9999 is used as an exemplary code value to indicate that stagnancy may not apply in some contexts. For example an authorized user AU may consider it to be acceptable if the item is left lying about off person .OffP for an indefinite amount of time while the item is at home.

The above identified data elements of location usage expectations .Loc are exemplary only. Additional or alternative data elements may be employed as well.

In an embodiment certain usage expectation data fields are inherently related to whether or not an item is considered absent without leave AWOL . If an expected location .L is defined as a home base location .HB under Type then the days and times when that item should be in that location provide the basis for AWOL determinations if the item is not actually present in that location when it should be the item is AWOL . Alternatively or additionally if the is in a home base location .HB when it should not be the item may also be considered AWOL .

One or more additional AWOL related data fields may be employed as well. For example a user may indicate that some expected locations .L are not home base locations .HB for example they are not typically used for item storage but may still be subject to AWOL evaluations. This may apply for example to recreational locations or other expected locations .L that the user routinely visits at specifics times and dates. Similarly data fields may be provided to indicate whether an item is required to be within a specified location during the specified time or on the other hand only that the item may be that is is allowed to be but is not required to be within the specified location during the specified time.

In an embodiment the location usage expectations .Loc may include listings of one or more specific expected commuting routes .CR which the authorized user AU routinely transits or expects to transit with the item . Route information may be used by the BIRD for several forms of processing within the scope of BIRD Logic including for example and without limitation 

In an embodiment the location usage expectations .Loc for each travel route .CR may include various types of routing pertinent to the authorized user AU and the item including for example and without limitation 

Name This may either be a descriptive name of a specific route a street a bus or train transit line or similar or may be a name which is descriptive of a class or group of travel routes or descriptive of a mode or purpose of transit work recreation etc .

Mode A type or category of the transportation mode for example car bus train bicycle walking running etc.

Coordinates The coordinates or other data which actually define the transport path or paths. In an embodiment more than one path for example multiple roads may be included in a coordinate definition. Shown in are data pointers TR . . . TR to suitable data structures not shown but stored in BIRD memory which actually contain the travel route coordinates.

The above identified data elements of location usage expectations .Loc for travel routes .CR are designed to identify the routes in categories or groups associated with travel types highway local mass transit etc. . In an alternative embodiment travel routes may instead be clustered accorded to a combined route travelled by the authorized user AU of the item . For example a travel route may be defined or identified as a cluster of travel types and modes related to getting to or from work each day such a route may include modes of walking automobile public transport and even biking all under one travel route definition.

The above identified data elements of location usage expectations .Loc for travel routes .CR are exemplary only. Additional or alternative data elements may be employed as well including for example and without limitation 

Time Date Information Data elements pertaining to the dates or times when an item may be or should be found on a travel route 

Route Imagery Data For a BIRD which may be expected to obtain or possibly obtain a view of a route which can be detected by the BIRD s cameras .C .V images associated with a travel route may also be provided as a means for the BIRD to determine when it is traveling along the route. Such imaging means may be in addition to or in the alternative to location determinations via GPS and similar systems.

Vehicle or Transport Path Beacon Information Identification of specific vehicles or carriers the item is expected to encounter for example an automobile train or bus may transmit an electronic self identification signal or beacon and so enable a BIRD to determine whether or not the item is onboard the correct vehicle see below for a discussion of BIRD integration with ambient data streams .

However in an embodiment applicable usage expectations and especially morphIteMetrics may be copied or transferred from a BIRD . associated with a first item . to a second BIRD . associated with another item . .

In an embodiment the usage expectations associated with morphIteMetrics may include listings of one or more parameters waveforms or other data representations associated with various user activities and or physiological features 

In an embodiment motions associated with walking may be represented by specific parameters such as average walking speed maximum walking speed average user stride length average user bounce height the up and down movement associated with walking average user sway side to side motion and other parameters. In an alternative embodiment user walking motion may be represented by waveforms or waveform representations Fourier decompositions wavelet representations etc. or other data structures not shown in the figure .

In an embodiment aspects of walking and related activities may also be expressed in terms of percentages of time that the user engages in such activities. For example walking morphIteMetrics . may indicate the percentages of time the authorized user AU is expected to stand or sit and the associated magnitudes of user body motions while standing or seated. These motion magnitudes Mot. Mag. in the figure are illustrated with arbitrary values and units in the figure and should not be construed as limiting in any way. 

Exemplary parameters used to represent expected user arm and hand movements with exemplary data values are illustrated in . Data values shown are exemplary and arbitrary and should not be construed as limiting in any way. 

In an alternative embodiment arm and hand motion morphIteMetrics . may be represented by waveforms or waveform representations Fourier decompositions wavelet representations etc. or other data structures not shown in the figure .

In an embodiment aspects of arm and hand motion morphIteMetrics . may also be expressed in terms of percentages of time or average number of minutes of time that the item is in hand or similar time related metrics. Such arm and hand motion morphIteMetrics . may also be considered an element of psyIteMetrics for the item discussed further immediately below.

The usage expectations for physiological iteMetrics . may be stored in the BIRD in a variety of data forms including various parameterized forms waveforms and other data structures. Shown in are data pointers FP VP NP IS PS to suitable data structures which may be stored in BIRD memory .

In general the morphIteMetric parameters shown in the figure as well as the particular data values are exemplary only and should not be construed as limiting. Many other psyIteMetrics parameters may be envisioned within the teachings scope and spirit of the present system and method.

In an embodiment the morphIteMetrics stored as part of usage expectations may also serve as a foundation for some psyIteMetrics . For example For a particular authorized user AU and a particular item the BIRD may store any correlations which are identified during a training session between any of walking morphIteMetrics . arm hand motion iteMetrics . physiological iteMetrics . and or possibly other sensed environmental data light exposure sound exposure temperature etc. .

PsyIteMetrics which are typically determined and identified during a training or training session to identify behavioral aspects of item usage by an authorized user AU . PsyIteMetrics for an item and user may vary depending on context for example depending on location. illustrates exemplary psyIteMetrics which vary depending on an authorized user s location in this case the home the workplace and other daily life locations .DL .

The psyIteMetric parameters shown in the figure as well as the particular data values are exemplary only and should not be construed as limiting. Many other psyIteMetrics parameters may be envisioned within the teachings scope and spirit of the present system and method.

In an embodiment it is the BIRD s usage expectations which determine along with BIRD logic and usage data .U the analyses and comparisons made by the BIRD in steps and of the exemplary method . The usage expectations express in formal terms the ExD criteria for an item .

In an embodiment BIRD logic consists of algorithms and methods which may be substantially pre programmed into a BIRD possibly with various operational and logical parameters which may be accessible by an authorized user AU for tweaking or fine tuning the BIRD logic . The pre defined algorithms and methods constitute the default BIRD logic .

Similarly in an embodiment the BIRD s usage expectations may be determined or defined according to a number of processes or methods including for example and without limitation 

 i direct configuration by an authorized user AU employing a pre established user interface which is an element of BIRD navigation 

 ii determination by the BIRD based on item usage by the authorized user AU during a training or training session 

 iii modification by the BIRD based on authorized user AU feedback and other events during a training session and or during field use of the item .

The usage expectations may also be defined via a combination of the preceding three methods. As discussed above in conjunction with the usage expectations may take the form of various values parameters and data structures which characterize expected use of an item by an authorized user AU .

In an embodiment when BIRD navigation presents a pre defined user interface or automatically defines expected item usage during a training session BIRD navigation has several features which are salient here 

 a BIRD navigation will collect environmental data which is congruent with the structure of the default BIRD logic meaning BIRD navigation will collect such data as is necessary for the default BIRD logic to determine the extant normal . . vs. displaced anomalous state . . of the BIRDed item and

 b BIRD navigation stores the data in data structures and generates processed data which is again congruent with the default BIRD logic 

 c Any user interface presented by BIRD navigation will constrain user data entry to conform to the requirements of the default BIRD logic .

In an embodiment and in the sense characterized by features a b and c immediately above the BIRD may have a data framework in place which constitutes a default structure for BIRD navigation .

In an embodiment a BIRD may be configured to accept and apply supplemental usage expectations .S which may incorporate as well elements of supplemental BIRD logic . For brevity such supplemental usage expectations BIRD logic will simply be referred to as supplemental usage expectations .S .

In an embodiment supplemental usage expectations .S may at times augment or extend existing the default BIRD logic and the default BIRD navigation . In an alternative embodiment supplemental usage expectations .S may override some elements of existing system default BIRD logic .

Supplemental usage expectations .S may be entered into a BIRD and BIRD memory through a variety of means including for example from a configuration computer .

In an embodiment supplemental usage expectations .S may be used to define new or novel anomalous item states . that is states apart from the displaced states . of lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen . In an embodiment supplemental usage expectations .S may be used to define new or novel normal states . of usage that is states apart from extant . or possibly sub states of being extant . . In an embodiment supplement usage expectations may enable third party vendors to provide extensions to BIRD logic and BIRD navigation .

The supplemental usage expectations .S may be expressed in a variety of forms. The supplemental usage expectations .S shown in are presented in a kind of pseudocode representative of the generic computer code often employed in the art of computer software. Other forms of mathematical logical and or symbolic representation may be employed as well including for example and without limitation 

The pseudocode shown in and used elsewhere in this document is exemplary only and many other examples of suitable code may be envisioned. The pseudocode may in practice be implemented via any number of known programming languages. The code once translated into executable form would be run on the processor of the BIRD .

In an embodiment supplemental usage expectations .S may be expressed or symbolized and analyzed in operation via clearly defined combinations of 

Not shown in are conditional elements which may be considered as implicit. Thus the supplemental usage expectations .S may be understood as expressing 

Supplemental usage expectation .S. indicates whether or not an item is typically stationary .Stat and for how long in normal usage. It will be understood that exactly how still an item is when stationary .Stat may be defined by other parameters not shown.

Supplemental usage expectation .S. indicates whether or not an item is typically within a certain temperature range during normal usage. It will be understood that temperature range may refer to the environment to which an item is typically exposed such as the temperature of an indoor environment or outdoor environment within which the item is used or the temperature of an aqueous environment such as a swimming pool or other body of water in which the item is used or the temperature may refer to a temperature caused by an activity of the item itself if for example the item is an electrically active item.

Supplemental usage expectation .S. indicates whether or not an item in normal usage typically does not go outside a certain environmental temperature range for more than an indicated amount of time.

Supplemental usage expectation .S. indicates whether or not an item is typically within certain defined locations or regions .L or along certain travel routes or within certain buildings if the item is in normal usage. It will be understood that the defined locations or regions .L or the defined travel routes or the location and or spatial extent or scope of the buildings will be characterized using separate parameters.

Supplemental usage expectation .S. indicates whether or not an item is typically within certain defined locations or regions .L or along certain travel routes for a certain percentage of time of a defined time period if the item is in normal usage.

Supplemental usage expectation .S. indicates a maximum time duration for which an item may be stationary .Stat during a defined time period if the item is in normal usage. It will again be understood that exactly how still an item is when stationary .Stat may be defined by other parameters.

Supplemental usage expectation .S. indicates whether or not an item is typically experiencing or exposed to a defined temperature range for a defined percentage of the time if the item is in normal usage.

Supplemental usage expectations .S. indicates whether or not an item is typically within a defined region for a certain percentage of the time during a defined time period.

Supplemental usage expectation .S. pertains to usage locations routes buildings times days of the week indicating that an item is normally used according to the indicated criteria.

Supplemental usage expectations .S. are several versions of usages elements which indicate whether or not an item is typically within certain defined expected locations .L and in motion within defined acceleration levels during specified times of day.

Supplemental usage expectations .S may be defined in various ways and also grouped into sets of related expectations in various ways. discussed below addresses exemplary sets of supplemental usage expectations .S . discussed below illustrates an exemplary dialog box for defining sets of supplemental usage expectations .S .

For purposes of discussion throughout this document it will be understood that the term reference number usage expectations may typically refer to either or both of the default usage expectation framework generally built into the BIRD operating system and user defined supplemental usage expectations .S . Context may in some cases indicate that the system default usage expectation framework is under consideration as for example with respect to above . Where supplemental usage expectations .S are specifically intended as immediately above in the discussion of the appropriate terminology and label supplemental usage expectations .S will be employed.

In an embodiment a BIRD may have for a single item and a single authorized user AU multiple different sets of usage expectations either default expectations and or supplemental usage expectations .S . For example in an embodiment each of the different location usage expectations Location 1 Location 2 and Location 3 of above may be considered a distinct set of usage expectations for a total of three sets. For another example each of the different psyIteMetrics Jane s Home Jane s Office Jane s Daily Life of may be considered a distinct set of usage expectations.

Definitions for multiple sets of usage expectations can be used to define the overall expected environment for an item when the item is in an extant normal state . . in specific expected locations .L . Similarly definitions for multiple sets of usage expectations can be used to define the overall expected environment for an item when the item is in extant normal usage . . at various times of day or days of the week that is in different time frames or more generally in different detection contexts . Throughout it will be understood that in alternative embodiments usage expectations may be employed which are indicative of displaced anomalous item usage . . instead. 

Usage expectation groups may be defined by authorized users AU or by the computational intelligence of the BIRD itself for example by BIRD Navigation and include combinations of sets of usage expectations . The combined usage expectations will indicate two or more item statuses in which a particular item is expected to be found in normal usage or in an alternative embodiments in anomalous usage . .

 1 an expectation than an item in extant normal usage . . should be found moving at or below a first specific velocity and

 2 a further expectation than the same item in extant normal usage . . should never be found to be accelerated at greater than a first specific acceleration.

 1 an expectation than the same item in extant normal usage . . should be found moving between a second specific velocity and a third specific velocity and

 2 a further expectation than the same item in extant normal usage . . should never be found to be accelerated at greater than a second specific acceleration.

A third fourth and additional groups of motion expectations MS MS etc. may be defined as well for the item .

 1 an expectation than the item in extant normal usage . . should be found within a first specific geographic region and or

 2 a further expectation than the same item in extant normal usage . . should be found in a first specific building which may or may not be within the first specific geographic region .

 1 an expectation than the same item in extant normal usage . . should be found in a second specific building and or

 2 a further expectation than the same item in extant normal usage . . should be found in a third specific building.

A third fourth and additional groups of location expectations LoS LoS etc. may be defined as well for the item .

Similar groups of usage expectations TS TS TS etc. may be defined for expected temperatures surrounding the item during normal usage. Similar groups of expectations SS SS etc. may be defined for an ambient sound level and or ambient sound qualities surrounding the item during extant normal usage . . . Similar groups of expectations LiS LiS etc. may be defined for an ambient light level ambient color and or other optically related qualities surrounding the item during extant normal usage . . .

Similar groups of usage expectations may be defined for other types of sensed environmental data such as air pressure humidity surface pressure ambient RF qualities and or other sensed environmental qualities surrounding the item during extant normal usage . . .

Usage expectation groups may be further combined into context specific expectation groups . Several exemplary context specific expectation groups are shown in . A Home Expectations group .H may contain usage expectations for items which are kept in the home or for items which may leave the home but are sometimes at home. An Office Expectations group .O may contain usage expectations for items which are kept in the office or for items which may leave the office but are sometimes in the office. Similarly context specific expectation groups may be defined for local travel .LT the golf course .GL the gym .GM or for times of day such as the evening .E .

Such context specific expectation groups may be shared via file transfers or data transfers among multiple BIRDs which in turn may each be used with various respective items which share a common usage such as home office gym golf club etc. . Once shared or transferred from one BIRD to another a context specific expectation group such as the Home Expectation set H may be further fine tuned or modified for each specific item in the home or other context.

A BIRD may be configured to apply different context specific expectation groups at different times of day and or on different days of the week. An exemplary first application .A of context specific expectation groups is shown for weekdays. The BIRD may be configured so that Home Expectations group .H is in effect from approximately the hours of midnight to 0715 and again from approximately the hours of 2130 to 2400. The Office Expectations set . may be in effect from approximately the hours of 0800 to 1830. Similarly the Travel Expectations set .LT and the Evening Expectations set .E may be in effect for the hours illustrated.

It will be seen that the BIRD may be configured so that more than one context specific expectation group is in effect at the same time. This may reflect that an authorized user AU of the BIRD has determined that alternative uses of a BIRDed item may be possible during a given time frame. For example in the first application .A the user expects that during the hours of approximately 2030 to 2400 the BIRDed item may either be at home otherwise be in general evening use. As such the expected environmental conditions for the item may be either those for the Home Expectation set .H or the Evening Expectation set .E .

An exemplary second application .B of context specific expectation groups is also shown here applying to the use of the BIRDed item on the weekends and holidays.

An exemplary Set Activity Velocity Ranges dialog box is used to define contribute to defining or editing user specific iteMetrics for item motion which in turn may become an element of the usage expectations . The dialog box enables a user to define one or more typical acceleration range associated with the authorized user AU of an item . For various types of activities or activity contexts a user may engage in a velocity or acceleration range is associated with the activity context. The velocity ranges shown are in arbitrary units and are for purposes of illustration only. Since different authorized users AU may move differently for example walk at different speeds or run at different speeds the velocity ranges may be adjusted accordingly.

An exemplary Set Criteria Precision Requirements dialog box may be used to define contribute to defining or editing a set of usage expectations which may have multiple classes of parameters such as location velocity and acceleration. The dialog box enables a user to define for the usage expectations an degree of precision required of various types of sensor data such as location velocity and acceleration. Such precision criteria may for example define tolerance levels for different types of sensed environmental data.

For example a top priority parameter 1 may be expected to fall exactly within specific ranges a medium priority parameter 2 may be expected to fall closely within specific ranges while a low priority parameter 3 may be expected to fall only approximately within specific ranges. Degrees of exactness or variability may be set via other dialog boxes not shown .

The same item when in the possession of different owners or authorized users AU may also be assigned different precision requirements for different users.

The dialog box includes a detection context name field used to pick or set a name for the usage expectation group . The name may pertain for example to a specific detection context in which an item may be used such as a home base location .HB such as the home or office or a daily life location .DL or an activity type such as shopping or time a time of day such as the evening . Another dialog box or a New button not illustrated in the figure may be used to define additional detection contexts see below or usage expectation group names. Preferred Criteria radio buttons may be used to help define various logical options for a usage expectation group .

In an embodiment various predefined fields may be employed to define different criteria for extant normal usage . . of an item when the item is in use by an authorized person or user. For example check boxes menus data entry fields and radio buttons may be used to define expected item behavior pertaining to item velocity in different activity contexts.

Similar dialog box data entry elements may be used to define percentages of time the item will be carried on a person in extant normal usage and the amount of time an item may be stationary .

The dialog box may also enable the authorized user AU or system administrator to set parameters pertaining to general expected environmental conditions for the item . For example the authorized user AU or administrator may set the expected item temperature environment s for extant normal item usage . . .

The dialog box may also enable the authorized user AU or system administrator to set parameters pertaining to location usage expectations .Loc for the item . For example the authorized user AU or administrator may employ GUI elements to set an expected location based on zip code a pre defined map a named area or possible other location defining parameters such as geographic coordinates not illustrated .

It will be understood that the dialog box is exemplary only and other or additional dialog boxes or components of dialog boxes may be used to define usage expectations and groups of usage expectations . In particular it will be understood that BIRDs employing other or additional types of environmental sensors may require dialog box elements pertaining to those sensors and the types of environmental phenomena sensed by them for example orientation parameters optical parameters audio parameters pressure parameters and so on .

It will also be understood that usage expectations for an item and its associated BIRD indicating expected extant normal item usage . . may be defined additionally or in the alternative via software code uploaded parameters and conditions data files containing parameters and conditions and via other means and processes. Some of these alternative or additional means or processes are discussed further throughout this document.

It will also be understood that usage expectations for an item and its associated BIRD may be defined in terms of parameters expected for displaced anomalous environments or usage . . rather than or in addition to parameters expected for extant normal environments or usage . . .

Parts of the discussion as presented above pertains to a two state definition of item behavior extant normal . . vs. displaced anomalous . . . In an alternative embodiment additional states of an item may be characterized including a variety of displaced anomalous state . . s such as lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. stolen .. or wandering .. and also various species of extant normal states . . such as a borrowed state .. . Additional states may also be pertinent to discrimination of the anomaly alert level AAL already discussed above which indicates the estimated probability by the BIRD that the alert that is the determination of displaced anomalous item behavior is valid. For example AAL states may be defined which include extant normal usage . . low indication of displaced anomalous usage . . medium indication of displaced anomalous usage . . high indication of displaced anomalous usage . . certainty or near certainly of displaced anomalous usage . . .

The Define Extant Normal Usage Expectation Group dialog box as well as other related dialog boxes used to configure the BIRD may be suitably modified with additional fields and options to characterize ranges of sensor readings associated with different categories of extant normal usage . . different categories of displaced anomalous usage . . different AALs and other item usage distinctions as well.

In an embodiment usage expectations may take the form of usage patterns which can include elements which are probabilistic have self similarity at different scales fractals have repetitive or semi repetitive underlying data structures are time generators of new elements cellular automata and have other elements which benefit from characterizations alternative to or in addition to concise algebraic or limited parameter definitions. Such usage patterns may be analyzed by BIRD navigation during training or training sessions and possibly refined during extant normal . . field use of an item . At the same time during field use BIRD logic may then be configured to compare real time usage pattern assessments with the stored usage patterns.

For example for a BIRDed item a pattern of usage over time may be expressed through waveforms representative of the item s location motion light exposure sound exposure or similar environmental data. The waveform s may be deconstructed via various mathematical analyses such as Fourier analysis or wavelet analysis. Future determinations of extant normal . . or displaced anomalous . . item usage by the BIRD may be made by comparing current waveform decomposition data for example Fourier or wavelet coefficients with historical waveform data with suitable parameters to allow for some inevitable statistical variation. In some cases waveforms representations of data from different types of sensors may be combined by the BIRD to form composite waveforms suitable for such analysis.

For another example a pattern of item usage over time based on data from a single type of BIRD sensor or from multiple types of sensor data may be integrated into an artificial neural network representation stored in the BIRD . The neural network representation is first trained to recognize extant normal . . patterns of environmental context and or item behavior and then is later used to monitor the environment and item and identify significant variations from the extant normal . . patterns. Various algorithms for pattern recognition training and reinforced learning may be employed to train a neural network to recognize extant normal . . and or displaced anomalous . . item usage environment.

Usage expectations may have distinctive probabilistic stochastic elements for example in terms of distributions of events. Consider for example the usage of ordinary keys .K such as house car and office keys all together on one key chain by a typical user.

The keys .K may sometimes be in motion subject to acceleration or taken out of the user s pocket and so exposed to ambient light at predictable times of day such as when leaving the house driving to work leaving the office etc. . To that extent motion of the keys .K or exposure of the keys .K to light may be predicted in relatively reliable or deterministic ways during specific time frames of the day. For example the user may consistently leave the house at about 0830 hours arriving at work at 0900 hours with appropriate implications for usage expectations for the keys .K . 

In between these predictable time periods however it may be difficult to say exactly at what times of day the keys .K might be in motion or might be taken out of pocket. However on account of human nature and the relative consistency of personal habits it may be possible to determine that the authorized user AU is likely to move about or remove his or her keys .K from a pocket for a fairly predictable number of times during the day. Similarly for a given user the distribution of time intervals between removals of the keys .K from a pocket or purse and the length of time of removal from the pocket or purse may follow a reliable statistical distribution. Such distributions may be determined through measurement of extant normal usage . . by the user during a training period and then used as a basis to determine displaced anomalous usage . . of the keys .K . Thus if the keys are stolen .. the thief s statistical distribution of key usage is unlikely to conform to that of the authorized user AU . As a result displaced anomalous usage . . may be identified.

More generally either or both of BIRD logic or usage expectations may constructed with various elements parameters or mathematical terms which are approximate probabilistic or otherwise logically fuzzy. Such fuzzy logic and parameters may be more consistent with real world environments and sensor readings for items. These elements may include for example and without limitation 

It will be recognized that defining item behavior by usage expectations which are based on extant normal item usage . . is only one way to define item behavior. In an alternative embodiment item usage may be defined by usage expectations indicating a state or environment in which an item may be found when the usage of the item is displaced anomalous . . . In an alternative embodiment combinations of normal and anomalous usage expectations may be employed. These considerations apply to complex embodiments of usage expectations as usage patterns waveforms fractals neural network representations cellular automata probabilistic stochastic represcntations etc. as well as to usage expectations in relatively less complex structures or representations.

In an embodiment analogous usage expectations with variations in specific parameters may be associated with different forms of BIRD alerts and notifications associated with BIRD song . For example in an embodiment anomaly alert levels AALs may be pre coded or predefined by the BIRD via built in BIRD logic and or BIRD song and then suitably fine tuned for individual items in conjunction with usage expectations . Suitable user interface means dialog boxes wizards etc. may be provided to the authorized user AU to adjust both the usage expectations and the associated AAL settings.

In an alternative embodiment some or all BIRD alerts or notifications such as for example anomaly alert levels may be associated with various item events via supplemental usage expectations .S .

For another example and for example for a wallet .W or keys .K which are usually kept in a pocket or closed purse 

In other words the longer the wallet .W or keys .K are exposed to light the higher the likelihood that the usage is anomalous . . Similarly suppose the authorized user AU has ExD criteria such that he expects to carry the wallet .W or keys .K about all day and assume the user engages in some motion most of the day. Then the AALs may be set so that the longer the wallet .W or keys .K are stationary .Stat the higher the likelihood of displaced usage . for example that the user left the keys or wallet lying about somewhere and so has lost or misplaced them . Beyond a certain amount of time with no motion the AAL settings would indicate a 100 probability of a displaced state . .

Discussed above are the different categories of sensor data associated with a BIRD see for example discussion associated with . Table .T of summarizes the distinctions in this document among sensor data .

In an embodiment the descriptive labels at the far right of for example. Key chain at home out on table . . . etc. are not part of historical environmental data log and are shown only as exemplary suggestions of when where and how an item might be in use when sensor data is detected by sensors . In an alternative embodiment such descriptive labels might be stored in the data log for example by being added as annotation by an authorized user AU . In an alternative embodiment the descriptive labels might be stored in the data log for example by being added as annotation by a natural language module of the BIRD which is configured to recognize and define the when where and how of item use in natural language.

A first portion or first set of records of the exemplary historical environmental data log may be data recorded by the BIRD when for example the keys are at home out on a table not only stationary .Stat but also motionless at night. Each data record is marked with a date time stamp indicating when the data was recorded. The data includes the location of the keys indicated here symbolically as GPS 1.0 the acceleration and velocity both 0 for keys lying motionless and the ambient light level shown as 0 though in practice a low ambient light level may be recorded even at night . Also shown is a single data field PSD with processed sensor data .P though in fact the BIRD may calculate and the environmental data log may store numerous types of processed or derived data. See for example the discussion associated with below of method Meth and the resulting associated processed data types. For more complex forms of derived data such as waveforms or other functions a data field for the processed data .P may include a data pointer or other reference to a suitable data structure.

The time date data is obtained from the BIRD s clock timer calendar . The remaining real time and historical sensor data is obtained from various BIRD sensors The data for location is obtained from location sensor .L . The data for acceleration and velocity is obtained from motion sensor .M . The data for light intensity is obtained from one or more of the camera .C the electromagnetic sensor .E the optical sensor .Opt or the video camera .V . Other categories or types of environmental data not shown may be collected and recorded from other sensors as well. The processed data .P is calculated by the BIRD s processor according to the requirements of BIRD logic . Sec step of exemplary method and also discussion associated with A A and other figures throughout this document for further discussion of derived data .P .

A next successive portion or successive set of exemplary records of the exemplary historical environmental data log may be data .P recorded and or derived by the BIRD when the keys .K are at home out on a table motionless at dawn. The recorded data will be similar to that recorded for the keys at night but the ambient light level shown in arbitrary representative units will start to increase as daylight enters the home. Other sensor readings may change as well. For example if people are waking in the home a recorded sound level may increase. The ambient recorded light level may also increase significantly and abruptly if someone wakes up and turns on the inside lights.

Successive portions of exemplary records are shown for times throughout the day for example environmental data for when the keys .K are at home moving about the home in an owner s pocket environmental data for when the key chain .K is out of the owner s pocket as the owner locks the house door then opens and starts car environmental data for when the owner is on the road driving for example to a job environmental data when the keys or key chain .K is still out of pocket as the owner locks the car and has the keys out for entry to an office while walking to the office environmental data for the keys .K while the keys are in the owners pocket with minimal body movement while the owner is at his or her desk and environmental data for when the owner is walking about the office with the keys .K still in pocket.

Except for time and date data all exemplary data .H .R .P shown uses arbitrary representative units intended mainly to show relative changes in intensity for example more light or less light high speed or lower speed etc. . In real application appropriate units and associated appropriately scaled data values would be used for light intensity velocity acceleration and other sensor measurements.

It will be noted that the illustrated exemplary historical environmental data log shows historical environmental data .H as being recorded at one minute intervals. This time interval is exemplary only. In an embodiment environmental data may be recorded and or stored at more frequent intervals for example once every ten seconds or once every second or even multiple times per second or environmental data may be recorded and or stored at less frequent intervals for example once every two minutes or once every five minutes or even longer intervals . An advantage of storing less data is a reduced requirement for memory by the BIRD . An advantage of storing more data is a more fine grained analysis of environmental conditions.

In an embodiment the BIRD may store different types of environmental data from different sensors at different time intervals. For example location or motion data may be stored in time intervals on the order of seconds while humidity or moisture data may be stored in time intervals on the order of minutes.

In an alternative or complementary embodiment the BIRD may store more recent data .R at more frequent intervals supporting fine grained environmental analysis of current and recent conditions while selectively deleting older data .H so that it is stored at less frequent time intervals. Such embodiments balance requirements for fine grained analysis with requirements for reduced data storage requirements.

In an alternative or complementary embodiment the BIRD may selectively stop recording certain kinds of data altogether depending on environmental conditions. For example if the BIRD determines that the BIRD and its associated item are indoors then humidity data may not be recorded or stored at all. Similarly if the BIRD determines that the BIRD s location has remained unchanged for a pre determined period of time then recording of acceleration or velocity data may cease. Recording of motion or velocity data may resume when an acceleration is detected by the motion sensor .M or when a change in position is detected by the location sensor .L .

The BIRD may employ similar environmentally contingent decision making to actually shut down some sensors and or associated circuitry when not required thereby saving power. Examples again include shutting down moisture detection when indoors or shutting down location detection when the BIRD is stationary .Stat or in the alternative shutting down motion detection when the BIRD s location remains unchanged . Choices of which sensors to shut down and or which sensor data to record or not record and or frequency of recorded data may be programmable may vary from one sensor to another and may be changed dynamically depending on time of day user selection s general location and other factors.

Step of exemplary method see above entails analyzing current and or historical environmental conditions and or item usage expectations. Step of exemplary method entails determining if the resulting usage data .U from step are in conformance with and or fall within parameters specified for expected item conditions from step of method .

 For context and for convenience of reference also reproduces steps and of method . These steps were already discussed above and the discussion will not be repeated here. Exemplary method that is the method steps specific to step of method is shown in the shaded area of . Inputs to the method are shown in the unshaded areas at the top and top left of . 

Various steps of exemplary method accept time date input from the BIRD s clock calendar timer and sensor data from sensors and from the BIRD s historical and environmental data log stored in the BIRD s memory . The clock calendar and time data may contribute to triggering specific types of calculations or analyses in time appropriate ways as well as contributing time and duration data for the calculations.

Various steps of method may also receive usage expectations with parameters and or logic for expected environmental conditions and or learned or adaptive item condition parameters algorithms data structures and similar such as neural network constructs received from the BIRD s learning module . At times exemplary method may also receive direct user input as well for example through a graphical user interface. The direct user input may for example modify the parameters of the monitoring process in real time. For example if the authorized user AU ordinarily spends the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in an office but will instead spend all or part of the day outside the office the authorized user AU may enter parameters to indicate to the BIRDed item that it will be legitimately used outside their usual context.

For convenience of exposition the steps of exemplary method will be discussed immediately below with reference to an exemplary usage expectation . see below but also repeated here for convenience 

Between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. and for the most recent hour the Item Temperature is greater than 60 F. and the Item Temperature is less than 85 F. for at least 90 of the hour.

In step of method the BIRD determines the appropriate data type requirements for data retrieval and evaluations. With reference to the exemplary usage expectation . the appropriate type of data which will be retrieved and evaluated is ambient temperature data recorded by the BIRD .

In step the BIRD determines the appropriate data scope requirements that is which data is to be retrieved. In an embodiment the data scope refers to a time frame for the data. In an alternative embodiment the scope of the data to be retrieved is defined by other considerations including for example and without limitation the magnitude of the data an estimated accuracy of the data or other factors pertaining to the data. With reference to the exemplary usage expectation . the appropriate scope of the data which will be retrieved and evaluated is ambient temperature data recorded for the immediately preceding hour as long as the current time .T is any time between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m.

In step the appropriate data determined in steps and is retrieved. With reference to the exemplary usage expectation . temperature data for the past hour is retrieved. The data may be retrieved both from current readings and from the environmental data log .

In step a calculation type is determined. Calculation types may vary widely in complexity and type. With reference to the exemplary usage expectation . the calculation type is a determination of the percentage of the past hour during which the retrieved temperature data was between the lower and upper limits of 60 and 85 F.

In step the appropriate calculations are performed on the retrieved sensor data . Results of the calculations may be a new number or value such as an average value a maximum or minimum value a percentage value or similar value a logical outcome such as a true or false result or yes or no result a trend calculation such as increasing or decreasing values or a correlation factors among the data a mathematical function or value s indicative of or associated with a mathematical function such as parameters defining a statistical distribution or Fourier coefficients or wavelet coefficients of a curve representative of the data or a complex data structure such as that associated with defining a neural network.

Regarding again steps . and . a combination of correlation and pattern recognition calculations may be used to determine a correlation between internal location in a facility and movement or usage of the item . The pattern correlation may detect that a BIRDed item is frequently in use within certain zones .Z within a facility or perhaps is typically not in use in certain locations . If at a later time the observed real time behavior of the item is opposite to the previously calculated correlation a displaced state . or an anomalous state . of the item may be occurring.

Another pattern recognition calculation . may comprise recognizing a probabilistic or deterministic regularity in location within a home base .HB or zone .Z or local movement of the item with respect to time. Again if at a later time the observed real time behavior is different from the previously calculated regularity an anomalous item usage may be in progress.

For some items which are in regular and consistent usage a broad selection of normal behavior parameters associated with processed sensor data values .P may be determined to be associated with particular days of the week. For examples items like keys .K a wallet .W or a purse .P may have one typical set of usage behaviors on working days typically Monday through Friday and a different set of parameters for weekends and holidays. Other items have usage parameters which may be determined less by particular days of the week and more by other factors such as location. For example musical instruments .M and sporting goods items .R may have one set parameters associated with processed sensor data .P when located and used or in storage at a home location and a different set of parameters associated with processed sensor data .P when taken outside the home which may be at irregular dates or times.

In figures throughout this document various exemplary plots are shown of exemplary BIRD sensor data for purposes of illustrating BIRD sensor data analysis. In many of the figures the time segments slices illustrated are on the order of one day with exemplary data subdivided or analyzed in hour units. The choice of time slices of a day and or an hour is exemplary only. The BIRD is designed to receive and interpret data on time scales which are appropriate to analyze and identify human usage of an item and environmental variations that affect or impinge upon an item . Appropriate time scales for data collection and analysis may typically range from fractions of a second to intervals of one second or several seconds up to time scales of multiple days or even weeks.

For example one means of identifying behavior or environmental factors indicative of a particular human user iteMetrics associated with an item may be to identify motion patterns velocity and acceleration reflective of a user s walking patterns or running patterns or even smaller scale motion patterns associated with movement while being seated. For such analysis data collection and analysis on the order of one second or even fractions of a second may be appropriate.

Between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. the Item Temperature is greater than 60 F. and the Item Temperature is less than 85 F.

Under usage expectation . steps and of method together determine if the environment surrounding the BIRDed item has remained strictly between 60 F. and 85 F. during the hours of 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. If yes the item usage is determined to be normal . and otherwise the item usage is determined to be anomalous . . Usage expectation . may for example be indicative of an for a BIRDed item which is expected to be wholly used in a typical room temperature controlled environment between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m.

Usage expectation . has already been discussed in part above. Usage expectation . may for example be indicative of an expected environment for an item which will be used in a typical room temperature controlled environment between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. but where the user may occasionally step into a warmer or colder environment. For example the usage expectation . may be applicable to an item carried by a person working in a supermarket who will occasionally step into a refrigerated room during the day or perhaps be near an oven where the item will be exposed for brief periods to temperatures below 60 F. or above 85 F.

Between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. there is a 98 or greater correlation between a low light level for the item indicated in arbitrary units as 0.1 and a low acceleration for the item indicated in arbitrary units as 0.01 .

In informal language the usage expectation . indicates that in normal . or extant . usage there is a very high correlation between low light exposure and low acceleration for the item. This may indicate for example an item for which i when the user is not using the item the item is typically kept in pocket limiting light exposure and the user is typically in a state of limited motion seated for example whereas ii when the user is using the item the item is out of pocket and so exposed to light and the user is likely active walking or running etc. . A hypothetical item and authorized user AU fitting this scenario might be keys .K belonging to a guard or other security personnel who keeps the keys in pocket when seated at a monitoring desk or station but typically has the keys in hand when making rounds.

In an embodiment the API function calls may be available only for use internally by the BIRD . In an alternative embodiment some or all of the API function calls may be made so called public interfaces which are available to third party programmers seeking to create enhancements to or supplements to the programs and applications provided with the BIRD .

The functions shown and others like them may be employed by BIRD programmers as part of implementing the code for usage expectations . In an embodiment the API runs on the processor of the BIRD using the logical and mathematical function hardware of the processor to make necessary environmental calculations and determinations. In an embodiment the API has the necessary internal computer code to obtain data from memory of the BIRD including data from the historical and environmental data log .

Other APIs may be envisioned as well pertaining to other kinds of sensor data including for example and without limitation API functions pertaining to location moisture or humidity BIRD orientation in space air pressure surrounding the BIRD water pressure surrounding the BIRD surface pressure on a surface of the BIRD the ambient temperature surrounding the BIRD the electromagnetic environment surrounding the BIRD vibrations experienced by the BIRD sensed radiation data radar data sonar data and chemicals detected in the environment around the BIRD .

Comparison of a BIRDed item s usage expectations or supplemental usage expectations .S with the item s usage expectations .U may occur through the steps of exemplary method as discussed above. In steps and of method the BIRD determines appropriate responses reports or signal as well as other appropriate measures in response to determining that an item is displaced anomalous . . . In step of method the BIRD may also initiate responses to its associated item being extant normal . . . The logic algorithms and or other processing which a BIRD applies to the determination of appropriate responses is referred to as BIRD song .

Combination selections indicate various ways that the different conditions may be combined that is be simultaneously present in different contexts . The response options indicate different options for the BIRD to signal a user that the BIRD and its associated item are experiencing anomalous conditions. The selection response options indicate which specific responses may be implemented.

During Time Frame 1 context C1 indicates that if the item is not in motion for more than a specified threshold number of minutes or if the item is outside an allowed area for more than a specified threshold number of minutes then the BIRD should sound a local alarm.

During Time Frame 1 context C2 indicates that if the item is not in motion for more than a specified threshold number of minutes or if the environmental sound level is greater than a specified threshold level then the BIRD should sound a local item alarm and the BIRD should also send an alert message to a user alert center a cell phone a home PC a laptop or tablet computer a LARC etc. .

It will be understood that the decision table . is exemplary only. Many more or different conditions may be employed and the conditions may be combined or interpreted through a plurality of logical relations such as AND OR XOR NOT and others. The decision table . may employ probabilistic elements as well or employ various kinds of fuzzy logic. The decision table . may be used along with or as an adjunct to other types of data structures analytical mechanisms pattern recognition and resolution systems and other general methods and systems for determining the response of the BIRD to displaced anomalous states . . for the item .

In an embodiment the BIRD song decision table . may be implemented in whole or in part as part of the response module and or the reporting module of the BIRD software. In an embodiment the BIRD song decision table . may be implemented in whole or in part as part of BIRD operating system services including local signal alert system remote messaging system third party control item control and security communications and BIRD security or the BIRD song decision table . may call upon various functions and features implemented within the same or similar operating system services.

A signal as understood here is a local sensory based prompt or emission by the BIRD which is i generally sufficient in intensity to obtain the attention of an authorized user AU or other person nearby to the BIRD and ii indicating that the BIRDed item is in some possibly displaced anomalous state . . . Signals may include for example and without limitation an alarm sound or other distinctive or vivid auditory sound emitted by the BIRD a flashing light or other distinctive or vivid visual display presented by the BIRD or a vibration or other distinctive or vivid tactile presentation by the BIRD . In an embodiment and particularly for emergency uses the signal may even be a small electric shock to be administered by a BIRD worn against the authorized user s body. The signal is generated via the BIRD s local signaling .

A report as understood here is a content oriented message which may either be presented locally on the BIRD itself or may be transmitted by the BIRD to another device or recipient such as a cell phone a user s computer a LARC AISs or item team members . A report may also be stored on the BIRD for future reference. The content may be in the form of text graphics animation a pre recorded or artificially generated vocal message alarm sounds other tones music or a combination of the above. The content may pertain to various aspects of the BIRDed item s displaced anomalous state . . . To the extent that a report may be presented locally on the BIRD a report may be viewed as a signal as well so the two presentation modes signal and report may have some overlap.

Exemplary BIRD signaling and reporting method . begins with step ... In an embodiment in step .. the BIRD responds to a self assessment by BIRD logic that the BIRDed item may be in a displaced anomalous state . . . In an embodiment BIRD logic not only assesses the displaced anomalous state . . but also generates other pertinent data as well including for example and without limitation an anomaly alert level AAL the time of detection specific associated sensor data and the usage expectation s or other criteria which triggered the signal for example a determination by a neural network system of the BIRD . Various elements of this displaced anomalous state . . data may be included in reports generated by BIRD song . In step .. the BIRD parses the displaced anomalous state . . data identifying those elements which may be pertinent for response reporting purposes. The BIRD may determine among other elements the type of displacement anomaly state . . and possibly an associated AAL generally indicative of the severity of the displaced state anomaly or the probability of the displaced state anomaly.

In step .. the BIRD obtains reporting and or signaling rules. These rules are typically retrieved from the BIRD s memory . In an embodiment these rules are provided by an authorized user AU during BIRD configuration. In an alternative embodiment the reporting signaling rules may be provided as default rules for the BIRD that is provided by the designer or manufacturer of the BIRD . In an alternative embodiment the rules may be a combination of default rules and user provided rules.

In an embodiment the reporting signaling rules may be established in whole or in part via a BIRD song decision table . . In an alternative embodiment other logical rules or other forms of tables may be employed to establish the reporting signaling rules.

In step .. the BIRD determines the environmental context. The determination may be based on sensor data pertaining to location the optically sensed environment BIRD motion and other data as well. Based on available data the BIRD determines or attempts to determine the current environment of the BIRDed item such as a home base or other storage location .HB or whether the BIRD is in an office a public space indoors or outdoors in travel etc.

In step .. the BIRD assesses available signaling and or reporting modes. This may include establishing whether the BIRD s local signaling elements are operational. It may also entail establishing whether a communication link can be successfully established with one or more of a target cell phone a target user computer a LARC AISs or item team members 

In step .. the BIRD chooses suitable signaling and or reporting modes as well as report content. The determination s are made by applying the reporting signaling rules from step .. to the current displaced anomaly state environmental context and available reporting signaling modes from steps .. respectively .

In step .. the BIRD generates the appropriate local signals s and or the appropriate reports based on the determinations made in step ... The signals are generated via local signaling elements while the report s are transmitted via the transceivers and antenna . Reports may also be presented locally via the BIRD display .D and audio output .A .

In an embodiment when a BIRD transmits a report to a remote device or LARC the BIRD is configured to expect a confirmation signal from the remote device or LARC. In the event the BIRD does not receive the confirmation signal the BIRD may be configured to transmit to an alternate remote device or LARC . In the event the BIRD does not receive the confirmation signal the BIRD may also be configured to generate a local signal even if a local signal is not normally generated for the given displaced anomalous state . . .

In an embodiment in the event the BIRD does not receive the confirmation signal the BIRD may be configured to run a general check of the communications media and protocols normally available to it such as cellular links WiFi Bluetooth general internet access etc. . In the event one media and or protocol proves to be non operative the BIRD may be configured to attempt communications via alternate media and or protocols.

In method . the BIRD may self initiate other procedures in response to a displaced anomalous item in addition to signaling and reporting. In an embodiment and while not shown in method . may entail steps similar or analogous to steps .. .. .. and .. of method . 

In an embodiment and in response to the item being lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. the BIRD may initiate one or more possible responses which may include for example and without limitation 

For example a routine level of security may either require a use to enter a password in order to shut down power for the BIRD or to use a biometric signature such as a thumbprint to shut down power. At an elevated level of security the BIRD may require both the password and the biometric signature in order to shut down power. At a routine level of security the BIRD may enable a user to readily enter in the field or on the fly changes to the BIRD s expected environment for a given day or a given period of time that is to make changes to the usage expectations . At an elevated level of security password access and or biometric signature confirmation may be required in order to change the BIRD s expected environment usage expectations . Other changes in security features may be envisioned as well in response to a determination that the BIRDed item is lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. .

The functions shown and others like them are used to report determinations of anomalous contexts or environments and or anomalous usage . and to report or signal the determinations as per step method see and as per method . see . The functions shown and others like them may be employed by BIRD programmers as part of implementing the code for the BIRD s reporting to users. In an embodiment the functions shown and others like them may be part of BIRD response module and or BIRD reporting module . In an embodiment the functions shown and others like them may be elements of the BIRD operating system for example being implemented within local signal alert system or remote messaging system . In an embodiment the functions shown and others like them may be accessible by third party programmers via the BIRD OS s public API .

In an embodiment the API would run on the processor of the BIRD . In an embodiment the API would have the necessary internal computer code to obtain data from memory of the BIRD including data from the historical and environmental data log . In an embodiment the API would have the necessary computer code to obtain data from the sensors of the BIRD .

In an alternative embodiment some or all of the API function calls may be made available to third party programmers seeking to create enhancements to or supplements to the programs and applications provided with the BIRD .

Discussed above and throughout this document are ExD criteria which express in common or conventional language or via user friendly user interface elements the ways in which an item will be used or stored and or the environments to which the item will be exposed in the course of expected or ordinary use by an authorized user AU .

For a BIRD to determine if its associated item is in an extant normal state . . or a displaced anomalous state . . the BIRD must compare actual item usage as indicated by usage data .U with the ExD criteria . To make this comparison the ExD criteria must ultimately be expressed and stored within the BIRD as formal parameters which can be compared via the processor to usage data obtained directly or indirectly from sensors . The formal parameters for expected item usage are referred to as usage expectations .

The methods and algorithms employed by a BIRD to determine the usage expectations are referred to as BIRD navigation . In an embodiment BIRD navigation may determine the usage expectations based primarily on data and parameters input by an authorized user AU . In an alternative embodiment BIRD navigation may determine the usage expectations through various automated or semi automated methods. In an alternative embodiment BIRD navigation may determine the usage expectations through a combination of authorized user AU input and automated or semi automated methods.

Several exemplary methods .A .B .C .D of BIRD navigation are discussed below in conjunction with . Other methods and or algorithms associated with BIRD navigation are discussed in conjunction with other figures throughout this document.

In an embodiment a user s established or planned personal schedule daily weekly or monthly may provide a simple means to establish significant elements of the usage expectations . This is particularly true if the user has a fairly consistent and well defined schedule and if scheduled user activities can be reliably associated with specific expected locations .L .

For example a user with a substantially fixed set of work hours may import into a BIRD the schedule of hours for which the user is at work. The workplace may then be associated with a specific location so that the BIRD now has at least a preliminary set of location usage expectations .Loc . Similarly a teacher or student with a fixed class schedule may import into a BIRD the schedule of classes and then establish expected classroom locations .L again establishing a set of preliminary location usage expectations .Loc .

Such usage expectations may be preliminary in the sense that the user may still elect to fine tune the usage expectations for example by indicating allowed ranges of time that actual presence in a location may vary from the formal schedule.

In an embodiment the association between certain scheduled times and certain specific expected locations .L may be established via the BIRD user interface itself. In an alternative embodiment an association between certain scheduled times with specific expected locations .L with suitable specific geographic coordinates may be established via a configuration computer . For example scheduling or calendar software for example Microsoft Outlook and similar programs may be provided with modular software extensions which enable the user to define expected locations .L and to associate the expected locations .L with specific appointment times. Such data can then be imported into a BIRD to provide partial preliminary usage expectations .

In addition to location other elements of expected item usage may be entered via a calendar as well. For further discussion of associating an authorized user s schedule with usage expectations see the exemplary BIRD navigation method .D discussed below in conjunction with and the associated exemplary calendar discussed below in conjunction with .

It will be noted that location data is taking on increasing importance in many areas of society. As such location data in the form of GPS data geographic coordinates or dedicated location specific signals from location beacons for buildings and other significant locations .L parks shopping malls roads etc. may become routinely available via online services provided by information vendors for example Google Yahoo Microsoft Apple online news vendors and other information vendors present in the information market either at the time of filing of this document or in the future . Similarly schools and business may make available to employees faculty and students suitable location data for offices and classrooms. Such third party location data may be employed by the BIRD in conjunction with the various BIRD navigation methods discussed below.

Expected environmental condition s are the environmental conditions to which an item is expected to be subject or likely to be subject during extant normal usage . . by an authorized user AU . In an embodiment in steps and or of the exemplary method discussed above see the BIRD receives or determines usage expectations which reflect the expected environmental condition s for an associated item when the item is in extant normal use . . . In an alternative embodiment in steps and or of the exemplary method discussed above the BIRD receives or determines usage expectations which reflect environmental condition s for an associated item when the item is in displaced anomalous use.

Exemplary method .A is typically applicable when an authorized user AU can define in relatively precise specific terms the expected environments and or behaviors for an item in a given context. For example the item may be a set of car keys .K to be used during the day to leave and enter the home and to drive the car to and from work. For the keys .K a user may be able to specify in significant or complete detail the key s usage environment s for example the expected locations .L for the keys the times when the keys are likely to be in motion the temperatures sound levels or light levels to which the keys will be exposed and similar environmental factors.

In an embodiment exemplary method .A is typically user driven. That is most or all of the parameters are entered by a user of the BIRD for example via a user interface of a configuration computer used to configure the BIRD . Appropriate parameters may be entered into the configuration computer through a variety of means including but not limited to configuration dialog boxes for example elements discussed in part above and further below and similar dialog boxes.

In an alternative embodiment exemplary method .A may be partly or wholly automated for example by importing configuration data from a first BIRD . to a second BIRD . . The imported data may serve as a baseline against which the user can made suitable modifications.

Exemplary method .A may also be used in conjunction with exemplary methods .D .C and or .D discussed below.

In step .A. a context definition is received by the BIRD from the authorized user AU for the expected environmental condition s . In an embodiment a context definition establishes expected environmental conditions for a normal . or extant . item state as well as the when and where for the item and associated BIRD during which certain conditions are expected to prevail.

In an alternative embodiment a context definition establishes an anomaly type such as lost misplaced or stolen as well as the when and where for the item and associated BIRD during which certain conditions are expected to prevail.

This indicates that the usage pattern or environmental conditions to be specified are applicable on weekdays between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and that the specified information will be indicative of anomalous item behavior or environment pertaining to a lost or misplaced item. The parameters to be specified may indicate either how it is known that the item is lost .. or misplaced .. or how it is known when the item is where it is expected to be that is that the item is not lost .. or misplaced .. .

In step .A. the BIRD receives from the authorize user a sensor type. The sensor type is indicative of a type of environmental condition which reflects whether the item is in an extant normal state . . or a displaced anomalous state . . . Examples of sensor types may include any of the sensors already discuss above.

In step .A. the BIRD receives from the authorized user AU a definition for either an extant normal . . or displaced anomalous . . item environment behavior as may be detected by the type of sensor selected in step .A.. For example if the selected sensor type was a temperature sensor .T the usage condition with the item behavior definition may now be 

In step .A. the BIRD receives from the authorized user AU an indication if the item behavior definition is complete for the current sensor type. Some sensors may sometimes require only a single definition for example a single temperature range while other sensors may sometimes require multiple definitions for example multiple temperature ranges multiple locations or multiple levels of velocities etc. . It should also be noted that an extant normal . . or displaced anomalous . . behavior definition may include probability elements such as indicating that a condition is expected to be true for a certain percentage of the time.

If in step .A. the BIRD receives from the authorized user AU an indication that the item behavior definition is not complete for the current sensor type the method continues by returning to step .E where an additional expected and or anomalous item behavior may be defined for the sensor currently under consideration.

If in step .A. the BIRD receives an indication that the item behavior definition is complete for the current sensor type the method continues with step .A.. In step .A. the BIRD receives from the authorized user AU an indication of whether the item behavior definition is complete for all sensor types.

If the item behavior definition is not complete for all sensor types the method continues back at step .A. where the BIRD receives from the authorized user AU an indication of a new sensor type for the item behavior definition. The method then continues as before to step .A. where one or more extant normal . . and or displaced anomalous . . item behaviors environments are defined for the selected sensor .

If in step .A. it is determined that the item behavior definitions are complete for all sensor types the method continues with step .A.. In step .A. the BIRD receives from the authorized user AU logical combination criteria AND OR criteria ELSE IF criteria and similar among the previously established item behavior definitions.

Steps .A. through .A. are exemplary only and do not necessarily need to be completed in the order shown. In an embodiment for example these steps may be integrated into the usage of a single dialog box such as the exemplary Define Extant Normal Usage Expectation Group dialog box discussed above. The dialog box enabled the definition of context specific expectation groups .

In an alternative embodiment multiple dialog boxes may be employed by the user to provide to the BIRD the appropriate context specific expectation groups and usage expectations . For example a wizard style system provided by BIRD navigation may be employed prompting a user for appropriate entries and tuning the selections in successive dialog boxes based on user entries in earlier dialog boxes. In addition the wizard may provide suggested data values or boundaries based on previously recorded data for the item or for other items used by the authorized user AU .

At the conclusion of step .A. an exemplary complete usage pattern reflective of the authorized user s ExD criteria might now be 

In step .A. BIRD navigation converts the authorized user s usage ExD criteria received in the previous steps into an internal representation as usage expectations .

Step .A. is formally an element of BIRD song rather than BIRD navigation but is included here for completeness and clarity. In step .A. the BIRD receives from the authorized user AU reporting and signaling for the context. That is if anomalous behavior is detected for the item during field use the type s of remote reporting and local signaling to be used are defined for example send an e mail message to a cell phone and sound a local alarm buzzer at a certain volume level. In an embodiment step .A. may include defining appropriate AALs for different values or ranges of anomalous parameters.

In step .A. a determination is made if all contexts have been defined. If in step .A. all contexts have been defined the method stops .A. and the BIRDed item is now ready for field use.

If in step .A. it is determined that more contexts need to be defined the method continues with step .A. as per above. In the above example at least one and possibly more contexts may need to be defined for example 

It will be noted that certain types of sensor data may be integrated into expected environmental condition s and or usage expectations both as part of the context and as part of the normal or anomalous behavior criteria. For example part of the context could be a larger geographic area or location while the anomalous behavior criteria could include more specific location determinations. For example 

This means that the above criteria are only in use when the item and its associated BIRD are on the grounds of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda Md. When on those grounds the BIRD will signal a displaced item state . or an anomalous item state . if the specific location criteria for normal behavior fail to be met.

Detection contexts have already been discussed above in conjunction with C P and other figures. A detection context is a set of context parameters that determine when and or where some usage expectations that is expected environmental conditions should be associated with the item . In an embodiment the context parameters pertain to time and or date ranges of item usage and or to where the item is in use. In an alternative embodiment alternative or additional parameters may be employed as well. For example a first detection context for an item may apply when the item is in use on land while a second detection context for the item may apply when the item is in use in the water. In such a case detection context definitions may include the ambient surrounding medium for the item for example air or water . For specialized applications other detection context parameters may apply as well.

A detection context may also be understand as an environmental context where an item may be put to use by a person and where the item s usage is expected to be generally consistent or to display a consistent usage pattern possibly over fairly well defined duration in time. A detection context is typically defined in terms of a general usage location and or a general usage time frame or time range . For example a detection context might be a home base location .HB such as the authorized user s home or office or a time frame such as weekdays during working hours or weekdays at nights. For operational purposes specific data parameters are provided to indicate the location and or time for home. office working hours etc. 

A detection context may also be defined in the alternative or additionally by a type of user activity such as shopping dancing etc. A detection context may also be defined in the alternative or additionally by a storage of an item or mode of carrying an item such as in pocket for a wallet or keys on wrist for a watch in purse or in backpack for various items etc.

If a BIRDed item is typically expected to by used by more than one user that is the item and BIRD are typically shared by the different users then applicable detection context definitions may also include a particular authorized user AU . In field user when the BIRDed item switches hands from one user to another the current user may input their identify via password biometric identification or similar to help establish the appropriate detection context. 

Viewed broadly detection contexts are part of the usage expectations . A detection context helps specify the expected usage of an item in terms of where and or when an item is expected to be used in certain ways. A typical item may for example have three primary usage contexts two home base locations .HB such as a home and place of work and a broader encompassing daily life domain .DL . Specific usage expectations can then be define which are appropriate to each of these three contexts.

The data fields shown are exemplary only and alternative or additional fields and data entry elements may be employed for defining the context elements shown location dates times and for defining other contextual elements as well for example altitude accelerations for a car airplane etc. .

Radio buttons allow the user to determine if the data entered will indicate extant normal . . or displaced anomalous . . environmental temperatures for the item and if anomalous . the AAL level general likelihood that the readings do indicate displaced anomalous states . . . Other data entry fields as shown may be used to define the specific expected temperature ranges the item should experience in extant normal usage . . or displaced anomalous usage . . as appropriate.

The Define Normal Anomalous Environment Or Usage dialog box may also include addition GUI elements not shown for associating different ranges of AALs with different sensor readings or ranges of sensor readings.

Exemplary method .B may be used in conjunction with exemplary method .A already discussed above to confirm or augment user delineated expectations for environmental conditions and or usage expectations . Method .B may also be employed when an authorized user AU is unable to determine or is uncertain of the precise parameters for expected item environmental conditions or usage. Method .B enables the BIRD to automatically define suitable usage expectations for expected item environmental conditions based on actual item usage. Method .B may also be used in conjunction with exemplary methods .C and or .D discussed below.

Method .B depends on the authorized user AU making use of an item in typical usage over some extended period of time. This period of time may be referred to as a BIRD training period. Other equivalent terms may be employed as well such as BIRD item tracking period BIRD configuration period or BIRD observation period. The exact configuration or training period of time must be chosen by the authorized user AU based on general BIRD usage guidelines provided to the user and based on the user s own general knowledge of typical usage for a particular item .

For example if an item will typically be used in varying ways over the course of a typical work week and weekend off then typical usage expectations may be determined by keeping the item in use tethered to the BIRD and under BIRD observation for a period of several weeks. In general two or more cycles of a single full usage period would be the preferred choice to determine normal item usage.

During this extended multiple cycle normal usage period it would be important for the user to take extra precautions or simply be extra aware to make sure the item remains in extant normal . . or typical usage. For example for an item that would typically be carried about by the user at various times of day on certain days the user will want to pay added attention to ensure that the item is not lost or misplaced and certainly not stolen during the BIRD observation period or tracking period.

In step .B. a context definition is established for the expected environmental condition s . A context definition establishes a when and or a where for the item and associated BIRD during which certain environmental conditions are expected to prevail. The context definition may also establish an anomaly type.

This indicates that the usage pattern or environmental conditions to be identified are applicable on over the course of a single week for example Sunday through Saturday and that the specified information will be indicative of extant usage . the item is not a lost misplaced stolen misappropriated or wandering . The parameters to be identified by the BIRD will be indicative of extant normal usage . . of the item . The context definition may be established for example through the exemplary Define Detection Context dialog box already discussed above in conjunction with .

 iii allowed to continuously monitor and record the environmental conditions and usage to which the item is subject.

Substantively the BIRD s configuration or monitoring mode may differ little from routine item monitoring for field use of the item in that appropriate environmental sensors are active either way. In an embodiment however the BIRD is configured to continuously monitoring throughout the training period even if in normal usage the authorized user AU might at times shut down the BIRD to conserve battery power for example . In such an embodiment during the training period it is therefore also important that the BIRD be kept continuously charged or if in continual on the go usage that the battery be swapped if and when needed to maintain continual or nearly continual power. In an alternative embodiment the BIRD may be shut down at points even during the training period the BIRD may include the shut down times and locations .L as part of its determination of extant normal . . environment or usage.

Step .B. occurs at the conclusion of the training period or training period. In step .B. the BIRD or an associated configuration computer automatically defines extant normal sensor responses for extant normal item usage expectations and also either implicitly or explicitly thereby defines displaced anomalous sensor responses for displaced anomalous states . . . In step .B. the BIRD or configuration computer analyzes the data collected during the preceding training period. In an embodiment determinations made by the BIRD or configuration computer may include for example and without limitation 

The patterns of levels and ranges so determined may also be expressed or determined in terms of probabilities or percentages. For example the BIRD or configuration computer may determine that there is a 90 likelihood the item will be found within a certain building or traveling along a certain road within a certain time frame on certain days.

The output or result of step .B. are one or more usage expectations which have been determined to be indicative of extant normal usage . . of the item . See discussed further below for addition information on step .B..

In step .B. the normal sensor responses for extant normal item usage . . determined in step .B. are presented to the user for review and editing. This may take any of several forms including presenting real time and historical sensor data presenting processed sensor data .U including various summaries of item usage presenting sensor data in various graphical forms presenting summaries of sensor data as encapsulated into usage expectations in algebraic and logical formats and or presentations of the usage expectations in natural language formats for user editing.

In step .B. the BIRD or configuration computer receives user edits of the sensor data to eliminate outlier values values the user would expect to rarely see which only showed up by accident or unlikely circumstance during monitoring or the user may edit conditional statements for usage expectations . Other forms of user editing of the usage expectations may be employed as well.

Steps .B. through .B. may be iterative .B. with analysis by the BIRD or configuration computer being repeated in light of user edits.

In steps .B. and .B. reporting and signaling are respectively defined for the usage context s . That is if displaced anomalous . . behavior is detected for the item the type s of remote reporting and local reporting to be used are defined for example send an e mail message to a cell phone and sound a local alarm buzzer at a certain volume level. These steps may be formally part of BIRD song but are included here for completeness and clarity. 

In an embodiment steps .B. .B. and .B. may be combined in whole or in part so as to include defining appropriate AALs for different values or ranges of displaced anomalous states . . .

In step .B. the authorized user AU makes a determination whether or not all contexts have been defined. If in step .B. all contexts have been defined the method concludes at step .B..

If in step .B. it is determined that more contexts need to be defined the method continues with step .B. as per above.

In an alternative embodiment and referring back to step .B. usage expectations may additionally or in the alternative be automatically defined in terms of more abstract mathematical representations or patterns. For example item velocity and acceleration light exposure sound exposure pressure patterns or even location data may be represented as waveforms. The waves may be further deconstructed via such pattern analysis tools as Fourier analysis or fast Fourier analysis or wavelet analysis to determine typical or baseline expected wave coefficients.

Once these baseline coefficients are determined and stored as usage expectations future data collected by the BIRD during field use may be gathered in step of method see subject to similar analysis that is Fourier analysis wavelet analysis or similar . The analyzed data in field use may then be compared to the baseline data in step of method to make a determination of normal or anomalous behavior step of method .

Other data analysis modes may be employed as well. For example during the training period the recorded sensor data may be used to program a neural network model or other stochastic modeling system. The BIRD may then employ the neural network model or other stochastic modeling system to predict future expected behavior of the item associated with the BIRD . If future behavior of the item does not match the predicted behavior the BIRD may signal the possibility of anomalous behavior steps and of method .

In an alternative embodiment and referring back to steps .B. and .B. presentation of extant normal item sensor data to a user and editing by the user may entail direct presentation of sensor derived waveforms or waveform coefficients. In the alternative and possibly in a more user friendly mode presentation and editing may entail appraising a user of possible outlier data values and allowing the user the option of suppressing such values. Presentation and editing .B. .B. may also entail enabling a user to edit parameters associated with the use or interpretation of wave data or similar data. For example the authorized user AU may be able to edit parameters pertaining to how closely or loosely future sensor measurements should be expected to be similar to the configuration period measurements. Other forms of sensor data review and editing may be envisioned as well.

In an embodiment steps .B. .B. and .B. may be combined in whole or in part so as to include defining appropriate AALs in terms of different amounts or degrees of variation from expected sensor waveforms. For example future waveform measures which are by some suitable waveform variation metric within 10 of previously measured waveforms may be considered non anomalous waveforms showing between 10 and 20 variation from previously measured waveforms may be considered to have a low probability of anomaly indication waveforms showing between 20 and 40 variation from previously measured waveforms may be considered to have a medium probability of anomaly indication etc.

As noted above analysis .B. of sensor data acquired by the BIRD during the training period and used to arrive at usage expectations may occur on either the BIRD or a configuration computer . If the analysis is done on the configuration computer it will be understood that sensor data acquired by the BIRD is first downloaded to the configuration computer the computer performs the analysis and data presentation steps .B. .B. and .B. and the finalized usage expectations are then uploaded from the configuration computer back to the BIRD .

In step .B. of exemplary method .B discussed above the BIRD or an associated configuration computer automatically determines expected environmental condition s and or usage expectations for an associated item based on BIRD sensor data obtained during a BIRD training period.

The method begins with step .B. . In step .B. a determination is made as to the total time frame or time period of the BIRD configuration process. This time frame should be at least the duration of a primary time cycle unit for usage of the BIRD and its associated item but may be two or three such cycles or longer.

In step .B. a determination is made as to the primary time cycle unit within the overall configuration process time frame. In an embodiment a primary time cycle is a time frame in which the authorized user s overall pattern of usage repeats itself. In an embodiment a primary time cycle is the most extended or longest time frame within the overall training period in which the authorized user s overall pattern of usage repeats itself.

For example for many items in typical usage a typical primary time cycle for usage might be one week. A person s keys .K purse .P or wallet .W are carried about and used during the course of a typical work week with certain expected usage on workdays such as Monday through Friday and different expected usage on days off such as Saturdays and Sundays . Assuming the authorized user AU maintains fairly steady work and life habits usage expectations for items can be expected to be more or less similar from one week to the next.

Of course for different items used in other contexts or for persons with less conventional work time off life cycles other time patterns might apply. For example for some item used exclusively in a work setting as opposed to work and home a typical primary time cycle might be a single day or some period of several days other than Sunday through Saturday or even a period of several hours depending on the specific work context.

If the appropriate primary time cycle for an item is one week for example Sunday through Saturday then a desirable total time frame for BIRD configuration might be two weeks or possibly three or four weeks.

In an embodiment the determination of the total configuration time frame and the primary time cycle may be made at least in part by the user with one or the other or both being provided to the BIRD or to the configuration computer .

For example in step .B. the BIRD or configuration computer may receive from the authorized user AU that the total time period to be devoted to BIRD configuration is one month. After the data has been gathered for a month by using the BIRD and associated item in the field the BIRD may analyze the sensor data and determine that usage of the item typically repeats from week to week. In this case the BIRD has determined in step .B. that the primary cycle time for the BIRD is one week.

In an alternative embodiment step .B. may precede step .B. . In this event step .B. may actually come at the beginning of the entire BIRD configuration process .B. Meth . The user specifies in advance that the primary cycle time is for example one week. The BIRD or configuration computer then recommends a total configuration time frame which is a multiple of one week for example two three or four weeks . The user then selects the actual configuration time and data collection proceeds.

 Note that while steps .B. and .B. are considered part of step .B. in practice they may proceed or overlap with steps .B. and or .B.. 

Following data collection and following steps .B. and .B. the method proceeds with step .B. . In step .B. the method determines appropriate time subunits for further data analysis. Multiple time sub units may be determined. For example if the total time frame for BIRD configuration data collection is several weeks and the primary time cycle for the BIRD and associated item is one week then a primary time subunit may be determined to be one day in length a secondary time subunit may be determined to be one hour in length a tertiary time subunit may be determined to be some fraction of an hour such as a quarter hour or five minute intervals etc. .

Appropriate but different time subunit intervals may be determined based on different considerations and algorithms. In general however a time subunit interval is 

 i an interval which is long enough to reflect some sustained usage of an item by a authorized user AU and or sustained impact of an environment on the BIRDed item or

 ii an interval which is long enough to reflect some sustained pattern s of usage of the item by the authorized user AU and or a sustained pattern of environmental impact and therefore is

 iii long enough that failure to reflect those pattern s may indicate displaced anomalous usage . . .

For many common items a time period of for example a few seconds would likely be too short for a time subunit though there may be some exceptions for some items and some types of usage which is highly time specific. For example in some corporate industrial government or military application where it is expected that a particular key must be inserted in some lock at precisely a specific time every day a time subunit on the order of seconds may be appropriate. Most people however in common usage do not start their car in the morning at exactly precisely 06 00 00 hours. So for example a time interval indicative of when a car should normally be started and so when the keys should be out and be in motion to start the car might specify a time range on the order of ten minutes or multiples of ten minutes indicating the car should be started somewhere within that time interval .

Upper limits to time usage subunits may be established as well. Time usage subunits may also be established based on known conventions for human behavior and may therefore have specific time boundaries. For example usage subunits may be established for morning for example 06 00 00 hours to 12 00 00 hours for afternoon for breakfast time for lunchtime for dinner time etc. In some cases time usage subunits may partly overlap as well.

In an embodiment time subunits are predefined. In an alternative embodiment time subunits are defined by BIRD navigation based on an analysis of the sensor data . For example an automated analysis of the sensor data may determine an average length of time in which certain sensor data is sustained. For a particular example an automated analysis of the sensor data may determine that on average usage motion of an item is sustained for typically five minutes when the item is in motion at all with a typical variation of two minutes either way. Based on such data a time subunit may be established of for example three minutes five minutes seven minutes and or ten minutes. Fractions of average usage time may also be employed in the above example if an average the motion of an item is sustained for five minutes at a time a time subunit of one minute may be established as a basis for further analysis and processing.

Other criteria may be employed as well to determine time subunits for example based on variations from baseline sensor data. Such variations may be referred to as periods of active sensor readings. For example for motion or acceleration sensor readings baseline data may be considered to be zero values during periods when an item is not in motion and or not accelerated and non zero values may be considered active sensor readings. For light readings baseline values may be darkness. Other appropriate baseline criteria may be developed for other types of sensor readings.

Criteria for delimiting or identifying time subunits may include for example and without limitation average time intervals for active and or baseline sensor readings as per above time intervals between active and or baseline sensor readings minimum length of active and or baseline sensor readings and maximum length of active and or baseline sensor readings. Outlier values may or may not be dismissed according to optional filter criteria.

Specialized time intervals may also be defined around cultural and social calendars such as holidays vacation periods seasons of the year and so on.

In step .B. the BIRD or configuration computer may determine location units and or subunits primary secondary tertiary etc. . Location units and subunits identify definable areas or regions where the BIRD and its associated item are used for significant or substantial lengths of time. Location units and subunits may be defined in terms of geographic coordinates such as GPS coordinates and boundaries or a central geographic point and radial distance from that point building identifiers room names within buildings road and street names and similar.

In an embodiment step .B. may identify one or more appropriate boundaries for daily life locations .DL home base locations .HB and zones .Z . In an embodiment daily life locations .DL may be identified by determining the outer perimeter for all item usage during the training period. In an alternative embodiment daily life locations .DL may be identified by first determining an outer perimeter for all item usage and then extending the perimeter according to conventional public location boundaries such as cities boundaries or county boundaries . Similarly in an embodiment daily life locations .HB may be identified by the boundaries of actual locations .L where the item is regularly used or stored or in alternative embodiment by identifying the location boundaries of regular item use storage and then extending such boundaries to conventional public location boundaries such as home or office property lines . Similarly considerations may apply to identifying zones .Z .

As with time cycle units and subunits location units and subunits may be identified in whole or in part by data provided by a user of the BIRD in whole or in part by an analysis of the sensor data recorded during the BIRD training period or by a combination of user provided data and analysis by the BIRD or configuration computer . Outlier values such as a location visited only once during the BIRD training period may or may not be dismissed according to optional filter criteria or user editing.

In step .B. the BIRD or configuration computer may determine units and or subunits primary secondary tertiary etc. for other types of environmental contexts in addition to time and space. Time and space that is location are the two most common environmental contexts in which human behavior and therefore item usage may be examined for patterns. Put another way An item is used or not used by a person an item is put into motion or not put into motion an item is exposed to light sound or not exposed to light sound etc. either at certain times or in certain locations .L . It is therefore in the context of time and or location that a BIRD would typically seek out recognizable usage expectations. However for specialized applications and items other domains or contexts may apply as well.

For example consider an item specifically meant to be used and mainly intended for use on board an airplane. Such an item may have one broad set of behavior patterns and associated sensor readings or typically show usage at all while at high altitudes associated with flight the same item may have a different broad set of behavior patterns and perhaps show little or no usage while at low altitudes. For such an item time and or location may be a less relevant context for distinguishing usage expectations based on sensor readings while altitude may be a more appropriate context.

Therefore in step .B. the BIRD or configuration computer may use the sensor data recorded during the BIRD training period to determine if additional contexts other than time or location should be defined for the BIRD and the associated item . Other imaginable contexts may include altitude temperature light or darkness radiation levels and others. If so appropriate boundaries for example low altitude vs. high altitude as determined by GPS readings air pressure sensor readings or acceleration or velocity sensor readings may be determined as well.

For the remainder of the discussion of this method .B. Meth it will be assumed that the broad environmental contexts for data analysis are time and or space that is location category . However it will be understood that similar analysis may be conducted against other environmental contexts as well.

Analysis of item behavior as displaced anomalous . . or extant normal . . may be based on readings from more than one sensor. In an embodiment however and for purposes of defining extant normal . . behavior analysis may initially proceed based on data from one sensor at a time. In step .B. a sensor is selected for example one of the motion sensor .M location sensor .L light sensor .C audio sensor A etc. . Data values previously recorded for the selected sensor spanning the BIRD training period are retrieved from the historical environmental data log via the data storage and management module .

In step .B. possible outlier data values are identified. Outlier values may be determined based on a number of criteria including for example and without limitation the frequency or rarity of similar values and the number of standard deviations of variance from a mean or normal value for the data. A determination as to whether to keep or ignore outlier values in relation to further data processing below may be made based on a number of parameters and criteria.

The remaining data processing analysis discussion below pertains to sensor data values which have been retained for analysis after step .B. outlier evaluation .

In step .B. the BIRD and or the configuration computer identifies the degree of randomness of the sensor data . Randomness or non randomness can itself be used as a criteria to distinguish displaced anomalous . . from extant normal . . item behavior.

In step .B. the BIRD and or the configuration computer identifies data sensor consistencies across time units and subunits and or across location units and subunits. The identification process may include comparing sensor data across comparable context units or context subunits to identify consistent sensor readings.

For example comparable hours of each day may be analyzed to identify consistent sensor readings for a given hour. As a specific example it may be determined based on analysis of motion data that a user s keys .K or purse .P are generally in motion between 08 00 hours and 09 00 hours. More fine grained analysis may reveal further details for example that the keys .K are usually in motion for example during at least 90 of the time slices analyzed between 08 45 hours and 09 00 hours the amount of motion a range of velocities and or accelerations may be determined as well.

Data consistencies which span subunits may be identified as well. For example if the smallest subunits as established in steps .B. .B. and .B. are five minute intervals it may be determined that the keys .K are in motion on at least 90 of the days from 08 40 hours to 08 45 hours. Data consistencies may be determined across locations .L as well for example that on all days the keys .K are in motion at least 30 of the time when the keys .K are located in Office Building .

In step .B. the BIRD or configuration computer analyzes the sensor data to determine data limits and boundaries within either or both of time units and subunits and or location units and subunits. For example it may be determined that the item associated with the BIRD is normally only exposed to temperatures between a specific lower temperature limit and specific upper temperature limit.

In step .B. the BIRD or configuration computer analyzes the sensor data to determine statistical patterns within time units and subunits and or within location units and subunits. For example it may be determined that during certain time slices for example during certain hours of the day the keys .K are in motion at least 20 of the hour but never more than 40 of the hour.

Other values and patterns may be detected as well during any of steps .B. .B. and or .B. . For example determinations may be made as to sensor data trends sensor data values substantially increasing or substantially decreasing during a time period or going from one location to another average value calculations for sensor data determinations of suitable boundary values for boundary crossing detections or counts and other pattern calculations for sensor data . In general the values and patterns identified may correspond to any of those identified in method of which is associated with field use of the BIRD and in particular with values and patterns . . . . . . . . . . associated with step of method .

In step .B. the BIRD or configuration computer translates the data randomness data consistencies data limits and boundaries and data patterns detected in steps .B. into usage expectations . In an embodiment the translation process may entail adding specified degrees or percentages of fuzziness that is allowance for error in the measurements made during the BIRD training period into the definitions of the usage expectations . Once defined and stored the usage expectations may be used by the BIRD to distinguish extant normal . . from displaced anomalous . . item behavior during steps and of method .

In step .B. item velocity acceleration light exposure sound exposure pressure patterns location data and other sensor data may be represented as waveforms. The waves may be further deconstructed via such pattern analysis tools as Fourier analysis or fast Fourier analysis or wavelet analysis to determine typical or baseline expected wave coefficients. The coefficients may be further analyzed to detect various patterns and consistencies not previously identified.

In step .B. the sensor data may be analyzed with a view towards predictive analysis. For example a neural network model of the data may be created or updated to predict future item sensor readings based on past sensor readings.

In step .B. a determination if made as to whether data has been analyzed for all sensors employed by the BIRD during the BIRD training period. If not the method proceeds back to step .B. where a different previously unanalyzed sensor is selected. For the newly selected sensor the method again proceeds through steps .B. through .B. .

If in step .B. it is determined that data from all sensors has been analyzed the method proceeds to step .B. . In step .B. the BIRD or configuration computer analyzes and compares data from multiple sensors to determine additional usage expectations . The analysis may yield indications of pattern correlations or anticorrelations between sensors. See for example discussion associated with below. Additional usage expectations may be generated based on this analysis.

In step .B. the BIRD or configuration computer may prioritize data from different sensors to determine which sensor or sensors are most likely to yield sensor data which is indicative of displaced anomalous . . or extant normal . . item behavior.

In an embodiment exemplary method .C may be used by itself. In an alternative embodiment exemplary method .C may also be used in conjunction with methods .A and .B already discussed above see as well as method .D discussed below see to confirm or augment user delineated usage expectations or automatically generated usage expectations .

In an embodiment method .C may be employed when an authorized user AU is able to characterize in general terms how an item might be used but has difficulty determining specific numeric boundaries for such parameters as geographic locations .L accelerations velocities light exposure levels sound exposure levels etc. Method .C enables the BIRD to work with the user to determine appropriate boundary parameter values for data obtained from various sensors .

Method .C depends on the authorized user AU making use of the BIRD and an associated item during a training period in specific user activity modes. A user activity mode is any kind of specific user activity that is fairly consistent in terms of motion and possibly other environmental factors such as sound levels light levels etc. Exemplary user activity modes may include for example and without limitation standing still walking running driving general driving on local roads driving on the highway walking indoors walking outdoors walking in a specific work environment running indoors running outdoors various athletic activities skiing tennis horseback riding miscellaneous team sports etc. .

In an embodiment the steps of the method .C assume that a number of user activity modes have already been defined that is such modes have been named but are void of sensor data either predefined by a product manufacturer and or defined by the authorized user AU . In an alternative embodiment a pre defined user activity mode may include default sensor data values for example typical upper and lower bounds for human walking speeds which may be modified by the authorized user AU through testing in the field with the BIRD .

Selection of User Activity Mode The method beings with step .C.. In step .C. the BIRD receives from the authorized user AU a selection of a named but undefined user activity mode to be populated with appropriated sensor data .P or the BIRD receives from the authorized user AU a selection of a previously defined user activity mode which is to be modified. For example the user may select walking while carrying the item or select running while carrying the item or other such modes. See element of dialog box in below. 

In step .C. the authorized user AU initiates a user activity mode training session. This session is a period of time when the user will carry the item about with them along with its associated BIRD . The BIRD is set to make sensor readings during this training session and to associate the sensor data so obtained with the user activity mode selected in step .C. I. The period of time may vary as appropriate and may be as little as a few minutes or as long as several hours.

In step .C. the BIRD analyzes the sensor data obtained during the training session and determines appropriate parameters reflective of the user activity. The BIRD may determine for example and without limitation 

More generally during such a user activity mode training session the BIRD may obtain the sensor data necessary to identify various iteMetrics . In particular the BIRD may obtain the sensor data necessary to characterize morphIteMetrics such as user gain characteristics user arm and hand movement characteristics user head movement characteristics user voice print and even physiological signatures such as pulse and respiration parameters.

The analyzed parameters are stored and associated with the user activity mode. A determination may also be made as to associated sensor wave patterns for the item in the user activity mode. Such wave patterns may later be used as a basis to distinguish extant normal . . vs. displaced anomalous . . item activity as already discussed above.

In step .C. the BIRD enables the user to determine whether or not all user activity modes have been defined. If not the method returns to step .C. to select another user activity mode for example a running activity if all walking activities have been defined and continues with data collection in step .C.. If in step .C. it is determined by the user that all user activity modes have been defined the method continues with step .C..

In step .C. the BIRD receives from the user a context definition. As previously discussed a context definition establishes a when and or where for the item and associated BIRD during which certain conditions are expected to prevail. The context definition may also establish an anomaly type.

In an embodiment in step .C. the BIRD receives from the authorized user AU an expected item usage for the context. In this embodiment a expected item usage is an indication of how the user thinks the item is expected to be used in the given context and is defined here in terms of one or more user activity modes. For example for a typical item used in an office setting between 09 00 and 17 00 hours on weekdays the applicable expected item usage might be 

In each of the four examples immediately above the elements which are underlined and in bold face correspond to a user activity mode for which sensor data has been recorded and analyzed during a user activity mode training session.

In an alternative embodiment in step .C. the BIRD determines the expected item usage for the context and associates various user activity modes with the context using methods the same or similar to exemplary method .B already discussed above see .

In step .C. the BIRD combines the context definition s from step .C. the user item usage from step .C. and sensor data .P for the various user activity modes from step .C. to determine expected extant normal . . and or displaced anomalous . . item sensor results for the context. These are integrated into usage expectations .

In step .C. the user defines reporting and or signaling for the BIRD for displaced anomalous and or extant normal sensor responses for each item context.

In step .C. a determination is made if all item contexts have been defined. If yes the method concludes at step .C.. If in step .C. a determination is made that not all contexts have been defined the method returns to step .C. and the selection of another item context.

A drop down Activity list box enables the user to select an activity mode to be defined for example Item On User Indoors In Pocket Purse User At Rest. 

Sensor check boxes enable the user to select which BIRD sensors will record data that the user believes to be applicable for characterizing the user activity mode.

Training session control buttons enable the user to start recording sensor data pause the sensor data recording resume sensor data recording and stop sensor data recording.

A Define New . . . control button leads the user to a new dialog box not shown which enables the user to define a new Activity mode not currently available in the Activity list box .

A Context drop down list box enables the user to select a detection context to be defined or modified for example Home Office etc.

A Normal Activities list box is used to list all the user activity modes which the user believes are likely to be associated with the detection context. For example in an office setting the user may elect to associate such user activity modes as Item At Rest Indoors Out In Open Item On User Indoors In Pocket Purse User At Rest etc.

An Add User Activity selection area enables a user to associate activity modes with the detection context thereby adding those activity modes to the Normal Activities list box .

Exemplary method .D may be used for implementing step of exemplary method see possibly in conjunction with step of exemplary method . The method .D may result in the generation of one or more usage expectations based on the authorized user s ExD criteria . Further method .D may result in the generation of or support the generation of iteMetric criteria and in particular psyIteMetrics for a particular authorized user AU and item .

In an embodiment exemplary method .D may be used by itself. In an alternative embodiment exemplary method .D may also be used in conjunction with methods .A .B and .C already discussed above see to confirm or augment automatically generated usage expectations and or user delineated usage expectations generated by methods other than the calendar based method discussed here.

Exemplary method .D is typically applicable when an authorized user AU can define his or her daily schedule or expected schedule for some other definite time frame and associated item location and use in relatively precise terms and also in relatively consistent reliable and or repetitive terms. Particularly if the usage of an item or multiple items tends to be confined to localized well defined areas for significant parts of the day exemplary method .D lends itself to easily definition of location usage expectations .Loc and AWOL criteria for the item .

In an embodiment the method .D enables an authorized user AU to define his or her item usage with simple extensions of already familiar computer based calendar tools for example the calendars provided by Microsoft Outlook Google Calendar and other calendar tools and applications available for desktop computers web browsers cell phones tablet computers and related PDAs .

Therefore in an embodiment the method .D entails among other elements downloading or transferring see above from a configuration computer to the BIRD suitable calendar data. The method .D assumes that the authorized user AU has already entered the appropriate calendar data on the configuration computer . An exemplary authorized user AU calendar with suitable data entries is discussed in conjunction with below.

The calendar data or similar user defined scheduling and location data effectively formalizes the user s ExD criteria for item usage but in a user friendly process filling in a digital calendar which is familiar and readily accomplished by most contemporary computer PDA users. It will be noted however that for purposes of establishing usage expectations for a BIRD the calendar data entered by the authorized user AU may include additional data beyond that conventionally entered purely for personal scheduling purposes. BIRD navigation transforms this calendar based ExD criteria into BIRD friendly usage expectations via the steps of method .D.

The ExD criteria which may be captured by the BIRD or configuration computer via method .D and converted into usage expectations includes for example with without limitation 

In the embodiment presented in it is assumed the calendar data which may include both personal schedule data and also additional item usage data is prepared by the authorized user AU on a configuration computer . The calendar data is then downloaded to the BIRD see above . The BIRD then converts the calendar data to suitable usage expectations . In an alternative embodiment the calendar data may be entered directly into the BIRD via BIRD user interface elements . In an alternative embodiment the calendar data may be entered into the configuration computer and BIRD navigation on the configuration computer may then convert the calendar data to usage expectations . The usage expectations may then be downloaded from the configuration computer to the BIRD .

Detection Contexts and AWOL Criteria The method .D begins with step .D.. In step .D. the BIRD receives an item s detection contexts and possibly sub contexts . A sub context illustrated below in conjunction with is a more fine grained division of a detection context .

For example a detection context for a particular user may be a home base location .HB such as a college or university setting for a certain period of time during a day. The time at the college may be further divided into smaller units of time and into particular zones .Z within the school such as classrooms these smaller units of place time are the detection subcontexts . See again . Thus the calendar has places .HB .DL .Z defined via place labels already associated with specific time slots . . By downloading such a calendar BIRD navigation can identify when and where the BIRDed item is expected to be.

In step .D. the BIRD converts the received detection contexts and subcontexts into AWOL criteria. In an embodiment the default AWOL criteria are that if an item is not within a context and or subcontext .B during a time when it should be with the context subcontext then the item is AWOL .

For example suppose the calendar indicates that the item should be in room between 0900 hours and 1050 hours. The BIRD converts this into a data representation for usage expectations shown here in pseudocode form 

The data representation for usage expectations is exemplary only and other representations may be employed as well within the scope and spirit of the present system and method.

In an embodiment the calendar contains location labels for expected locations .L at which the user expects to bring the BIRDed item . The location labels may include labels for building addresses room number or room names and similar location appellations. In an embodiment the location labels take a form which is readily familiar to non technical users of a BIRD . In step .D. the BIRD maps the location labels to more formal location usage expectations .Loc . In an embodiment this entails the BIRD determining location boundaries and or location beacons in a form consistent with location data which may be obtained via the BIRD s location sensor .L during BIRDed item field use.

Location usage expectations .Loc may include GPS coordinates for the expected locations .L and or location perimeters or similar data. Data associated with location beacons may take the form of suitable radio signal data and or location data packet signatures for location data which may be broadcast at the location s in question for example as radio frequency waves infrared signals etc . See below. 

In an embodiment the BIRD may determine the location boundaries and or beacon data by downloading suitable location coordinates and or location beacon data from databases which associate the location labels with the location data. Suitable location databases may include internet based mapping services local building facility location databases maintained by various institutions and other sources. In an embodiment of the present system and method it is envisioned that over time it will become increasingly common for many public and private facilities to maintain location databases and or location beacons which may be compatible with BIRD technology. In an embodiment a BIRD or configuration computer may come pre configured with some internal location databases or the BIRD or configuration computer may be configured to download location databases for extended areas or for facilities which the user expects to visit on a regular basis such that updates by the user to is or her ExD criteria can be accommodated via previously downloaded location information.

In an embodiment the authorized user AU may specify an amount of time or a percentage of time that the BIRDed item may be outside of a detection context that is outside of a location it is generally required to be in at a given time . Such a parameter may be referred to as AWOL relaxation criteria . For example while the authorized user AU may expect to be in a classroom with the BIRDed item during certain hours the user may also expect to step out for one or more breaks. The AWOL relaxation criteria may indicate for example and without limitation a number of times the BIRDed item might be outside the normally expected location an amount of time the BIRDed item might be outside the expected location and a percentage of the time the BIRDed item might be outside the expected location.

In step .D. the BIRD receives any AWOL relaxation criteria which may be associated on the calendar with an item s detection contexts and or sub contexts .B .

In an embodiment the authorized user AU may be able to enter via the calendar and associated data entry tools for example dialog boxes other item usage parameters . For example the authorized user AU may be able to indicate via the calendar whether they expect the item will typically be on person .OnP or off person .OffP when the item is within a given detection context and or sub context .B . Similarly the authorized user AU may be able to indicate via the calendar whether it is expected that the item will be out of pocket or in pocket or in other enclosed spaces such as a carrier item .C for example a purse briefcase or backpack . Other parameters related to item usage may be reflected as well via the authorized user s calendar entries.

In step .D. the BIRD receives these additional item usage criteria which may be associated on the calendar with an item s detection contexts and or sub contexts .B .

Data for AWOL relaxation criteria and other item usage parameters as stored by the calendar associated software may not be in a form which is directly consistent with representations used internally by the BIRD for usage expectations . In step .D. the BIRD performs any necessary data format conversions or data structure conversions which are required to adapt calendar based item usage parameters that is ExD criteria into a format structure suitable for internal BIRD storage as usage expectations .

In steps .D. and .D. reporting and signaling are respectively defined for any displaced anomalous item states . . which may be detected in an item context and or sub context .B . In an embodiment these steps may formally be considered elements of BIRD song rather than BIRD navigation . They are discussed here for convenience.

In an embodiment such reporting and signaling may already have been defined by the user via the calendar and its associated software and user interface elements. In this case steps .D. and .D. may entail downloading the user defined reporting from the calendar and making suitable data format structure adaptations to store the reporting and signaling requirements in the BIRD .

In an alternative embodiment reporting and signaling may instead by defined via the BIRD or via BIRD song software residing on a configuration computer but separate from the calendar related software. In these embodiments steps .D. and .D. may entail the BIRD and or BIRD song software prompting the user to provide appropriate reporting and signaling requirements.

The use of a calendar interface in conjunction with method .D as discussed above is exemplary only and should not be construed as limiting. In alternative embodiments other user interfaces may be employed by the BIRD and or a configuration computer to collect the user defined ExD criteria employed by the method .D. In an alternative embodiment a user may directly code or author the ExD requirements using either or both of i a programming language designed to express ExD requirements in a form readily accessible to relatively non technical users for example an XML type language and or ii a programming language which may be of a more technical or compact nature than XML but which is employed internally by the BIRD for certain data or code representations.

In an alternative embodiment in addition to the calendar interface per se multiple dialog boxes or other user interface means may be employed by the authorized user AU to define various aspects of the ExD criteria . For example dialog boxes or a wizard style system may be employed prompting a user for appropriate entries for various ExD criteria such as location labels AWOL relaxation criteria and other item usage parameters .

The order of steps employed in method .D is exemplary only and should not be construed as limiting. Some of the steps may be performed in different orders or in parallel with substantially the same or similar results.

In an embodiment the method .D may be performed in conjunctions with other methods described above or other methods within the scope and spirit of the present system and method for ascertaining usage expectations . For example additional methods may be employed by the BIRD to determine elements of iteMetrics .

The calendar enables the authorized user AU to formalize and edit his or her ExD criteria via a software interface which is readily familiar to most contemporary computer users. The calendar when populated with appropriate data by the authorized user AU contains multiple elements such as 

Multiple elements of item related data are illustrated as being displayed on the calendar . However it will be understood by persons skilled in the relevant arts that in an embodiment for the authorized user AU to enter data into the calendar may required the use of additional user interface widgets such as various dialog boxes which are not illustrated in the figure. In an alternative embodiment calendar data entry may be accomplished via direct input onto the calendar itself either text boxes radio buttons check boxes and other GUI widgets not shown or via touch screen interface or via voice interface or via other means known in the art.

The calendar itself may employ any number of digital GUI formats well known in the art to represent time and date information . In many cases a digital calendar will have multiple different views to show scheduling information for years months multiple days single days etc. The calendar display may be user configurable in various ways. Shown in is an exemplary display of a single date . . While not shown in the figure the calendar may contain options which enable the authorized user AU to indicate that a schedule for a single day is generally applicable across multiple days over an extended period of time. For example a course schedule for a single day of the week may be applicable over an entire semester.

The item either when with the authorized user AU or in storage may be expected to be in various home base or daily life locations .HB .DL and possibly various zones .Z at specific times during the day. The calendar s time of day elements . in conjunction with location labels zone labels enable the authorized user AU to define time and location based detection contexts and detection subcontexts .SB . As discussed above see a detection subcontext .SB is a more fine grained division of a detection context . A detection subcontext .SB may for example be associated with either i a zone .Z within a home base location .HB or daily life .DL location and or ii a division of a block of time for example a duration of time spent at one location .HB .DL .Z into smaller blocks of time.

As already discussed above see the location labels . and or zone labels . enable an authorized user AU to define the expected item home base daily life zone locations .HB .DL .Z an aspect of the users ExD criteria in conventional language. A BIRD or configuration computer may employ suitable location databases to translate the location zone labels into internal designations of locations as GPS coordinates location beacon parameters or similar suitable for detection by the BIRD sensors and analysis by BIRD logic .

In an embodiment the user may designate AWOL relaxation criteria . In an embodiment these criteria specify an amount of time or a percentage of time that the BIRDed item may be outside of a detection context or subcontext .SB . On the exemplary calendar an exemplary format for AWOL relaxation criteria takes the form 

where i n how many times an item may be outside the detection context .SB without the item being considered displaced anomalous . . and ii m the maximum number of minutes the item may outside the detection context .SB on each n occasion without the item being considered displaced anomalous . . . The format shown is exemplary only and other formats may be employed for AWOL relaxation criteria within the scope and spirit of the present system and method.

As noted above see in an embodiment the authorized user AU may be able to enter via the calendar and associated data entry tools for example dialog boxes other item usage parameters . For example the authorized user AU may be able to indicate via the calendar whether he or she expects the item will typically be on person .OnP or off person .OffP when the item is within a given detection context and or sub context .SB . Similarly the authorized user AU may be able to indicate via the calendar whether it is expected that the item will be out of pocket or in pocket or in other enclosed spaces such as a carrier item .C for example a purse briefcase or backpack . Other parameters related to the authorized user s expected item usage may be reflected as well via the authorized user s calendar entries.

In an embodiment different entries may be made on the calendar for item usage parameters for multiple different items . In an embodiment a set of default item usage parameters . may be entered for item usage throughout a detection context while overriding item usage parameters . may be established for detection subcontexts .SB .

In an embodiment BIRD navigation is configured to map various colloquial or common language expressions of item usage expressive of the user s ExD criteria into forms suitable for use internally as usage expectations . Further the BIRD may be configured to extend the user s ExD criteria by applying suitable logical inferences about relations or interactions between the user and various items and or logical inferences about relations or interactions among the items themselves. The BIRD or configuration computer may also be configured to solicit additional information from the authorized user AU as needed.

For example if the user indicates that an item is In Backpack the BIRD navigation may determining that the item is likely to be shielded from light and further BIRD navigation may determine if the item will be on person .OnP or off person .OffP depending on whether the backpack .C which is functioning as a container item is itself on person .OnP or off person .OffP . Similarly if the authorized user AU indicates an item will be on desk then in an embodiment BIRD navigation may be configured to determine that the item is both off person .OffP exposed to light and typically motionless. If an item s expected behavior is flagged by the authorized user AU as indeterminate then in an embodiment BIRD navigation may be configured to prompt the user via dialog boxes or wizard style software for possible ranges or possibilities of item usage.

Data shown on the exemplary plot for the 24 hour period includes a line graph of ambient temperature surrounding the item ambient light intensity impinging on the item the velocity of the item named locations where the item is found and actual item usage locations .L as shown by representative GPS coordinates . The named locations may be identified by the BIRD via direct entry by the authorized user AU through associations with the GPS coordinates as previously established by a user via a dialog box not shown and or through downloads from a location database. Though not shown in the figure some location coordinates may be identified via references to location beacons or other means rather than through GPS coordinates.

Vertical slices through the plot correspond to times when the item is in specified named locations some or all of which may for example be home base locations .HB . Each vertical slice captures sensor data for that time slice.

Some named locations may be represented by abbreviations . for example Tr for travel or L1 and L2 for various other locations .L . In an embodiment a legend not shown may identify detailed information about the named locations including the location abbreviations . . In an alternative embodiment other display or GUI means may be used to provide additional information about the locations .L for example moving a cursor over a named location or location abbreviation . may bring up a display box with additional information.

In an embodiment the plot may have other features or elements for example controls which enable the authorized user AU to zoom in enlarge parts of the plot or otherwise changes the scale of the plot.

The Define Detection Context dialog box includes a plot of sensor data already discussed above in conjunction with .

A detection context is defined using the dialog box . The context name is selected using a Context Name drop down list box and possibly an associated New Context Name dialog box not shown accessed via the New Context Name button . The context is defined by one or more types of sensor readings location time sensor ranges which are selected via check boxes .

Once the sensor or sensor types are selected by the user various GUI means may be employed to indicate specific data or ranges of data which determine and define the detection context . For example in an embodiment on screen bracket pairs may be used to select or highlight ranges of data. Show in the figure are a first pair of brackets . which select the location named My Condo in the morning hours and a second pair of brackets . which select the location named My Condo in the evening hours. The brackets may be moved about on screen using a mouse or other navigation device or method touchscreen voice command and so one and a cursor not shown . Bracket pairs may be added using an Add Bracket Pair button which may also present the user with various bracket related options.

Once one or more bracket pairs have been placed on screen and used to define a location and or range of time for the detection context the detection context may be saved by the user.

The Define Item Use By Sensor Boundaries dialog box includes a plot of sensor data already discussed above in conjunction with .

In the dialog box the user selects a detection context which will be defined by using the Context drop down list box .

The user indicates which sensors of the available sensors will be employed to determine extant normal . . or displaced anomalous . . states by checking or unchecking the Use Sensors check boxes . In the example shown the Light Intensity sensor .Opt and Velocity sensor .M are selected and so these sensor readings are available on the plot to indicate preferred sensor readings or preferred sensor data ranges. Since the Temperature sensor .T is not selected the temperature data is visible but grayed out not available for use on plot . This list of sensors shown is exemplary only and other sensors may be listed as well.

The Define Usage radio buttons are employed by the user to indicate how the selected range s of sensor data are to be interpreted for example as Normal Item Use Anomalous Item Use or possibly as an intermediate Anomaly Alert Level such as Suspect Item Use. The usages shown are exemplary only and other usages may be listed as well. For example specific types of displaced anomalous . . states lost .. misplaced .. stolen .. misappropriated .. wandering .. and other anomalous usages . may be included among the radio button options.

Sensor data plot already discussed above is used to define data values or ranges of values for normal usage or for anomalous usage. Boundary Markers are employed for this purpose. Boundary Markers are GUI elements which a user may move and position on screen using for example a mouse and Boundary Position Cursors or other screen control means and methods such as touch screen .

For example the Boundary Marker . is the marker used to indicate where the light level should be 100 of the time. Since Normal usage is currently selected the user has indicated through the position of Boundary Marker . that light intensity should always be from 0 up to the level indicated by Boundary Marker .. If the light intensity exceeds this level that is considered an indication of an anomalous environment for the item . The user can select this level based on the plot of past illumination and in the present case the user has chosen to place the Boundary Marker . slightly above the peak values that were previously recorded for light intensity .

Similarly the Boundary Marker . is the marker used to indicate where the light level should be 90 of the time. Since Normal usage is currently selected the user has indicated through the position of Boundary Marker . that light intensity should be from 0 up to the level indicated by Boundary Marker . for at least 90 of the time. If the BIRD determines that the light intensity exceeds this level for more than 90 of some monitoring time window that is considered an indication of an anomalous environment for the item .

The exact length of the monitoring time window is configured elsewhere in some dialog box not shown . For example the BIRD may configured with a two hour monitoring window. In that case if the illumination level exceeds the indicated level shown by boundary marker . for more than 10 of any continuous two hour interval a normal environment no longer prevails and an anomaly is signaled.

The user can select the level indicated by marker . based on the plot of past illumination and in the present case the user has chosen to place the Boundary Marker . slightly below the peak values that were previously recorded for light intensity .

Similar considerations apply to configuring the Boundary Markers . . for the velocity of the item . Here again the user employs the velocity plot as a guide to determining the appropriate height that is the velocity limit values for normal item behavior when setting the position of the Boundary Markers . . . In the example shown the user has indicated via the markers that the peak velocity values associated with travel Tr are not appropriate values for the current context which is the Home context.

As discussed above the BIRD may employ multiple algorithms methods and criteria to characterize extant normal . . item usage and environments and to distinguish extant normal . . item usage and environments from displaced anomalous . . item usage environments. One such method of distinguishing extant normal . . from displaced anomalous . . is to identify patterns trends and correlations in sensor data .

An exemplary Item Motion Histogram summarizes item motion activity. For each hour of the day the plot indicates the percentage of time the item is not in motion at all the percentage of time the item is in motion from 1 to 50 of the hour and the percentage of time the item is in motion from 51 to 100 of the hour. The plot provides baseline values and is assumed to be based on an average of usage over an extended time such as a training period when the item was maintained deliberately in extant normal usage . . by the user. In the exemplary histogram the training period was ten days. In an embodiment a BIRD internal data structure not shown representing the plot may include a reliability rating such as a standard deviation factor for each bar of the histogram. The motion histogram constructed during the training period may be considered a part of the item s usage expectations and is stored in the BIRD in memory .

In regular field usage and as per step of exemplary method above similar motion histogram data may be constructed dynamically hour by hour over the course of a day. Such a dynamically created histogram not shown in the figure is an element of processed sensor data .P and may further be considered an element of the item s usage data .U . As per step of exemplary method the BIRD may compare the field use dynamically created histogram part of the usage data .U against the stored usage expectation histogram . If the BIRD detects over the course of a particular hour any significant variation between the two histograms this may be indicative of displaced anomalous usage . . of the item .

An Average Light Exposure Plot summarizes light exposure for the item . For each hour of the day the plot indicates the average amount of light impinging on the item . The plot provides baseline values and is assumed to be based on an average of usage over an extended time such as a training period when the item was maintained deliberately in normal usage by the user. In an embodiment a data structure representing the plot may include a reliability rating or variability data such secondary plots indicating a reasonable expected range above and below the primary data plot. The Light Exposure plot constructed during the training period may be considered a part of the item s usage expectations and is stored in the BIRD in memory .

In regular field usage and as per step of exemplary method above a similar plot may be constructed dynamically over the course of a day. Such a dynamically created Light Exposure plot not shown in the figure is an element of processed sensor data .P and may further be considered an element of the item s usage data .U . As per step of exemplary method the BIRD may compare the field use dynamically created Light Exposure plot part of the usage data .U against the stored Light Exposure plot . If the BIRD detects over the course of a some period of time any significant variation between the two plots this may be indicative of displaced anomalous usage . . of the item .

In addition the stored plot may also be used to determine trend data over a time interval for example that light exposure should generally trend upwards or downwards at certain times of day. Significant variations from these trends during field use may again be indicative of a displaced anomalous state . . of the item .

A Light Motion Correlation Plot summarizes the average correlation between item motion as shown in plot and light exposure as shown in plot for the item . For example data for the hour of 0300 0400 vertical line shows both that the item is normally not in motion and that the item is normally in darkness. The is likely indicative of an item which is not in use during evening hours and may be in storage during those hours or the room lights are simply dark at night . The data for motion and light exposure are strongly correlated.

For both the hours of 1000 1100 vertical line and 1900 2000 vertical line both the item motion and the item light exposure have roughly average widely distributed values. Yet a fine grained correlation analysis of sensor data fine grained values not illustrated in the figure recorded by the BIRD during the training period reveals that motion and light values are strongly correlated for the hour of 1000 1100 and also reveals that motion and light values are strongly anti correlated for the hour of 1900 2000 . In this case correlation analysis of the sensor data from the training period reveals distinct patterns for each respective hour. During field use variations from these correlations when detected by the BIRD during step of exemplary method may be indicative of displaced anomalous usage . . or a displaced anomalous environment for the item associated with the BIRD .

In an embodiment a BIRD has logic for anticipating preventing and or resolving possible ambiguities which may arise or could arise during BIRD training or BIRD field use. provides an exemplary illustration of two exemplary detection contexts . . and two exemplary associated usage expectations . . for which ambiguities could potentially arise.

Detection context . is defined to apply when the BIRD and its associated item are in use between noon and 3 p.m. in a location A. For simplicity of illustration a very simple usage expectation . has been defined to be in use for detection context . namely if the item is outside of location A the BIRD asserts a possibly displaced anomalous item state . . such as the item being lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen .

Detection context . is defined to apply when the BIRD and its associated item are in use between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. in a location B. Again for simplicity of illustration a simple usage expectation . has been defined to be in use for detection context B namely if the item is outside of location B the BIRD asserts a possibly displaced anomalous item state . . such as the item being lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen .

An actual item usage could occur. In actual item usage the time is 2 50 p.m. and so between noon and 3 p.m. but the BIRD and associated item are in location B. The situation is ambiguous because it is not clear if detection context 1 . is applicable or if detection context 2 . is applicable. Consequently it is not clear if usage expectation . or usage expectation . should be used to assess the normal anomalous condition of the item .

Numerous possible strategies and algorithms may be employed by a BIRD to anticipate and possibly prevent such ambiguities or to render ambiguities resolvable if and when they occur. Exemplary ambiguity resolution strategies include for example and without limitation 

In an embodiment a detection context may be defined in terms of either a location where an item is expected to be used or a time frame date date range time range on the clock when an item is expected to be used or both location and time frame. In an embodiment the BIRD may either recommend or require the following if a detection context is defined in terms of both location and time frame then the user must prioritize one over the other.

In the example shown in suppose the user has prioritized time frame over location and assume this applies to both detection context 1 . and detection context 2 . . Then in actual usage since time frame is the priority and since the BIRD and item are in use between noon and 3 p.m. detection context 1 . applies. Usage expectation . for detection context 1 . indicates that if the item is outside location A the item usage is to be flagged as possibly displaced anomalous . . . Since the item is in fact in location B out of location A the BIRD will signal or report displaced anomalous item usage . . .

It will be noted that with such a priority scheme it may still be meaningful for the user to specify a detection context in terms of both a higher priority time frame and a lower priority location. For example it may be that during a given time frame say noon to 3 p.m. the item may be in extant normal . . use in any of several expected locations .L for example location B or location C . The user may elect to specify different usage expectations for each location. Therefore the user may still define a first detection context based on expected item usage between noon and 3 p.m. if the item is in location B and also define a second detection context based on expected item usage between noon and 3 p.m. if the item is in location C. The two different detection contexts may for example be applicable on different days of the week.

In an embodiment an authorized user AU may also be able to specify that the lower priority elements of a detection context are to be understood as implicit usage expectations as well relative to higher priority elements. For example and again referring to detection context 1 . from The detection context . is defined in terms of both the time noon to 1500 hours and the location Location A . Assume the detection context time is considered higher priority than the detection context location then it may be considered inherent in the detection context definition that if the BIRDed item is outside of location A during the hours of noon to 1500 the item is AWOL . And similarly for detection context . it may be considered inherent in the detection context definition that if the item is outside of Location B between 1500 and 1800 hours the item is considered AWOL . 

It will be understood by persons skilled in the art that the details of both detection context definitions and usage expectation definitions as well as the interactions and relations of context definitions and usage expectations may be implementation dependent.

In an embodiment a BIRD may be configured to allow or may be configured to require that any adjacent detection contexts have some degree of overlap. By adjacent is meant any two detection contexts which are immediately adjacent in time and or in space. By overlap is meant that the two detection contexts be defined so that there is at least some partial commonality either to their time frames or their expected locations .L or both. The overlap of detection contexts takes into account that it is sometimes not feasible to define item usage in absolutely strict terms by either time frames or expected locations .L .

Referring again to the example of an item which is typically used in location A from 1500 to 1800 may on some specific occasion and in actual use be used from say 1505 hours to 1755 hours in location A and then be in use in location B the rest of the time. More generally the item may be in transit along with the user from A to B at times approximately surrounding 1500 hours.

In an embodiment the usage overlap may be established in the definition of the detection context . In an alternative embodiment usage overlap may be established via the usage expectations . In an alternative embodiment usage overlap may be established via a combination of the detection context definition s and the usage expectations .

Referring again to the example of consider the following revised detection context definitions along with revised usage expectations 

Because of the overlap in the time portion of the detection contexts . . the BIRD logic allows that during the time frame from 1455 to 1505 either of detection context 1 . and detection context 2 . can be applied. If the BIRD detects that between 1455 and 1505 hours the item is in either location A or location B then the item usage is considered to be normal.

Suppose however as per usage in the item is found to be at location B at 1450 hours. The BIRD logic can be programmed to recognize that the user has already made allowance for a possibly ambiguous location but only during the overlap time frame of 1455 to 1505 hours. Outside of this ten minute overlap window the BIRD logic may be designed to recognize that the overlapping time frames indicate that time is the priority factor in choosing between detection contexts. Since the time of 1450 hours is only meaningful within detection context 1 . the appropriate usage expectation is usage expectation .. Since the item is not in location A item usage is displaced anomalous . . .

During BIRD configuration by the authorized user AU and or training of the BIRD during a training period BIRD logic may be configured to analyze both detection context definitions and usage expectations . This analysis may entail determining if for example the context definitions and or usage expectations are under specified which may result in potential ambiguities in the field. If the potential for ambiguities is detected the user may be alerted that the potential for ambiguities exists and the BIRD may prompt for suitable additional criteria for the usage expectations .

Potential ambiguities in detection context definitions and or usage expectations may be resolved by the inclusion of additional usage expectations or refinements of existing expectations as required. In the example of and as already discussed above specifying a priority of either time or location is one way to resolve the potential ambiguities. Adding additional elements to the usage expectations may also resolve or minimize ambiguities.

In the example of usage expectation . could be extended as If item is outside of location A for more than five minutes usage is anomalous. Similarly usage expectation . could be extended as If item is outside of location B for more than five minutes usage is anomalous. These combined expectations now indicate that from 1200 to 1500 hours the item can be outside of location A and be in location B for up to five minutes with detection context 1 . still being applicable and not requiring or suggesting that detection context 2 . be invoked.

In real time field operation BIRD logic may arrive at ambiguities in the detection process for example being unable to determine an appropriate detection context that is being unable to determine which usage expectations to apply to the current real time environment . In such an event the BIRD may be configured to signal or report both a possibly displaced anomalous state . . and also that an ambiguity problem has been detected. The authorized user AU or other signal message recipient may then determine if the item is really in an displaced anomalous state . . or not and may also address the ambiguities in the usage expectations or detection context definitions .

The exemplary detection contexts may be applicable to a particular BIRDed item belong to an authorized user AU who regularly commutes for example between a job or jobs and a home or two. A first detection context . may be applicable for a home and job in the state of Maryland where the authorized user AU may typically spend her time during the even numbered weeks of the year. A second detection context . may be suited for the authorized user s home and job in the state of New York where she typically spends her time during odd numbered weeks of the year.

For this authorized user New York and Maryland may be considered her two overall encompassing daily life locations .DL where she spends much of her life. Because these states are so large it may make sense for the authorized user AU to associate these locations with detection contexts . A third default detection context . is also defined for those times when the authorized user AU is not in New York and also is not in Maryland but has the BIRDed item in her possession or possibly when the authorized user AU is in those states but the BIRDed item has been left behind elsewhere or is otherwise lost or stolen.

When the authorized user AU is in Maryland with her BIRDed item during an even numbered week the first detection context . applies. Assuming that her BIRDed item is otherwise subject to consistent expected environments and usage within Maryland then the item is extant . .

Similarly when the authorized user AU is in New York with her BIRDed item during an odd numbered week the second detection context . applies. Assuming that her BIRDed item is otherwise subject to consistent expected environments and usage within New York then the item is extant . .

If the BIRDed item is not in Maryland during an even numbered week or not in New York during an odd numbered week then BIRD logic may be configured with several possible responses. Just one set of exemplary responses is indicated here but persons skilled in the art will recognize that other BIRD logic choices are possible as well 

 i If the BIRDed item is in neither of the states of New York nor Maryland then the default detection context three . will apply.

 ii If the BIRDed item is in Maryland but during an odd numbered week when it should be in New York then the detection context for New York will be deemed applicable. The associated usage expectations . and or BIRD logic will likely self assess the item as diverted . .

 iii If the BIRDed item is in New York but during an even numbered week when it should be in Maryland then the detection context for Maryland will be deemed applicable. The associated usage expectations . and or BIRD logic will likely self assess the item as diverted . .

 a If the BIRDed item is in either New York or Maryland then either detection context one . or detection context two . applies but the choice is based on the week number that is the date time not on the state. This reflects that the BIRDed item is expected to be in specific states during specific weeks. Displaced anomalous states . . are assessed based on where the item is expected to be as determined by the actual date and time .T .

 b In the event that the BIRDed item is in neither of New York nor Maryland then and only then does the default detection context three . apply.

For each detection context suitable usage expectations can be assigned as appropriate providing more specific details on expected environments . For example expected locations .L within Maryland along with associated dates times are indicated in usage expectations . . Similarly expected locations .L within New York again along with associated dates times are indicated in usage expectations . .

Authorized user iteMetrics may be indicated in a separate set of usage expectations . which may be applicable across all detection contexts . Similarly a general set of usage expectations . may be defined and may be applicable to all detection contexts .

Still other sets of usage expectations for example . may also be defined or identified and may be deemed applicable only to some detection contexts and not others for example to detection contexts . and . but not . .

Discussed above are elements of an exemplary BIRD which in an embodiment is designed to be separate from an item and attached to the item by a mechanical tether or coupling .C . The mechanical link or tether .C may also have active electrical or optical properties for purposes of ascertaining link presence and integrity and possibly other purposes.

In an alternative embodiment the BIRD may be integrated in whole or in part into the structure of the item see for example above elements B F C D E so that the BIRDed item is an integrated unit. In an alternative embodiment a BIRD need not be physically separate from a passive item .Pass . Further examples of integration of BIRD elements into items which are conventionally passive are presented in conjunction with and A C discussed further below.

Typically however in embodiments discussed above the BIRD is connected to an item or is integrated into an item which has as its primary or essential functions and properties ones that are largely mechanical and or static in nature. By static is meant items with are without moving parts or even with moving parts the items are unchanged or substantially unchanged in practical use. Such items discussed above which are fundamentally mechanical static in nature typically makes little or no use of electricity. Many exemplary such items can be listed including standard non RF and non infrared house keys and car keys .K wallets .W some toys .T many recreational items .R and other items illustrated in F and other figures above.

Such an item may also be referred to as a passive item .Pass illustrated in and in other figures throughout this document .

In an embodiment elements of a BIRD may be distributed between a passive item .Pass and a structurally separate BIRD . For example sensors and or some or all processing elements etc. may be structurally integrated into a passive item .Pass while other processing elements etc. and signaling elements ports communications elements and user interface elements may be in a separate BIRD housing . Communications between the passive item .Pass and the BIRD may be maintained via radio frequency link or via wires .W see within the mechanical link or tether .C . Other distributions of elements between the passive item .Pass and the BIRD may be envisioned as well.

In some instances the introduction of BIRD processing or sensor elements in the passive item .Pass may suggest or lend itself to the introduction of feature improvements in the passive item .Pass whereby the passive item utilizes the processor memory sensors etc. for determinations not strictly related to determinations that the item .Pass is in a displaced anomalous state . . . For example a processor memory and sensors may be used in sporting goods .R to help evaluate athletic usage and performance or may be utilized inside a briefcase .B or other carrying case to determine that certain smaller items are contained within. Several exemplary such applications are discussed in conjunction with and A C below.

In additional to passive items .Pass embodiments of the present system and method may also be implemented in active Items .Act . Active items are defined generally as being a portable object device or package typically though not always meant to be carried on or moved along by a person which inherently incorporates elements associated with either of 

. . . as part of the object s normal conventional or essential operations. These inherent elements typically include an item microprocessor an item memory item timing calendar elements a bus a power supply possibly either internal or external sensors and other elements typically required for data processing functions. As will be discussed further below in an embodiment of the present system and method some of these active item elements may co function as a BIRD s processor memory clock sensors bus power elements and so on.

Typical of such active items .Act are not only the presence of these processing elements but the fact that the processing elements are often put to distinctive respective idiosyncratic usage by different respective human users of the processing elements. For example for a cell phone different users will tend to maintain a distinctive list of phone numbers called or web addresses or e mail addresses which are accessed and different users will have different usage expectations in terms of frequency and timing of when and how they use their cell phone.

In this document in the discussion above which has preceded this point the term item has typically been illustrated with respect to passive items .Pass . However persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a stand alone BIRD can be tethered to and used with active items .Act as well. As will be discussed in detail further below an active item .Act may have associated with it a separate BIRD now referred to as an active item BIRD .Act or ABIRD .Act the two of which are typically linked by an active connection .Act . The active connection .Act is typically both mechanical in nature and also electrical and or optical for purposes of data transport.

In an alternative embodiment however an active item .Act and an active item BIRD .Act may be completely integrated into one structural and functional unit.

In figures below and for the sake of technical completeness an active item .Act is often illustrated with an embedded integrated BIRD element .Act.I . In the figures the embedded BIRD element .Act.I may be illustrated as lying on top of the active item .Act or on the surface of the active item .Act . However it will be understood that in typical embodiments the embedded BIRD element .Act.I is actually distributed and integrated into the interior electronics of the active item .Act .

It will be further understood that in some embodiments the standard components of the BIRD .Act.I such as the microprocessor memory timing elements bus and other elements may be shared with the active item .Act . For example a common processor may perform both the standards functions of a cell phone .CP and also the functions associated with BIRD environmental detection and analysis. In an alternative embodiment two separate processors separate memory or other separate elements may be employed for the active item .Act and the BIRD processing.

There are some items with some electrical features such as for example a flashlight electronic keys remote controls for TVs many electrical tools electric drills electric saws etc. and similar items. Such items may in some sense still be considered passive in that they typically have either no processing memory sensing or logical capabilities or have only minimal processing capabilities for very limited purposes of mechanical control or other simple control functions.

One the one hand such items which may for convenience be referred to as electrical Items are not fundamentally oriented towards data processing in the manner associated with computers or cell phones. However the electrical features of such devices along with whatever processing abilities they have for control purposes still lend themselves to monitoring and data assessment by a BIRD . Equally important such inherent electrical capabilities and limited processing abilities may still lend themselves to appropriate definitions of usage expectations and the recording of usage data .U . For example even for a flashlight a user may be able to define detection contexts where the user expects the flashlight to be on or off. Similar suitable sensors may be able to provide data to the BIRD as to when the flashlight is on or off. As such and for purposes of this document even such electrical items may be considered to be active items .Act provided suitable sensors can provide the BIRD s processor with appropriate data to support BIRD functions and analyses.

The exemplary active items include a digital camera .Act.CM an electronic testing device such as an oscilloscope .Act.T and a medical testing device such as an EKG or ECG .Act.M . Each such active item .Act is linked to an external active item BIRD .Act.E via an active item to BIRD active link .Act . In an embodiment the active link .Act provides for mechanical connection detection of separation between the active item .Act and the external active item BIRD .Act.E and for data transfer between the active item .Act and the external active item BIRD .Act.E .

The data transfer which may be one way or two way enables the active item .Act to report to the external active item BIRD .Act.E on the electronically definable monitorable activities or uses of the active item .Act . This data can be used by the external active item BIRD .Act.E as additional means to distinguish extant normal . . from displaced anomalous . . states for the active item .Act as discussed further below see . The data transfer may also be employed by the external active item BIRD .Act.E to modify the behavior of the active item .Act particularly if the external active item BIRD .Act.E detects displaced anomalous item behavior or a displaced anomalous item environment . . .

Active item BIRDs .Act may be referred to in general as ABIRDs .Act . An external active item BIRD .Act.E may be referred to as an external ABIRD .Act.E . The combination of an active item .Act linked with an external ABIRD .Act.E via a active connection .Act may be referred to as an ABIRDed item .Act.E .

The exemplary active items shown in also include a cell phone .Act.CP labeled elsewhere in this document with reference number when used as a configuration computer see for example a remote control .Act.RC a weapon with active electronics for example a taser .Act.W a laptop computer or tablet computer .Act.LC labeled elsewhere in this document with reference number or see for example electronic keys .Act.ECK and a global positioning system .Act.GPS each with an associated respective internal active item BIRD .Act.I .

In an embodiment and as noted above it is understood that the internal active item BIRD .Act.I is actually distributed and integrated into the electronics of the active item .Act generally into the interior of the active item .Act . However some components of the internal BIRD .Act.I may be on the surface of the active item .Act . For example some sensors may be on the surface of the active item .Act .

It will be understood as well that the data communications between the functional elements of the active item .Act and the internal active item BIRD .Act.I are accomplished internally for example via a common or shared bus or via an electronic link between a first bus dedicated to the active item .Act per se and a second internal ABIRD bus .

An internal active item BIRD .Act.I may be referred to as an internal ABIRD .Act.I . The combination of an active item .Act with an integrated internal ABIRD .Act.I may be referred to as an ABIRDed item .Act.I .

It will be understood that the allocations shown in the figure of BIRDs which are internal or external to the active items .Act are exemplary and for purposes of illustration only. In an embodiment any active item .Act may be linked to an external ABIRD .Act.E via suitable ports and other connectors on the active item .Act . Similarly many active items .Act both currently known and those to be designed in the future can be specifically designed to have an internal ABIRD .Act.I .

For brevity in discussion below both an external ABIRD .Act.E and an internal ABIRD .Act.I will be referred to as an ABIRD .Act .

A BIRD and an active item BIRD ABIRD .Act are substantially the same in components and operations except that in some embodiments an ABIRD .Act has additional capabilities 

 i to receive from an active item .Act additional information about the item s internal operations internal states .Act or processing statuses .Act which possibly along with other environmental data help distinguish extant normal item states . . from displaced anomalous item states . . based on the internal item states and or

 ii to modify the active item s internal operations and or processing states .Act based on determinations of displaced anomalous item states . . .

Again and as noted above an active item .Act with an integrated internal ABIRD .Act.I will generally be referred to simply as an ABIRDed Item .Act.I . When necessary the integrated BIRD components or BIRD functionality of the active item .Act are distinguished as the ABIRD components or ABIRD functionality .Act of the active item .Act .

Shown in are elements of an active item BIRD .Act or ABIRD for short which may be either an external ABIRD .Act.E or an internal ABIRD .Act.I with some variations on configuration in each case as discussed immediately below . As noted above if the active item BIRD .Act is integrated into the active item .Act then the integrated unit may be referred to as an ABIRDed item .Act.I .

Many of the elements of the ABIRD .Act are the same as those already discussed above in conjunction with above. These include the processor the main memory .M the clock calendar timer the environmental sensors the bus battery s the communications interface ports transceivers and signaling elements the local I O interface and I O elements and secondary memory .S and removable storage unit .RSU .

If the active item BIRD .Act is an external ABIRD .Act.E then in an embodiment it has an active item port . The active item port is configured for connection and data transfer with an external active item .Act.E . In an embodiment the active item port may be a conventional USB Firewire port or other local signaling . In an alternative embodiment a unique or custom port may be employed. The port may support item link integrity detection .

If the ABIRD .Act is integrated into the item .Act many elements may have shared functionality or dual functionality providing support for both the operations conventionally associated with the active item and the operations associated with a BIRD . For example the processor and memory in a cell phone .Act.CP may support all the conventional communications and data processing activities of a conventional cell phone and may additionally support the extant normal . . versus displaced anomalous . . item determinations of the ABIRD .Act.I .

In an embodiment an internal ABIRD .Act.I may also have a Redundant Active Item Monitoring And Analysis module or RAIMA . The RAIMA elements are designed to provide redundancy in view of a variety of circumstances that can affect BIRD performance and or to provide additional support for BIRD analysis in the context of active items .Act . The RAIMA may include for example and without limitation 

In an alternative embodiment the additional processor .P may actually be the same processor as the primary processor but in a lower power mode with reduced speed and possibly with some modules within the primary processor for example advanced graphics modules some math pipelines etc. shut down.

The RAIMA may also include dedicated random access memory RAM or similar .M which again is available when the rest of the active item .Act is shut down. In an embodiment the RAM may be incorporated into the additional processor .P for example as cache memory.

Also shown in for completeness are dedicated active item elements which may be part of an ABIRDed item .Act.I with an internal ABIRD .Act . These elements are not strictly speaking part of the internal ABIRD functionality per se which is suggested by the shading and dotted line in the figure but the elements will be integrated into the physical structure and body of an internal ABIRDed item .Act.I . The exact nature of the dedicated active item elements will vary depending on the particular nature of the active item .Act .

For example in a cell phone .Act.CP the dedicated active item elements may include elements of the user interface which are not required for or utilized by ABIRD operations for example a headset jack and supporting internal electronics or advanced graphics features not needed by an ABIRD . In a GPS .Act.GPS the dedicated active item elements may include algorithms related to guiding a user to a desired location algorithms related to presenting a map to a user and specialized communications transceivers which are not utilized as elements of ABIRD communications for signaling or alerting to displaced anomalous . . item states.

In an electronic weapon such as a taser .Act.W any and all elements which are present solely for the purpose of energizing or operating the weapon as a stun device or other weapon would be considered as dedicated active item elements . In a laptop computer .Act.LC elements of a high fidelity sound system anything in excess of that required for BIRD signaling would be considered dedicated active item elements as might components associated with advanced graphics that may not be useful for BIRD signaling or GUI purposes or be in excess of what a stand alone BIRD would need. In medical test equipment .Act.M any components specifically dedicated to monitoring of the human body and which are not in dual use for say ABIRD biometrics .D or are more advanced than needed for ABIRD biometrics .D would be considered dedicated active item elements .

Some elements may be viewed or understood in a dual sense as being part of or used by the internal ABIRD .Act.I but also as being present in embodiments which are in some sense beyond conventional BIRD requirements for a stand alone BIRD or external ABIRD .Act.E . For example in an embodiment a BIRD may employ a display .D of relatively minimal size or moderate display resolution this may be because an authorized user AU may typically be expected to require limited data from the BIRD display on limited occasions and equally because a stand alone BIRD may be deliberately designed with weight and size considerations in mind.

By contrast an active item .Act such a cell phone or a tablet computer may be designed with a larger or much larger display than a stand alone BIRD or external ABIRD .Act.E . When an internal ABIRD .Act.I is integrated into the design of such an active item .Act the internal ABIRD .Act.I will typically use the active item s display for its own display .D . However the use of such a large display or high resolution display may be seen as being mandated by the requirements of the active item .Act and not by the requirements of the integrated ABIRD .Act.I per se. Similar considerations may apply to many other shared elements full size keyboard processor size speed and power memory requirements secondary memory and so on where the active item .Act may require substantially more expanded features and system demands size speed weight power consumption than would the same elements in a standalone BIRD or even a stand alone external ABIRD .Act.E .

In the dedicated active item elements are illustrated as sharing a common bus with the internal ABIRD elements. In an alternative embodiment the dedicated active item elements possibly along with other elements of the active item .Act may have their own separate bus from the ABIRD bus in this event the ABIRDed item .Act.I will have suitable hardware means to share data between the two buses and more generally to share data between the elements of the active item .Act and the internal ABIRD .Act.I .

In an embodiment dedicated active item elements may not be regarded as part of internal ABIRD operations that is such elements may not participate in any of the ABIRD sensing analysis or signaling reporting operations per se. However operational data from and pertaining to dedicated active item elements may be utilized as part of ABIRD analysis. Put another way the dedicated active item elements in addition to serving their primary functional role in the active item .Act also may be viewed as a kind of additional sensors only in this context what they sense is the choice of their usage by a human owner or operator of the active item .Act . This is discussed further below in conjunction with .

Additionally the operations and internal states .Act of dedicated active item elements may be actively modified by the internal ABIRD operations especially if displaced anomalous . . environments or activity are detected.

In some cases the active item .Act and its internal ABIRD .Act.I may share environmental sensors . For example many active items .Act now include sensors for location determination .L optical sensors .Opt a camera .C or video camera .V a motion sensor acceleration sensor .M and or possibly other sensors. That is in an embodiment and for some active items .Act some or all of the sensors used by the active item .Act may also be used by the internal ABIRD .Act.I for normal anomalous item context determinations. For example a cell phone .Act.CP or a GPS .Act.GPS may be provisioned with a location sensor .L employed by the authorized user AU to determine his or her location or to navigate to a desired location etc. The same location sensor .L may be employed by the internal BIRD elements .Act.I and processing to help determine displaced anomalous . . item environments or usage as described in detail throughout this document.

In some cases the ABIRD .Act.I may employ a dedicated sensor S which is supplemental to one of the primary sensors but which provides similar functionality.

For example consider a cell phone .Act.CP or a GPS .Act.GPS which employs standard GPS functionality and circuits to determine location. In some cases due to environmental factors the cell phone .Act.CP or GPS .Act.GPS may be shielded from access to the GPS satellite system. For example a cell phone .Act.CP or GPS .Act.GPS may lose access to GPS satellite data when inside a building or parking facility or similar. In other cases GPS data may not have been modified or updated to reflect recent modifications to road routes or other pertinent location data. The internal ABIRD .Act.I of the cell phone .Act.CP or GPS .Act.GPS may therefore incorporate a secondary location sensor .L perhaps one based on internal data streams from a building itself see discussion associated with below to supplement GPS data. A secondary location sensor .L may also include identifying actual locations .L based on an up to date imaging database of a local environment . Other secondary location determination means are discussed elsewhere in this document.

For another example a cell phone camera may function as an optical sensor .P for the internal ABIRD .Act.I . However when the cell phone .Act.CP is shut down the camera functionality may no longer be available. Therefore the ABIRDed cell phone .Act.I may incorporate a secondary light sensor .Opt possibly less sophisticated and of lower power consumption than the cell phone camera as a supplemental optical sensor .Opt . The supplemental optical sensor .Opt is provided to determine extant normal . . or displaced anomalous . . item usage relying on power from the secondary dedicated BIRD battery .E . For example the supplemental optical sensor .Opt can help determine if the cell phone .Act.CP is in the dark possibly stored away inadvertently at a time when it should be in usage and out in the light. 

In operation the usage of an ABIRDed item .Act is substantially the same or similar to that for a BIRDed item that is a BIRD with a passive item .Pass with some appropriate modifications 

With reference to method the ABIRD .Act may be configured for expected item behavior and or anomalous item behavior step via authorized user AU input. With reference to method the ABIRD .Act may be configured via a training session.

With reference to method step coupling the item .Act and ABIRD .Act.I is not applicable for an internal ABIRD .Act.I since the internal ABIRD .Act.I and active item .Act are physically integrated. Environmental monitoring routine usage of the item .Act by the user and signaling by the ABIRD .Act.I remain applicable to both an internal ABIRD .Act.I and an external ABIRD .Act.E .

In practical application an ABIRD .Act would often be configured to report to some primary reporting device for example a user s cell phone .Act.CP . However if an ABIRDed item .Act which is displaced . or otherwise anomalous . is itself the primary reporting device for example the cell phone .Act.CP then the user must have previously programmed the cell phone .Act.CP to report to an alternate reporting device for example to send an e mail which the user may access using any computer which provides access to their e mail service .

As per the active item .Act may be configured via a suitable configuration computer . However if the active item .Act has a sufficiently complex and suitable user interface for example a cell phone .Act.CP or a laptop or tablet computer .Act.LC the configuration may be done in part or in whole directly via the interface of the active item .Act .

As per the active item .Act may report anomalies to a variety of different reporting centers as well as using the local signaling .

Method shown in remains applicable. Method shown in remains substantially applicable both for active items .Act with an external ABIRD .Act.E and for active items with integrated ABIRDs .Act.I .

However for an active item .Act the details of usage expectations discussed above in conjunction with will have additional elements see below . Similarly for an active item .Act sensor data processed sensor data .P and usage data .U may all contain additional elements pertaining to the internal operations and internal states .Act of the active item .Act . Further for an active item .Act both the process of defining usage expectations see and other figures above and the BIRD logic for comparing usage data .U with usage expectations may have additional elements. See again below. Finally. BIRD song may have additional elements as well.

Along with each ABIRDed item .Act is a list of exemplary active item operations evaluations which can be evaluated to distinguish or help distinguish extant normal . . active item usage from displaced anomalous . . active item usage. In an embodiment many of these operations evaluations may reflect aspects of item usage which are strongly correlated with the authorized user s habits and preferences for utilizing the active item technology consequently the usage expectations associated with these active item operations evaluations may be viewed as an aspect of the active item s iteMetrics and in particular the psyIteMetrics .

While not specifically shown in it will be understood that the active item operations evaluations will typically have associated with them active item statuses .Act which in turn reflect internal operations features and internal active item states .Act . These statuses .Act will be based on comparisons between the active item internal operations states .Act and the applicable usage expectations .

For example an evaluation of whether an active item .Act is properly on when expected may have several associated on off statuses .Act for example On OK On Unexpected Off OK Off Unexpected which in turn reflect associated power on off states .Act . For another example an evaluation of whether a cell phone .Act.CP is being used properly may have such status values .Act as Expected Outgoing Calls Unexpected Outgoing Calls Expected Incoming Calls Unexpected Incoming Calls and so on. More generally exemplary status values may take the form of Consistent With Past Usage or Expected Usage or Inconsistent With Past Usage or Expected Usage. See for additional discussion.

In an embodiment the ABIRD .Act elements of the active item .Act may be configured to distinguish extant normal usage . . from displaced anomalous usage . . based solely an the internal statuses .Act determined from the active item s internal operations evaluations . In an alternative embodiment the ABIRD .Act may be configured to distinguish extant normal usage . . from displaced anomalous usage . . based on a combination of 

 ii sensor data pertaining to the external environment and user usage of the active item .Act such as item motion location light exposure sound exposure external temperature and similar environmental data as already discussed above.

Generic active item operations evaluations for item usage which are likely to be applicable for many different types of active items .Act include for example and without limitation 

Exemplary active item operations evaluations for item specific usage are also listed for a cell phone laptop or tablet computer GPS and an electronic weapon . The active item parameters listed are exemplary only and should not be construed as limiting in any way.

In partial analogy with methods .A .B .C and .D discussed above the expected usage of an ABIRDed item .Act can be defined or determined in a number of ways which include for example and without limitation 

In an embodiment extant normal usage . . and usage expectations in general may also be determined by taking a data snapshot of certain user selected stored operating parameters at a given time. Examples include lists of phone numbers stored on a cell phone .Act.CP files recently used or accessed on a personal computer .Act.LC web sites accessed on the item s web browser etc. The snapshot may be taken at a time indicated by the user or may be taken and updated periodically at intervals determined by the user or by default settings.

Parameters and algorithms for distinguishing extant normal . . from displaced anomalous item usage . . for an ABIRDed item .Act may also be established via supplemental usage expectations .S already discussed above in conjunction with . Three exemplary supplemental usage expectations .S are presented here in pseudocode form 

Other such supplemental usage expectations .S may be envisioned as well. The pseudocode shown is exemplary only and many other examples of suitable code may be envisioned. The pseudocode may in practice be implemented via any number of known programming languages including for example and without limitation C C Java Pearl and others. The code once translated into executable form would be run on the processor of the ABIRD .Act .

Various aspects of active item usage times and dates of usage power consumption usage of specific features and so on may also be plotted in partial analogy with plots shown in discussed above and otherwise stored as waveforms waveform coefficients and other mathematically dense or compressed representations. Usage contexts and normal . or anomalous . states may be defined with respect to the plotted data in partial analogy with plots shown in discussed above or waveform data. Correlations among active item usage factors or between active item usage and other environmental factors may also be identified and determined in partial analogy with discussed above.

If an ABIRD .Act determines that its associated active item .Act may be displaced . lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen or otherwise anomalous . the ABIRD .ACT may be programmed to modify or limit internal operations features or states .Act of the active item .Act . Some of these modifications may be related to device security. For example if an ABIRD .Act determines that its associated cell phone .CP is displaced . the ABIRD .Act may shut down all calling and e mail features of the phone or in a more limited response the ABIRD .Act may permit calls and e mails to be made or permit calls and e mails but only to a limited set of pre designated destinations but may prevent access to or prevent editing of the phone s directory of called numbers and other such stored data.

Similarly if an ABIRD .Act determines that a GPS .GPS has been displaced . the ABIRD .Act may prevent access to the list of previously visited locations or travel routes for the GPS .GPS . This helps ensure that only an authorized user AU may access vital data stored on these active devices.

In such cases an authorized user AU may restore access by entering a suitable pass code biometric identification or apply a similar security or identification feature which signals the active item .Act that control is being restored by an appropriate party.

An item team is a group of two or more items with each item having associated sensing processing technology typically a BIRD for self assessment of extant normal . . versus displaced anomalous usage . . where 

 i the BIRDed items will typically be carried about or transported about in close proximity to each other over a sustained period in time and

 ii the BIRDed items are configured not only for self monitoring but also for mutual monitoring data exchanged and or item support.

In an embodiment the items in the item team are mobile as a group and are carried on the person and or put in use in close proximity to the person who is the authorized owner user of the item team . In the latter embodiment the items in the item team may move substantially in tandem for all or much of the time.

In an embodiment an item team may include some alternatively monitored altMon Items .altM . AltMon items .altM are items which lack overall BIRD technology but which have passive or semi passive elements for example RFID tags or some sensors which enable other BIRDed items in the item team to maintain some monitoring on the altMon items .altM . See below. Where appropriate an altMon item .altM may include RFID tagged items .RFID . For convenience and simplicity most of the discussion of item teams in treats the teams as consisting of BIRDed items it being understood that altMon items .altM and in particular RFID tagged items .RFID may be included as well.

An item team may consist of BIRDed items which are typically to be carried about by a single person. Alternatively an item team or an extended item team may consist of items which are to be carried about by a group of people where the people in the group typically engage in shared activities work recreation etc. in relatively close physical proximity to each other. For example members of a police unit or a team of firemen may carry multiple BIRDed items all of which may be part of an extended item team.

In the discussion below reference it made to item team BIRDs .IT . An item team BIRD .IT is technology the same or substantially similar to BIRDs already discussed at length above in this document and discussed further below but which has been configured or enabled with any additional functionality software and or hardware necessary to support item team operations. An item team member .IT is a BIRDed item that is part of an item team that is an item team member .IT is the combination of an item .IT which is part of an item team along with the item s associated item team BIRD .IT .

The item team . includes a purse .IT.P with an associated or embedded item team BIRD .IT.P a set of keys .IT.K with an associated item team BIRD .IT.K a wallet .IT.W with an associated or embedded item team BIRD .IT.W and a cell phone .Act.CP with internal ABIRD components and functionality .IT.CP .

The items .IT in the item team are generally not connected or coupled to each other by any mechanical connection wire or tether. However each BIRD .IT in the item team maintains communications with all other BIRDs .IT in the item team through RF data transmission links or other wireless links . In an embodiment the RF links are short range low power links using packet based communications for example using the unlicensed bands and such technologies as WiFi or Bluetooth.

In an alternative embodiment other forms of communications links may be employed other than RF such as infrared or other optical links. However RF links are generally preferred for their ability to penetrate most common material objects and in particular their ability to penetrate clothing at short ranges.

In an embodiment the item team . is configured via a configuration computer . Each respective BIRD .IT in the item team . is connected to the configuration computer via a respective data link .A .B .C .D . In an embodiment because critical security data is communicated via the data links the data links are highly secure. For example the data links may be wired links rather than wireless links which are inherently more subject to third party monitoring as compared to wired links . The data links may further be direct local wired links for example local connections in a home base .HB home setting or office setting such as a USB cable connections or Ethernet connections possibly with no intervening network cloud or network elements.

In an alternative embodiment if a wireless connection or network based connection is employed for the data links for example for user convenience or for various operational necessities significant measures are preferred to ensure data security such as encryption and password protections.

The data links are used to upload configuration and setup data from the configuration PC to the BIRDs .IT .

In an embodiment each BIRD .IT for each of the items .IT in the item team . typically receives the configuration and setup data for all the members .IT of the item team . .

Put another way Each BIRD .IT receives the configuration and setup data for itself and also for all the other members of the item team . . In an embodiment this enables each member .IT of the item team . to both identify and assess the status state of all other members of the item team with respect to the requirements for each member .IT of the item team.

By contrast the transient semi transient validation strings are uniquely generated by the configuration computer . The transient validation strings are intended to allow the members .IT of the item team . to reliably and uniquely verify each other s identities when the item . is in the field that is in use beyond the authorized user s home base typically where the configuration PC is located . The transient validation strings are configured to enable the members .IT of the item team . to mutually verify identities in a manner which cannot be readily spoofed or hacked by unauthorized users UU . More details about the use of the transient semi transient validation strings are presented immediately below.

In an embodiment item evaluation criteria and anomaly responses are typically configured or programmed at least in part by an authorized item team user. The configuration or programming are substantially analogous to those discussed above for individual items with associated BIRDs with suitable modifications and extensions for items .IT viewed as members of an item team .

By contrast and as discussed further below the validation strings are extended strings of random bytes or random numbers and would typically be generated entirely automatically via software on the configuration computer .

In alternative embodiment some or all of the BIRDs .IT in the item team . may generate their own validation strings but would still exchange these strings with other members of the item team . via the configuration computer and or secure data links .

Data communications occurs between the BIRD .IT.K associated with the keys .IT.K and the other members of the item team . . The other members of the item team . apart from the keys constitute a first subset ..S of the item team . . The first subset includes the purse .IT.P the wallet .IT.W and the cell phone .Act.CP and each of their respective associated BIRDs .IT .

Data communications occur in two directions .R .T which in an embodiment are in general substantially simultaneous 

For brevity reference is made below to data transmitted by the keys .IT.K or data received by the keys .IT.K it being understood that the data is actually transmitted by or received by the BIRD .IT.K associated with the keys .IT.K . In an embodiment reception .R and transmission .T are substantially concurrent activities and further that reception does not necessarily trigger or induce transmission though in some instances it may and similarly transmission does not necessarily trigger or induce listening for packets though in some cases it may.

In an embodiment the data .K transmitted by the keys .IT.K is a sequential time series of data records . In an embodiment the records are transmitted at intervals short enough that if a displaced anomalous . . behavior or environment occurs for the keys .IT.K the other members ..S of the item team . can recognize and signal the anomaly within a time frame which is useful for the authorized user AU or owner of the item team . . For example data records in the time series .K may be transmitted once each second or once every five seconds. Other time frames longer or shorter may be envisioned as well.

Other data may be transmitted as well. For example battery power levels may be transmitted so that item team members .IT can notify each other when their battery power is dropping below an acceptable level.

Similar considerations apply to other data communications between members .IT of the item team . For example data communications occurs between the purse .IT.P and the other members ..S of the item team . . Data communications occur between the cell phone .Act.CP and the other members ..S of the item team . . Data communications occur between the wallet .IT.W and the other members ..S of the item team . 

The data structure of the data records transmitted by each item will be the same or substantially similar except that some items .IT may be characterized by unique or item specific sensor data . For example an active item .Act such as a cell phone .Act.CP may transmit operational data of a type that would not be applicable for passive items .IT.Pass .

As discussed further below the data received by each item team member .IT concerning the other item team members can be used by each item team member to determine whether other members of the item team . or the team as a whole are being subject to displaced anomalous states . . . In addition the integrity of the communications links themselves can be an indication of item state and item team integrity.

Field values shown for Item Team ID Item ID Sequence Validation Time Location Motion. Illumination. etc. are exemplary only and do not necessarily conform to any established standards or conventions for such data. Persons skilled in the relevant arts will recognize that a variety of identifiers may be used for such fields as Item Team ID or Item ID and that any number of notation systems are known and may be used for such data as time location acceleration velocity light intensity etc.

As noted above and for brevity this document sometimes refers below to data transmitted by an item .IT or to the digital signature of an item .IT or makes similar references to data elements associated with an item .IT it being understood that the digital content is actually generated by and or associated with the BIRD .IT associated with the item .IT . Elsewhere the item .IT and associated BIRD .IT may simply be referred to as an item team member .IT with similar references to associated data transmission or data elements.

In an embodiment one use of item teams is to provide additional security against item theft for example pick pocketing of items . In an embodiment and to enhance the reliability of the method it is important that a potential pick pocket not be able to spoof the digital signature of an item team member .IT . In turn to prevent spoofing an electronic scanning or monitoring device in the vicinity of an item team should not be able to fully identify the electronic signature of the items .IT in the item team .

There are various means and algorithms that may be employed to prevent or inhibit determination of an item s electronic identification even when that identification is broadcast openly. Various such means and methods may be compatible with the present system and method and the present system and method is not limited to the use of validation strings . However validation strings already discussed above are one such means.

In an embodiment a validation string is an extended string of bits or bytes which is random or semi random. Each item team member .IT either is assigned its own unique validation string or else self generates such a unique validation string. In an embodiment each item team member .IT receives a new validation string different from the previously used string during a configuration session prior to each field use of the item .IT . In an alternative embodiment each item team member .IT may receive a validation string which is long enough to last through multiple field uses of the item .IT .

In an alternative embodiment a validation string may have to be recycled reused during a single field use of the item team for example during a single day . However the practical usage of the item team wherein the item team may be on the go that is subject to extended changes in location may be such that a person attempting to hack the items .IT would not have a sufficiently extended time exposure to the item team to obtain the full validation strings .

In an embodiment a unique random validation string is generated by the configuration computer which is used to configure an item team member .IT prior to field use. The validation string is uploaded from the configuration computer to the BIRD .IT associated with the item team member .IT as discussed above see . The validation string for a given item .IT is also uploaded to the other members of the item team during the same configuration process. Each member of the item team has not only its own validation string but also the validation strings for all the other item team members therefore each member of the item team can validate the data transmissions .R it receives from the other item team members.

During field use each item team member .IT transmits in sequential order the bits or bytes from its unique validation string . In an embodiment these bits or bytes are included as part of that is part of a field within the sequential time series of data records already discussed above.

If a validation string was short enough that it would repeat in a detectable time then the validation string could be detected and identified by an external third party monitoring device that is a device not part of the item team which is an undesirable outcome. For example suppose the validation string was just sixty bytes in length and suppose an item .IT transmitted a data record every second suppose also that each data record included one byte in sequence of the sixty bytes of the validation string . Then in just one minute the item .IT would transmit its entire validation string and would need to recycle the validation string in the next minute. A third party RF monitoring device nearby could detect the repeated pattern of the validation string in just two minutes or even less and could then spoof the identity of the item .IT .

In order to prevent detection and spoofing of a validation string the validation string should be long enough that is it should have a sufficient number of bits or bytes that the validation string does not need to be re used or recycled within any realistic listening time frame. For example for an item team that will be used in a relatively localized setting over an entire working day such as an office the validation strings should not repeat for at least eight hours. Potentially if a third party monitoring device might be maintained on site by some unfriendly party the validation strings should not repeat for much longer time frames perhaps days weeks or longer. 

In an embodiment suppose each item team member .IT transmits a data record every second with each data record containing one byte from the validation string . Then to avoid identification and spoofing of a validation string the validation string should contain at least 1 byte second 3600 seconds hour 8 hours 28 800 bytes

Longer validation strings can be envisioned as well. For example a validation string based on one byte per second and good for an entire month of continuous item use would be approximately 3 Megabytes which is easily within the storage capabilities of contemporary device memories . Even an item .IT storing not only its own validation string but those of other items in an item team may need to store only several tens of megabytes of item team data for extended usage.

In an alternative embodiment the validation strings could be much shorter than the length characterized above. Each item team member .IT could also have an algorithm designed to permutate the elements of the validation strings so that new validation strings could be dynamically generated on the fly. Associated with the permutation algorithm would be unique randomly generated permutation parameters the permutation parameters are commonly shared by the entire item team so that each member of the item team can generate the updated validation strings used by all other members of the item team. While this embodiment requires less memory than the extended length validation string described above it requires greater use of the BIRD s processor . It is also essential that the permutation algorithm be sufficiently complex that it and or the associated permutation parameters cannot be decoded by any nearby monitoring devices.

In an embodiment and to further forestall spoofing and or hacking of the validation strings access to and modification of the validation strings in BIRD memory may be controlled both for upload and download. Various means may be employed to control and limit access to modification of the validation strings including for example and without limitation password protection and storage in a special separate area of memory with hard wired limits on memory access and control. For example upload and modification may be through a special hard wired port for use by the configuration computer with no direct access via wireless signaling. Access to the validation string may be limited by control circuitry to prevent release of bytes any faster than the authorized transmission speed for example one byte per second and to ensure that release of bytes is strictly sequential.

The item team evaluations are criteria which item team members .IT can use to assess the state of other item team members to support an assessment of whether or not an item team member .IT is likely in extant normal . . or displaced anomalous . . usage. In particular the item team evaluations may be used among other purposes to determine if an item team member .IT is significantly out of proximity to other members of the item team . Such a proximity change determination may indicate that an item team member .IT has been displaced . .

Many item team evaluations are generic evaluations in the sense that they could apply to more than one type of item team member .IT . Below the term suspect item team member refers to any member .IT.S of the team whose signaling is deemed potentially anomalous . by other item team members .IT . These generic evaluations include for example and without limitation 

Other exemplary item team evaluations may include for example and without limitation cell phone evaluations keys evaluations wallet evaluations and purse evaluations as shown in the figure.

It will be noted that significant processing logic and parameter specification may be required during a configuration stage to establish suitable thresholds and criteria for determining anomalous states . among item team members .IT . For example it may not always be expected that all item team members .IT will always be in identical usage or identical locations .L .

Regarding for example exemplary item team . there may be times when the keys .IT.K the wallet .IT.W and the cell phone .Act.CP may all be carried inside the purse .IT.P . However at intervals any one item of the keys .IT.K the wallet .IT.W and or the cell phone .Act.CP are likely to be removed by the authorized user AU for temporary usage the removed item team member s .IT is are put into a different state of motion somewhat different location and subject to other environmental variations from the other item team members .IT . Suitable criteria can be defined for allowable variations both in intensity and time duration for variable sensor readings between item team members .IT . For example a maximum distance can be established beyond which no item team member .IT is expected to wander from the other members of the item team . in normal use. Similarly a maximum time can be established for the amount of time that each item team member .IT might reasonably be expected to be in active use by the owner and so removed from the purse .IT.P .

The method begins with step . In step each item team member .IT receive item team evaluation criteria and anomaly responses for itself and all other item team members. In step each item team member .IT receives a unique validation string for itself also receives the unique validation strings for all other members of the item team .

Steps and constitute a configuration phase of the method . In an embodiment and as discussed above the received item team evaluation criteria anomaly responses and validation strings are uploaded from a configuration computer . In an alternative embodiment the members .IT of the item team may be directly linked to each other for mutual data uploads downloads.

Following the configuration phase field use of the item members .IT begins as the items .IT are typically carried about and put to use by an authorized user AU .

In step and in substantial similarity to steps and of method the BIRDs .IT associated with the items .IT initiate and continue environmental monitoring. For each BIRD .IT this includes receiving data from its sensors receiving data regarding dedicated active item elements for its active item members .Act.IT if any and updating the historical and environmental data log .

In step the item team members .IT begin an exchange of data packets typically at some regularly scheduled interval for example every second. Other intervals longer and shorter may be envisioned as well.

In step each item team member .IT analyzes and compares received data from all item team members including its own self data in the analysis. In an embodiment the analysis is accomplished via BIRD logic running on the BIRD processor and is based on the previously uploaded item team evaluation criteria as well as item specific usage expectations . In an embodiment mutual evaluations by item team members may be based not only on the data in the data packets but also on the signal strength signal quality signal timing and data integrity of the received data packets themselves.

In step each item team member .IT determines if its own condition is indicative of being displaced anomalous . . either based on its own inherent requirements or in relation to the condition of other item team members.

If in step a determination is made by an item team member .IT that its self conditions are possibly displaced anomalous . . then the method continues in part with step and also substantially in parallel with step . In step the item team member .IT reports or signals a state of self anomaly and also may take adaptive measures based on the anomaly response rules or other item specific rules incorporated into BIRD song .

If in step a determination is made by an item team member .IT that its self conditions are not displaced anomalous . . then the method continues with step . In step the item team member .IT analyzes that current and historical data received from other members of the item team once again based on the item team evaluation criteria . The item team member .IT then determines according to the item team evaluation criteria if another member .IT of the item team is potentially in a state of displaced anomalous usage . . .

If in step a determination is made by an item team member .IT that the conditions of another item .IT in the item team are possibly displaced anomalous . . then the method continues with step . In step the item team member .IT reports or signals a state of displacement anomaly . . for the other item .IT and also may take adaptive measures based on the anomaly response rules .

In an embodiment steps self anomaly determining and steps determination of anomaly for other items may occur substantially in parallel. In some instances processing and analysis may yield an initially ambiguous result suggesting that one or more items .IT of the item team are in a displaced anomalous usage . . as compared with others items .IT but it being unclear which items if any remain in extant normal usage . . vs. those items which are in displaced anomalous usage . . . Advanced processing logic may be developed and employed to resolve such uncertainties with varying degrees of probabilistic results.

In an embodiment members .IT of the item team may be assigned priority roles in assessing or determining the possible displaced anomalous states . . of other items .IT in the team .

A potential challenge or concern with an item team is that all the members of an item team may be affected by the same displacement anomalous event influence or environment. For example if all the smaller items of item team . are at some time contained in the purse .IT.P and if the purse is lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. the user may no longer have any local reporting device to alert her to the displacement. This is particularly true if the cell phone .IT.CP was intended as the main personal or local reporting device. 

In an embodiment a solution to this is to have at least one BIRDed item .IT of the item team which is likely to be kept with the user but which is kept apart from the other elements of the item team . In an embodiment this distinctive BIRDed item .IT may be designed to be worn by the user and may be referred to an item attached to person .ATP .

As with the first exemplary item team . the second exemplary item team . includes a purse .IT.P with an associated or embedded item team BIRD .IT.P a set of keys .IT.K with an associated item team BIRD .IT.K a wallet .IT.W with an associated or embedded item team BIRD .IT.W and a cell phone .Act.CP with internal ABIRD components and functionality .IT.CP .

These BIRDed items purse keys wallet cell phone .IT.P K W CP are generally carried loosely by a person in hand in a pocket in the purse etc. and may also be left lying about on a desk or in a drawer when on standby use collectively they are herein referred to as Items free from person .FFP . BIRDed items which are free from a person .FFP may still be carried about by the authorized user AU or be in pocket or otherwise attached to the person intermittently or in a transitory way but such items free from person .FFP may also normally be picked up and carried and then put down again or set aside by the authorized user AU in the course of normal typical or routine usage.

However some other BIRDed items are generally worn on a person and are usually kept on the person throughout an active day or working day possibly from the time a person gets up and dresses until they retire for the evening. Such items as noted above are referred to generally herein as Items attached to person .ATP . In an embodiment a characteristic of such items attached to person .ATP may be that they include as an integral structural element a part or component which holds the item in close and sustained proximity to the authorized user AU or alternatively that such an item .ATP in routine use is held securely to the authorized user AU by some means such as a strap or belt.

Such BIRDed items attached to person .ATP may include for example and without limitation a wristwatch .Act.WrW assumed here to be an electronic watch with processor and jewelry such as a necklace .IT.N . Shown in are an exemplary wristwatch .Act.WrW with an associated embedded BIRD .IT.WRWT and an exemplary necklace .IT.NL with an exemplary pendant the pendant having an embedded BIRD .IT.NL . In a stroke of fashion genius the exemplary pendant happens to be designed to look appealingly like an icon for an exemplary BIRD that is a gray rectangle with a grid of rectangular lines with the image of a bird superimposed. With such seductive design it will surely sell by the millions. Get yours now while supplies last. Dial 1 800 . . . 

A user may wear one such item attached to person .ATP or may wear more than one. As before each BIRD .IT in the item team . maintains communications with all other BIRDs .IT in the item team through data transmission links . In addition to communications between the free from person items .FFP this includes also communication between each of the free from person items .FFP and the item s attached to person .ATP .

The items attached to person .ATP such as the wristwatch .IT.WRWT or the necklace .IT.NL are typically kept on the person and so are less likely to be lost or misplaced in the course of a day. They are also less likely to be stolen and if stolen that is if blatantly ripped off the person s body the authorized owner is likely to notice immediately even without the added benefits of BIRD sensing and notification.

Because the items attached to person .ATP are assumed to remain in close and continuous contact with the owner s body while in the field location and motion sensing data from the items attached to person .ATP may generally provide baseline user coordinates and motion data for other sensors attached to other item team members .IT .

In an embodiment one of more of the items attached to person .ATP may have reduced or customized BIRD elements and functionality specifically focused on items which are physically in intimate contact with the human body through most of the day. An item attached to person .ATP may also have reduced or customized BIRD elements and functionality to maintain small size small weight or reduced power consumption with associated extension of battery life.

In an embodiment an item attached to person .ATP may function as a principal reporting item .PRI discussed further below in conjunction with . In an embodiment an item attached to person .ATP may have modified or additional sensors and or sensor data filtering elements to take into account the sustained close proximity to the human body.

For example in an embodiment an item attached to person .ATP may have two temperature sensing elements .T on facing sides one to detect body temperature and another to detect ambient air temperature. In an embodiment an item attached to person .ATP may have two audio sensors .AI and or .AC and or may have suitable audio filtering hardware software in order to distinguish bodily sounds such as respiration heartbeat and or voice from ambient environmental sounds. In an embodiment an item attached to person .ATP may have suitable means for motion sensing .M including suitable signal filtering to distinguish the movement of a person s center of mass from other body movements such as the swinging of an arm for a wristwatch BIRD .IT.WRWT or the movement of a person s chest which is indicative of respiration for a necklace pendant BIRD .IT.NL .

BIRD s for items attached to a person .ATP may also include biometric or biomedical sensors for example sensors to monitor pulse blood pressure respiration and body temperature. Such BIRD s may use the additional biometric sensors as another means to distinguish extant normal item usage . . from displaced anomalous usage . . especially in the event that such items attached to person .ATP are in fact stolen . Such BIRD s may also be used to warn the owner of any unexpected and potentially dangerous biomedical states which may be indicative of potential heart attack heat stroke or other forms of physiological distress. As elements of extended item teams .EIT see below such BIRDs .IT with biomedical monitoring capabilities can also provide warnings to other persons on an extended team of persons that a team member is potentially in need of medical assistance.

In an embodiment an item team is confined to items used by a single authorized user AU . In an alternative embodiment an item team may also be distributed over multiple persons who typically work in substantial proximity to each other. The items .IT in such a team may be referred to as extended team Items .EIT belonging to an extended item team .EIT . The combination of the item .EIT and an associated extended item team BIRD .EIT may be referred to as an extended item team member .EIT .

In an embodiment an extended item team member .EIT may have parameters and anomaly determination functions directed both towards a local or personal item team as discussed above and also towards the extended item team .EIT . In an embodiment and for purposes of an extended item .EIT the concept of items in the team .EIT may also be more broadly construed than elsewhere in this document and may include for example and without limitation 

Exemplary item team usage criteria . for the exemplary extended item team . are also listed in . Not included in is the usage of extended item team members .EIT to provide monitoring of and possible team warnings concerning biometric indications of possible physical or medical distress.

In an embodiment the BIRDs .EIT embedded in or attached to items .EIT may have special sensors and or special processors or special processing capabilities which are custom indicated or designed for the team mission s . For example in an embodiment audio content sensors .AC and or specialized audio signal processors from multiple police BIRDs .EIT may be configured to identify the sound of gunfire. By using advanced signal processing applied to the sound of gunshots as heard by different BIRDs .EIT at different locations it may be possible to quickly narrow down a location or direction of the gunfire and so to find a criminal. In an embodiment the BIRDs .IT associated with the extended item team . for the police may have audio sensors .AC with enhanced directional sensing capabilities to help identify the direction of gunfire or other pertinent ambient sounds.

A fourth exemplary item team . is associated with a group of hikers in an outdoor terrain. Extended item team determinations appropriate for such a team may include whether or not all the hikers remain within an expected proximity to each other whether or not any hiker is in one place or motionless for more than a threshold period of time whether or not a hiker is exposed to extremes of temperature for longer than a recommended time period and whether or not a hiker is prone lying down at a time or place other than expected. If the BIRDed items .IT worn or utilized by the hikers provide biometric measurements of pulse respiration body temperature or other biometric indicators the items .IT may also signal warnings if any hikers show signs of medical distress.

A fifth exemplary item team . is associated with a group of mountain climbers. Extended item team determinations appropriate for such a team may be similar to those for the group of hikers and their item team . already discussed above. Additional determinations appropriate for mountain climbers may pertain to the altitude of a climber a rate of acceleration in the vertical direction for a climber and the integrity of rope or other items associated with mountain climbing.

Described throughout this document above are numerous exemplary BIRD logic algorithms and exemplary usage expectations to determine a possibility that an item is displaced . lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen or otherwise in an anomalous state . . In an embodiment in addition to employing such algorithms and usage expectations an item team may employ addition usage expectations to determine the extant normal . . vs. displaced anomalous . . state of the item team as a whole. Some exemplary whole item team usage expectations may include for example and without limitation 

In an embodiment a BIRDed item is generally configured to self assess as being lost or misplaced even if the authorized user AU has not yet noticed the absence of the BIRDed item . Sometimes however an authorized user AU may notice the absence of an expected item before the BIRDed item has self assessed as being lost .. misplaced .. stolen .. etc.

In an embodiment a BIRD such as one associated with a cell phone .Act.CP or an item attached to person .ATP may be configured to make user initiated contact with other members .IT of an associated item team . For example the authorized user AU may attempt to send a signal from his or her cell phone .Act.CP to the a target team member .IT which the user has identified as being lost .. or misplaced .. or possibly misappropriated .. or stolen .. . If the target team member .IT is within range of the communication the target team member .IT may be configured to then report its current specific location .L to the cell phone .Act.CP the mapping features of the cell phone .Act.CP may then guide the authorized user AU to the target member .IT of the item team .

Similar protocols may also enable an authorized user AU to make other types of status checks of item team members .IT via a cell phone .Act.CP item attached to person .ATP or even a configuration computer with suitable remote communications capabilities.

In an embodiment some items .IT in an item team may be monitored in whole or in part via RFID tags . This may provide among other benefits a means to include some items in an item team where the full functionality of a BIRD is not required is too costly or is not appropriate for reasons of size or weight or other considerations. The RFID tag provides proximity data and possibly other data for the minimally monitored item .altM and more specifically the RFID tagged item .RFID with which it is associated or coupled. However actual determination of a displaced anomalous state . . of the RFID tagged item .RFID is not performed by the RFID tag but rather by a BIRD .IT associated with another item .IT of the item team . Put another way an item with only an RFID tag attached is not equipped for a self assessment of its own state as extant normal . . on the one hand or displaced anomalous . . on the other hand. However if included within the scope of an item team the RFID tagged item may have the assessment made on its behalf by another BIRDed item .IT within suitable range.

In the exemplary item team . the purse .IT.P the keys .IT.P and the cell phone .Act.CP maintain item team functionality through the use of attached or integrated BIRDs .IT.P .IT.K .IT.CP . The purse keys and cell phone maintain item team interaction through RF links . These elements have been discussed above and the discussion will not be repeated here.

Also included in the exemplary item team . are a wallet .IT.RFID.W and eye glasses .IT.RFID.S which do not have associated or integrated BIRDS . However both items have RFID tags . . . The wallet .IT.RFID.W has RFID Tag 1 . which may be built into the wallet as part of its construction or may be attached to the wallet by an authorized user AU . Similarly the glasses .IT.RFID.S have RFID Tag 2 . which may for example be built into the frame of the glasses or may be attached to the frame by the authorized user AU . The RFID tags shown in the figure and in particular the RFID tag . associated with the glasses .IT.S are not necessarily drawn to scale and are shown in symbolic form only. Tags are available which can be readily incorporated inconspicuously into the frames of many eye glasses as well as into wallets. 

At least one of the BIRDs .IT associated with the item team . will have RFID interrogator technology. For example in item team . the BIRD .IT.P associated with the purse .IT.P has built in RFID interrogatory technology .RFID not shown see discussion associated with above for more discussion of RFID sensors interrogators in BIRDs .

Using its RFID interrogator .RFID the purse .IT.P and associated BIRD .IT.P can periodically interrogate that is ping both the wallet .IT.RFID.W and glasses .IT.RFID.S . The RFID interrogator .RFID transmits RFID signals to determine whether or not these items are within RFID pinging range of the purse .IT.P . If the wallet .IT.W or glasses .IT.S fail to return a suitable signal when pinged the BIRD .IT.P may identify the wallet or glasses as possibly being in a displaced . or anomalous . condition.

In an embodiment the BIRD .IP with the RFID interrogator may be the principal reporting item .PRI as discussed further below in conjunction with .

In an embodiment in addition to using standard RFID tags an item team may also employ WISP wireless identification and sensing platform RFID tags to obtain data such as temperature acceleration and sound and or light intensity for the item .IT.RFID to which the WISP RFID tag is attached. Such data may be put to additional uses in assessing the state of either the item .IT.RFID to which the WISP RFID tag is attached or the state of the entire item team or both.

In embodiments of item teams above team members .IT are equipped with either a BIRD to establish a BIRDed item .IT or an RFID tag to create an alternatively monitored item .altM . In an alternative embodiment an item .IT may have an associated BIRD to establish a BIRDed item but the item may also have an RFID tag or other technology suitable for at least minimal monitoring of the item .IT by the item team . The RFID tag or other technology suitable for minimal monitoring may be used for example to provide redundancy and backup in case of BIRD failure.

In an embodiment many members .IT of an item team may tend to share significant elements of their usage expectations . In an embodiment such shared usage expectations may be stored on a common data processing technology for example on a configuration computer . The shared usage expectations may be custom edited for individual items .IT and may be downloaded from the common data processing technology to the individual item team members .IT as appropriate.

In an embodiment two or more conventional communications oriented devices such as for example cell phones or PDAs which are conventionally implemented without any of or without most of the other BIRD specific technologies and algorithms discussed throughout this document may be still configured to function similarly in part to a BIRD item team . The conventional communication technologies may do so by using their available technology to implement a subset of BIRD item team functionality. The items so assembled and so operating may be referred to as a pseudo item team.

In a first such exemplary embodiment two communications devices may be configured to maintain substantially continuous real time communication of their locations. The communications device locations may be determined via GPS or other existing locationing systems. The communications devices may be configured such that when a first device determines the second device is beyond a predefined acceptable distance the first device determines that displaced anomalous usage . . may be in progress for the second device or for itself.

In a second such exemplary embodiment two communications devices may be configured to maintain substantially continuous real time communication of their motions as determined via internal motion sensors or fine grained use of location sensors or other means . The communications devices may be configured such that when a first device determines the second device is engaged in substantially different motion from itself displaced anomalous usage . . may be in progress.

In a third such exemplary embodiment the two communications devices may be configured to maintain substantially continuous real time direct radio frequency RF communications direct communications are RF interactions which are not mediated through a third party communications infrastructure for example not mediated through a cell phone network nor through the internet . The devices may be configured to maintain such direct communications through a device to device protocol or at a device to device transmission level which results in a relatively limited inter device communications range for example a few dozen yards no more than a kilometer or a mile etc. . Protocols such as Bluetooth or WiFi may be employed for these purposes. The communications devices may be configured such that when a first device determines the second device is no longer in communication or when signal strength or signal quality has fallen below a pre defined level a determination is made of possible displaced anomalous usage . . .

In a fourth exemplary embodiment one or more member s of the pseudo item team may have RFID readers while at least one other item of the pseudo item team may be equipped with an attached RFID tag. The RFID reader may periodically interrogate the RFID tagged item. If an appropriate RFID signature is received in reply the reader determines that the item remains in appropriate range. If the appropriate RFID signature is not received the reader determines that displaced anomalous usage . . of the RFID tagged item may be in progress.

A BIRDed item whether operating by itself or as part of an item team may have its operations enhanced by drawing on data from external data sources . Some data sources may be non local for example data drawn from a wireless internet connection or other wireless connections or satellite based which may provide location information for example GPS weather information or similar data. Other data steams may be drawn from localized area specific data streams for example RF or infrared data streams which may be broadcast from item proximate location beacons . The location beacons are envisioned as being integrated into buildings facilities transportation devices storage units and so on.

Below in this document the label is used to refer both to i locations .L with location beacons and ii other data stream resources for example internet data services and data service providers . Both the physical broadcast elements beacons and their location data streams with actual location data content are referenced as . Data may be radio frequency but may be transmitted by other means as well such as infrared light etc.

In an embodiment a BIRD is a passive receiver of location data . In an alternative embodiment a BIRD may work interactively with a location beacon both broadcasting data to a beacon and receiving data from a beacon to optimize the identification of the BIRD s location.

To reduce visual clutter in only some of the locations and data sources are illustrated with beacons but it may be assumed that beacons are associated with all the locations sources .

Such department floor unit or other zones .Z within a facility data streams may provide specific information which enables a BIRD to determine if it is in an appropriate environment or not. For example an item designated for use in a specific facility may be authorized or intended for use in some departments or sections but not in others.

In one implementation of the environmental reporting system an entrance exit may be augmented with a plurality of RF elements either active RF transmitters or passive RFID tags in either implementation some RF elements are deliberately positioned inside a building or facility while others are positioned outside the building or facility. This supports a BIRD in determining a direction of its transit from outside to inside or vice versa.

In an embodiment a BIRD may be configured with image processing software which compares the image sent to it by the security camera .SC with a pre programmed image of an authorized user AU of the BIRDed item . If the two images do not match the BIRD may take appropriate action to signal that the item may possibly be in the hands of an unauthorized user UU .

In an alternative embodiment image processing tasks may be off loaded to the security camera .SC or supporting computers not shown . The camera .SC may send a request to a BIRD requesting an image or images of the authorized user AU of the BIRDed item . Upon receiving the image s the camera .SC or supporting processor compares the image s of the authorized user AU with the image of the person actually in view of the camera .SC . In an embodiment if the two images do not match the camera .SC can send a signal or message to appropriate authorities that a possibly unauthorized possessor of an item is in view. In an embodiment an ABIRDed item .Act may also be configured to receive security notifications from authorized public devices telling the ABIRDed item .Act to take appropriate security measures.

Environmental reporting elements may also be used for error checking and calibration of BIRD sensors . For example the temperature reported by BIRD sensors .T may be compared to localized temperature reporting motion sensors .M may be compared against data reported by highway or automotive sensors and diverse location sensors .L may be cross checked against each other.

Other possible location specific active data sources which may support a BIRDed item include for example and without limitation 

In an embodiment at least one member .IT of an item team may be configured as a principal reporting item .PRI of the item team . In an embodiment the principal reporting item .PRI is an active item .Act which may also be an item attached to person .ATP . The purpose of the principal reporting item .PRI is to have at least one team member .IT which is likely to remain within the control of an authorized owner or user and to remain functional even if other items .IT in the item team have become separated from the authorized owner or otherwise display signs of displaced anomalous . . environment usage or ownership.

In addition to being an item attached to person .ATP a principal reporting item .PRI will typically benefit from having an internal ABIRD .Act.I . In an embodiment the principal reporting item .PRI will have low power usage and corresponding long battery life. In an embodiment the principal reporting item .PRI is configured to have local signaling which is highly likely to draw the attention of the authorized user AU in the event that some other item .IT in the item team provides indications of a possible anomaly. For example the principal reporting item .PRI may have a vibrator signaling element .V which is in direct contact with the authorized user s skin.

It will be noted that in such an embodiment the principal reporting item .PRI is also an ABIRDed item .Act.I with an internal ABIRD .Act.I .

Exemplary interaction illustrates how a principal reporting item .PRI may interact with data streams from a public transportation system. The exemplary principal reporting item .PRI illustrated is a wristwatch .Act.WrW with a dedicated BIRD display .D . When the authorized user AU steps on board a bus .MTP a data stream from the bus .MTP signals the wristwatch .Act.WrW that it is on board the bus.

Additionally an active news data stream or weather data stream may signal the wristwatch .Act.WrW that it is currently raining. Based on pre programmed usage expectations and specifically in view of the fact that it is raining the wristwatch .Act.WrW is programmed to assume that the authorized user AU is carrying an umbrella .S . If the user has an umbrella .S with an associated BIRD the umbrella .S may be part of an item team which is actively signaling its presence to the wristwatch .Act.WrW . 

When the bus .MTP approaches a bus stop .MTBS either the bus .MTP or the bus stop .MTBS provide a signal telling the wristwatch .Act.WrW of the approach to the bus stop. In an embodiment at each approach to a bus stop the wristwatch .Act.WrW may signal the user to Take Umbrella. In an alternative embodiment the wristwatch has been preprogrammed .Act.WrW by the user to know the bus stop s at which the user is likely to get off the bus. The wristwatch .Act.WrW only signals the user to Take Umbrella at the user s likely stop s . In an alternative embodiment the wristwatch .Act.WrW and or other members of the item team maintain an ongoing observation of the user s movement patterns over time the watch and or other members of the item team determine which bus stop s are the ones the user is most likely to use to exit from the bus. The watch .Act.WrW then signals the user to Take Umbrella at those stops.

In an alternative embodiment the watch .Act.WrW may detect or determine its presence on the bus not through a data stream but through other sensor parameter determinations such as changing location mapped to stored bus route s velocity and acceleration determinations . Even data from an audio sensor A such as identification of bus engine sounds may contribute to a determination of presence onboard a bus. Similarly the arrival or approach to a bus stop may be determined via location determinations via GPS or similar.

Exemplary interaction illustrates how a principal reporting item .PRI may interact with data streams from entrances or exits to a facility such as a building or section wing department of a building. The exemplary principal reporting item .PRI again in this instance a wristwatch .Act.WTCH is pre programmed or pre configured to remind the user to take certain items such as a purse keys cell phone and wallet. Illustrated are successive stages of a scrolling message to the user. The messaging may be employed whether or not the listed items have BIRDs associated with them.

Exemplary interaction illustrates how a principal reporting item .PRI may interact with another member .IT of an item team and possibly with local data streams . An authorized user AU with her watch .Act.WrW and cell phone .Act.CP may visit a first business facility .B for example a veterinary office. Upon picking up her dog D the authorized user AU is so happy to have her dog D back from the vet she forgets her cell phone .Act.CP .

The authorized user AU walks her dog D down the street. By the time she is in the vicinity of a second business .B the cell phone .Act.CP and or the watch .Act.WrW may determine in any of several ways that the cell phone has been left behind. For example the cell phone .Act.CP may make an auto determination that it has been lost .. based on methods discussed at length earlier in this document. Alternatively the cell phone .Act.CP may determine based on location data or based on a data stream from the veterinarians office .B that it is at the veterinarian s office while the watch .Act.WrW determines based on location data or based on a data stream from the nearby business .B that it is no longer at the veterinarians office.

Once it has been determined that the cell phone .Act.CP and the watch .Act.WrW are no longer at the same location the watch signals the authorized user AU that she has forgotten the cell phone .Act.CP at the vet s office .B . Not illustrated is how unhappy is the dog D to return to the veterinarian s office .B for even a short time. 

One general goal of the present system and method is identifying when an item is in a possibly displaced anomalous state . . anomalous usage anomalous environmental context and or anomalous internal operations or conditions which may for example indicate the item is lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. . System and method elements directed to this goal are discussed at length throughout this document. However in an embodiment the system and method seeks to anticipate and prevent an item from being displaced . lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen or otherwise entering into an anomalous state usage or environment . .

Some elements directed towards the anticipation and prevention of a extant normal item state . . have already been discussed immediately above in conjunction with . presents drawings of further exemplary elements associated with the anticipation prediction and or prevention of displaced anomalous item states . . usage or entrance into an anomalous environment.

In BIRDed item represents any item in combination or association with a BIRD . The BIRDed item may be any of a passive item .Pass physically tethered to an associated BIRD or with an integrated BIRD or an active item .Act tethered to an external active item BIRD .Act.E or an active item .Act with an integrated internal active item BIRD .Act.I .

Certain factors are likely to be associated with the anticipation or prediction that a BIRDed item item which is not currently lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. may become lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. . These factors include for example and without limitation elements related to 

An authorized user AU or other BIRD administrator can configure suitable BIRD song for example via usage expectations to be run on processor to trigger warnings or alerts if an BIRDed item appears to be at risk of becoming displaced . or otherwise found in an anomalous state . .

Illustrated in is a locker .L . Lockers may be either in a state of being open or closed. Suppose a user not shown approaches the locker and opens it. Then items . within the locker are visible to the user the user can see the items . and immediately identify those items he or she should have in possession on their person. However if a locker is closed the items . in the locker are internal and hidden from view. The visible items . and the hidden items . can self identify as being in view or hidden based for example on the amount of light detected by their respective optical sensors or cameras .C . If the locker .L is configured with intelligent electronics the hidden items . may also self identify as being in view or hidden based for example on a signal sent to them by locker .L indicating that the locker door is closed.

As the authorized user AU approaches the locker or is in proximity to the locker .L a principal reporting item .PRI not shown which is worn by the user and also items in the locker . . can mutually self identify each other. Suppose the user then leaves proximity of the locker .L this may be determined by location monitoring or by a data stream .L associated with the locker or by other means.

Suitable detail may be included in the usage expectations to indicate that an amount of time the locker .L was open or how recently the locker was open may influence the determination of whether to issue an advisory to the user.

Similar considerations apply to hidden items . and visible items . which may potentially be stored in other kinds of storage units or compartments such as a dresser .D which may include internal drawer associated data streams to help identify specific drawers. Similar considerations might apply to desks filing cabinets and other storage systems not shown .

Discussed above in association with was the use of data streams in conjunction with entrances and exits .EE and with transportation such as metro buses with environment reporting elements .MTB metro bus stops with environment reporting elements .MTBS metro trains with environmental reporting elements .MTT and metro train stations with environment reporting elements .MTTS . The reporting elements can assist BIRDs in identifying their exact location and providing other pertinent environmental data. If data streams are not available a BIRD may compensate to varying degrees via analysis of data from the sensors .

In either case suitable usage expectations may be employed either within a single BIRD or across the members .IT of an item team to determine a likelihood that certain items are at risk of becoming displaced . or otherwise subject to an anomalous state . . Suitable warnings may then be issued to a user.

Typically contexts where a user is at risk of leaving an item behind include for example and without limitation mass transit or mass transit stops .MTB MTBS MTT MTTS where person gets off a bus or metro and entrances and exits .EE particularly if when a member .IT of an item team is separated by more than a configurable distance from other members .IT which are clustered together.

In programming or configuring a BIRD for anomalous item anticipation advisory a user may be assisted by various GUI means for example a configuration wizard. For example a wizard could present a survey to an authorized user AU with the survey including various questions about item usage and also about the user s habits. Exemplary survey questions might include for example and without limitation 

Based in whole or in part on user responses to these questions and similar questions the wizard could then program or fine tune usage expectations for anomalous item anticipation advisory.

The probability or risk that an BIRDed item may be lost or misplaced by a user or stolen or misappropriated by another person may be influenced by among other factors 

The probability or risk that a BIRDed item may be lost or misplaced by a user or stolen or misappropriated may be influenced by among other elements 

The probability or risk that a BIRDed item may be lost or misplaced by the user or stolen or misappropriated may be influenced by among other elements 

The probability or risk that a BIRDed item may be lost or misplaced by the authorized user AU may be influenced by among other elements 

It will be recognized that specific criteria usage expectations suitable parameters and parameter thresholds for predicting a possibility of item loss or misplacement will necessarily vary from item to item. It will also be recognized that generally speaking some or all of the criteria which may be applicable to item loss prediction may also be applied to determinations that an item has already been lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. is wandering .. or is stolen .. . In general however usage expectations and specific data thresholds will tend to be different for loss prediction vs. lost misplaced stolen determinations.

In some instances a single prediction usage factor PREDUS may be configured via usage expectations to serve as a critical prediction factor. A critical prediction factor is one which if satisfied by environmental conditions will be sufficient by itself to trigger the BIRD to present an advisory to an authorized user AU to manually check the state of an item.

For example a critical prediction factor may refer to a stored list of certain mass transit stops train or bus stops where the user is likely to exit from mass transit. The critical PREDUS may indicate that any time the user is commuting and is approaching one of the stops on the list the BIRD will issue an advisory reminding the user to take certain items such as a purse or cell phone.

In other cases usage expectations may require a combination of PREDUS factors to trigger an advisory to a user to manually check an item.

The pseudocode fragment first defines a list of items. In the code sample shown the items are specifically identified. However items may be identified by other means such as selecting all small items all items which are often not carried in pocket or purse or similar criteria.

The pseudocode fragment then evaluates each item in the list in turn. For each item the pseudocode determines if the item is not currently collocated with the user.

The issued advisory may take the form of a sound or visual signal issued directly by the BIRDed item at risk of being lost .. or misplaced .. if the item is part of an item team the issued advisory may in addition or in the alternative take the form of a sound or visual signal provided by a principal reporting item .PRI which is reliably worn by the authorized user AU .

The pseudocode shown is exemplary only and many other examples of suitable code may be envisioned. The pseudocode may in practice be implemented via any number of known programming languages including for example and without limitation C C Java Pearl and others.

In an embodiment the processes or methods by which a BIRDed item may identify itself as being at risk of becoming lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. is similar to the processes by which the BIRDed item identifies itself as already being lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. but with suitable modifications.

With reference to method and method the BIRDed item is configured for expected item behavior and or environments or behaviors which signal a risk of being displaced anomalous . . . With reference to method step coupling the item and BIRD is applicable if the BIRD is a separate physical unit from its associated item . Environmental monitoring item usage by the user and signaling by the BIRD remain applicable. The configuration of the BIRD for item anticipation prediction may take place at the time the BIRD is configured to determine that the item has been lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. or the configuration may take place at a different time.

As per the item may be configured via a suitable configuration computer . However if an active item .Act has a sufficiently complex and suitable user interface for example a cell phone .Act.CP or a laptop or tablet computer .Act.LC the configuration may be done in part or in whole directly via the interface of the active item .Act . As per the item may report a risk of being lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. to a variety of different reporting centers as well as using the local signaling .

Process diagram summary method descriptions and method shown in respectively remain substantially applicable. The logic for item loss prediction may be viewed as an extension of BIRD logic .

However in an embodiment for prediction of item loss misplacement theft method step will entail receiving prediction usage factors . In an alternative embodiment prediction usage factors may be viewed as an element of usage expectations . Also for item loss misplacement theft prediction step and associated usage expectations will entail comparing analyzed item usage data .U with one or more prediction usage factors .

In operational use when BIRD logic identifies a risk that an item may become displaced . BIRD song may issue local signal in the form or warnings or advisories to the authorized user AU . However certain BIRD song advisories to a user warning them of a risk of possible item loss or misplacement may become routine and commonplace. For example if BIRD song advises an authorized user AU to take certain items every time the user approaches a certain stop on the train the user may wind up hearing and or seeing the same advisory every day. With such constant repetition there is a risk that the user will become acclimated to such a repetitive advisory and so tend to ignore the advisory.

In an embodiment BIRD song tracks the kinds of advisories it issues to a user regarding risk of item loss item misplacement etc. If BIRD song determines it is issuing an advisory on a routine basis daily for example then in an embodiment BIRD song may change the advisory. For example if tones or music are part of the advisory a different tone or music could be selected possibly at random each time the same advisory is issued. If a synthesized spoken warning is used the sentence structure and or the voice of the speaker could be changed on successive advisories. If vibration from the BIRD is used as part of the signaling the intensity frequency and pattern of vibration may be varied from one advisory to the next. These variations will help keep the user attuned to the advisories so the advisories are less likely to be ignored.

In an alternative embodiment the user may configure the advisories to vary in a desired way or after a designated number of repetitions of the same advisory.

Discussed above in this document are systems and methods for BIRDs which serve the general function of identifying an item s environment activity usage or operations as extant normal . . or displaced anomalous . . . Discussed above is the integration of such BIRD elements into items which are primarily mechanical or structural in nature that is passive items .Pass . Also discussed is the integration of BIRD elements and functionality into active items .Act that is items which inherently employ processors memory and other electronics associated with data processing.

In some instances some passive items .Pass may benefit from the inclusion and integration of item specific sensors which detect specific mechanical and or structural states or usages of the passive item .Pass . Some passive items .Pass may also benefit from the inclusion and integration of item specific sensors which detect other items carried within or on the passive item .Pass . Several exemplary such passive items .Pass with suitable item specific sensor elements .S are discussed immediately below.

At the time of preparation of this document there are some items which are conventionally passive items .Pass . With the passage of time some of these items .Pass may increasingly include various processor based technologies including for example the BIRD itself . The present discussion will remain applicable to such items .Pass as they transition to the role of active items .Act .

In turn the container items themselves may constitute team members .IT of still larger item teams see in particular below .

To avoid excessive and possibly confusing label density in figures which already contain numerous elements and labels the item teams associated with are not specifically labeled as such in the drawings. Similarly the contained items though possibly being item team members .IT and or extended item team members . EIT are not labeled as such in .

For convenience and in particular for purposes of discussion associated with FIGS. A G such items previously labeled .C will be collectively labeled as here as personal item transport containers . Such items may also be referred to for short as container items . The goal is to help distinguish in the text those items which do the containing from those items which are contained within. 

In an embodiment the exemplary BIRD elements .C which are integrated into the structure of the briefcase but are not shown in detail in the figure may include a processor a memory a clock calendar timer various general environmental sensors for sensing wallet location motion light exposure surface pressure on the wallet etc. a bus communications elements local signaling one or more batteries item specific sensors .IS and other elements discussed in conjunction with various BIRD embodiments throughout this document. In an alternative embodiment some or all of the typical sensors pertaining to external environmental sensing may be omitted and mainly or only internal sensors .IS for internal item location may be employed. In an embodiment the sensors may include an RFID interrogator .RFID such an embodiment is discussed in further detail below in conjunction with .

Suitable usage expectations may be configured to determine whether the usage of pockets clasps locks and possibly other suitcase elements is consistent and whether or not the usage is appropriate for the current detection context . For example the BIRD logic BIRD song for the briefcase may be configured to signal an alert if the briefcase is closed by a user when certain pockets which are expected to contain items do not contain items. Similarly the briefcase may be configured to signal an alert if the briefcase is closed and in motion but one or more of the locks or clasps are not set properly.

In an embodiment the briefcase may also be configured to detect and signal an alert if an active item .Act remains powered on when the briefcase is closed and in motion which may result in the active item .Act suffering unnecessary drain of its battery . In alternative embodiment the briefcase may be configured to send a signal to BIRDed items within signaling the item s BIRDs and or an associated active item .Act if applicable to either shut down or reduce power when the briefcase is closed.

In an embodiment a photoelectric material not shown on the surface of the briefcase .B may be employed to provide electricity both for battery charging and to supplement the battery in the event the briefcase is lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen for an extended period of time.

Similar sensors and similar BIRD logic BIRD song are applicable for such other containers items as luggage .LG toolkits .TK purses .P and other baggage type items which are used by a person to carry smaller items about.

In an embodiment a personal item transport container is generally defined as a container which is closed or closeable to create a substantially sealed off separation between an internal inside environment and an external outside environment.

In an alternative embodiment a personal item transport container may not be sealable an example might be a wallet .W a shopping cart or a carrying bag lacking a zipper or similar closure which may still be employed to carry or transport other items .

In an alternative embodiment a personal item transport container may be a compartment of a vehicle such as the trunk or glove compartment of a car or truck or even the passenger compartment of the car or truck.

As discussed throughout this document a BIRD .C may be associated with any personal item transport containers in order to help the BIRDed transport container to self identify as possibly being displaced . lost misplaced misappropriated stolen wandering or being otherwise in an anomalous state . .

In an embodiment as already discussed above in part in conjunction with and again below with respect to it also possible to place internal sensors .IS inside of such personal item transport containers where the internal sensors .IS help determine if smaller items are appropriately carried within. For discussion and development purposes a container item may be referred to as a mother BIRD and the items meant to be carried within a chicklets or eggs. However such terminology is not employed further herein. 

In an embodiment the internal sensors .IS of a personal item transport container may be associated with specific pockets or pouches within the container and the sensors .IS may be used to detect the presence of an item within the pocket or pouch. See for example above. 

In an alternative embodiment the RFID sensing can be employed to determine if a personal item transport container contains one or more other items that are expected to be contained within.

In an alternative embodiment the integrated BIRD .C of a container item may be configured to communicate with other BIRDed items which are expected to be held within the container item . In such an embodiment the container item and the BIRDed items within become another variation on item teams see and B above and other figures throughout this document .

In an alternative embodiment combinations of pocket sensors RFID technology and BIRD to BIRD communications may be employed to track and monitor items within the container item .

In an embodiment the personal item transport container may have as part of its outer wall or enclosure an RF shielding element such as a metallic foil or a metallic mesh to insulate items and RF elements which are inside the personal item transport container from outside RF interference and sources. In an embodiment the BIRD .C may have an RFID antenna .RFID which is configured to direct RFID queries substantially towards the interior cavity or space of the personal item transport container that is the antenna may be directional . In an embodiment the RFID elements the shielding and or the RFID antenna s .RFID may be incorporated into a compartment or subunit within the container item .

In an embodiment the personal item transport container may have additional RFID internal antennas .RFID situated at various points along its inner enclosure coupled to the BIRD .C via suitable wires bus or similar not shown in the figure and designed to ensure that the entire interior cavity of the personal item transport container can obtain suitable exposure to an RFID interrogation signal. Suitable exposure is defined as an RF signal which is sufficiently strong to activate any RFID tag no matter where placed in the interior of the personal item transport container .

In an embodiment the personal item transport container may have one or more additional antennas .RFID.Ext which are mounted on or coupled to the exterior of the personal item transport container and which are coupled to the BIRD .C . These exterior antennas .RFID.Ext are configured to detect items which are in the space exterior to the personal item transport container but which are in possibly intended to be carried within the personal item transport container .

In an alternative embodiment the personal item transport container may be equipped with only some elements components of a general BIRD BIRD logic or general BIRD functionality. However the personal item transport container will include at a minimum the RFID interrogator .RFID and sufficient processing memory power user interface elements and or to implement the elements of RFID operations described herein see further discussion immediately below .

Shown are two exemplary BIRDed items . . represented via the double diamond shapes . Also shown are four exemplary altMon items .altM which may be any kind of portable items which may be carried in the personal item transport container . Specific representative altMon items .altM a writing pad .X a shirt .Y a calculator .Z and a pen .W are shown in the figure to help aid understanding. These are entirely exemplary and any items of suitable size and portability may be envisioned. These four exemplary items .W X Y Z are not part of the personal item transport container . However to take advantage of the RFID capabilities of the personal item transport container there is an associated RFID tag labeled in the figure as Tag W Tag X Tag Y and Tag Z attached to each respective item .W .X .Y .Z .

All such RFID tagged items .W X Y Z and other items with RFID tags may also be referred to as RFID tagged items .RFID .

In an exemplary embodiment the display .D may offer an authorized user AU of the personal item transport container four options 

This option enables the user to upload into the container s BIRD .C a list of expected items see which are expected to be found in the container . The upload may be for example from a configuration computer and may be accomplished via a wireless connection or via a wired connection using a port not shown on the container .

The list to be uploaded would identify an item meant to be carried in the container this identification is via either of i the electronic product code EPC or similar code of an RFID tag attached to the item or ii a BIRD ID code such as the Item Team ID and Item ID for each BIRDed item .IT associated with an item team see for example above .

In an embodiment of the present system and method an RFID tag would also store text descriptive of the item or even an image of the item . In an alternative embodiment the RFID tag would only store the EPC while an associated descriptive text and or image for the item may be uploaded from the configuration computer and stored in the container s BIRD .C .

This option enables the user to establish the list of items which are expected to be in the container based on the items which are actually present in the container . In an embodiment after selection of option 2 the display .D may prompt the user through a series of steps to be taken. For example the steps may entail i Make sure all items which are expected to be in the container are actually placed within the container ii close the container iii wait a specified period of time for the container to perform an RFID scan and or a query of all BIRDed items in the interior of the container for items present.

In an embodiment the scan is conducted automatically once the container is closed. A latch sensor .IS.L or hinge sensor .IS.H not shown may determine when the container is closed. In an alternative embodiment once the user closes the container a button or other user interface element on the exterior of the container may be used to initiate the RFID scan. In an alternative embodiment the RFID scan may be performed even when the container is still open.

This option may present the user with an editing interface to manually edit or modify the list of expected items . In an embodiment the personal item transport container with its integrated BIRD .C may be able to store more than one possible list of expected items suitable for different uses or different occasions of use of the container . The Edit briefcase expected item list option may provide access to the several lists which have been stored by the container s BIRD .C .

This option performs an RFID scan and or a BIRD to BIRD query of the interior of the container the container s BIRD .C then compares a found item list of the items identified through the scan see with the expected item list . The result is a another list not shown in displayed to the user of

It will be apparent to person s skilled in the relevant arts that selecting any of options 1 2 3 and or 4 may result in the container s BIRD .C presenting via the display .D additional instructions for the user additional options for the user and or additional information. Further the options illustrated are exemplary only and fewer options more options or different options than those illustrated may be presented.

The process described above is exemplary only and is in no way limiting. Determination of items in the container may be augmented or supplemented with other means including for example and without limitation 

The BIRD .C components remain embedded in the structure of the container but are shown as partly superimposed on top for ease of visualization. Similarly several items are inside the transport container including BIRDed item . the calculator .Z the pen .W and an unexpected item a book .UI with an RFID tag Tag UI . These items are stored within the personal item transport container but are illustrated as partly superimposed on top for ease of visualization.

Also illustrated are three items which are external to the transport container the writing tablet .X which is within RFID proximity . to the container the shirt .Y which is outside . of the RFID range of the RFID technology of the container and BIRD .C and the BIRDed item . . It will be noted however that in an embodiment the BIRDed item . may itself have RFID capabilities in such an embodiment BIRDed item . may itself detect the shirt .Y and relay the information about the detected shirt to the container .

Shown in the figure are two different display contents both of which may be shown on the display local input .D .L . In an embodiment the two different display contents are displayed at different moments in time in an alternative embodiment both display contents may fit on the display at the same time and be displayed at the same moment in time. 

The first display contents shown on the display local input .D .L at a first point in time lists action options for the user where the authorized user AU has selected the fourth option 4 Check for missing items. The options shown are the same as those discussed above in conjunction with .

In an embodiment when the user selects the option 4 Check for missing items the RFID interrogator .RFID of the BIRD .C initiates an RFID scan of the interior of the container . If the RFID interrogator .RFID is suitably configured it may initiate a scan as well of the area which is external to and surrounding the container . At the same time the container s BIRD .C also attempts to initiate contact or to update an established contact with any contained BIRDed items and or nearby BIRDed items .

Due to either or both of the directional nature of the RFID antennas .RFID and the shielding of the container the container s BIRD .C is configured to distinguish between RFID tagged items .RFID which are in the interior of the container and RFID tagged items .RFID which are located external to the container . The container not only performs the RFID scan but the BIRD logic compares the scan results with the stored expected item list see below .

As noted above see in an embodiment some BIRDed items . which are exterior to the container may have an RFID interrogator sensor .RFID during an RFID scan the container may query any outside BIRDs . and have them initiate their own RFID sweep or scan if the outside BIRD s . have such capabilities. Such BIRDs which are external to the container but with RFID capabilities may effectively function to extend the RFID range of the container .

In an embodiment the container s BIRD .C may determine which BIRDed items are contained within and which are not based on the nature of RF contact. For example the container s shielding may prevent interior RF signals from reaching BIRDed items outside the container . As a result the container may have separate interior and exterior antennas not illustrated depending on which antenna interior or exterior establishes contact with a BIRDed item the container s BIRD .C may thereby determine that a BIRDed item . is interior to the container or that a BIRDed item . is exterior to the container .

In an alternative embodiment BIRDed items . . may use light intensity measurements or other means to determine if they are inside a container or not and return a report to the container s BIRD .C . In an alternative embodiment fine grained location determinations may be employed to determine if a BIRDed item . . is interior or exterior to the container . Other interior exterior determination methods may be employed as well.

The resulting output see indicates which expected items .RFID are inside the container and which are outside . An exemplary contents report is shown on the display local input .D .L see again . The contents report indicates that three expected items the calculator the pen and item . were found within the container . A fourth expected item the notepad was not found within the container but was identified as being nearby within RFID pinging range . A fifth expected item . was also identified as being outside the container . A sixth expected item the bowling shirt was not found within the container and was not identified as being within RFID pinging range. In this exemplary case presumable the outside BIRDed item . either lacks RFID capabilities or the outside BIRDed item . has RFID sensing capabilities but was also out of range of the shirt .Y . Finally an additional unknown item tagged with RFID Tag UI was identified as being within the container .

With this information in hand the authorized user AU is in a position to locate or at least attempt to locate the missing items and also to determine if the unknown item in the container really properly belongs in the personal item transport container . If yes the item can be added to a stored expected item list. 

The method include steps which may be performed by an authorized user AU of the container steps which may be performed by a BIRD .C integrated into or associated with the container or a combination of user performed and BIRD performed steps. For convenience. also includes several exemplary lists or displays which may be employed or generated by the method .

The method begins with step . Step entails establishing or configuring a list the Expected Item List which lists items that are to be stored or transported in the container . In different embodiments step may be implemented in different ways including for example and without limitation alternate paths .A or .B 

In either case step .A entails creating or editing the expected item list . The list contains data sufficient to identify the items which are expected to be in the container as those items would be sensed or detected by the sensors of the BIRD .C associated with the container .

In an embodiment associated with the sensor parameters for each item is also descriptive text for each item. The exemplary expected item list includes a list of items which are associated with RFID tags each RFID tag having an associated serial number. Persons skilled in the relevant arts will recognize that an actual tag serial number would be a more extended string than the single letter alphanumeric strings shown. In the expected item list each RFID tag is associated with a text string descriptive of an item . For example RFID tag X is associated with a writing tablet RFID tag Y is associated with a bowling shirt and RFID tags Z and W are associated with a calculator and a pen respectively.

The list also includes BIRDed items which are expected to be stored and or transported in the container item . For purposes of illustration the items are identified by label numbers only . . persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in application descriptive labels would be employed possibly along with suitable internal BIRD identification numbers or other internal BIRD IDs.

In step .B. the authorized user AU places in the container the items which are expected to be carried in the container . Typically step .B. would be accomplished in the normal course of placing items in the container prior to transport. For example the authorized user AU places the items in a briefcase prior to the user taking the briefcase on a trip. Similarly items may be placed in containers such as a suitcase or backpack prior to taking the suitcase or the backpack on a trip.

In step .B. the authorized user AU initiates a contents scan of the container by the integrated BIRD .C . The BIRD .C has associated integrated sensors .IS such as for example pocket sensors .IS.P or an RFID interrogator .RFID along with communications capabilities suitable for BIRD to BIRD communications. These sensors and communications capabilities are configured to determine the items held within the container . The BIRD .C performs the scan of the container to generate the list of found items stored within.

In an embodiment the items scanned may contain not only an identification code such as RFID code but the RFID tags associated with the items may also contain a text description of the item. Similarly BIRDed items may have their own stored descriptive names or labels. In an alternative embodiment the authorized user AU separately uses a list editor already described above to edit a list of tags or to edit a list of other identifying parameters for each item in order to associate text descriptions with each item in the container .

Step which follow step entails general usage of the container and the items within by a user. Typically if the container is normally closed or sealed when in transit the user will close the container such as closing a briefcase and latching the cover closed or closing a suitcase or a backpack by closing a zipper or similar closure elements associated with the container . Typically the user will carry or otherwise move the container to a destination for example by carrying it rolling it about if the container is wheeled or carrying it on the authorized user s back. In the course of use the container may be opened or closed as needed and items may be removed and returned as needed.

At step the authorized user AU has finished using the container and the items within for example at the completion of a business meeting when items are returned to a briefcase or at the end of a vacation when packing up the luggage and the user is planning to move to another destination. The authorized user AU wishes to ascertain that all the items which were originally in the container are still in the container . In other words the user wishes to ascertain that no items are being left behind and possibly that no additional items have been inadvertently placed in the container.

As initiated by the user the container s BIRD .C performs another scan of the interior container as well as possibly a scan of areas exterior to the container . For example the container s BIRD .C may scan the interior of the container using an RFID interrogator scan and the BIRD .C may also scan an area or space surrounding the container again using an RFID scanner .RFID . BIRD to BIRD communications may also be employed for interior and exterior scans for BIRDed items . The BIRD .C may also employ other sensing means such as the testing whether certain items are present in pockets in the container or detecting items in the container or surrounding the container by an interior optical scan within image matching protocols.

In an alternative embodiment the container may be configured to automatically initiate scans of items based on any of several criteria such as when the container is opened or closed or at scheduled time intervals or based on other criteria or triggers.

The result of step is a list of found items . The found items list indicates which items are found inside the container and which items are found outside the container .

In step the BIRD .C compares the found items list with the expected items list . The BIRD .C determines which items in the expected items list are not present in the found items list . The BIRD .C also determines which items in the found items list are present in that list but are not in the expected items list . These latter items may be items which may have been inadvertently packed away or may be new items that should be added to a revised or amended expected items list .

In step and based on the results of the comparison step the BIRD .C generates the contents report which includes discrepancies between the found items and the expected items list . An exemplary report is shown in . Based on the report the user of the container can determine which items may need to be found that are not present in the container as well as which items have been added to the container and whether those items should be present or not. Additional operations not shown may be available to the user such as updating the expected items list or generating a new alternative list to reflect the current contents of the container .

In an embodiment a wallet .W viewed as a container item may employ its integrated BIRD elements .C for purposes of tracking other items which should be contained within the wallet. These wallet s BIRD or BIRD elements .C which are integrated into the structure of the wallet .W but are not shown in detail in the figure may include elements previously discussed throughout this document a processor a memory a clock calendar timer various general environmental sensors for sensing wallet location motion light exposure surface pressure on the wallet etc. a bus communications elements local signaling one or more batteries item specific sensors .IS and other elements discussed in conjunction with various BIRD embodiments throughout this document. In an embodiment the wallet s sensors may include an RFID interrogator .RFID .

In an alternative embodiment some or all of the sensors typically pertaining to external environmental sensing may be omitted and mainly or only internal sensors .IS for internal item location and or an RFID interrogator .RFID may be employed.

As with the briefcase .B discussed above in conjunction with the wallet .W may be configured with a list of credit cards .CrC and other items which are expected to be in the wallet. The wallet may then use the RFID interrogator .RFID to determine if the RFID tagged items .RFID are in fact present in the wallet . In an embodiment if the wallet lacks a sufficiently large built in user interface for such detailed configuration the wallet may be configured via a configuration computer or cell phone .

In an embodiment the wallet .W may have a flexible mesh RF shielding similar to that on the briefcase .B to help distinguish RFID responses from items .RFID tucked into the wallet versus RFID responses from items .RFID which are nearby but not suitably tucked into the wallet.

Suitable usage expectations may be configured to determine whether the usage of pockets clasps and possibly other wallet elements is consistent and whether or not the usage is appropriate for the current date time of day location and so forth. For example the wallet .W may be configured to signal an alert if the wallet is closed by a user when certain pockets which are expected to contain items do not contain items or for example do not contain expected credit cards or bank cards.

In an embodiment a photoelectric material not shown on the surface of the wallet .W may be employed to provide electricity both for battery charging and to supplement the battery in case the wallet is misplaced for an extended period of time. In an embodiment a piezoelectric material not shown may be embedded in the wallet .W to generate electricity from pressure applied by the human body as for example when the wallet is in a user s pocket . This may be used both to charge and supplement the battery . Similar sensors and similar sensor data processing analysis are applicable for such items as purse belts and utility belts which are used by a person to carry smaller items about.

As with other container items discussed above the integrated BIRD or BIRD elements .C may include for example and without limitation a processor a memory a clock calendar timer various general environmental sensors for sensing backpack location motion light exposure etc. a bus communications elements local signaling one or more batteries item specific sensors .IS and other elements discussed in conjunction with various figures in this document. In an alternative embodiment some or all of the sensors typically pertaining to external environmental sensing may be omitted and mainly or only internal sensors .IS for internal item location may be employed.

In an embodiment and in its role as a container item the backpack .Bkpk may also employ a variety of sensors to detect the presence of items stored or meant to be stored within the backpack .Bkpk . The sensing means and methods including i pocket or pouch sensors ii RFID sensing and iii BIRD to BIRD communications may be the same or substantially similar to that discussed above in conjunctions with the exemplary briefcase .B and exemplary wallet .W see .

The motion sensor .M and the location sensor .L may both be put to use for purposes described in detail elsewhere in this document for example to determine if the backpack .Bkpk is lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. . In addition however the motion sensor .M and location sensor .L may also be employed possibly along with other sensors to determine a status of a hiker who is using the backpack .Bkpk . The sensors may help determine if the hiker is maintaining an expected pace if the hiker is following an expected route if the hiker appears to be staying in one place for a longer than expected time etc.

Suitable BIRD logic and usage expectations may be employed to determine if the backpack .Bkpk is carrying expecting items .Act .RIFD as well as determining if there is any anomaly or problem for the authorized user AU of the backpack .Bkpk .

Disclosed throughout much of this document are items which are typically small enough and or light enough to be either handheld carried on a person or easily propelled by an un aided person pulling pushing on or lifting the item in the case of for example luggage .LG or a stroller .H . Typically such items are smaller than or no larger than and also typically lighter than the physical size weight of a person who may carry or use the item . For convenience such items may be referred to as person scaled items . . As also discussed throughout this document such items . may be readily displaced . meaning the items may be lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. stolen .. or be in a states of wandering .. with their authorized owners. A BIRD as discussed throughout this document is a technology which may be employed to help such person scaled items . to self assess as either being extant . or displaced . .

Most of the exemplary items shown in above would be representative of person scaled items . though the baby carriage .H may encroach upon a reasonable size limit and some power saws .L may similarly tax the size and or weight limit . Similarly many portable active items .Act such as cell phones .Act.CP and laptop tablet computers .Act.LC would also be representative of person scaled items . .

As further discussed above some person scaled items . such as purses .P wallets .W briefcases .B and similar items may also be viewed as personal item transport containers or simply container items . Such container items are designed for containing and transporting other smaller items typically person scaled items . . Such container items may be configured with a BIRD which in an embodiment is capable of identifying items . which should be present in the container but are not present and equally of identifying items . which may in fact be present in the container but were not expected to be present.

There exist some technologies which share some significant characteristics with person scaled items . as previously discussed above throughout this document but which also differ in some significant ways. In particular there are large scale motorized transportation technologies .Tr such as automobiles motorcycles trucks and buses and even airplanes and boats which share some significant qualities with person scaled items . as already discussed but which differ in important ways as well.

Illustrated in is a motorized transportation technology .Tr specifically an automobile .Tr.A which may also be viewed as a container item .

The automobile .Tr.A differs from the person scaled items . discussed herein in the very obvious sense that it is certainly not hand held nor is it transportable on a person. Further and apart from the rare event of laboriously pushing a stalled vehicle to the side of the road the automobile .Tr.A is generally not pushed or pulled by a person. To the contrary it is a person who would sit within an automobile .Tr.A and employ the automobile .Tr.A for purposes of personal transport both for the person and for items the person wishes to retain. Even the smallest motorized transportation technology .Tr for example a motor scooter generally has the a size and weight which is of approximately the same scale as a human being. Typically a motorized transportation technology .Tr is much larger and much more massive than a person.

In an embodiment transport vehicles .Tr may be viewed as personal item transport containers . As illustrated in a car s trunk functions as a transport container for person scaled items . . Other compartments within the vehicle .Tr.A may also be viewed as transport containers including the overall passenger compartment not shown in the figure and the glove compartment also not illustrated in the figure .

The automobile .Tr.A is illustrated with a BIRD .C within the container space of the trunk but it will be understood that this is for convenience of illustration only. Elements of a BIRD .C may be distributed throughout the vehicle .Tr.A including having appropriate sensors in or near the container spaces. The BIRD .C may be configured to use various kinds of sensors .RFID .C and communications elements in order to monitor and communicate with BIRDed items and RFID tagged items .RFID .

As with other container items discussed above the automobile s BIRD .C may be configured to store one or more lists of expected items and to determine if those expected items are or are not present when they should be. Similarly the BIRD .C may also detect the presence of BIRDed items and or RFID tagged items .RFID which are present when they should not be. Optical sensing and item recognition via one or more cameras .C not shown in the figure may extend the capability to identify items which lack both BIRDs and RFID tags .

There are other distinctions as well between transport vehicles .TR and person scaled items . with respect to ways in which a motorized transportation vehicle .Tr may be extant . or displaced . . Unlike smaller items . which can often slip readily out of view or out of sight or be hidden under other items or papers etc. transportation vehicles .Tr are not so readily lost from direct line of sight though on occasion and from certain angles they may be hidden from view behind larger vehicles .

Generally however an automobile .Tr.A may certainly be extant . that is present when and where it is expected to be at a given time. Further an automobile .Tr.A may also be displaced . in some respects as previously discussed but not in other respects.

Many of the elements of BIRD technology already discussed above may be employed in conjunction with an automobile .Tr.A . In particular a BIRD associated with an automobile may be provided with usage expectations which are consistent with the authorized user s normal usage of the vehicle. In the event that the vehicle is stolen the BIRD may be able to identify the stolen status and send appropriate signal to the authorized user AU and or appropriate authorities.

In conventional English terminology an automobile is sometimes said to be lost if for example a driver has parked their car and then later forgotten where the vehicle is located. However loss as applied to an automobile tends to blur or merge into the concept of misplaced as used elsewhere herein.

The term lost as used herein typically means that a person scaled item . has been left behind at some location .L which is not a home base location .HB and often may be identified only as possibly being broadly within the authorized user s daily life location s .DL . Misplaced as used herein typically refers to an person scaled item . which has been left lying around someplace within a home base location .HB .

In the sense in which people typically speak of losing an automobile .Tr.A a typical instance is a situation where the automobile has been parked somewhere in a large parking lot and the authorized user AU has forgotten exactly where in the lot the car was parked. The general storage or sitting location of the vehicle .Tr.A is known it s somewhere in the lot or perhaps parked on one of a few local streets but the more specific location needed for the driver to get to the vehicle is not known.

Thus what might be conventionally termed a lost car may in the present parlance be better referred to as a misplaced car .Tr.A . Whichever parlance is employed the following will be apparent to persons skilled in the art If a car .Tr.A is equipped with a BIRD suitable BIRD logic for identifying the BIRDed car as possibly lost misplaced may need to be modified in some respects from the parallel BIRD logic for lost .. or misplaced .. person scaled items .Tr.A .

For example In an embodiment a BIRD associated with small items . is generally configured to self assess as being lost .. or misplaced .. even if the authorized user AU has not yet noticed the absence of the item . . By contrast a BIRD associated with a transport vehicle .Tr may in informal language have a higher threshold of patience waiting longer before it would assess itself as being lost misplaced .. .. . The BIRD logic may be configured to assume that the authorized user AU will quickly notice if he or she has lost their vehicle.

In an embodiment an automobile s BIRD as an element of a larger item team may be configured to assist in the event that the authorized user AU identifies his or her automobile .Tr.A as being lost misplaced in a parking facility or on the nearby streets and so on . In particular the authorized user AU may send a signal possibly in the form of a conventional cellular phone call from his or her cell phone .Act.CP to the car .Tr.A . The automobile s BIRD may be configured to then report its current specific location .L to the cell phone .Act.CP the mapping features of the cell phone .Act.CP may then guide the authorized user AU to the vehicle .Tr.A .

An automobile .Tr.A is also unlikely to be casually or inadvertently misappropriated. Recall that misappropriated typically refers to a case where a friend or family member or other associate of the authorized user AU has inadvertently picked up an item and carried it away. People do not typically drive away a friend s car inadvertently. And even a family member including teenagers should typically know better than to accidentally drive off with mom or dad s car.

However with suitable iteMetrics and matching interior sensors the automobile .Tr.A may be able to distinguish various authorized users AU including distinguishing a primary driver such as a parent from borrowing drives such as teenagers . Should a borrower drive off with a parental car the BIRD within the automobile .Tr.A may be able to identify the driver and provide suitable responses such as for example alerting the parents that the automobile .Tr.A has been borrowed .. and possibly reporting on driving activity and locations.

Automobiles .Tr.A unfortunately may certainly be stolen just a smaller items may be. BIRD logic and BIRD song as well as corresponding usage expectations for addressing automobile theft may be substantially similar to that for smaller items . with some suitable adaptations. For example the morphIteMetrics for distinguishing an authorized driver from an unauthorized driver may take into account authorized driver height and weight as measured by sensors in the passenger compartment and possibly also employ direct facial recognition psyIteMetrics may take into account numerous aspects of an authorized user s style of driving including typical velocities accelerations and other measurable definable elements of driving behavior. At the same time the overall usage expectations may include data pertaining to when and where the automobile .Tr.A is expected to be parked or to be in transit that is typical detection contexts and also general daily life locations .DL for the vehicle home base locations .HB for the vehicle and typical commuting routes .CR for the automobile .Tr.A .

In the event that an automobile s BIRD flags a possible theft of the vehicle the BIRD may be configured to demand suitable user authentication. For example in an embodiment the BIRD may first demand a vocal password authentication and possibly employ voice print identification as well. Suitable BIRD song for theft may include standard notifications messages to the authorized user AU and to appropriate authorities. However BIRD song may include further adaptations such as limiting the speed of the automobile .Tr.A or preventing refueling of the automobile .Tr.A . In an embodiment BIRD song may determine a driving context in order to determine that minimum safe speed for the vehicle which may vary for example between a highway and local roads . In an embodiment the BIRD may be configured to sound an alarm or set off lights flashing to notify other nearby drivers and authorities of the stolen vehicle. Other such provisions may be provided as well.

An automobile .Tr.A is unlikely to be wandering .. in the sense previously defined in this document. Wandering .. recall entails inadvertently carrying an item outside of authorized bounds such as removing an item by accident from the workplace for example because the item has been forgotten in the authorized user s pocket purse or briefcase . One rarely if ever drives a car without realizing that one has actually in fact driven the car.

The use of item specific sensors .IS with sports equipment has multiple benefits which include for example and without limitation 

Additional fine grained location sensors .IS.FGL not shown may be employed and be worn by the tennis player on his or her shirt or belt or embedded with the player s shoes. A combination of such sensors .IS.FGL enables the tennis player with suitable computer support to recreate in great detail the player s movement on the court. Such location sensors would be useful for visual graphical reconstruction and analysis of the tennis player s game and may supplement any direct video recordings of the game.

Since the weight of a tennis racquet .R.TR itself is clearly important with light weight usually being preferred preferred embodiments of sensors .IS and other BIRD components for the racquet will typically employ extremely lightweight albeit possibly more expensive components.

In an embodiment and as noted above a photoelectric material not shown on the surface of the racquet .R.TR may be employed to provide electricity for the BIRD. This may permit the battery in the racquet to be removed during game play reducing weight.

The illustration and discussion of a tennis racquet .R.TR is exemplary only and should not be construed in any way as limiting. BIRDs with suitable item specific sensors .IS may be integrated into other sporting equipment including for example and without limitation Hockey sticks skates ice skates and roller skates baseball bats football helmets and pads athletic shoes in general and even into balls such as tennis balls basketballs baseballs footballs and similar.

The integration of BIRD elements into sporting goods .R requires careful structural design consideration to maintain light weight overall and further to maintain careful balance and equal or at least symmetric distribution of BIRD element weight throughout the item .R .

As any parent recognizes among those items most at risk of being found in an anomalous state are those smallish loud hungry endlessly demanding sometimes joyful sometimes irritable organic items known as children. The BIRD is not a sufficiently adaptable technology to alleviate all such anomalous states of a child and what fun would parenting be if it was but a BIRD has its child specific applications in some contexts.

It is well known that children should not be left in a car unattended particularly if the temperatures are very hot or very cold outside since a child can either suffer from heat or cold exposure. However there are documented occasions when a parent has left a child alone in a car seat in a parked car in some cases children have died as a consequence. Typically this is actually an accident a parent removes multiple bags of groceries from a car and gets so engrossed in putting away the groceries they forget the child. Incredibly there have also been instances where a parent has actually left a child seat with the child strapped in on the roof or trunk of a car and then driven off with the undoubtedly mystified child still on top of the car.

Fortunately where human intelligence fails or possibly was never present to begin with a microprocessor can sometimes fill the void.

In an embodiment the BIRD s sensors may also include a buckle sensor .BU configured to determine if the child seat belt buckle is fastened one or more seat pressure sensor s .SP specifically situated and configured to detect the weight of a child in the child seat and a wind velocity pressure sensor .WV P .

In operation either or both of the pressure sensor s .SP and the buckle sensor .BU are configured with suitable support from the processor and other BIRD elements to determine if a child is extant . in the child seat .H.CSS . Additional data may be provided via the audio sensor .AC which may detect typical sounds a child might make. Optical sensor recognition or other means of identifying the presence of the child in the seat .H.CSS may be employed as well.

Usage expectations are configured to determine the presence of a child via the sensors and further to analyze various environmental conditions 

The child seat .H.CSS may be part of an item team which includes the car .Tr.A see . In an embodiment the BIRD may be configured so that upon determination of the potential danger to the child the BIRD can send a signal to automatically unlock the car doors. In an embodiment the BIRD may be configured so that upon determination of the potential danger to the child the BIRD can activate the car s heating or cooling system as appropriate.

With increasing miniaturization of components many items which are small or compact readily lend themselves to the incorporation of BIRD technology embedded into their structure. Hardware elements necessary to implement BIRD technology can readily be embedded in the frame of eyeglasses .S.G . This is suggested in with the BIRD icon associated with the glasses shown in the figure. Eyeglasses .S.G lend themselves to additional customizations as well.

Additional Means Methods of Self Assessment for Items Subject to Being Covered Obstructed or Otherwise Hidden by Other Physical Objects

Eyeglasses .S.G are a type of item which readily lend themselves to being set down on a table or desk or similar. In addition eyeglasses .S.G tend to be set down with a fairly predictable or reliable spatial orientation. For example if a user removes his or her glasses but keeps them open the glasses are mostly likely to be set down on a table in one of two orientations either with the lower part of the frame .L resting on the table or the upper part of the frame .U resting on the table.

Eyeglasses .S.G along with other items which may be set on a table also unfortunately lend themselves to getting lost or misplaced by being covered with other items or objects. For example a near sighted user may wear glasses .S.G while reading a newspaper or magazine the reader may get up to take a break from reading setting down the glasses .S.G and then setting the newspaper or magazine on top of the glasses. If enough time passes then when the user later searches for their glasses .S.G he or she has forgotten that the glasses .S.G are under the newspaper magazine . This effectively renders the glasses .S.G as being misplaced if in the home or a home base location .HB or lost if the glasses are left behind outside a home base location .HB for example at some public facility .

In an embodiment the eyeglasses .S.G are configured to determine when they are covered by another object such as a newspaper or magazine. illustrates in a cross sectional perspective view an enlarged portion of the eyeglass frame . In an embodiment the frame portion has on top a light emitting source such as a photodiode which can emit light and also has on top a photodetector .Opt such as a photoresistor or photocell.

In an embodiment the light emitting source and the photodetector .Opt are placed so that the photodetector ordinarily is not exposed to light from the light emitting source . For example the light emitting source and the photodetector .Opt may be substantially flush with the upper surface of the frame .U or slightly recessed into the upper surface .U other configurations may be employed as well. 

However if the glasses .S.G are covered with a newspaper or magazine illustrated in inset and not drawn to scale the light from the light emitting source reflects off of the paper or magazine the reflected light is detected by the photodetector .Opt . BIRD logic and or usage expectations configure the BIRD to determine that the eyeglasses .S.G are covered. Possibly in combination with other usage criteria for example that the eyeglasses have been covered for a certain amount of time etc. this triggers the BIRD to issue an alert or message to the user.

In an embodiment the light emitting source and photodetector .Opt may be configured to emit detect light of a specified frequency. In an embodiment the specified frequency may be a frequency which is not visible to the user such as an infrared frequency. In an embodiment the light emitting source may be configured to emit the light in a specific pattern such as an on off pattern with a specified timing so that the photodetector .Opt in combination with BIRD logic and or usage expectations knows to look for the specified light pattern. In an embodiment and to conserve power the light emitting source may only begin to emit light after the eyeglasses .S.G have been stationary .Stat for longer than a stationary limit .

In an embodiment not illustrated two photodetectors may be employed. A first photodetector .Opt may be positioned on the frame to be proximate to the light emitting source while a second photodetector .Opt may be positioned on the frame to be more remote from the light emitting source . The second remote photodetector .Opt may be used to determine that overall light received at the glasses has been reduced due to a newspaper magazine etc. covering the glasses while the first proximate photodetector .Opt detects the reflected light from the local light emitting source . The contrast in light detection states between the two photodetectors .Opt may aid the BIRD logic in determining the covered state of the eyeglasses .S.G .

In an alternative embodiment the light emitting source and or photodetector .Opt may have placements on the frame other than or in addition to the placements shown in the figure. For example the light emitting source and or photodetector .Opt may be placed on the bottom of the frame L or one or both sides of the frame .S . In an embodiment additional or alternative means such as suitably placed surface pressure sensors .SP not shown in this figure may be used to determine when the eyeglasses .S.G are covered.

In an embodiment eye glasses .S.G are equipped with a miniaturized camera .C or video camera .V . The camera .C V is configured to continually capture images of the scene out in front of the glasses .S.G essentially capturing a video diary of everything seen by the authorized user AU eyeglass wearer for as long as the glasses are worn. In an embodiment if each captured image is stored as a JPEG file of 200 Kbytes and if an image is captured just once every five seconds then images for a continuous 18 hours of eye glass use could be stored in just 2.6 Mbytes of memory an amount of memory which can be readily stored in the frame of a pair of glasses. In an alternative embodiment if each image is stored using 0.5 Mbytes per image allowing either a larger viewing area and or higher image resolution and if an image is captured once every second the storage requirement for a continuous 18 hours of eye glass use still comes to only 13.3 Mbytes. Lower or higher image capture sizes and frame rates may be envisioned as well no pun s intended .

In an embodiment the captured images may be downloaded from the eyeglasses to a configuration computer or other processing device. In an embodiment the configuration computer or other processing device is configured with image processing software capable of comparing images of a given item even when the item is viewed from different angles.

In the course of day a user may lose an item other than the glasses .S.G setting it down and forgetting where the item was placed. If the item lacks associated BIRD technology or if the BIRD associated with the item for some reason fails to flag the item as lost and aid in the item s recovery the daily video diary from the glasses may assist in lost item recovery through a process summarized here. In an embodiment 

 i The user downloads from their eyeglasses .S.G to the configuration computer the daily video diary 

 ii The user employs video viewing software on the configuration computer to scan through the video diary identifying the last time and place the lost item was seen. This may aid the user in tracking down and recovering the lost item .

 i The user downloads from their eyeglasses .S.G to the configuration computer the daily video diary 

 ii The user activates suitably configured image processing and comparison software for ease of exposition refer to this software are Lost Item Finder on the configuration computer .

 iii Using the Lost Item Finder software the user opens an image file containing an image of the lost item or some similar item. In an embodiment the Lost Item Finder software may contain a library of still images of common items. For example if the user has lost a cell phone .Act.CP the Lost Item Finder software may already contain images of well known cell phones. The user may select a cell phone image.

 iv The Lost Item Finder software searches through the daily video diary and identifies the last frame or frames where the lost item was seen.

 v The Lost Item Finder software identifies the time that the lost item was last scene and further presents to the user the image of the lost item in the context where it was last seen. This may aid the user in tracking down and recovering the lost item.

Figures and discussion throughout this document address the configuration operations and usage of a BIRD . In an embodiment BIRDs broadly come in four forms 

All four types of BIRDs will have broad design similarities in terms of essential functional units and operational components. However implementation details for example processor type speed and power amount of memory required specific sensor choices choices of ports local signaling and remote transceivers etc. may vary.

In an embodiment a BIRD will have built in BIRD logic for defining recognizing analyzing and interpreting environmental data as extant normal . . or displaced anomalous . . . Substantial response logic signaling and or reporting that is BIRD song will be built in as well.

BIRDs may also be designed with various default options for the types of items they might attached to and default types of expected normal usage.

For example an Office BIRD may be intended or targeted for use by typical office workers and also be intended for attachment to typical consumer items carried on a person such as keys .K wallets .W purses .P and possibly active items such as cell phones .Act.CP . Such an Office BIRD may include options for the user to select one of these items and others as the target item for attachment. The Office BIRD may also come preconfigured with typical usage expectations based on an assumption of say 9 to 5 office hours a 45 minute commute to the office by car and standard workdays at work with standard weekends and holidays off. Specific default usage expectations for keys .K wallets .W etc. may be based on studies or surveys that have been conducted with test users of the BIRD technology. Such profiles will reflect that the users for example used their keys for a given percentage of the day kept their keys in the purses or pockets for the rest of the day or otherwise reflect how the test users naturally put their items to use. In an embodiment such default user profiles may even be fine tuned according to certain standard user profile elements such as age gender and even personality type based for example on Myers Briggs profiles or similar .

A purchaser of a BIRD that is a consumer who uses a BIRD may create their own item profiles that is usage expectations for their items from scratch using the various exemplary methods discussed above see for examples and other figures throughout this document and other methods which may be envisioned as well. Alternatively a user may adopt the factory provided default item profiles and modify them for their personal needs again through the application of the various exemplary methods discussed above. In either case the user will be provided with suitable software and interfaces which may run on the BIRD and or on a configuration computer to suitably adapt a BIRD to their particular needs.

Some of the configuration methods discussed above require the authorized user AU to let the BIRD learn about normal item usage during a configuration time period which may for example run several days or several weeks. The authorized user AU will typically configure a BIRD during this initial training period during which time it will be recommended that the authorized user AU make a careful effort to not lose or misplace an item and equally to keep a watch on the item to ensure that it is not stolen or misappropriated.

In the event that the item is lost or misplaced during the configuration time the software provided with the BIRD may be configured to allow for the editing out that is the redaction or cutting of sensor data collected by the BIRD during the time it was lost or misplaced. Alternatively the software may provide a means for the user to identify that time period as one in which the item was lost .. or misplaced .. in that event the BIRD can use the sensor data collected during the anomalous time period to help distinguish between extant normal . . and displaced anomalous . . usage.

In an embodiment a BIRD may be configured to store identification and contact information for the BIRDed item . This information may be made accessible to persons other than the authorized user AU in the event that the BIRDed item is lost .. and then found by a Good Samaritan. In an embodiment the BIRD may be configured with a variety of access control features for the identification and contact information.

For example in an embodiment the BIRD may be configured so that full contact information may only be accessible to authorities such as the police with specialized access codes for BIRDs .

In an embodiment a BIRD may be configured to place phone calls via the cell phone network or to send e mails over the internet or to make other network connections. The BIRD may be further configured so that a good Samaritan upon finding the BIRDed item may be able to initiate a BIRD to authorized user phone call or e mail or similar network contact without however actually revealing any identification or contact information to the Good Samaritan.

Throughout the discussion above exemplary uses of a BIRD to self identify an associated item which is in an undesired state have largely focused on identifying the item as being displaced . that is lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. . However a BIRD may be used to identify other anomalous item states as well.

In general terms a BIRD may be configured to identify an associated item as being in other undesirable states in addition to or apart from being lost .. misplaced .. misappropriated .. wandering .. or stolen .. using methods the same or substantially similar to those already identified above.

In an embodiment an authorized user AU or system administrator first identifies a category of condition which the user administrator considers to be anomalous . for the item. The anomaly possibility may be associated with a particular user a particular detection context typically a given location and or an indicated time frame . Exemplary possible anomalies are described immediately below. The authorized user ALT system administrator then identifies or predicts particular sensed environmental conditions and or item states which can be detected via the BIRD s sensors and which may be indicative of the anomaly. The states or conditions are programmed into the BIRD as usage expectations . The authorized user AU or administrator associates appropriate BIRD logic signal or reports with the usage expectations .

In an embodiment default usage expectations may be factory programmed into the BIRD but may be edited or modified by the authorized user AU or system administrator.

In an alternative embodiment the BIRD may be trained or configured to recognize anomalous conditions by deliberately exposing the BIRDed item to those conditions during a training period. The authorized user AU or system administrator again configures the BIRD with appropriate signal or reports that are to be issued in response to the trained anomalous states . .

In an embodiment a BIRD may be configured to detect only anomalous item states . other than the state of an item being displaced . lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen . In an alternative embodiment a BIRD can serve dual or multiple uses being configured to detect displaced item states . but also being configured to detect additional anomalous item states . as well.

A BIRD may be configured to determine that even if its associated item is likely extant . rather than displaced . the item is still being used in a way which is possibly anomalous . . This may be useful in various contexts and for various applications including situations in secure threat charged environments.

For example police officers and prison guards may carry batons. A baton may be used at times to subdue and or defend against prisoners or other hostile persons. In an embodiment a baton with an embedded integrated BIRD can detect motions of the baton indicative of the baton being put to use such as abrupt and rapid swinging motions and other motions which may be signatures of a baton for use in physical conflict defense. The baton with integrated BIRD may be configured to emit an alarm signal immediately alerting other nearby officers or guards that a colleague may be in danger. The baton with integrated BIRD may also be configured to transmit an emergency report to an emergency control center .

In an embodiment the baton may include an audio sensor .AC AI and or image sensor .C .V to convey to the emergency control center environmental data for the baton. In an embodiment the baton s BIRD may have iteMetric training to recognize the particular style of emergency use of the baton associated with the baton s authorized user AU that is a style or pattern of swinging or other offensive defensive movements . In the event the baton is acquired and used by an unauthorized user UU the BIRD may be able to identify the anomalous usage style that is anomalous style of swinging or other offensive defensive motions of the unauthorized user UU further signaling that the authorized user AU may have lost control of the baton.

For another example a power tool such as a chain saw or circular saw may also be equipped with embedded integrated BIRDs . A usage expectation for the saw may indicated that if i the saw is active that is the blade is in motion but ii the saw as a whole is motionless for more than a designated period of time this may indicate an anomalous state . . For example the active saw may have been left unattended posing a possible danger to any persons such as children who may be nearby. Or the user of the saw may have been injured by the saw and is incapacitated. In either event the saw may issue appropriate signal and messages .

Other tool appropriate usage expectations may be defined for other types of tools both manual tools and hand held. Analogous safety considerations and other considerations may apply to defining or specifying usage expectations for a wide variety of other household and industrial items with associated BIRDs including for example and without limitation kitchen appliances cleaning tools and appliances and yard tools and appliances.

A BIRD may be configured to determine if an item is in a threatening hostile or unsuitable environment which may damage the BIRD and its associated item or which may be dangerous to the person possessing the item . This may be particularly useful for items which are used in dangerous exploratory industrial or security contexts where an authorized user AU may be continually exposed to environmental risks.

For example a person working in a known dangerous environment may have a BIRD configured to alert the authorized user AU if the user wanders in a zone or region known to be particularly dangerous. In a mining environment or in a chemical factory a BIRD may be configured to report if known dangerous chemicals or vapors are detected beyond an acceptable concentration.

An authorized user AU may be a police officer. The officer may have multiple items with multiple BIRDs all having a camera .C . One or more of the BIRDs may in normal use be exposed to light that is not hidden within a pocket or similar . In that event the BIRDs either alone or in cooperation as an item team may be configured to recognize hostile persons for example based on detection of guns or knives in hand detection of known gang tattoos or clothing signatures or similar criteria. In this way one or more BIRDs may provide a police officer with electronic eyes behind their heads and backs increasing police officer safety. If a police officer or other law enforcement person is engaged in pursuit of a specific known felon or suspect the BIRDs may be programmed for facial recognition of the particular individual being sought. Other forms of recognition such as sound and voice recognition may be employed as well.

In regions prone to earthquakes a BIRD s processor may be programmed to use data from the motion sensor .M and or vibration sensor .B to provide early warning detection of a possible earthquake. If authorized by the BIRD s authorized user AU a BIRD may participate as part of a wide area team of BIRDs which share motion and vibration data creating a wide area early warning system for earthquakes.

The present document is entitled System And Method For Item Self Assessment As Being Extant Or Displaced. Consistent with the title discussion above has generally been directed towards embodiments wherein a BIRD which is substantially collocated with an item enables the BIRDed item to self assess its state as extant borrowed normal . .. . or as displaced . lost misplaced misappropriated wandering or stolen or otherwise being in an anomalous state . . The self assessment capability is generally associated with the on board processor of the BIRD which can analyze the appropriate sensor data to make the appropriate extant normal . . vs. displaced anomalous . . assessments.

However in an alternative embodiment a BIRD may rely in part or in whole on shared cloud based distributed and or delegated processing to arrive at appropriate extant normal . . vs. displaced anomalous . . assessments.

In an embodiment a BIRD may employ remote communications transceivers to communicate data with other local BIRDS for example other members of an item team or with remote data processing units centers . The BIRD may share off load or delegate to processors associated with an item team or to processors associated with remote data processing centers some or all tasks associated with extant normal . . vs. displaced anomalous . . determinations. The BIRD may then receive back from the remote processor s conclusory data or additional support for its local extant normal . . vs. displaced anomalous . . assessments. Similarly as a member of an item team the BIRD may support similar assessments by other members of the item team .

The assessment methods employed by remote processors may be the same or substantially similar to those disclosed throughout this application. However the addition of further processors may enable or support faster or more detailed processing of some data. For example various iteMetric determinations such as facial recognition or user identity assessments based on motion may be enhanced with the support of remote processing.

In an embodiment remote data processing or other off loaded data processing is not fully equivalent to local data processing by the BIRD s on board processor even if the item state evaluation methods are the same or substantially similar. For example to be effective remote data processing of BIRD sensor data may require substantially sustained wireless communications between the BIRD and the remote data processing units centers and or item team members . Such sustained wireless communications may place a greater drain on the BIRD s battery reducing the overall field life of the battery .

Additionally the requirement for sustained wireless communications may result in the BIRDed item becoming more vulnerable to operational failure if the BIRDed item is in an environment which isolates the BIRD from wireless communications. The risk of compromise of item data privacy may be an additional undesirable aspect of off loaded remote and or cloud based processing support for the BIRD . Even the fact of announcing its presence in an environment via the broadcast of RF signals may in some contexts be an undesirable outcome of off loaded remote and or cloud based processing support for the BIRD .

There may be other significant practical operation distinctions as well between local processing by the BIRD versus off loaded remote and or cloud based processing.

In an embodiment the BIRD may be configured to rely principally upon its local process but may also be configured under special circumstances to seek out additional remote or cloud based processor support when deemed necessary. For example in an embodiment the BIRDed item upon making a determination based on various factors that it may be displaced . may then seek remote processing support for such tasks as signal processing involved in image based identification of the environment or in current user identification.

In an embodiment a LARC or other centralized item support center may receive on going data streams from multiple items .

In an exemplary application data servers at the LARC may receive data streams from multiple items within a circumscribed geographic area all indicative of some possibility that the items may have been removed from their authorized owners. The LARC may make an assessment of heightened theft probability. In response the LARC may broadcast to BIRDed items within the geographic area instructions or suggestions to modify threshold parameters for lost item state .. . Similarly the LARC may also broadcast a direct warning to the BIRDed item or via cell phone or similar to authorized owners in the area to be aware of possible item theft.

In another exemplary application data servers at the LARC may receive data streams from multiple items within a very localized area indicative of all the items not being with their authorized owners. Or alternatively the LARC may determine that multiple items in a highly localized area have ceased transmitting their data. Based on such an assessment the LARC may determine a possibility that stolen items are being stored at a specific location and the LARC may advise appropriate authorities to this possibility.

Data privacy as well as data sharing are important considerations for many modern information processing technologies. illustrates an exemplary Item Data Privacy Options dialog box enabling a user of a BIRD to control data privacy for a BIRD and its associated item and user.

A first section of the Item Data Privacy Options dialog box includes options for determining how usage data .U is retained for the BIRD . A second section of the dialog box contains similar data retention options for all members of an item team of which the BIRD is a member. A check box enables the user to determine whether or not item team settings override settings for the individual BIRD .

A third section of the dialog box pertaining to data sharing enables the authorized user AU to determine whether item data or event events collected by the BIRD will be shared with various external services other users and or item teams.

A final sharing section of the dialog box enables the authorized user AU to determine to what extent if any the BIRDed item will participate in or drown in depending on one s values and views of such things the greatest or most greatly irritating first invention of the 21century digital social networking. May the Powers That Created The Universe help us all.

There was a time when if any item was lost it was lost somewhere in the village and perhaps an individual that is a member of the village and the owner of the item could even trust that some other member of the village would find the item and return it to the rightful owner. Social networking meant sitting on the porch with the kin and friends or maybe going to the local church dance. Of course this was back in a time when items were not generally labeled with numbers and for that matter neither were people. It was a time when a tweet was something done by a bird and not a cell phone and for that matter people appreciated birds not for their microprocessors but rather for their morning songs their glorious plumage and their soaring flight. Better still there was enough peace and quiet so that the members of the village could actually hear all the natural bird song without having to go to a park or to a zoo.
