title: Monitoring hosted service usage
abstract: Systems and methods are disclosed which facilitate monitoring of usage information associated with services implemented within a hosted computing environment. Providers of a service, or other authorized parties, may be enabled to associate one or more descriptors with a service. Thereafter, each service instances may be monitored for such descriptors. By correlating usage information of instances with specific descriptors, usage information for the descriptor may be generated. In some instances, usage information corresponding to a descriptor may be utilized to monitor license agreements associated with services including the descriptor. Further, use of descriptors may reduce or eliminate the need to associate services with physical attributes of hosting computing devices, such as media access control addresses.

Generally described computing devices utilize a communication network or a series of communication networks to exchange data. Companies and organizations operate computer networks that interconnect a number of computing devices to support operations or provide services to third parties. The computing systems can be located in a single geographic location or located in multiple distinct geographic locations e.g. interconnected via private or public communication networks . Specifically data centers or data processing centers herein generally referred to as data centers may include a number of interconnected computing systems to provide computing resources to users of the data center. The data centers may be private data centers operated on behalf of an organization or public data centers operated on behalf or for the benefit of the general public.

To facilitate increased utilization of data center resources virtualization technologies allow a single physical computing device to host one or more instances of a virtual machine which virtual machine instance appears to a user of a data center as an independent computing device. With virtualization the host computing device can create maintain delete or otherwise manage virtual machines instances in a dynamic manner. In turn users can request computing resources from the data center including single computing devices or a configuration of networked computing devices and be provided with virtual machine instances that provide the requested computing resources.

An instance of a virtual machine may be configured to provide specific functionality. For example a virtual machine instance may be associated with different combinations of software applications and operating systems or operating system configurations to enable a virtual machine to provide different desired functionalities or to provide similar functionalities more efficiently. One or more virtual machine instance configurations are often contained within a service image which a host computing device may execute in order to implement the desired specific functionality of the virtual machine instance.

In one embodiment the service image when executed by virtual machine instance provides a network accessible service a.k.a. Web service corresponding to the software applications configurations included in the service image. A network accessible service provides specific functionality to other applications and computing resources via a network through application programming interfaces APIs which APIs can also be considered a network accessible service or Web service. For example a service image when executed may provide a network accessible database or mass storage service. Once a service image is created it can be provided to users interested in utilizing the applications and computing resources available from a data center for specific purposes.

Generally a license may be required in order to implement a service image or services included within a service image. These licenses may include various terms of use. In some instances licenses may be for a fixed term e.g. 1 year . In other instances licenses may require a fee for use during a time period e.g. 1 dollar per hour of use . Licenses may contain additional or alternative terms. Further licenses may include combinations of any such terms.

Generally described aspects of the present disclosure relate to monitoring usage of hosted services within rapidly provisioned and released hosted computing environments which may also be referred to as cloud computing environments. Monitoring of services may be used for example to enforce licensing agreements associated with services or to generate usage data indicative of use of the service. Specifically each service may be associated with one or more unique descriptors. Each descriptor may be assigned to the service by a provider of the service or by a party authorized by the provider. Thereafter the descriptor may be permanently or semi permanently associated with the service such that any execution or implementation of the service may be linked to the descriptor. As will be described in more detail below any implementation of the service may therefore be associated with the descriptor. Therefore by polling or recording information associated with the descriptor usage information corresponding to the service may be easily retrieved. For example assume a license specifies a maximum number of simultaneous executions of a service. Further assume that the service is associated with a unique descriptor. In order to ensure compliance with the license a hosted computing environment may monitor the number of running services associated with the descriptor. If the number does not exceed the maximum specified within the license the license is complied with. Further examples of utilization of unique descriptors to generate usage information corresponding to a service will be described in more detail below.

In one embodiment an electronic services marketplace may be provided that permits users to browse descriptions of services such as service images implementing desired functionalities or services. Services may be submitted to and made available from the electronic services marketplace by third party providers or may be submitted to the marketplace by the operator of the marketplace itself. A customer may purchase licenses to implement services e.g. within images containing executable code for providing the services via a hosted computing environment. Once a corresponding license has been acquired through the electronic services marketplace a service may be launched on a hosted computing environment maintained by a third party or on a hosted computing environment associated with the marketplace. As discussed in greater detail below embodiments of the electronic services marketplace may provide one or more unique descriptors for a given service such that utilization of the service may be tracked based on the unique descriptors. For example an operator the electronic services marketplace may monitor unique descriptors of each service implemented within a hosted computing environment in order to ensure the services are in compliance with licensing agreements. As a further example the electronic services marketplace may generate usage data indicative of use of each unique descriptor and provide such usage data to a provider of a corresponding service or an operator of the electronic services marketplace. Usage data may indicate for example the number of customers implementing a service or details regarding implementation such as location timing or duration of implementation of the service.

Specifically providers of services may be enabled to associate a service or a service image containing executable code for providing the service with a unique descriptor which may also be referred to herein as a tag . The electronic services marketplace may require authentication in prior to some interactions with descriptors such that only authorized parties e.g. a provider are enabled to modify or generate descriptors associated with a given service. Thereafter the unique descriptor may be permanently or semi permanently associated with the service such that any implementation of the service is indicated by existence of the unique tag. In one embodiment where a service is contained within a set of executable instructions that may be provisioned to a computing device e.g. a service image a unique descriptor may also be included within the service image. Thus even where multiple copies of a service image are generated from a single initial image the unique descriptor may propagate throughout each service image copy. In another embodiment computer executable instructions associated with individual instances of a service e.g. a virtual data storage device corresponding to the instance may be modified to include a descriptor. In this manner each execution of the instance may include the descriptor regardless of the specific computing device which executes the instance. Association of descriptors to computer executable instructions associated with individual instances may be especially beneficial in cases where services are not implemented within service images. In still more embodiments unique descriptors may be associated with services without requiring modification of computer executable instructions associated with service images or service instances. For example the electronic service marketplace may maintain a database of associations between descriptors and computer executable instructions associated with a service image and or instances of a service. Such an association may be maintained for example based on an identifier of each set of computer executable instructions. Illustratively identifiers of sets of computer executable instructions may include a location of the computer executable instructions within a storage device virtual or physical an identifier of a virtual data store corresponding to a set of computer executable instructions e.g. a volume ID etc. As will be described in more detail below by associating descriptors with sets of computer executable instructions associated with a service image and or a service instance such associations may be maintained regardless of execution of the computer executable instructions. For example associations between a service instance and a descriptor may persist regardless of whether the service instance is started restarted or stopped and regardless of the physical computing device implementing the service instance.

Though generally reference may be made herein to service images services available via the electronic services marketplace may in some embodiments be implemented without use of a service image. For example the electronic services marketplace may include services providing access to applications or data sets either of which may or may not be associated with a service image. In addition the electronic services marketplace may provide access to either partially or wholly human provided services. Illustratively such human provided services may correspond to customer services or to technical support services. As such though reference to service images may be made below the current disclosure should not be limited to facilitating transfer of licenses related to service images but may encompass facilitating transfer of licenses related to any service available from and provided by an electronic services marketplace.

Embodiments discussed below may refer to the users of an electronic services marketplace for service images as customers. However it may be understood that users are not limited to customers but may include owners administrators end users and providers of service images purchased from the electronic services marketplace.

Embodiments of an electronic services marketplace which may offer service images for acquisition may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 248 227 filed on Sep. 29 2011 and entitled ELECTRONIC SERVICES MARKETPLACE FOR HOSTED SERVICE IMAGES the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference the 227 Application . In brief the electronic services marketplace may provide an environment with which both providers and customers of service images can interact via a network. In one embodiment a provider may submit a service image to the electronic services marketplace for inclusion in an electronic catalog. The provider may submit additional information corresponding to the service image that would be useful to a customer such as pricing information usage conditions a location of a provider hosted computing environment on which the service image can be hosted or other information.

Customers may employ a user computing device to browse the electronic catalog by interaction with various user interfaces generated by the electronic services marketplace described in greater detail below. On identifying a service of interest the customer may view details of each service in the electronic catalog such as the information submitted by the provider of the service. In some embodiments a customer may view further information associated with a service such as usage statistics by other marketplace customers of the service reviews by other customers or recommendations for similar or complementary services. Further in some embodiments customers may be enabled to view descriptors associated with a service. In other embodiments such descriptors may not be displayed to customers. Accordingly services may be surfaced to customers in a variety of ways by the services marketplace such as by navigation through a browse tree of services organized by function type size etc. or through recommendations reviews etc.

Once a customer selects a service the customer may purchase or otherwise acquire the service from the services marketplace. In some embodiments the customer may be required to submit payment information for the service prior to launch of the service. After acquisition of the service by the customer the service may be launched and executed by one or more hosted computing environments. The hosted computing environment may be provided by an operator of the services marketplace or may be otherwise associated with the services marketplace. In some embodiments the third party provider of the acquired service may provide a hosted computing environment for the service acquired by the customer via the services marketplace.

During or subsequent to launching of a service the electronic services marketplace may monitor usage of the service to ensure the service is in compliance with any applicable licensing agreements. In traditional computing environments monitoring may be accomplished in part by monitoring an identifying characteristic of a physical computing device implementing a service. For example when a database service is installed on a computing device within a traditional environment a media access control MAC address of the computing device may be recorded and associated with a license to the database. Thereafter any implementation of the database service by the device corresponding to the recorded MAC address may be determined to comply with the license. However implementation of the database service on a device not corresponding to the recorded MAC address may be determined to not be in compliance with the license. Accordingly the number of computing devices enabled to execute the database service would be directly proportional to the number of licenses granted.

However in environments where services are provided via rapidly provisioned and released computing resources e.g. virtual machine instances within a hosted computing environment e.g. a cloud computing environment association of licenses to identifying characteristics of a physical computing device may not be feasible or desirable. For example assume that a database service is associated with a machine image that may be provisioned to a computing device. Further assume that the database service is used infrequently and that the machine image is provisioned to a computing device only during those periods when access to the service is desired. Because of the infrequency of use and dynamic allocation of computing devices to implement the machine image the underlying physical computing device that implements the machine image may alter with each implementation. Accordingly while the current example only contemplates execution of a single database service multiple computing devices and therefore MAC addresses may be associated with the database service. In a traditional environment licenses may therefore be required for each MAC address that executed the service s machine image. The ability of the image to be rapidly provisioned to any available computing device would therefore be limited and the cost associated with rapidly provisioning the image would be increased.

In order to address such issues a service may be associated within a hosted computing environment or marketplace offering the service for acquisition with a unique descriptor. Thereafter each time the service is implemented within a hosting computing device e.g. each time an instance of the service is created the descriptor may be monitored to determine a total number of implementations of the service. In one embodiment a service may be configured such that each time the service is instantiated or destantiated an indication of such the instantiation destantiation is delivered to a usage monitoring device. In other embodiments a usage monitoring device may be configured to periodically monitor service instances and maintain a record of descriptors associated with the services.

Thereafter users of the hosted computing environment may submit queries regarding a descriptor and receive further information about the use of services associated with the descriptor. For example a provider of a service may request a license audit of a service associated with a descriptor. An electronic services marketplace and or hosted computing environment may thereafter determine the number of instances associated with the descriptor and return and indication of license compliance to the provider. As a further example an administrator of the electronic services marketplace may submit a query for geographic information associated with a descriptor and be provided with an indication of the number of instances associated with the descriptor executing in any desired geographic region. Further examples of usage information generated based on unique descriptors will be discussed in more detail below.

With reference to an illustrative operating environment is shown which includes an electronic services marketplace that enables customers to browse descriptions of services available from the electronic services marketplace . The electronic services marketplace may further enable customers to acquire licenses corresponding to services made available in the electronic services marketplace by third party providers or the operator of the electronic services marketplace . Services corresponding to acquired licenses may be implemented within a hosted computing environment as discussed in greater detail below.

As illustrated in the operating environment includes one or more provider computing devices and one or more customer computing devices in communication with an electronic services marketplace via a network . A third party provider using a provider computing device may submit via the network a service or service image implementing a service to the electronic services marketplace . The third party provider may additionally submit other information associated with use or acquisition of the service on the electronic services marketplace such as unique descriptors to be attached to the service or licensing information of the service. The electronic services marketplace may make the submitted service as well as other services or service images implementing services available to customers.

Accordingly a customer using his or her customer computing device may communicate with the electronic services marketplace regarding services made available by the electronic services marketplace . In one embodiment a customer may communicate with the electronic services marketplace in order to browse descriptions of services made available by the electronic services marketplace including the availability of licenses corresponding with the service and any terms of such licenses. In another embodiment a customer may communicate with the electronic services marketplace in order to acquire a license for a desired service. In a further embodiment a customer may communicate with the electronic services marketplace in order to launch a service corresponding to the acquired license. Launching of a service may occur within a marketplace hosted computing environment operated maintained provided or otherwise associated with the operator of the electronic services marketplace . In alternative embodiments where an acquired service was submitted to the electronic services marketplace by a third party provider the acquired service may be launched in a provider hosted computing environment that is operated maintained provided or otherwise associated with the third party provider.

A hosted computing environment e.g. marketplace hosted computing environment or provider hosted computing environment may include a collection of rapidly provisioned and released computing resources hosted in connection with the marketplace or a third party provider. Such computing resources may be referred to individually as host computing devices. The computing resources may further include a number of computing networking and storage devices in communication with one another. In some embodiments the computing devices may correspond to physical computing devices. In other embodiments the computing devices may correspond to virtual machine instances implemented by one or more physical computing devices. In still other embodiments computing devices may correspond to both virtual computing devices and physical computing devices. One example of a hosted computing environment is given in U.S. Pat. No. 7 865 586 entitled Configuring Communications Between Computing Nodes and issued Jan. 4 2011 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. A hosted computing environment may also be referred to as a cloud computing environment.

Though described herein with reference to hosted computing environments associated with a provider of a service and with the electronic services marketplace in some embodiments additional hosted computing environments may be utilized. For example a customer computing device may provide a customer hosted computing environment not shown or a third party may provide a third party hosted computing environment not shown . Any or all of these additional hosted computing environments may be accessible to the electronic services marketplace and may be utilized to host services available from the electronic services marketplace . For purposes of brevity such additional hosted computing environments may also be referred to herein as provider hosted computing environments. 

The provider computing devices and the customer computing devices may communicate with the electronic services marketplace via a network . The provider computing device or customer computing device may be any computing device such as personal computer PC kiosk thin client home computer and dedicated or embedded machine. Further examples may include a laptop or tablet computers servers personal digital assistant PDA hybrid PDA mobile phones mobile phones electronic book readers set top boxes cameras digital media players and the like.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the network may be any wired network wireless network or combination thereof. In addition the network may be a personal area network local area network wide area network cable network satellite network cellular telephone network or combination thereof. In the illustrated embodiment the network is the Internet. Protocols and components for communicating via the Internet or any of the other aforementioned types of communication networks are well known to those skilled in the art of computer communications and thus need not be described in more detail herein.

The electronic services marketplace is illustrated in as operating in a distributed computing environment comprising several computer systems that are interconnected using one or more networks. More specifically the electronic services marketplace may include a marketplace server a usage monitoring server an electronic catalog a billing server and a license datastore discussed in greater detail below. However it may be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the electronic services marketplace may have fewer or greater components than are illustrated in . In addition the electronic services marketplace could include various Web services and or peer to peer network configurations. Thus the depiction of the electronic services marketplace in should be taken as illustrative and not limiting to the present disclosure.

Any one or more of the marketplace server the usage monitoring server the electronic catalog the billing server and the license datastore may be embodied in a plurality of components each executing an instance of the respective marketplace server usage monitoring server electronic catalog billing server and license datastore . A server or other computing component implementing any one of the marketplace server the usage monitoring server the electronic catalog the billing server and the license datastore may include a network interface memory processing unit and computer readable medium drive all of which may communicate which each other may way of a communication bus. The network interface may provide connectivity over the network and or other networks or computer systems. The processing unit may communicate to and from memory containing program instructions that the processing unit executes in order to operate the respective marketplace server usage monitoring server electronic catalog billing server and license datastore . The memory may generally include RAM ROM other persistent and auxiliary memory and or any non transitory computer readable media.

With further reference to illustrative components of the electronic services marketplace will now be discussed. The marketplace server may facilitate network submission by third party providers and browsing and acquisition by customers of services made available in the electronic services marketplace . Accordingly a provider utilizing a provider computing device may submit one or more services e.g. in the form of a service image to the electronic services marketplace via the marketplace server . The submitted services may then be included in an electronic catalog . The process by which a provider utilizing a provider computing device submits a service to the electronic services marketplace is described in greater detail in the 227 Application.

A provider utilizing a provider computing device may further specify additional information corresponding to a submitted service. For example a provider may specify licensing information associated with a service such as required fees. Further a provider may specify unique descriptors to be associated with a service e.g. to facilitate monitoring and enforcement of licenses or to facilitate gathering and reporting of usage data .

The electronic catalog may include information on services available from a plurality of providers and on services made available by the operator of the electronic services marketplace . Accordingly the marketplace server may obtain service information for services offered by a plurality of providers and the marketplace and make information regarding the services available to a customer from a single network resource such as a Web site. A customer may then acquire a license corresponding to a service from the electronic services marketplace and launch the service in accordance with the license on a hosted computing environment e.g. the marketplace hosted computing environment or the provider hosted computing environment in a single interaction or order placed with the electronic services marketplace . Beneficially this eliminates the need for the customer to develop his or her own service or research search or otherwise investigate multiple different providers or other sources for the service.

Illustratively marketplace server may generate one or more user interfaces through which a customer utilizing a customer computing device may browse services made available by the electronic services marketplace submit queries for matching services view licensing information and details regarding specific services acquire a license corresponding to a service and implement the service on a hosted computing environment. An illustrative process by which a customer computing device may query the electronic services marketplace and by which the marketplace server generates a user interface is described in more detail in the 227 Application incorporated by reference above.

After the customer selects a desired service from the electronic services marketplace the marketplace server may facilitate the acquisition of a license corresponding to the service as well as configuration the service. Information associated with a purchased license may be stored in a license datastore . Illustratively the license datastore may include for each customer information regarding licenses acquired by the customer. License information may correspond to for example time of acquisition of the license terms of the license the source of the license e.g. from the service provider or from another customer as well as additional or alternative license information.

The marketplace server may further facilitate the launching of the service image on a hosted computing environment. In this regard the marketplace server may receive payment information from the customer computing device as well as information specifying how the service should be implemented by a hosted computing environment. In some embodiments the customer may select a specific hosted computing environment to host the selected service. The specific hosted computing environment may correspond for example to the marketplace hosted computing environment associated with the electronic services marketplace or to a provider hosted computing environment which is associated with the provider of the service. Launching of services on a hosted computing environment may generally include implementing computer executable instructions corresponding to the service within the hosted computing environment. In one illustrative embodiment implementation of a service may include creation of a virtual data store within the hosted computing environment provisioning of a copy of a service image corresponding to a desired service to the virtual data store and execution of computer executable instructions within the service image by a virtual computing device. Accordingly the functionality corresponding by the service image may be provided via the virtual computing device. In another illustrative embodiment implementation of a service may include modifying an already existing virtual data store to include computer executable instructions corresponding to the service e.g. by installing the service and subsequent execution of such instructions by a virtual computing device. Additional embodiments may include any execution of computer executable instructions corresponding to the service within the hosted computer environment.

Once an instance of the service is launched and running on a hosted computing environment the electronic services marketplace can monitor the usage of the service instance via the usage monitoring server . Specifically the electronic services marketplace can maintain records of descriptors associated with each service instance within a hosted computing environment. In one embodiment the hosted computing environment and or individual service instances may be configured to report instantiation or destantiation of a service instance to the usage monitoring server . In another embodiment the usage monitoring server may be configured to periodically request information of each service instance running on a hosted computing environment. The usage monitoring server may further be configured to store information regarding each instance of a running service for later use e.g. in generating usage information .

The electronic service marketplace may further be configured to bill the customer pay the provider based on usage information via the billing server . Specifically the billing server is provided to process payments from customers and in some embodiments provide payment to the providers of acquired services. The billing server may receive and provide payment information via interaction with the marketplace server . In some embodiments the billing server may alternatively receive and provide payment information via other processes such as via an additional server via telephonic interaction or other mechanisms. Moreover the electronic services marketplace may provide the customer with tools to manage monitor modify etc. the service service image implementing the service or licenses corresponding to the service.

As described above in some embodiments the electronic services marketplace may provide a variety of services such as access to software applications data sets or either partially or wholly human provided services. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art the illustrative components of may enable the electronic service marketplace to provide any one or more of these services.

With reference to one example of a user interface for provider submission of a service is displayed. As shown in the user interface enables a provider utilizing a provider computing device such as provider computing device of to submit a service to the electronic services marketplace . The user interface may be generated by the marketplace server of the electronic services marketplace and presented on the provider computing device by an application such as a browser application on the provider computing device . In this illustrative example the submitted service corresponds to a service image implementing a software application on a hosted computing environment. The user interface contains a title reference to the electronic services marketplace i.e. the Hosted Web Services Catalog as well as a salutation to the provider currently visiting the electronic service image marketplace . In the illustrated example the provider is identified as Paul Provider. The user interface further contains a navigation panel which directs the provider to various other features offered by the electronic service image marketplace . Illustratively units of text within the navigation panel may correspond to interactive links which modify or change the user interface when selected. In the current example Paul Provider has selected link Provide a New Service. Based on this selection the marketplace server has returned the content for user interface .

Through the user interface the provider may submit information associated with a service e.g. contained within a computer executable service image to the electronic service image marketplace . The provider utilizing a provider computing device may submit via input box an identifier of the service image to be used by the electronic services marketplace . This may be the name displayed to customers of the electronic services marketplace when they view browse or search the electronic services marketplace . The provider may submit additional information such as a file location e.g. a file name or address and pricing information via inputs . Input box allows the provider to specify the device image that is to be submitted and that may thereafter be hosted by a hosted computing environment on behalf of a customer. In the illustrated example the service image location is a location on the provider computing device as is displayed in . In other embodiments the service image file may be located on another computing device such as a computing device within a provider hosted computing environment or a computing device within the marketplace hosted computing environment associated with the electronic services marketplace .

In the illustrated example input boxes enable a provider to specify pricing information associated with acquiring a license to the submitted service image. For example input box enables the provider to specify a pricing structure associated with a service image such as a pricing structure requiring a subscription rate an hourly usage fee or other fee arrangements. Examples of additional pricing structures are discussed in more detail in the 227 Application.

In addition a provider may further specify one or more descriptors to be associated with a provided service. Specifically input box may enable a provider to specify a first descriptor for a service while link may enable additional input boxes to be shown e.g. to enable input of additional descriptors . As described in more detail below each descriptor may be utilized to track usage of the provided service on hosted computing environments. In one embodiment the provided service image may be modified by the electronic services marketplace to include an indication of the descriptor. In another embodiment the descriptor may be associated with the service without requiring modification of the service image such as by storing the association within the electronic catalog .

Illustratively a descriptor may include any combination of characters or symbols that may be used to uniquely identify or describe a service or collection of services. For example in a descriptor of PDBV1 is shown which may indicate the descriptor corresponds to Paul s Database Version 1. In one embodiment descriptors entered into the interface may be checked against all known current descriptors to ensure that each descriptor unique. For example where another provider of the electronic services marketplace had already used to descriptor PDBV1 the user interface may inform Paul Provider that another descriptor must be used. This may ensure that descriptors are associated only with the intended services and that unauthorized users may not associate a given descriptor with unintended services. In another embodiment each descriptor may be modified by the electronic services marketplace to ensure uniqueness of descriptors between providers. For example the descriptor entered in input may be modified by the electronic services marketplace to include the user name of the current provider e.g. Paul Provider PDBV1 . In this manner uniqueness of descriptors would not be required between providers. Further the electronic services marketplace may be configured to remove user names prior to reporting descriptors to providers such that the provider is unaware of the modification. Though prepending of user names is described herein one skilled in the art will appreciate that descriptors may be modified with any unique information such as a provider identification number. Further one skilled in the art will appreciate that supplementation of descriptors with unique information is not limited to prepending but may include appendation or other association.

While one illustrative interface is described above for associating descriptors to services additional or alternative interfaces or mechanisms may be utilized in order to create such an association. For example in some instances providers may be enabled to modify service images directly to include one or more desired descriptors. In other instances the electronic services marketplace may provide an API command line interface or alternative interface through which authorized parties may create or modify descriptors of a service. Any such interface including the user interface of may utilize a variety of authentication mechanisms generally known within the art to ensure that modification of descriptors is executed only by authorized parties. For example in one embodiment public private key encryption may be utilized such that each descriptor must be signed by a private key known only to the provider.

Moreover though descriptors are discussed above with respect to a single service in some embodiments multiple services may be associated with a single descriptor. For example where multiple versions of Paul s Database service are provided each version may be associated with a descriptor PDB exclusively or in addition to a version specific descriptor. In this manner a provider may be enabled to gather usage information across a range or category of services. Similarly multiple services provided by a provider may be associated with a given descriptor such that information on all services provided by the provider may be obtained based on the descriptor. Still further in some instances individual descriptors may be assigned to only specific instances of a service. For example each instance of a service associated with a specific customer may be given a specific descriptor such that instances of the service associated with the customer may be monitored independent of instances of the service associated with other customers. In some instances the electronic services marketplace may be configured to modify descriptors to differentiate between customers. For example the electronic services marketplace may prepend or append a descriptor with a customer identifier or other identification information. Accordingly descriptors may be associated with one or many services or with any subset of services.

After all information has been input by a provider submission may be completed by selecting the input control . Accordingly the provider may activate the input control to cause the provider computing device to transmit the service or information related to the service the electronic services marketplace . Thereafter a customer can submit a query for services available from the electronic services marketplace and use a user interface to display information related to different services of interest. The customer can purchase and or acquire the services available from the electronic services marketplace as described in greater detail in the 227 application.

With reference to an illustrative interaction for enabling a provider computing device to submit a request to add or modify one or more service descriptors associated with a service made available on the electronic services marketplace will be described. As depicted in the provider computing device may at 1 submit a request to modify a service descriptor associated with a service. In one embodiment such a request may be made through a graphical user interface such as the user interface of or other graphical user interface provided by the electronic services marketplace . In another embodiment such a request may be made through an alternative interface such as an API.

The request may be received by the electronic services marketplace e.g. via the marketplace server . Thereafter the marketplace server or other component of the electronic services marketplace may authenticate the request to ensure that the provider computing device has authorization to modify descriptors of the service. In one embodiment authentication may rely in whole or in part on a public private key encryption pair such as those generated in connection with the GPG PGP SSL TLS or SSH protocols. In brief a provider may be provided with a unique private key which may be used to sign requests to modify descriptors. Thereafter the marketplace server may utilize a corresponding public key to decrypt a portion of the request and therefore to authenticate the request. Public private key encryption algorithms and schemes are generally known within the art and therefore will not be discussed in detail herein.

Though public private key encryption is discussed herein the marketplace server may utilize any number of known authentication techniques to determine that the provider computing device is authorized to provide or modify a descriptor for a service. For example the marketplace server may require that the provider computing device provide a password or other secret phrase along with a request to modify a descriptor. One skilled in the art will recognize a variety of authentication techniques may be used to authenticate computing devices.

Subsequent to authentication of the provider computing device the marketplace server may interact with the electronic catalog to modify a descriptor associated with the service. In one embodiment the marketplace server may modify computer executable instructions corresponding to a service image to include the descriptor such that computer executable instructions of each instance provisioned based on the service image will include the descriptor. In another embodiment the marketplace server may modify computer executable instructions associated with one or more instances of the service previously or currently implemented on the hosted computing environment to include an indication of the descriptor with or without modifying the service image directly . In yet another embodiment the marketplace server may modify metadata or other information regarding the service to indicate the updated descriptor. In still more embodiments where the service is implemented on computing devices via an installation file or script the marketplace server may modify the installation file or script to correctly identify the descriptor such that installation of the service within a virtual data store causes computer executable instructions within the data store to include an indication of the descriptor. Thereafter any instance of the service instantiated within a hosted computing environment would correspond to computer executable instructions including an indication of the modified descriptor. Further the electronic services marketplace may therefore use the modified descriptor to generate usage data regarding instances of the service such as to enforce licensing agreements associated with the service.

With respect to the selected hosted computing environment is the marketplace hosted computing environment . However as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art the selected hosted computing environment may in some embodiments correspond to a provider computing environment such as a provider computing environment of . Launching of services within a hosted computing environment will be discussed in more detail below with respect to .

Subsequent to launching the customer selected service the marketplace server may at 4 transmit a confirmation to the customer computing device as well as information regarding the hosted service. Such information may include the location of the computing device implementing the service and any access information required to access the computing device hosting the service. Subsequent to receiving confirmation of launch and relevant hosting information the customer computing device may at 5 access the computing device hosting the service.

With reference to illustrative interactions will be described for monitoring use of a service executing on a marketplace hosted computing environment based on descriptors. Though described herein with reference to a marketplace hosted computing environment one skilled in the art will appreciate that usage of services within a provider hosted computing environment may also be monitored. Though shown in two figures the illustrative interactions may occur in conjunction and numbering is therefore maintained between the figures. Further one skilled in the art will appreciate that the interactions may represent activities at distinct points in time with or without intervening interactions e.g. customer use of services .

As depicted in at 1 a service such as the Paul s Database service of may be launched within the marketplace hosted computing environment . In one embodiment launching of a service may include instantiation of a virtual computing device executing computer executable instructions contained within an image corresponding to the service. In a second embodiment launching of a service may include executing computer executable instructions within an existing computing device virtual or physical . For example launching of a service may include launching an application or program implementing the service or may include launching an installation program corresponding to the service.

Subsequent to or during launching of the service the marketplace hosted computing environment may transmit an indication to the usage monitoring server that the service has been instantiated. In one embodiment such an indication may be generated by a virtual computing device implementing the service. In another embodiment the indication may be generated by a physical computing device hosting such a virtual computing device. In still more embodiments the indication may be generated by a distinct computing device within the marketplace hosted computing environment such as a computing device configured to manage instantiation of services within the marketplace hosted computing environment .

The transmitted indication may include information corresponding to the service such as any descriptors associated with the service. The transmitted indication may further include identifying aspects of the service or devices implementing the service. For example the transmitted indication may include a volume identifier associated with a virtual data store from which the service has been implemented and or an identifier of a virtual computing device implementing the service. Further information may be included within the service launch information such as a time or location of launch. In addition in some embodiments the usage monitoring server may be configured to modify or supplement the received service launch information such as by including a time of reception of the service launch information. Thereafter the service launch information may be stored within the service image data store . Accordingly by inspection of information within the service usage data store the usage monitoring server may determine usage data associated with the service such as a number of instances of the service currently being implemented timing information associated with the service or geographic information associated with the service.

Though illustrative interactions are described with respect to additional or alternative interactions further be undertaken by the marketplace hosted computing environment the usage monitoring server or both without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example though not shown in the marketplace hosted computing environment may in some embodiments be configured to update and or verify a license information associated with service prior to launching an instance of the service. For example the marketplace hosted computing environment may prior to 1 request an indication from the usage monitoring server that an additional instance of the service would comply with currently licensing agreements. The marketplace hosted computing environment may then make a determination as to whether to launch the service based on the response of the usage monitoring server . Further in some embodiments the usage monitoring server may be configured to utilize launch information received from the marketplace hosted computing environment to ensure compliance with a service license. For example assume that a customer is associated with a fixed number of licenses of a given service such that each instance of the service requires a single license. In such instances the usage monitoring server may utilize received launch information to associate a specific instance of a service with an individual license of the service. Illustratively the usage monitoring server may maintain an association between an individual license and a descriptor associated with a service instance. Such associations may thereafter be used to verify the availability of licenses for a service. For example where an association to a descriptor exists for each license available to a customer the usage monitoring server may determine that no additional instances of the service may be launched. One skilled in the art will appreciate that additional interactions may be implemented in conjunction with those shown in without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.

Thereafter at 3 the marketplace hosted computing environment may halt the executed service. Illustratively halting of the service may be undertaken in response to a client command to halt the service or in response to detection that execution of the service is no longer necessary e.g. according to a defined set of rules for service execution . In one embodiment halting of a service may correspond to halting a virtual computing device implementing the service. In another embodiment halting of a service may correspond to halting execution of an application or other computer executable instructions within a computing device. Subsequent to or during halting of the service the marketplace hosted computing environment may transmit an indication to the usage monitoring server that the service has been halted. In one embodiment such an indication may be generated by a virtual computing device implementing the service. In another embodiment the indication may be generated by a physical computing device hosting such a virtual computing device. In still more embodiments the indication may be generated by a distinct computing device within the marketplace hosted computing environment such as a computing device configured to manage instantiation of services within the marketplace hosted computing environment .

Similarly to as described above the transmitted indication may include information corresponding to the service such as any descriptors associated with the service. The transmitted indication may further include identifying aspects of the service or devices implementing the service. For example the transmitted indication may include a volume identifier associated with a virtual data store from which the service was implemented and or an identifier of a virtual computing device implementing the service. Further information may be included within the service halt information such as a time or location of halting the service. In addition in some embodiments the usage monitoring server may be configured to modify or supplement the received service launch information such as by including a time of reception of the service halt information. Thereafter the service launch information may be stored within the service image data store .

Subsequent to receiving a request for a descriptor audit the marketplace server at 2 requests descriptor usage information from the usage monitoring server . The service usage information illustratively corresponds to usage information of any service associated with the PDBV1 descriptor. For example the usage information may include a number type and location of computing devices currently implementing services associated with the descriptor as well as additional information regarding such services. Such information may include but is not limited to identification of customers utilizing such services run times of such services and licensing information regarding such services. The usage monitoring server at 3 returns the relevant service image usage information to the marketplace server .

Though not shown the electronic service image marketplace may optionally request permission from customers implementing services to release the relevant service usage information or the descriptor audit report. Such a request for permission may be transmitted to customers at any point prior to transmitting the audit report to the requesting provider. Permission to disclose an audit report may be required for example where private or sensitive information of customers would be disclosed by the report. In some examples usage conditions associated with a service image may specify whether the electronic service image marketplace requests permission from a customer prior to disclosing an audit report. One skilled in the art will appreciate that a customer may deny any audit report to a provider or may deny only access to specific information. In the current example C customers may allow Paul Provider to verify that each service instance is in compliance with the usage conditions associated with the services but may not allow Paul Provider to receive information such as the number of instances which are being executed on behalf of each customer or the number of aggregate hours during which those instances have been executed. In some embodiments a customer s preferences for release of usage information may be pre specified such that the customer need not give permission to release usage information unless release of the information would exceed their pre specified preference.

Subsequently at 4 the marketplace server may generate an audit report for the specified descriptor and customer based on the retrieved usage information. In one embodiment the marketplace server may determine whether each service associated with the retrieved usage information is in compliance with relevant licensing information. For example the marketplace server may determine that a specific customer is licensed to execute three simultaneous instances of services associated with the PDBV1 descriptor and is only executing two simultaneous instances. As such the marketplace server may generate an audit report reflecting that the customer is in compliance with usage conditions for the service. Alternatively if the customer was not in compliance with the set forth usage conditions the audit report would reflect this non compliance. In some embodiments as described above license compliance may be determined based at least in part on associations between individual licenses for a service and descriptors associated with the service. Accordingly in some such embodiments the marketplace server may be configured to determine compliance with a license agreement based on associations between a customer s individual licenses and one or more descriptors of a service.

As described above if a customer has not given permission to disclose additional details of usage the audit report may simply reflect a status of compliance or non compliance. On the other hand if the customer has allowed disclosure of additional information or if disclosure is required by the agreed on usage conditions the audit report may contain further details of the customers usage such as the peak number of instances executed or the aggregate number of hours the service image has been executed. Further examples for determining compliance with usage information are described in more detail within U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 406 348 entitled Managing Transfer of Hosted Service Licenses and filed Feb. 27 2012 the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
