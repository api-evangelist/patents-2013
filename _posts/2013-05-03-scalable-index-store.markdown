Computer systems may include different resources used by one or more host processors. Resources and host processors in a computer system may be interconnected by one or more communication connections. These resources may include for example data storage devices such as those included in the data storage systems manufactured by EMC Corporation. These data storage systems may be coupled to one or more servers or host processors and provide storage services to each host processor. Multiple data storage systems from one or more different vendors may be connected and may provide common data storage for one or more host processors in a computer system.

A host processor may perform a variety of data processing tasks and operations using the data storage system. For example a host processor may perform basic system I O operations in connection with data requests such as data read and write operations.

Host processor systems may store and retrieve data using a storage device containing a plurality of host interface units disk drives and disk interface units. Such storage devices are provided for example by EMC Corporation of Hopkinton Mass. and disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 206 939 to Yanai et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 778 394 to Galtzur et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 845 147 to Vishlitzky et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5 857 208 to Ofek. The host systems access the storage device through a plurality of channels provided therewith. Host systems provide data and access control information through the channels to the storage device and storage device provides data to the host systems also through the channels. The host systems do not address the disk drives of the storage device directly but rather access what appears to the host systems as a plurality of logical disk units logical devices or logical volumes. The logical disk units may or may not correspond to the actual physical disk drives. Allowing multiple host systems to access the single storage device unit allows the host systems to share data stored therein. In a common implementation a Storage Area Network SAN is used to connect computing devices with a large number of storage devices. Management and modeling programs may be used to manage these complex computing environments.

Two components having connectivity to one another such as a host and a data storage system may communicate using a communication connection. In one arrangement the data storage system and the host may reside at the same physical site or location.

Techniques exist for providing a remote mirror or copy of a device of the local data storage system so that a copy of data from one or more devices of the local data storage system may be stored on a second remote data storage system. Such remote copies of data may be desired so that in the event of a disaster or other event causing the local data storage system to be unavailable operations may continue using the remote mirror or copy.

In another arrangement the host may communicate with a virtualized storage pool of one or more data storage systems. In this arrangement the host may issue a command for example to write to a device of the virtualized storage pool. In some existing systems processing may be performed by a front end component of a first data storage system of the pool to further forward or direct the command to another data storage system of the pool. Such processing may be performed when the receiving first data storage system does not include the device to which the command is directed. The first data storage system may direct the command to another data storage system of the pool which includes the device. The front end component may be a host adapter of the first receiving data storage system which receives commands from the host. In such arrangements the front end component of the first data storage system may become a bottleneck in that the front end component processes commands directed to devices of the first data storage system and additionally performs processing for forwarding commands to other data storage systems of the pool as just described.

Often cloud computer may be performed with a data storage system. As it is generally known cloud computing typically refers to the use of remotely hosted resources to provide services to customers over one or more networks such as the Internet. Resources made available to customers are typically virtualized and dynamically scalable. Cloud computing services may include any specific type of application. Some cloud computing services are for example provided to customers through client software such as a Web browser. The software and data used to support cloud computing services are located on remote servers owned by a cloud computing service provider. Customers consuming services offered through a cloud computing platform need not own the physical infrastructure hosting the actual service and may accordingly avoid capital expenditure on hardware systems by paying only for the service resources they use and or a subscription fee. From a service provider s standpoint the sharing of computing resources across multiple customers aka tenants improves resource utilization. Use of the cloud computing service model has been growing due to the increasing availability of high bandwidth communication making it possible to obtain response times from remotely hosted cloud based services similar to those of services that are locally hosted.

Cloud computing infrastructures often use virtual machines to provide services to customers. A virtual machine is a completely software based implementation of a computer system that executes programs like an actual computer system. One or more virtual machines may be used to provide a service to a given customer with additional virtual machines being dynamically instantiated and or allocated as customers are added and or existing customer requirements change. Each virtual machine may represent all the components of a complete system to the program code running on it including virtualized representations of processors memory networking storage and or BIOS Basic Input Output System . Virtual machines can accordingly run unmodified application processes and or operating systems. Program code running on a given virtual machine executes using only virtual resources and abstractions dedicated to that virtual machine. As a result of such encapsulation a program running in one virtual machine is completely isolated from programs running on other virtual machines even though the other virtual machines may be running on the same underlying hardware. In the context of cloud computing customer specific virtual machines can therefore be employed to provide secure and reliable separation of code and data used to deliver services to different customers.

A method system and computer program product for providing via a provisioning engine a scalable set of indexed key value pairs enabled to store objects in a data storage environment wherein the data representing the objects is enabled to be spread across arrays in the data storage environment wherein additional arrays are enabled to be added to the data storage environment and included in the indexed key value pairs wherein the data stored across the arrays may be balanced.

Conventionally object systems may not be scalable. Usually an object system may not offer file access. Typically a file system may not offer object access. Usually a file system may not switch between file and object access.

In certain embodiments the current disclosure may enable storage of a large table or index of key strings along with their corresponding value bytes on file shares across multiple devices.

In some embodiments the current disclosure may enable an indexing service in a VM image that may be installed on a machine. In certain embodiments a set of such nodes may form an indexing service layer. In an embodiment a set of file shares may be created on NAS devices and registered with the ViPR indexing service for storage of data.

In certain embodiments nodes may form a fault tolerant layer over NAS devices. In at least some embodiments any number of nodes may be removed or added at any time without affecting the availability of an indexing system. In other embodiments any number of ViPR nodes may be unavailable but the transaction processing for any part of the data may continue to give a functioning node. In most embodiments each node may be connected to a number of file shares. In certain embodiments each note may be able to read and write data from any of file shares. In other embodiments each node may also accept transaction for any part of the data for any file share.

In most embodiments the current disclosure enables a horizontally scalable architecture. In certain embodiments if file shares run out of space new file shares can be created and registered with nodes. In certain embodiments the indexing system may start placing new incoming writes in the new file shares. In further embodiments any number of nodes may be dynamically added in the system to increase the transaction processing capacity of the system.

In certain embodiments a Virtual Storage Pool may be a definition of the characteristics of a file share device. In most embodiments each file share registered with a data service may be associated with a Virtual Storage Pool.

In some embodiments the desired Virtual Storage Pool characteristic for an index may be specified during its creation. In at least some embodiments the data belonging to the index may be stored on the file shares that are associated with the Virtual Storage Pool. In other embodiments if multiple file shares are associated with the Virtual Storage Pool the data of the index may be spread across all the file shares. In certain embodiments the index may be associated with a Virtual Storage Pool. In an embodiment a Virtual Storage Pool may form logically disjoint sets in which data set is divided.

In some embodiments a Virtual Storage Pool may be divided into one or more Partitions. In certain embodiments partitioning may be done based on consistent hashing. In at least some embodiments a hash number of a key may be found by deriving the SHA 256 value of the key string. In other embodiments each partition may be identified by the divisor remainder pair of the hash space. In a particular embodiment if a partition has divisor identifier and remainder identifier then it may contain all the keys whose hash value when divided by 4 gives remainder 1. In most embodiments the partition identifiers may be scoped within the Virtual Storage Pool so each of Virtual Storage Pool can have same partition identifiers. In certain embodiments a partition may be responsible for storage of data associated with the keys that fall in its hash.

In most embodiments the number of partitions in the system may change dynamically depending on the resources in the system. In certain embodiments if ViPR nodes and NAS devices are added in the system then better load balancing may be achieved by automatically increasing the number of partitions in the system. In some embodiments better load balancing may be achieved by a partition split process.

In at least some embodiments the number of partitions may automatically be decreased when the resources become constrained. In one embodiment partitions may be decreased when more file shares are creates on existing devices or when the number of ViPR nodes are removed from the system.

In alternative embodiments a partition with identifiers divisor 4 remainder 1 may split into two partitions with identifiers divisor 8 remainder 1 and divisor 8 remainder 5. In other embodiments two partitions with identifiers divisor 4 remainder 1 and divisor 4 remainder 3 may merge into one partition with identifier divisor 2 remainder 1.

In most embodiments nodes may host a database. In some embodiments the database may be Cassandra. In certain embodiments the database data may be stored in local disks on nodes. In further embodiments the database may be for storing system s metadata and not for any of the index s data. In at least some embodiments nodes may host a small instance of a lock service or locking service. In at least one embodiment the locking service may be Zookeeper. In most embodiments the locking service may provide the lock service for the nodes to coordinate with other nodes.

In most embodiments the information about each partition in the system may be stored as an entry in a database. In certain embodiments the entry may have the identifier for the partition Virtual Storage Pool divisor remainder . In some embodiments the entry may have the node identifier to specify which node is currently responsible for the partition. In at least one embodiment the entry may have a location on the file share where the metadata record of the partition is stored. In at least some embodiments a location may be identified by the file share identifier the full path of the file the offset in the file where the record begins and the length of the record.

In an embodiment the metadata record of a partition may be stored in a file on the file share. In certain embodiments the metadata record may contains the information about the latest B tree of the partition and position in the journal file. In some embodiments the journal file may be used as a redo log for holding the data that hasn t been included in the B tree yet. In other embodiments the location in the metadata record for the journal may contain the file share id full file path and the offset in the file. In most embodiments the journal file may be on any file share which need not be same file share where the B tree files and metadata record files are for that partition.

In certain embodiments data transactions for partitions may be logged into the journal. In most embodiments once enough entries are accumulated in journal the entries may be inserted into a B tree and the journal position may be advanced. In some embodiments in the case the node responsible for the partition crashes another node which picks up the responsibility may replay the transactions from the last journal position recorded in the metadata record.

In an embodiment a B tree structure may be maintained to store the keys belonging to the partition and corresponding values. In other embodiments the pages of the B tree may be stored in the files on the file shares. In some embodiments the location of pages in the tree may be identified by file share id full file path and offset in the file. In other embodiments the B tree may be spread across multiple file shares. In further embodiments the B tree structure may support multiversion concurrency control and read snapshot isolation. In at least one embodiment the existing pages may not be modified and modifications may be written as new pages in the file.

In an embodiment a partition may have files for metadata record B tree and journal. In certain embodiments the B tree and journal may span multiple files. In other embodiments each structure s location may be reached via a chain of pointers starting from the partition entry in Cassandra. In most embodiments the partition structure may not be bound to a fixed location. In a particular embodiment if a file share capacity is getting full the journal writes and B tree modifications may be moved to another file share without break in continuity or consistency.

In most embodiments when a node gets a transaction for a key it may calculate a hash value of the key. In certain embodiments the node may query the database to find into which partition the key falls. In some embodiments the partition information may be cached for future transactions. In alternative embodiments a node may send the transaction to the node responsible for the key to execute the transaction. In other embodiments if the cached information about the partition responsibility was stale the destination node may return a specific error code which may cause the source node to query the database and refresh the information to the latest state.

In an embodiment if a node discovers that the responsibility division of the partitions is uneven the node may take the responsibility from another node. In some embodiments the consistent hashing scheme for partitioning may result in random and even distribution of the load. In at least some embodiments the number of partitions may be the criteria for measuring even split of responsibility among the nodes.

In most embodiments nodes periodically check the database for the partitions that the node is responsible for to see if the node is still the owner. In another embodiment if a node wishes to take over ownership of a partition the node may register itself as the owner in the database. In at least some embodiments the node may wait for a periodic refresh interval for the original owner node to find out that the original node is not the owner anymore and stop serving the transactions for the partition. In most embodiments if a node is not able to reach the database it may stop serving the transactions for the partition until the node can successfully validate that it is the owner. In further embodiments if a node cannot reach the owner node for some time the node may assume that the owner node is down and may take responsibility for the partition.

In some embodiments an object system may be build on top of an indexing system. In certain embodiments an object system may provide object semantics for creating objects reading objects reading and writing metadata associated with the object. In further embodiments the object system may support byte range update on the object contents and atomic append to the object data. In most embodiments the object system may support REST protocols and the related features of S3 Atmos and Swift. In further embodiments an object service or object system may provide a single namespace that may span across multiple file shares.

In certain embodiments objects may be grouped in one or more bucket. In most embodiments a bucket may support operations such as listing of all the objects in the bucket. In some embodiments the list of object names in a bucket may be stored in an indexing system. In a particular embodiment a SHA 256 of the bucket name may be used for deriving a hash id of the partition where the list is stored. In at least some embodiments when an object is created an entry may be made in the indexing system for the bucket id and object name. In other embodiments the listing of bucket operations may go through the entries in the indexing for the bucket id.

In an embodiment each change or mutation to an object may be stored as a separate transaction. In most embodiments storing each change as a separate transaction may provide a journal of changes to the object without overwriting the previous state. In certain embodiments recording a separate object may enable snapshot read isolation. In further embodiments querying the object at a given point in time may see the same consistent state of object throughout the read duration as it was when it started reading.

In other embodiments the data associated with a change or mutation in an object may be written directly into a file on the fileshare. In certain embodiments the location of the data may be stored in the indexing system as an update entry. In a particular embodiment a given object may have many update entries in the index each with location of the data on the file system. In at least some embodiments a reader may need to go through all the update entries of an object to get the current state of the object. In some embodiments the system may consolidate the update entries of an object when there are no readers. In alternative embodiments SHA 256 of the object name may be used for deriving the hash id of the partition where the update entries for the object are stored.

In certain embodiments multiple transactions for atomically appending the data to the object may be issued. In some embodiments the update sequencing on the server side of the indexing system may order the append transactions and may provide the atomicity.

In an embodiment the file access feature may provide ability to access the object data through the native file system interface of the NAS device by mounting the fileshare. In certain embodiments the user may send a request to get file access for a bucket. In some embodiments the system may return the full file path for each of the objects in the bucket. In other embodiments modifications made through the file interface on those objects may be reflected in the object data. In at least some embodiments during modifications to the object through REST interface may be prevented. In alternative embodiments when a user is done with file access the REST interface may be accessible. In at least one embodiment internally the system may consolidate the update entries and data of an object and may place them into a single file before giving the file out for file access.
