This invention relates generally to social networking systems and in particular to managing access to collections of content shared by social networking system users.

A social networking system allows a user to connect to and communicate with other social networking system users. A user creates a profile on the social networking system that is tied to its identities and includes information about the user such as interests and demographic information. The increasing popularity of social networking systems and significant amount of user specific information maintained by social networking systems make a social networking system ideal forum for users to share their interests and experiences with each other by uploading content for sharing with other social networking system users.

Conventional social networking systems allow users to upload groups of content such as collections of photographs to be maintained on the social networking system and shared with other social networking system users. However based on user specific settings such as privacy settings different users may have different levels of access to content in group of content shared among social networking system users. Conventional social networking systems have limitations on privacy setting configuration that may prevent a user from sharing a complete photo albums with other users. For example conventional social networking systems may prevent a user from sharing a photo album with users who are indirectly connected to the user users directly connected to a user sharing a photo album using a conventional social networking system may have access to a greater number of photographs in the photo album than users having an indirect connection to the user sharing the photo album. Additionally conventional social networking systems do not allow a user sharing a group of content to authorize other users to add additional content to the group of content or to manage user interaction with the group of content. For example a conventional social networking system prevents a user sharing a photo album from authorizing other users to add photos to the photo album or to share the photo album with additional users.

A social networking system allows its users to upload content items e.g. photos audio data video data and organize the content items into albums maintained by the social networking system. For example social networking system users upload photographs to the social networking system and organize the photographs into one or more albums. A user may create a shared album that is accessible to additional social networking system users. A user that creates a shared album on the social networking system is the owner of the shared album and may invite additional users to access the shared album or identify additional users authorized to access the shared album. Additional users who accept an invitation to access a shared album or who are identified as authorized to access the shared album are members of the shared album.

To regulate access to content items in a shared album one or more privacy settings are associated with the shared album and specify social networking system users authorized to access content items included in the shared album. For example a public privacy setting allows all social networking system users to access content items in the shared album while a private privacy setting limits access to content item in the shared album to members of the shared album. An intermediate setting may allow an owner of the shared album to identify specific users or to identify characteristics of users authorized to access content items in the shared album. For example using an intermediate setting a shared album owner may limit access to content items in the shared album to members of the shared album and social networking system users connected to a particular member of the shared album.

Privacy settings associated with a shared album may also regulate actions that members of the shared album may perform on content items within the shared album. An owner of a shared album may add or remove members from the shared album add content items to the shared album add or modify tags associated with content in the shared album change privacy settings or metadata associated with the shared album and delete the shared album. Additionally the owner of a shared album may also specify privacy settings for additional members of the shared album that authorize the members to perform different actions. For example privacy settings associated with a member limit the member s permissible actions to adding additional members adding additional content items adding tags to content items in the shared album and deleting only content items and metadata added to the shared album by only the member.

In one embodiment then an action associated with a shared album is performed a notification is provided to social networking system users authorized to access the shared album through any suitable channel. For example a push notification a text message an e mail a story or other suitable communication describing an action associated with the shared album is presented to users authorized to access the shared album. Additionally the social networking system may prompt a user to create a shared album based on actions identified by the social networking system. For example a user is prompted to create a shared album if a threshold number of users connected to each other check in at a location attend an event or request access to an album. Further shared albums may be created from existing albums or merged with existing albums on the social networking system.

The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.

A social networking system allows its users to upload and organize content items e.g. photographs audio data video data etc. into albums and to grant additional social networking system users permission to access content items in the groups i.e. shared albums . A user that creates a shared album on the social networking system is the owner of the shared album. The owner of a shared album may invite additional social networking system users to access content items in the shared album or to identify additional users authorized to access to the shared album. Additional users accepting an invitation to access a shared album or identified as authorized to access the shared album are referred to as members of the shared album.

Social networking system users authorized to access content items in a shared album may be specified by one or more privacy settings associated with the shared album. Privacy settings associated with a shared album may be generally categorized as private public and intermediate. A private privacy setting limits access to content items in the shared album to only members of the shared album while a public privacy setting allows all social networking system users access to content items in the shared album. An intermediate privacy setting allows an owner of a shared album to specify additional users authorized to access content items in the shared album. For example using an intermediate privacy setting an owner identifies characteristics of users authorized to access content items in a shared album. As a specific example a shared album owner limits access to the shared album to members of the shared album and users connected to members of the shared album through an intermediate privacy setting.

A shared album owner may add and remove members or content item to and from the shared album add or modify tags associated with content items in the shared album change privacy settings and metadata associated with the shared album and delete the shared album. However actions by members of a shared album are regulated by privacy settings associated with the shared album by the owner. Privacy settings associated with a shared album may limit actions involving the shared album or content items in the shared album that a member of the shared album is authorized to perform. For example members of a shared album may be limited to performing actions identified by a privacy setting. Additionally notifications describing an action associated with a shared album may be presented via any suitable communication channel to social networking system users authorized to access the shared album.

In one embodiment the social networking system a user to create a shared album based on actions performed by the user or by additional social networking system users. For example a user is prompted to create a shared album if a threshold number of users connected to each other on the social networking system check in at a location attend an event or request access to an existing album. In addition to creating new shared albums social networking system users may create a shared album from an existing album or merge a shared album with an existing album to create an additional shared album.

The client devices are one or more computing devices capable of receiving user input as well as transmitting and or receiving data via the network . In one embodiment a client device is a conventional computer system such as a desktop or a laptop computer. Alternatively a client device may be a device having computer functionality such as a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile telephone a smartphone or another suitable device. A client device is configured to communicate via the network . In one embodiment a client device executes an application allowing a user of the client device to interact with the online system . For example a client device executes a browser application to enable interaction between the client device and the online system via the network . In another embodiment a client device interacts with the online system through an application programming interface API running on a native operating system of the client device such as IOS or ANDROID .

The client devices are configured to communicate via the network which may comprise any combination of local area and or wide area networks using both wired and or wireless communication systems. In one embodiment the network uses standard communications technologies and or protocols. For example the network includes communication links using technologies such as Ethernet 802.11 worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX 3G 4G code division multiple access CDMA digital subscriber line DSL etc. Examples of networking protocols used for communicating via the network include multiprotocol label switching MPLS transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP hypertext transport protocol HTTP simple mail transfer protocol SMTP and file transfer protocol FTP . Data exchanged over the network may be represented using any suitable format such as hypertext markup language HTML or extensible markup language XML . In some embodiments all or some of the communication links of the network may be encrypted using any suitable technique or techniques.

One or more third party systems may be coupled to the network for communicating with the online system which is further described below in conjunction with . For example the online system is a social networking system. In one embodiment a third party system is an application provider communicating information describing applications for execution by a client device or communicating data to client devices for use by an application executing on the client device. In other embodiments a third party system provides content or other information for presentation via a client device . A third party website may also communicate information to the online system such as advertisements content or information about an application provided by the third party website .

Each user of the online system is associated with a user profile which is stored in the user profile store . A user profile includes declarative information about the user that was explicitly shared by the user and may also include profile information inferred by the online system . In one embodiment a user profile includes multiple data fields each describing one or more attributes of the corresponding social networking system user. Examples of information stored in a user profile include biographic demographic and other types of descriptive information such as work experience educational history gender hobbies or preferences location and the like. A user profile may also store other information provided by the user for example images or videos. In certain embodiments images of users may be tagged with information identifying the social networking system users displayed in an image. A user profile in the user profile store may also maintain references to actions by the corresponding user performed on content items in the content store and stored in the action log .

While user profiles in the user profile store are frequently associated with individuals allowing individuals to interact with each other via the online system user profiles may also be stored for entities such as businesses or organizations. This allows an entity to establish a presence on the online system for connecting and exchanging content with other online system users. The entity may post information about itself about its products or provide other information to users of the online system using a brand page associated with the entity s user profile. Other users of the online system may connect to the brand page to receive information posted to the brand page or to receive information from the brand page. A user profile associated with the brand page may include information about the entity itself providing users with background or informational data about the entity.

The content store stores objects that each represents various types of content. Examples of content represented by an object include a page post a status update a photograph a video a link a shared content item a gaming application achievement a check in event at a local business a brand page or any other type of content. Online system users may create objects stored by the content store such as status updates photos tagged by users to be associated with other objects in the online system events groups or applications. In some embodiments objects are received from third party applications or third party applications separate from the online system . In one embodiment objects in the content store represent single pieces of content or content items. Hence social networking system users are encouraged to communicate with each other by posting text and content items of various types of media to the online system through various communication channels. This increases the amount of interaction of users with each other and increases the frequency with which users interact within the online system .

The action logger receives communications about user actions internal to and or external to the online system populating the action log with information about user actions. Examples of actions include adding a connection to another user sending a message to another user uploading an image reading a message from another user viewing content associated with another user and attending an event posted by another user. In addition a number of actions may involve an object and one or more particular users so these actions are associated with those users as well and stored in the action log .

The action log may be used by the online system to track user actions on the online system as well as actions on third party systems that communicate information to the online system . Users may interact with various objects on the online system and information describing these interactions is stored in the action log . Examples of interactions with objects include commenting on posts sharing links checking in to physical locations via a mobile device accessing content items and any other suitable interactions. Additional examples of interactions with objects on the online system that are included in the action log include commenting on a photo album communicating with a user establishing a connection with an object joining an event joining a group creating an event authorizing an application using an application expressing a preference for an object liking the object and engaging in a transaction. Additionally the action log may record a user s interactions with advertisements on the online system as well as with other applications operating on the online system . In some embodiments data from the action log is used to infer interests or preferences of a user augmenting the interests included in the user s user profile and allowing a more complete understanding of user preferences.

The action log may also store user actions taken on a third party system such as an external website and communicated to the online system . For example an e commerce website may recognize a user of an online system through a social plug in enabling the e commerce website to identify the user of the online system . Because users of the online system are uniquely identifiable e commerce websites such as in the preceding example may communicate information about a user s actions outside of the online system to the online system for association with the user. Hence the action log may record information about actions users perform on a third party system including webpage viewing histories advertisements that were engaged purchases made and other patterns from shopping and buying.

In one embodiment the edge store stores information describing connections between users and other objects on the online system as edges. Some edges may be defined by users allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example users may generate edges with other users that parallel the users real life relationships such as friends co workers partners and so forth. Other edges are generated when users interact with objects in the online system such as expressing interest in a page on the online system sharing a link with other users of the online system and commenting on posts made by other users of the online system .

In one embodiment an edge may include various features each representing characteristics of interactions between users interactions between users and objects or interactions between objects. For example features included in an edge describe rate of interaction between two users how recently two users have interacted with each other the rate or amount of information retrieved by one user about an object or the number and types of comments posted by a user about an object. The features may also represent information describing a particular object or user. For example a feature may represent the level of interest that a user has in a particular topic the rate at which the user logs into the online system or information describing demographic information about a user. Each feature may be associated with a source object or user a target object or user and a feature value. A feature may be specified as an expression based on values describing the source object or user the target object or user or interactions between the source object or user and target object or user hence an edge may be represented as one or more feature expressions.

The edge store also stores information about edges such as affinity scores for objects interests and other users. Affinity scores or affinities may be computed by the online system over time to approximate a user s interest in an object or another user in the online system based on the actions performed by the user. A user s affinity may be computed by the online system over time to approximate a user s affinity for an object interest and other users in the online system based on the actions performed by the user. Computation of affinity is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 978 265 filed on Dec. 23 2010 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 690 254 filed on Nov. 30 2012 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 689 969 filed on Nov. 30 2012 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 690 088 filed on Nov. 30 2012 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Multiple interactions between a user and a specific object may be stored as a single edge in the edge store in one embodiment. Alternatively each interaction between a user and a specific object is stored as a separate edge. In some embodiments connections between users may be stored in the user profile store or the user profile store may access the edge store to determine connections between users.

The interface generator generates one or more interfaces such as web pages including content from the online system . For example interfaces generated by the interface generator include images video profile information or other data. The interface generator also generates one or more interfaces allowing the online system to request information from users and for users to provide information to the online system via the client device and the network . For example the interface generator generates a form for a user to provide biographic information such as the user s age for inclusion in the user s user profile. When other users request a user s profile page the interface generator retrieves data from the profile store and generates a representation of the information in the user profile for presentation by the client device .

In one embodiment the interface generator generates a prompt including a suggestion to create a shared album for presentation to a user based on actions performed by the user or by other social networking system users connected to the user. For example the interface generator generates a prompt to create a shared album when a threshold number of users connected to each other through the social networking system check in at a location attend an event request access to an album or perform another suitable action the prompt is presented to one or more of the users that performed the action through any suitable communication channel e.g. push notification text message recommendation unit etc. . The interface generator also generates a shared album user interface allowing a user to create access and manage content in a shared album. Privacy settings associated with a shared album are retrieved and used to modify the content of the shared album user interface presented to a user. For example the actions associated with a shared album presented to various users by the shared album user interface vary depending on the privacy settings associated with the shared album and with different users. Examples of actions associated with a shared album presented to a user through the shared album user interface include inviting additional users to access the shared album identifying additional users authorized to access the shared album removing members from the shared album adding content items to the shared album removing content items from the shared album associating metadata with content items in the shared album associating metadata with the shared album modifying metadata associated with content items in the shared album or with the shared album deleting the shared album removing the user from accessing the shared album and merging the shared album with another album.

The interface generator may generate stories or other notifications describing actions associated with a shared album or with content items in a shared album e.g. adding photos commenting on the shared album etc. . Notifications describing actions associated with a shared album may be presented to members of the shared album through any suitable communication channel. For example notifications are presented as stores in a timeline or newsfeed shown to users authorized to access the shared album or are described by e mails text messages or other types of communication sent to users authorized to access the shared album. The interface generator is further described below in conjunction with .

The shared album store includes one or more privacy settings associated with various shared album and information identifying content items included in various shared albums. For example the shared album store includes a shared album identifier and content item identifiers associated with the shared album identifier that identify content items stored in the content store . A privacy model associated with a shared album identifies one or more privacy settings associated with the shared album by an owner of the shared album. Privacy settings associated with a shared album identify users authorized to access the shared album as well as actions associated with the shared album that various users authorized to access the shared album are authorized to perform.

In some embodiments the shared album store also includes information describing the owner of a shared album members of the shared album and users invited to access the shared album. For example identifiers of user profiles associated with a shared album s owner and the shared album s members as well as users invited to access the shared album are associated with the shared album s identifier. In one embodiment Information describing users authorized to access or invited to access a shared album is retrieved from the shared album store to identify users who are permitted to access a shared album and actions that various users accessing the shared album are capable of performing. For example a privacy setting associated with a shared album includes a description of one or more action types associated with an identifier of a user profile to indicate the types of actions associated with the shared album that a user corresponding to the identified user profile is authorized to perform. User identification information included in a privacy setting may also be used to identify users to receive notifications of actions associated with a shared album. Metadata or other information associated with a shared album may also be stored in the shared album store . For example a comment about an individual photo in a shared album is stored in the content store while a comment about the shared album itself is stored in the shared album store .

The web server links the social networking system via the network to the one or more client devices as well as to the one or more third party systems . The web server serves web pages as well as other web related content such as JAVA FLASH XML and so forth. The web server may receive and route messages between the social networking system and the client device for example instant messages queued messages e.g. email text messages short message service SMS messages or messages sent using any other suitable messaging technique. A user may send a request to the web server to upload information e.g. images or videos that is stored in the content store . Additionally the web server may provide application programming interface API functionality to send data directly to native client device operating systems such as IOS ANDROID WEBOS or RIM .

The social networking system may also prompt a user to create a shared album based on actions associated with the user or actions associated with other social networking system users connected to the user. In one embodiment the interface generator provides a notification to a user prompting the user to create a shared album if the user performs one or more actions. For example a user is prompted to create a shared album if a user checks in at a location where other users connected to the user have also checked in if a threshold number of users connected to each other are associated with a content item or with content items having one or more common characteristics e.g. connected users are tagged in photos taken at the same location and time if a user requests access to an album that is not a shared album or if the user uploads a content item associated with an event. In one embodiment if a user uploads a content item associated with entity having a user profile maintained by the social networking system an administrator or the event is notified of the upload and may sponsor presentation a prompt to the uploading user to add the content to a shared album owned by the entity. For example if a user uploads a photo taken at a Giants baseball game an administrator of the user profile for the Giants may compensate the social networking system to prompt the user to add the photo to a shared album owned by the Giants.

In addition to receiving a request to create a shared album the social networking system may receive a request from an album owner to make an existing album a shared album a request to merge an existing album with an existing shared album or a request from an owner of a shared album to merge an existing shared album with another existing shared album. If a request to make an existing album a shared album is received metadata stored by the social networking system and associated with the existing album or with content items within the album are preserved. For example if a user requests to convert the user s photo album into a shared album feedback and comments associated with individual photos in the photo album are preserved and remain associated with the photographs in the shared album and feedback and comments associated with the photo album in its entirety remain associated with the shared album. If a request to merge an existing unshared album with an existing shared album is received the metadata associated with the existing unshared album may be deleted while metadata associated with content items in the existing album is preserved. For example if the social networking system receives a request to merge an unshared album with a shared album comments associated with the unshared album are deleted while comments associated with individual content items in the unshared album and comments associated with the shared album and its content items are preserved in the merged album. Privacy settings of the shared album created by merging an unshared album with a shared album are specified as the privacy settings of the original shared album.

If the social networking system receives a request to merge existing shared albums into a single shared album the privacy settings of the merged shared album may remain the same if the original shared albums have the same privacy settings. In one embodiment confirmation of the privacy settings for the merged shared album is requested from owners of each shared album to be merged e.g. confirmation may be requested from an owner of one of the shared albums to be merged confirmation may be requested from the owners of each of the shared albums to be merged etc. the privacy settings are associated with the merged shared album when confirmation is received. However if the privacy settings of the shared albums to be merged differ privacy settings associated with one of the shared albums may be initially specified as the privacy settings associated with the merged shared album. In one embodiment confirmation of the privacy settings for the merged shared album is requested from owners associated with one or more of the shared albums to be merged e.g. confirmation may be requested from an owner of one of the shared albums to be merged confirmation may be requested from the owners of each of the shared albums to be merged etc. when confirmation of the privacy settings is received the privacy settings are applied to the merged shared album. The metadata associated one or more of the original shared albums may be deleted while metadata associated with content items included in the shared albums is preserved alternatively metadata associated with each of the shared albums may be preserved and included in the merged shared album along with metadata associated with content items included in the original shared albums.

When the social networking system receives the request to create a shared album from a user options associated with the shared album are presented and information identifying the user as the owner of the shared album is stored. For example an identifier associated with the shared album is included in the shared album store and an identifier of the user profile associated with the user is associated with the shared album identifier along with an indication the user is the owner of the corresponding shared album. Examples of options presented are shown in the user interface of and include an interface for creating the content of the shared album options for specifying the layout of the shared album an interface for identifying members of the shared album or for identifying users to invite to access the shared album and an interface for specifying privacy settings determining access to content in the shared album by members as well as determining types of actions users authorized to access the shared album are authorized to perform.

Referring to the example user interface of an owner of a shared album may specify a title for the shared album and access an interface element to add to remove or to modify content items included in the shared album or metadata associated with content items included in the shared album. Additionally the interface for creating the shared album content shown in presents content items included in the shared album . Any suitable type of content item may be included in a shared album. Examples of types of content items included in a shared album include image data audio data video data and other types of media data. An owner of a shared album may organize the content items included in the shared album based on any suitable criteria. For example if photos are included in a shared album an owner of the shared album may organize the photos in the shared album based on the titles of the photos the time the photos were taken the users who provided the photos to the social networking system the location in which the photos were taken or the number of likes or comments associated with the photos. The interface for creating the shared album content shown in also includes a membership interface element allowing an owner of a shared album to add or remove members associated with the shared album or to invite additional social networking system users to become members of the shared album. The owner may also specify additional owners of the shared album or invite additional social networking system users to become owners of the shared album via the membership interface element .

In one embodiment privacy settings for accessing content items in a shared album are classified as public private or intermediate. A private privacy setting limits access to content items in the shared album to only members of the shared album. Social networking system users become members of a shared album by being identified by the owner of the shared album or by accepting an invitation sent by the social networking system on behalf of the shared album owner to become a member of the shared album. A public privacy setting allows all social networking system users access to content items in the shared album. An intermediate privacy setting allows members and specified users of the social networking system e.g. users connected to members of the shared album to view the content of the shared album. For example using an intermediate privacy setting an owner identifies characteristics of users authorized to access content items in a shared album. Examples of characteristics of users authorized to access a shared album include a connection to a user identified by a privacy setting as authorized to access the shared album a connection to an owner of the shared album a type of connection to a user identified by the privacy setting authorized to access the shared album and a type of connection to the owner of the shared album. As a specific example a shared album owner limits access to the shared album to members of the shared album and users connected to members of the shared album through an intermediate privacy setting. For private and intermediate privacy settings a social networking system user associated with content items included in a shared album e.g. users tagged in photos included in a shared album who is not a member of the shared album may be permitted to access content items associated with the user or associated with another user connected to the user but not permitted to access other content items included in the shared album.

A shared album owner may specify privacy settings authorizing different members of the shared album to perform different actions associated with the shared album. For example privacy settings specified for a particular member allow that member to add tags to photos that the member did not provide to the shared album while privacy settings associated with other members limit those members to adding tags to photos those members provided to the shared album. Examples of types actions associated with a shared album authorized by one or more privacy settings include allowing members to add other members allowing members to add content items allowing members to associated tag with content items allowing members to specify metadata e.g. indications of preferences for a content item comments etc. associated with content items allowing members to delete content items they provided to the shared album and allowing members to delete or modify metadata associated with content items they provided to the shared album. show examples of interface elements presented to various members depending on their associated privacy settings depending on the privacy settings associated with a member. In the example user interfaces of a content item addition interface element a member addition interface element a tag addition interface element a metadata addition interface element and an interface element for requesting withdrawal of a user s authorization to access a shared album are shown. However in other embodiments other suitable interface elements may be presented to a member by a user interface depending on the privacy settings associated with the member.

The social networking system receives selections of options from the owner associated with shared album and generates the shared album based on the received selections. Content items identified by the users as well as privacy settings ownership information and membership information received from the owner associated with shared album are used to generate the shared album. When the shared album is generated it is accessible to the owner and to the additional users of the social networking system authorized to access the shared album. In various embodiments users authorized to access the shared album are notified when the shared album is generated . For example a story describing generation of the shared album is presented in a newsfeed or timeline presented to users authorized to access the shared album. The example user interface of shows an example of a notification presented presented to users authorized to access the shared album. Users authorized to access the shared album may be notified of generation of shared album through any suitable communication channel e.g. push notification text message e mail etc. .

As described above owners and members of a shared album perform a variety of actions associated with the shared album via the shared album user interface as illustrated in the examples of . When a user accesses the shared album privacy settings associated with the shared album are retrieved from the shared album store to determine whether the user is authorized to access content items included in the shared album and to identify types of actions associated that the user is authorized to perform and interface elements for performing suitable actions are presented to the user. As described above an owner of a shared album may authorize additional users to access a shared album add or remove content items from the shared album add or modify tags associated with content items from the shared album add additional owners to the shared album withdrawal other users authorization to access the shared album rescind invitations for other users to access the shared album delete content items included in the shared album or delete the shared album. Depending on the privacy settings associated with a member of the shared album the member may authorize other users to access the shared album add content items to a shared album add or modify tags associated with content items in the shared album or delete content items or metadata provided to the shared album by the member. Members may elect to have their authorization to access the shared album removed by e.g. by selecting an interface element for requesting withdrawal of a user s authorization to access a shared album as shown in . However a member may not delete a shared album unless all other members including the owner or owners have rescinded authorization to access the shared album.

An owner or members of a shared album may perform various actions associated with the shared album such as downloading the shared album or individual content items from the shared albums viewing additional members of the shared album and electing not to receive notifications associated with the shared album sent by the social networking system . In one embodiment notifications describing actions performed by users of the social networking system and associated with the shared album or with content items included in a shared album e.g. inviting adding other members expressing a preference for a content item in a shared album providing comments adding content items to the shared album etc. . The notifications of actions associated with the shared album may be presented to social networking system users authorized to access the shared album using any suitable communication channel e.g. via a news feed via a timeline via a text message via an e mail via presentation in an activity log etc. .
