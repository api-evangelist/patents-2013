Broadband wireless systems are in a rapidly evolutionary phase in terms of the development of various technologies development of various applications deployment of various services and generation of many important standards in the field. Although there are many factors to be considered in the design of these systems the key factors have been the bandwidth utilization efficiency due to the limited bandwidth allocation flexibility in operation and robustness of the communication link in the presence of various disturbances while achieving the specified performance. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Accessing OFDM techniques offer efficient bandwidth utilization and provide some immunity against one of the most common type of distortion viz. the distortion due to the multipath propagation environment. Therefore the OFDM techniques have been adapted in many wireless communication standards such as the World wide Interoperability for Microwave ACCESS Wimax digital audio broadcasting DAB digital video broadcasting terrestrial DVB T Long Term Evolution LTE etc.

One of the advantages of the OFDM system is the mitigation of a major source of distortion present in high data rate wireless communication links namely the inter symbol interference ISI achieved by reducing the symbol period by the use of multiple carrier transmission. However the use of a large number of carriers based on the orthogonality property in the OFDM system makes the performance of the system very sensitive to any carrier frequency offsets introduced for example by the Doppler shifts encountered in the wireless channels. The proper operation of the OFDM system requires means for precise estimate of the Doppler that may be different for different carriers in the frequency selective fading channel and means to mitigate such a Doppler effect from the received OFDM signal. Various methods exist in the prior art to solve this problem.

An outstanding problem arising with the use of a relatively large number N of carriers used in the OFDM signal is a relatively high peak to average power ratio resulting in a much reduced radio frequency RF power amplifier efficiency. Due to the inherent saturation in the RF power amplifier the signal with amplitude exceeding the input linear range of the amplifier is clipped or distorted. In order to keep the distortion to some specified limit arrived at by the signal to distortion plus noise power ratio considerations the output RF power is backed off from the maximum available power at the amplifier output and higher is the peak to average power ratio of the signal at the amplifier input larger is the required back off in the output power. The output back off concurrently also results in the reduction of the DC to RF power conversion efficiency of the RF power amplifier thus increasing the drain on the battery or any other power supply source in the mobile devices. Another problem arising due to distortion caused by the amplifier is the spreading of the spectrum of the OFDM signal outside the allocated band. Thus there has been strong motivation to come up with methods to reduce the peak to average power ratio of the OFDM signal without causing any distortion in the process of transformation or losing in terms of bandwidth or other important efficiency measures.

Among the various methods to reduce the peak to average power ratio of the OFDM signal is the clipping method wherein the signal above a certain specified value is clipped. This is similar to the clipping by the amplifier and thus introduces distortion however clipping and filtering the signal before inputting to the RF amplifier may mitigate the problem of spectrum spreading that is encountered by the clipping caused by the amplifier. Moreover by using adaptive threshold in clipping some possible reduction in distortion may be achieved.

The selective mapping SLM method of PAPR reduction consists of forming K vectors P q 1 2 . . . Q for some integer Q with the ielement of the vector Pselected equal to P exp j j square root over 1 i 0 1 . . . N 1 with the dimension of the modulation symbol vector X k equal to N. The phase is selected in a random manner with a uniform probability density function over the interval 0 2 . The set of vectors thus formed is made known to the receiver in advance. For any time k the modulation symbol vector X k is component wise multiplied by each of the Q vectors Presulting in the modified vector X k q 1 2 . . . Q. This follows evaluation the inverse fast Fourier transform IFFT x k of X k and computing the peak to average power ratio of the OFDM modulation signal vector x k for q 1 2 . . . Q. The vector x k with the minimum PAPR is selected for transmission with the corresponding index qmade available to the receiver as a side information.

In the partial transmit sequence PTS method the set of indices 0 through N 1 is partitioned into V disjoint subsets S v 1 2 . . . V wherein each of the V subsets has N V indices. For v equal to 1 through V a vector X k of length N is obtained with all its elements equal to 0 except the ones with indices in the subset Sthat are selected to be equal to the corresponding elements of the vector X k resulting in

In the dummy sequence insertion DSI method of the PAPR reduction the vector X k is comprised of Nmodulation symbols and N N N dummy symbols resulting in X k X k X k wherein T denotes the matrix transpose and X k and X k are the vectors of length Nand Nand comprised of the modulation symbols and dummy symbols respectively. The DSI method results in a reduction of the bandwidth efficiency by a factor of N N however it does not require any side information. The selection of the dummy sequence is comprised of an initial step and a recursive step that modifies the dummy sequence until the PAPR of x k FX K is below a threshold or the number of recursions exceeds some maximum permissible number of recursions. Four different methods for the selection of the dummy sequence have been suggested in. In the first method the dummy sequence is comprised of a complementary sequence with different complementary sequences selected in the recursive step. In another method the initial dummy sequence is selected to be an all 0 or an all 1 sequence with the recursion step comprised of sequentially flipping the dummy sequence bits until the PAPR below the threshold value is achieved or the number of recursions exceed a specified limit.

In the method of selective scrambling the message bit sequence is scrambled by each of the four m sequences that are not cyclically shifted versions of each other with the two bits representing the index q of the m sequence appended to the scrambled sequence. The scrambled sequences are modulated into QPSK symbols resulting in the OFDM modulation symbol vectors X k which are inverse Fourier transformed resulting in the OFDM modulated signal vectors x k for q 1 2 3 and 3. The vector among the 4 vectors x k with a minimum PAPR is selected for transmission. This method is very similar to the SMI method with the difference that it is the bit sequence that is scrambled instead of the QPSK modulation symbol sequence in the SMI method.

In the block coding schemes for the PAPR reduction the OFDM modulation symbol vector X k is transformed using one of the block error correction codes. For example the use of complementary sequence codes is taught by H. Ochiai and H. Imai in MDPSK OFDM with Highly Power Efficient Block Codes for Frequency Selective Fading Channels IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology Vol. 49 No. 1 January 2000 pp. 74 82. While the use of the block error correction codes to reduce the PAPR while simultaneously achieving the error correction capability of the code is of interest however the presently studied schemes based on block error correction codes may require relatively very low code rate codes resulting in relatively very poor bandwidth efficiency at relatively high number of carriers as concluded by H. Ochiai and H. Imai in their teachings. In the precoding techniques proposed earlier the OFDM modulation symbol vector X k is pre multiplied by a fixed orthogonal matrix P resulting in the transformed symbol vector X k PX k . The inverse Fourier transform of the transformed symbol vector provides the OFDM signal vector x k for the transmission. The precoding matrix P is signal independent and is known to the receiver. The orthogonal transforms that have been used in the prior art are the discrete Hartley transform DHT discrete cosine transform and the Walsh Hadamard transform WHT .

The prior methods of the PAPR reduction provide some improvement in the PAPR especially for low order modulation schemes such as the QPSK modulation. However for high order modulation such as 64 QAM or 256 QAM and for relatively large number of subcarriers N most of the prior methods provide only a limited reduction in the PAPR with the resulting PAPR significantly higher compared to that for the case of single carrier modulation. Some of the prior schemes have poor bandwidth efficiency while others require extensive computational effort. It is desirable to have PAPR reduction systems and methods that achieve a PAPR that is comparable to that for the case of single carrier modulation thus almost completely eliminating the PAPR penalty arising from the use of multi carrier modulations methods such as the OFDM system have high bandwidth efficiency are computationally efficient and provide for a tradeoff between the PAPR performance and the computational requirements. The systems and methods of this invention possess these and various other benefits.

The following description is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention and sets forth the best modes contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention. Various modifications however will remain readily apparent to those skilled in the art since the generic principles of the present invention have been defined herein specifically to provide systems and methods for multi transform OFDM systems with reduced peak to average power ratio signals.

Referring to the information baseband symbols s k are inputted to the serial to parallel converter . The serial to parallel converter splits the in general complex valued information baseband symbol sequence s k is split into N subsequences s k with s k s n n kN m 1 m 1 2 . . . N 1 k 0 1 2 . . . and N is any positive integer possibly equal to some integer power of 2.

Referring to the serial to parallel converter provides the modulation symbol vector X k s k s k . . . s k with T denting the transpose operation to the Ntransform blocks . . . Nwherein the number of transform blocks may be selected to be an integer between 4 and 16. Throughout the description of this invention the notations a b . . . N and 1 2 . . . N for any integer N are equivalent and both refer to the enumeration between 1 and N. The Ntransform blocks transform the modulation symbol vector X k by Ndifferent transforms providing the Ntransformed symbol vectors X k X k . . . X k at the outputs wherein 1 20 1 2 . . . 1 

In 1 Pfor n 1 2 . . . Nare some appropriately selected N N nonsingular matrices. In various embodiments of the invention the matrices P n 1 2 . . . N may be selected to be some orthonormal matrices. For example with N 4 the 4 selected matrices may the identity matrix Icorresponding to no transform the Walsh Hadamard transform WHT matrix P the discrete cosine transform DCT matrix P and the discrete Hartley transform DHT matrix P.

The use of scalar 1 square root over N in 2 5 makes these matrices orthonormal with PP Ior P Pfor any of the transform matrices Pin 2 5 with H denoting the matrix conjugate transpose and Idenoting the N N identity matrix. Due to symmetry the matrices PH PW and PC are also unitary with P P. In some embodiments of the invention the normalizing scalar that is a multiple of 1 square root over N may be dropped in 2 5 leaving the transform matrices to be orthogonal but not orthonormal.

The use of the orthogonal or orthonormal matrices permits the use of Fast transform techniques permitting the matrix vector multiplication in order N log N operation instead of requiring order Noperations for obtaining the transformed symbol vector X k . The number of operations can be further reduced by exploiting the known relationships between various transforms. In particular the various transforms may be related to the Fourier transform or the inverse Fourier transform. For example for a real valued sequence X k its DHT transform may be obtained in terms of the inverse Fourier transform as DHT 1 square root over 1 6 In 5 denotes the inverse Fourier transform IFFT and Re z for any complex quantity denotes the real part of z. With X k X k j X k its DHT transform may be evaluated as DHT 1 1 7 Thus computing the IFFT of X k and X k separately permits a direct computation of the DHT form 11 requiring only order N operations. The required IFFT of X k may be evaluated from 8 . 8 

The computations of IFFT of X k from 8 does not require any more computations compared to directly computing the IFFT of X k . In the same manner the WHT of X k may be computed in terms of the FFT or IFFT of X k . For example Y. Tadokoro and T. Higuchi in Discrete Fourier Transform Computation via the Walsh Transform IEEE Transactions on ASSP Vol. ASSP 26 No. 3 June 1978 pp. 236 240 included by reference with this application teach a method of computing the Fourier transform of a real sequence in terms of its Walsh Hadamard transform. The relationship given in the teachings of Y. Tadokoro and T. Higuchi may also be used for the computation of WHT in terms of the IFFT. For example the equation 6 of Tadokoro relates the WHT to the FFT for the case of N 8 requiring only 10 real multiplications equivalent to less than 3 complex multiplications. For the case of N 4 the order of transforms and IFFT may be performed as shown in so as to minimize the total number of the required computations.

Referring to the transformed symbol vector X k is inputted to the respective IFFT block providing the transformed OFDM signal vector x k at the output for n 1 2 . . . N. The IFFT block evaluates the N point inverse Fourier transform of the input with the output x k related to X k by 1 2 . . . 0 1 2 . . . 9 

The matrix Pin 9 is an orthonormal matrix and x k may be evaluated by the inverse fast Fourier transform algorithm similar to the computation of the other transforms such as the DHT etc.

The total computational requirements for the evaluation of the Ntransformed OFDM signal vectors x k x k . . . x k may be minimized by using the relationships between the various transforms. shows the flow diagram for the computation of transformed OFDM signal vectors x k x k x k and x k for the case of N 4 transforms comprised of the identity transform DHT WHT and the DCT transforms so as to minimize the total number of computations.

In 11 x k denotes the melement of the transformed OFDM signal vectors x k and the denominator in 11 is an estimate of the average power present in the elements of the vector x k . The minimum PAPR evaluator block minimizes the PAPRover the index n and provides the minimizing index nto the input selector block . For any orthonormal transform matrix P and any complex valued vector the norm of the transformed vector is equal to the norm of the vector as may be inferred from 12 .

From the orthonormal properties of the transform matrices Pand the IFFT matrix Pit follows that the norm of all the transformed OFDM signal vectors x k n 1 2 . . . Nare all equal with 1 2 . . . 13 

From 13 it follows that the denominator term in 11 is independent of n and the PAPRmay be minimized equivalently by 14 and thereby minimizing the computational requirement in the evaluation of the minimizing index n.

Referring to the transformed OFDM signal vectors x k n 1 2 . . . Nare inputted to the input selector block that provides the transformed OFDM signal vector with index n x k to the parallel to serial converter block .

In various embodiments of the invention the number of orthonormal transforms may be greater than 4. The increased number of transforms may be obtained for example by the appropriate cascades of the WHT DCT and DHT transforms with the corresponding matrices P P and P. For any pair orthonormal matrices Pand Pone obtains 15 

From 15 the product of any two orthonormal matrices is also orthonormal. As an example of N 16 orthonormal transforms Table 1 lists 16 distinct transforms obtained by the cascades of the transforms selected from the basic group of transforms comprised of the WHT DCT and DHT transforms.

In 16 each multiplication by the matrix P i 1 2 3 may be performed by the use of fast transform algorithms. Referring to and Table 1 it may be inferred that the sequence of computations of the Ntransformed symbol vectors X k may be so arranged such that each of the Ntransforms requires only 1 additional fast transform algorithm application as for example in the computation of PP P X the transformed symbol vector P P X may be already available and so on. The total computational requirement in the evaluation of the Ntransformed symbol vectors X k is of the order NN log N . The relationship among the IFFT DWT DCT and DHT transforms may also be used for the more general case of Nto further reduce the total computational requirements as illustrated by for the specific case of N 4.

In various embodiments of the invention the threshold Vmay be set equal to some appropriately selected non zero value that is expected to be satisfied by the OFDM Pc DSI system. For example the complementary cumulative distribution function CCDF plots of the PAPR dB may be obtained by simulations for the case of V 0 i.e. with exhaustive search over the Nnumber of sequences of the dummy symbols for the OFDM Pc DSI system. The CCDF plot of the standard OFDM system that corresponds to the case of identity transform with the dummy sequence set equal to 0 is obtained as well by simulations. For any information symbol vector X k the PAPR of its inverse Fourier transform denoted by PAPRis evaluated and the corresponding value of the CCDF denoted by CCDFfrom the CCDF plot for the standard OFDM system is obtained. The expected value of the PAPR for the OFDM Pc DSI system is the value of the PAPR obtained from the CCDF plot for the OFDM Pc DSI system corresponding to the CCDF value of CCDF. Denoting this value by CCDFthe threshold Vmay be selected equal to CCDF with selected to be some small positive number for example 0.1 dB. With the selection of nonzero value for V the output is logic 1 when the value of the PAPRis smaller than the threshold value Vor the number of iterations ion the selection of the dummy sequence X k i is equal to N. With the selection of nonzero value for V the number of iterations ion the selection of the dummy sequence is variable bounded by N. In some embodiments of the invention the threshold Vmay be set equal to some appropriately selected non zero constant.

Referring to the reset input is inputted to the delay providing the enable input to the gate . The delay compensates for the delay introduced by the buffer. At the end of the dummy sequence selection process that occurs when either i Nor PAPR

Referring to the transformed OFDM signal vector x k is inputted to the cascade of the parallel to serial converter guard interval insertion block the band limiting filter and the carrier modulator providing the OFDM band pass signal v t at the output of the carrier modulator . The operation of the cascade of the blocks and is identical to that described with reference to . For the case of variable number of iterations of the dummy sequence selection corresponding to a nonzero threshold V a dynamic buffer not shown may be present between the output and the parallel to serial converter so as to equalize for the variable delay introduced by the dummy sequence selection process. The OFDM band pass signal v t may be connected to the cascade of RF power amplifier and antenna not shown for the transmission of the OFDM signal.

In various embodiments of the invention one of the various possible methods for the selection of the number of dummy sequences N the set of dummy sequences and the order in which the dummy sequences from the set are selected may be used. For example in one such method the number Nmay be set equal to N Mwhere M is the order of modulation equal to the number of symbols in the signal constellation of the baseband modulator and Nis the number of dummy symbols. In alternative embodiments of the invention the number Nmay be set equal to N N where Nis the number of points in an appropriately selected subset of the symbols in the signal constellation of the baseband modulator . For example Nmay be selected equal to 4 corresponding to the 4 corner points of the signal constellation diagram irrespective of M. Simulation results performed on the OFDM P DSI system have shown that the Nvalue of higher than 1 provides only very marginal improvement over the case of N 1. In various embodiments of the invention the number Nmay be set to a value between 4 and M.

For the case of threshold Vselected equal to 0 the selection of the dummy sequence over the set of Ndummy sequences is done in an exhaustive manner and thus the order in which the dummy sequence is selected from the set may be arbitrarily selected. In the embodiments of the invention employing a nonzero Vthe order of selection of the dummy sequence may be optimized so as to minimize the average number of iterations of the dummy sequence selection. For example the histogram of the optimum dummy sequence selected may be obtained from simulations with Vset equal to 0 and the selection of the dummy sequence may proceed from the most probable sequence to the least probable sequence resulting in minimum value of the average number of iterations of the dummy sequence selection.

Referring to the selection over the set of Ntransforms and Ndummy sequences is performed in a sequential manner by minimizing the PAPR over the Ntransforms for any of the selected dummy sequence and repeating the process over the Ndummy sequences to obtain an overall optimum transform and dummy sequence. In alternative embodiments of the invention the procedure may be reversed by minimizing the PAPR over the dummy sequences for one of the Ntransforms and repeating the procedure over the Ntransforms. Both the order of selection of the transform and that of dummy sequence may be performed on the basis of their respective histograms obtained by for example simulations performed with Vset equal to 0 and the search performed exhaustively over both the Ntransforms and Ndummy sequences so as to minimize the overall average computational requirements.

The computational requirements of the optimum transform DSI method can be significantly reduced by an appropriate organization of the computations. The transformed OFDM signal vector x k may be expressed as

In 29b yis the vector of length Nwith its elements equal to the dummy symbols and Pis the N N sub matrix of Pcomprised of the Ncolumns of the matrix Pwith indices j j . . . j i.e. the matrix Pis given by

In 31 s k denotes the dummy symbol and pis a column vector given by the Fourier transform of the jcolumn of Pwherein j is the index of the dummy symbol in the OFDM symbol vector X k . The vector may be pre computed and stored for use in the real time application. Thus the change of the dummy symbol requires just the multiplication of a fixed vector pby the selected symbol for the selected transform matrix P rather than requiring an N point IFFT and orthonormal transform computation for each symbol selection and each value of n resulting in considerable saving in the computational requirements.

The information about the selected transform index n may be imbedded into the OFDM signal by using one or more symbols of the OFDM frame for this purpose. For the case wherein the order of modulation M is greater than equal to 64 and the number of transforms Nis less than or equal to 16 one symbol is adequate for carrying this information. In fact for M 64 significant error correction coding on the transform index may be used to protect against error. Using one symbol for carrying the information about the index n the number of zeros in the vector X k is made equal to N 1 . Assuming that the information about the index n is contained in the elements i i . . . iof the modulation symbol vector X k the vector to be added to the modified information signal vector x k equal to the IFFT of the X k PX k is given by 32

The multiplier multiplies the dummy symbols sub vector Y k i by the matrix Pproviding the product to the adder for n 1 2 . . . N. Referring to the vector qgiven by 32 33 is inputted to the adder . The adder sums the inputs and providing the transformed OFDM signal vector x k i n at the output of the adder for n 1 2 . . . N.

Referring to the transformed OFDM signal vectors x k i n n 1 2 . . . Nare inputted to the input selector . The input selector is provided with the transform index nby the minimum PAPR evaluator block and the enable input of the input selector is connected to the output of the decision block . When the enable input is equal to logic 1 the input selector selects one of the inputs corresponding to the index n nand makes the output x k i to the buffer . The enable input is also connected not shown to the buffer enabling the storage of the buffer input whenever the input has a value of logic 1.

Referring to the operation of the minimum PAPR evaluator block the decision blocks and the minimum function block and the delay block to generate the enable signal and the optimum transform index nare as explained with reference to and results in the selection of the dummy symbols sub vector Y k i out of the Npossible vectors and the selection of the transform matrix Pout of the Npossible transform matrices to provide the minimum possible value of the PAPR.

The embodiment of requires only Nnumber of orthonormal transforms and IFFTs irrespective of the number Nof possible dummy sequences resulting in a very significant reduction in the computational requirements over that of . Additionally the embodiment of does not require any side information channel for the transmission of the index nof the optimum transformation matrix P.

Referring to the output of the buffer is inputted to the gate . The enable input of the gate is connected to the delayed reset input . The reset input tales value logic 1 at the end of the dummy sequence selection process and enables the gate to connect the input to the output x k .

Referring to the optimum transformed OFDM signal vector x k is inputted to the cascade of the parallel to serial converter guard interval insertion block the band limiting filter and the carrier modulator providing the OFDM band pass signal v t at the output of the carrier modulator . The operation of the cascade of the blocks and is identical to that described with reference to . For the case of variable number of iterations of the dummy sequence selection corresponding to a nonzero threshold V a dynamic buffer not shown may be present between the output and the parallel to serial converter so as to equalize for the variable delay introduced by the dummy sequence selection process.

Referring to the selection of the indexing symbol vector in the evaluation of the vector qused to encode the transform index n for n 1 2 . . . Nis made from the signal constellation diagram of the complex baseband signal s k so as to minimize the probability of error in the detection of n at the OFDM receiver. For example for the case of 16 QAM modulation with the signal constellation diagram shown in N 4 and N 1 the indexing symbols may be selected to be the points with indices 0 3 12 and 15 resulting in a minimum distance among the indexing symbols equal to 3d where d is the distance among the adjacent symbols in . With two symbols for indexing N 2 and N 16 the transform index n may be encoded by a code word comprised of a pair of symbols selected from the set of symbols with indices 0 3 12 15 in resulting in a minimum Euclidean distance among the code words equal to 3d square root over 2 4.3 d making the probability of detection error very small.

As another example for the case of 64 QAM modulation with the signal constellation diagram shown in N 16 and N 1 the indexing symbols may be selected as shown by the shaded circles in resulting in a minimum distance among the indexing symbols equal to 2d compared to the minimum Euclidean distance equal to d among the symbols in the complete signal constellation diagram thereby minimizing the probability of detection error in the transform index n in the OFDM receiver. In some cases more than one indexing symbol may be used for further reduction of the probability of detection error. For example using two symbols for indexing the transform index n may be encoded by a code word comprised of a pair of symbols selected from the set of symbols with indices 0 7 56 63 in resulting in a minimum Euclidean distance among the code words equal to 7d square root over 2 10d making the probability of detection error extremely small.

In the embodiment of the invention given in the transform indexing symbol vector is imbedded in the transformed OFDM signal vector x k and introduces some self noise in the detection of the index nat the OFDM receiver. The self noise may be eliminated in an alternative embodiment of the invention where in the multi transform DSI implementation the N N transform matrices Pare replaced by partitioned matrices shown in 35 for the example case of N 1 with the indexing symbol sappearing in the first element of the transformed symbol vector.

In 35 denotes a row vector of zeros of length N 1 and is the N 1 N 1 orthonormal transform matrix. In the example case of Ni 1 the vector qin is replaced by the vector q Pswhere Pdenotes the first column of the IFFT transform matrix P. Equivalently the indexing symbol sis added to the first component of the transformed symbol vector X k i that is the FFT of the transformed OFDM signal vector x k i if .

In the alternative embodiment of the invention the indexing symbol vector is not a part of the orthonormal transform operation and may be detected more directly at the OFDM receiver from the first component of the modulation symbol vector X k obtained after performing the FFT operation on the received OFDM signal vector x k . The same partitioning approach may be applied for the transmission of the pilot symbols. For example if in the example of N 1 as in 35 and with one pilot symbol used in the OFDM system for the synchronization purposes not shown in appearing in the last element of the modulated symbol vector X k i the matrix Pmay be partitioned as in 36 .

In 36 denotes a row vector of zeros of length N 2 and is the N 2 N 2 transform matrix. The partitioned matrix Papproach may be applied to the case where the indexing and pilot symbols appear as nonadjacent elements of the transformed symbol vector X k i 

Referring to the RF to complex baseband converter block down converts the RF signal r t to complex baseband filters the down converted signal by a band limiting filter such as the square root raised cosine filter and converts the filtered signal to the digital form providing the resulting OFDM signal g n to the guard interval deletion block . The guard interval deletion block removes the guard interval from each of the OFDM frame of length by deleting Nsamples from the OFDM frame of length N N samples of the OFDM signal g n and provides the serial OFDM signal g n to the serial to parallel converter . Referring to the serial to parallel converter arranges consecutive N samples of the OFDM frame in to the elements of the transformed OFDM signal vector x k corresponding to the optimum transform index nselected at the OFDM transmitter.

Referring to transformed OFDM signal vector x k is inputted to the FFT block . The FFT block evaluates the fast Fourier transform of the input providing the transformed symbol vector X k to the transform index detection block . The transform index detection block detects the transform index nselected at the OFDM transmitter from the indexing symbol vector imbedded in the transformed symbol vector X k and provides the transform index nto the bank of inverse transforms block .

Referring to the transformed symbol vector X k is inputted to the inverse transform block . The bank of inverse transforms block is comprised of a bank of Ntransforms that are inverse of the corresponding Ntransforms at the OFDM transmitter of . For the case of orthonormal transform with matrix P its inverse transform matrix is given by P where H denotes the conjugate transpose operation. For the more specific case of real symmetric orthonormal matrices P as is the case wherein the various transforms are obtained by the cascades of the WHT DCT and DHT transforms P P.

Referring to the inverse transform block selects the transform with matrix P from bank of Ninverse transforms with transform index nand multiplies the transformed symbol vector X k by the matrix P providing the modulation symbol vector X k at the output to the dummy indexing symbols deletion block . Referring to the dummy indexing symbols deletion block deletes the elements of the modulation symbol vector X k containing the dummy indexing symbols and the symbols corresponding to the pilot signals and provides the information modulation symbol vector k of length Nto the parallel to serial converter . The parallel to serial converter arranges the components of the vector k into a serial stream k that constitutes the estimate of the information baseband symbol stream s k in .

Referring to the estimate k of the information baseband symbol is inputted to the baseband demodulator block . The baseband demodulator block detects the baseband symbols on the basis of the signal constellation diagram of the baseband modulator at the OFDM transmitter of by mapping the estimate k into one of the points of the signal constellation diagram of the baseband modulator in the two dimensional signal space. For example the baseband modulator may be an M 64 QAM modulator with 64 points in the signal constellation diagram shown in .

The detection of the information baseband symbols may be based on for example the maximum likelihood criteria or the minimum distance criteria in the two dimensional signal space. The baseband demodulator block then may maps the detected baseband symbols into groups of m binary digits wherein m log M assumed to be an integer using the inverse of the map from group of m binary digits into 1 out of M possible information baseband symbols used in the baseband modulator at the OFDM transmitter. The baseband demodulator block may finally concatenate the groups of M binary digits into the serial stream circumflex over d k that constitutes the detected version of the user input data d k at the OFDM transmitter.

Referring to the detailed organization of the transform index detection block depends upon the mode of transmission of the transform index n. In case wherein the indexing symbol vector is a sub vector of size Nof the modulation symbol vector X k for example when the elements of the indexing symbol vector are the first Nelements of the modulation symbol vector X k the indexing symbol vector may be recovered by pre multiplying the transformed symbol vector X k by the matrix Jgiven by

In the absence of noise the indexing symbol vector may be obtained by pre multiplying the transformed symbol vector X k by the matrix J P . In the presence of noise the transform index nis obtained by minimization of the index r k over n as

In 39 Pdenotes the sub matrix of Pcomprised of the first Nrows of Pas for the orthonormal real symmetric matrix P P P. For the case of N 1 Pdenotes the first row Pof Pand sis complex scalar with r k given by 1 2 40 

In 40 k is the noise term. In the noise free case the substitution of X k PX k in 40 results in 0 41a 1 2 41b From 41b the mean squared value of r k n nmay be estimated as tilde over 42 

In 42 E denotes the expected value operation and tilde over is the vector obtained after deleting the first component of . From 41 42 it follows that in the absence of noise the optimization 38 always results in the correct detection of the transform index n. In the presence of noise there may be some nonzero probability of incorrect detection of the transform index n that is a function of the number of indexing symbols Nand the signal to noise power ratio . 43

The output of the multiplier is a sub vector of the transformed symbol vector X k of size Ni and is equal to the indexing symbol vector plus noise not shown in .

Simulation results on the PAPR performance of the multi transform OFDM system and the multi transform DSI system of the invention also referred to as the OFDM OP DSI System are presented. The complementary cumulative probability distribution function CCDF of the PAPR is obtained by simulation runs of 10OFDM frames. Thus the number of baseband symbols simulated in each run is equal to N 10. The simulation are performed with MQAM modulation with the number of points M in the signal constellation selected equal to 16 64 and 256. Performance results are presented for the case of M 64 the results for the other cases are similar and are not shown. In case of the dummy sequence insertion scheme the number of dummy symbols Nis limited to 1 in all of the simulation results as an increase in the length of the dummy sequence provides only marginal improvement at the cost of significant increase in computational complexity.

As may be inferred form for a CCDF value of 10 the multi transform OFDM system of the invention provides an improvement of about 1 dB over the discrete Hartley transform that has the best performance among all of the fixed transform methods of the prior art. It may be also inferred from that the PAPR performance improves with increasing Nand thus it may be possible to reduce the PAPR obtained with the multi transform OFDM system further by increasing Nbeyond 16. The graph labeled OFDM Pc DFT in refers to the case where the selected orthogonal transform is the FFT or DFT discrete Fourier transform with N 1. With the inverse of the FFT transform following the orthogonal transform the overall OFDM system in this case reduces to the case of the single carrier system with N 1.

Table 2 summarizes the PAPR at a CCDF value of 10for the OFDM Pc DSI system. In a different embodiment of the OFDM Pc MDSI system referred to as the OFDM Pc MDSI system for the purpose of minimizing the computational effort the optimum dummy symbol for the case of P I identity transform may be obtained first and the same dummy symbol used with all of the transforms. Table 2 includes the case of single carrier transmission for comparison and also lists the APAPR defined as the difference between the PAPR achieved with the OFDM Pc DSI method and that of the single carrier transmission at the CCDF value of 10.

As may be inferred from Table 2 the OFDM Pc DSI system with N 12 provides an improvement of 4.46 dB in PAPR over the OFDM with the resulting PAPR only 0.78 dB higher than for the single carrier transmission. With N 16 the improvement is 4.75 dB in PAPR over the OFDM with the resulting PAPR only 0.49 dB higher than for the single carrier transmission thus almost entirely eliminates the PAPR limitation of the OFDM system. It may be possible to reduce this gap of 0.49 dB further by increasing the number of dummy symbols to more than 1 and or by increasing the number of total transforms beyond 16 considered in the simulations. On the other hand the computational complexity can be significantly reduced by restricting the number of symbols Nfrom which the dummy symbol is selected at the cost of some increase in the PAPR. As shown in the table with N 4 and N 12 the reduction in PAPR is 4.18 dB compared to 4.46 dB with N 64. For the case of N 16 and N 4 the PAPR reduction is 4.70 dB compared to 4.75 dB with N 64 thus resulting in a negligible degradation in PAPR due to the reduction in Nfrom 64 to 4. However the reduction in Nfrom 64 to 4 results in a very significant reduction in the computational requirements.

The multi transform OFDM system of the invention provides a PAPR that is only about 0.5 dB worse than for the single carrier system with only moderate computational requirements practically eliminating the PAPR penalty incurred due to the use of traditional multi carrier OFDM system. The gap of about 0.5 dB may be further reduced by selecting the number of transforms Nto be higher than 16.
