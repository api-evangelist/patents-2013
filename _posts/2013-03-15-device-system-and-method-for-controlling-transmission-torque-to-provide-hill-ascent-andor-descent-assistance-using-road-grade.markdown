This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 611 948 entitled DEVICE SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING TRANSMISSION TORQUE TO PROVIDE HILL ASCENT AND OR DESCENT ASSISTANCE USING ROAD GRADE by Jared Shattuck et al. which was filed on Mar. 16 2012 the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present disclosure relates generally to transmission control systems and techniques and more specifically to devices systems and methods for controlling transmission torque to provide hill ascent and or descent control assistance.

Transmissions are used to transfer a drive torque from a drive unit to a load. For example in vehicular applications a vehicle transmission transfers the drive torque from the vehicle engine to the vehicle load. Some transmissions include a finite set of gears which may be selected to produce a specific transmission ratio. To do so the transmissions may include one or more clutches which may be engaged to select one or more gear sets to produce the required transmission ratio.

In automatic transmissions the operation of the transmission may be controlled by a transmission control module TCM which is often embodied as an electronic circuit. The transmission control module may select for example one or more gear sets by causing engagement of the corresponding clutches. The transmission control module may control the operation of the automatic transmission based on one or more operation signals such as transmission operation signals and engine operation signals. Such signals may be received by the transmission control module directly from the corresponding sensors. Alternatively some of the signals used by the transmission control module may be received indirectly from an engine control module ECM of the vehicle which monitors and controls the operation of the vehicle s engine. Further in some vehicles the transmission control module and the engine control module may be combined into or otherwise included in a powertrain control module PCM . In this way the transmission control module and the engine control module or powertrain control module operate together to control and monitor the operation of the vehicle s powertrain.

According to one aspect a transmission control module for controlling an automatic transmission of a vehicle may include a control circuit and a memory electrically coupled to the control circuit. The memory may have stored therein a plurality of instructions that when executed by the control circuit cause the control circuit to determine a clutch hold pressure sufficient to lock an output shaft of the automatic transmission to resist roll back of the vehicle as a function of a tractive effort of the vehicle and apply a clutch hold pressure to at least one clutch of the automatic transmission as a function of at least one of a transmission output speed signal indicative of a rotational output speed of the automatic transmission a throttle signal indicative of application of a throttle of the vehicle and a brake signal indicative of application of a brake of the vehicle.

In some embodiments the control circuit may determine the tractive effort of the vehicle as a function of a transmission output speed to vehicle speed ratio. For example the control circuit may receive a vehicle speed signal indicative of a speed of the vehicle and calculate the output speed to vehicle speed ratio as a function of the transmission output speed signal and the vehicle speed signal. Additionally or alternatively the control circuit may determine the tractive effort of the vehicle as a function of a vehicle mass of the vehicle. The control circuit may determine the vehicle mass by receiving a vehicle mass signal from a vehicle mass sensor and determine the vehicle mass based on the vehicle mass signal. Alternatively the control circuit may determine the vehicle mass by determining the vehicle mass of the vehicle using a load based shift scheduling algorithm.

Additionally or alternatively the control circuit may determine the tractive effort of the vehicle as a function of a road grade signal indicative of a grade of the road on which the vehicle is currently positioned.

The present disclosure is directed to a system and associated method for assisting the operation of a vehicle when the vehicle is attempting to traverse an incline or a decline e.g. during hill ascent or descent . With a typical vehicle the operator of the vehicle may experience an amount of roll back or roll forward of the vehicle when attempting to accelerate initially from a stationary or near stationary position while positioned on an incline or decline. For example when traversing a hill the typical vehicle may roll back some amount when the operator of the vehicle moves his her foot from the brake pedal to the accelerator pedal. As discussed in more detail below the illustrative control system and method assist the operation of a vehicle traversing such inclines declines by controlling a transmission of the vehicle so as to resist the rolling i.e. roll back or roll forward of the vehicle.

Referring now to in one embodiment an illustrative vehicle includes a drive train . The drive train includes a drive unit a transmission and a vehicle load which is driven by the transmission .

However in other embodiments the drive unit may be embodied as a spark ignition type internal combustion engine i.e. gasoline engine a hybrid engine electric motor combination or another source of rotational power. The drive unit includes a drive unit output shaft that provides rotational power to the transmission . Similarly the transmission includes an output shaft that provides rotational power to the vehicle load when the transmission is engaged i.e. is in a forward or reverse gear .

The transmission is illustratively embodied as an automatic transmission and is operable to transmit the rotational power from the drive unit to the vehicle load at various transmission ratios. The transmission ratio provided by the transmission is selected based on a gearing system . In the illustrative embodiment the gearing system is embodied as a planetary gearing system but other gearing system configurations may be used in other embodiments. The gearing system includes a plurality of gear sets which may be engaged to select a desired transmission ratio. Depending on the type of transmission one two or more gear sets may be engaged to achieve the desired transmission ratio. The gear sets of the gearing system are engaged via use of a clutch assembly of the transmission . The clutch assembly includes a plurality of clutches that may be applied to engage one or more gear sets. The specific number of gear sets of the gearing system and clutches of the clutch assembly may depend on the type of transmission the number of operational modes ranges and or criteria. For example in some eight speed transmissions the gearing system may include four planetary gear sets and five clutches e.g. C C C C and C which may be applied individually or in sets to select one or more of the gear sets.

As discussed above the illustrative vehicle includes a control system for controlling the transmission to provide assistance during hill ascent descent of the vehicle . The control system includes a transmission control module configured to control operation of the clutch assembly of the transmission to assist operation of the vehicle when the vehicle is attempting to traverse an incline or a decline e.g. during hill ascent or descent . To do so in one embodiment as discussed in more detail below the transmission control module is configured to determine and apply a clutch hold pressure to one or more clutches of the clutch assembly to lock the output shaft of the transmission to resist rolling of the vehicle when the vehicle is attempting to transverse an incline decline i.e. at initial acceleration from a stationary or near stationary position .

In the illustrative embodiment of the brake pressure sensor is coupled to the brake pedal or linkage thereof of the vehicle . Alternatively in embodiments in which the brake signal is indicative of an amount of pressure applied to the vehicle brakes the brake pressure sensor may be coupled to a brake air or hydraulic system of the vehicle to detect an amount of pressure within the brake air hydraulic system. Additionally in other embodiments the brake signal may be received by the transmission control module from another module of the vehicle rather than directly from the brake sensor .

In some embodiments the memory includes a plurality of instructions that are executed by the control circuit during operation of the transmission control module as discussed below.

Referring now to in one embodiment the transmission control module may be configured to execute a method for enabling hill ascent and or descent transmission control of the transmission . The method begins with block in which the transmission control module determines whether to enable the hill ascent descent transmission control feature. The enablement of the transmission control may be based on any one or more criteria such as user selection environmental conditions and or other criteria. If the transmission control module determines that the transmission control should not be enabled the method advances to block in which the hill ascent descent transmission control is disabled. However if the transmission control module determines that hill ascent descent transmission control should be enable the method advances to block .

In block the transmission control module compares the transmission output speed signal received from the transmission output sensor to a transmission speed threshold to determine whether the current rotational output speed of the transmission output shaft is below a maximum threshold i.e. whether the transmission is initially engaged to move the vehicle from a stationary or near stationary position . In the illustrative embodiment the transmission speed threshold is about 25 revolutions per minute but other transmission speed threshold values may be used in other embodiments based on any one or more criteria such as vehicle type vehicle mass transmission type locality and or the like. If the transmission output speed is determined to be greater than the transmission speed threshold the method advances to block in which the hill ascent descent transmission control is disabled. However if transmission output speed is determined to be equal to or less than the transmission speed threshold the method advances to block .

In block the transmission control module compares the throttle signal received from the engine throttle sensor or from the engine control module to a throttle low threshold to determine whether the vehicle is stopped or otherwise at a substantially stationary position. In the illustrative embodiment the low throttle threshold is set within the range of about 2 3 throttle displacement. Of course in other embodiments other throttle low thresholds may be used to determine whether the vehicle is stopped or near stationary. If the throttle signal is determined to be greater than the throttle low threshold the method advances to block in which the hill ascent descent transmission control is disabled. However if throttle signal is determined to be equal to or less than the throttle low threshold the method advances to block .

In block the transmission control module compares the brake signal received from the brake sensor or from the engine control module to a brake low pressure threshold to determine whether an operator of the vehicle is applying the brake e.g. whether the operator has his her foot on the brake . In embodiments in which the brake signal is embodied as a binary state signal i.e. brake on off signal the brake low pressure threshold may embodied as a simple on state check. Alternatively in embodiments in which the brake signal is embodied as a pressure value or percentage the brake low pressure threshold may be embodied a corresponding pressure value or percentage. In the illustrative embodiment the low brake pressure threshold is about 10 pounds per square inch PSI . Of course in other embodiments other brake low thresholds may be used. For example in the illustrative embodiments the vehicle is fitted with an air brake system. However in other embodiments the brake system of the vehicle may be embodied as a hydraulic brake system or other type of brake system. In such other embodiments the low brake pressure threshold and other brake pressure thresholds discussed below may be adjusted or otherwise dependent on the type of brake system included in the vehicle .

If the brake signal is determined to be less than the low brake threshold the method advances to block in which the hill ascent descent transmission control is disabled. However if the brake signal is determined to be equal to or greater than the brake low pressure threshold the method advances to block in which in which the hill ascent descent transmission control is enabled. Alternatively in some embodiments the transmission control module may be configured to determine whether the vehicle is ascending or descending and enable disable based on such determination. For example in such embodiments the method may advance to block rather than block if the brake signal is determined to be equal to or greater than the brake low pressure threshold. In block the transmission control module determines whether the vehicle is ascending or descending. For example in some embodiments the inclinometer may be configured to generate a signal indicative of whether the vehicle is ascending or descending. Alternatively in other embodiments the transmission control module may be configured to determine the direction of inclination of the vehicle based on other signals and or data. For example the transmission control module may be configured to determine the inclination of the vehicle using a load shift methodology or the like.

In block the transmission control module determines whether the vehicle is ascending based on the determination made in block . If so the method advances to block in which in which the hill ascent descent transmission control is enabled. Conversely if the transmission control module determines that the vehicle is descending the method advances to block in which the transmission control module determines whether to allow transmission control for the descent. If not the method advances to block in which the hill ascent descent transmission control is disabled. However if transmission control is allowed for descent the method advances to block in which the hill ascent descent transmission control is enabled. The transmission control module may determine whether to allow descent transmission control based on a setting one or more operation signals or characteristics and or other data. For example in some embodiments the hill descent transmission control option may be selected on or off by an operator of the vehicle .

Referring now to in operation the transmission control module may execute a method for controlling transmission torque of the transmission of the vehicle to provide hill ascent and or descent assistance. The method begins with block in which the transmission control module determines whether the hill ascent descent control feature has been enabled. As discussed above the transmission control module may execute the method to enable or disable the hill ascent descent control feature.

If the transmission control module determines in block that hill ascent descent control feature is enabled the method advances to block in which the transmission control module determines whether the transmission is engaged. That is the transmission control module determines whether the transmission is in a forward gear or a reverse gear i.e. not parked or neutral . The transmission control module may determine whether the transmission is engaged using any suitable methodology. For example in some embodiments the system may include a shift sensor coupled to the transmission a shift selector of the vehicle or other component of the vehicle to detect the current shift state of the transmission .

If transmission control module determines that the transmission is engaged the method advances to block in which the transmission control module compares the brake signal received form the brake sensor or from the engine control module to a brake high or upper brake threshold. That is in block the transmission control module determines whether the operator of the vehicle has the brake fully applied or near fully applied or is in the process of for example switching his her foot from the brake pedal to the accelerator. Again in embodiments in which the brake signal is embodied as a binary state signal i.e. brake on off signal the brake high pressure threshold may embodied as a simple on state check. Alternatively in embodiments in which the brake signal is embodied as a pressure value or percentage the brake high pressure threshold may be embodied a corresponding pressure value or percentage. In the illustrative embodiment the brake high pressure threshold is about 45 pounds per square inch PSI . Of course in other embodiments other brake high thresholds may be used.

If the transmission control module determines that the brake signal is equal to or greater than the brake pressure high threshold the method advances to block . In block the transmission control module compares the throttle signal received from the engine throttle sensor or from the engine control module to a throttle high threshold to determine whether the operator has applied enough accelerator to overcome the roll back or roll forward of the vehicle i.e. whether the operator is now fully in acceleration mode . Illustratively the throttle high threshold is equal to about 80 throttle displacement but other throttle high threshold values may be used in other embodiments based on for example the type of drive unit or transmission the vehicle load various environmental factors and or other criteria.

If the transmission control module determines that throttle signal is equal to or less than throttle high threshold the method advances to block in which a clutch hold pressure value is determined. To do so as shown in the transmission control module may execute a method for determining the clutch hold pressure value as function of various vehicle operation and or characteristic signals. The method begins with block in which the transmission control module determines a transmission output speed N to vehicle speed V ratio i.e. an N V ratio . To do so as discussed above the transmission control module receives a transmission output speed signal from the transmission output sensor or from the engine control module and a vehicle speed signal from the vehicle speed sensor . The transmission control module may generate or calculate the N V ratio as the quotient of the transmission output speed signal N divided by the vehicle speed signal V .

After the transmission control module has determined the transmission output speed to vehicle speed ratio the method advances to block in which the transmission control module determines the vehicle mass of the vehicle . To do so the transmission module may use any suitable methodology to determine generate or otherwise obtain the vehicle mass. For example in some embodiments as discussed above with regard to the system may include the vehicle mass sensor . In such embodiments the vehicle mass sensor is configured to generate a vehicle mass signal which may be used by the transmission control module to determine or calculate the vehicle mass of the vehicle . Alternatively the transmission control module may receive a signal or data from another module such as the engine control module indicative of the vehicle mass of the vehicle . Further in some embodiments the vehicle mass may be embodied as a predetermined value stored in for example the memory of the transmission control module . Such predetermined vehicle mass values may be manually stored in the memory e.g. during manufacturing or determined at initial vehicle operation e.g. when the vehicle is first operated or periodically or responsively thereafter . For example the transmission control module may be configured to calculate or determine the vehicle mass of the vehicle based on other vehicle operation signals and or characteristics. In one particular embodiment the transmission control module is configured to determine at initial vehicle operation an estimated vehicle mass as a function of a calculated tractive effort F of the vehicle and an initial acceleration a of the vehicle as discussed in more detail in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2010 0305822 by Kresse et al. the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. Of course other algorithms and methodologies may be used by the transmission control module to estimate or determine the vehicle mass of the vehicle in other embodiments.

After the transmission control module has determined or otherwise obtained the vehicle mass of the vehicle the method advances to block in which the transmission control module determines the current tractive effort of the vehicle . In the illustrative embodiment the transmission control module is configured to determine or otherwise calculate the tractive effort of the vehicle as a function of the determined vehicle mass of the vehicle and the road grade signal indicative of the grade of the road or other surface on which the vehicle is currently positioned. As discussed above in some embodiments the system may include the inclinometer to generate the road grade signal. The tractive effort is an estimation of the pulling pushing force exhibited by the vehicle . The transmission control module may use any suitable algorithm to calculate or determine the tractive effort as a function of the vehicle mass and road grade. For example in one embodiment the transmission control module is be configured to determine the reactive tractive effort of the vehicle using Newton s Second Law of Motion F m a wherein F is the tractive effort m is the vehicle mass of the vehicle and a is the gravitational acceleration due to the determined road grade. Again in other embodiments other algorithms and methodologies may be used by the transmission control module to determine the tractive effort.

After the transmission control module has determined the tractive effort of the vehicle the method advances to block in which the transmission control module determines or otherwise calculates the clutch hold pressure as a function of the determined tractive effort. To do so the transmission control module may use any suitable methodology to determine the clutch hold pressure based on the tractive effort. For example in one embodiment a look up table that correlates tractive effort values to clutch hold pressure values is stored in the memory of the transmission control module . In such embodiments the transmission control module may determine the appropriate clutch hold pressure by correlating the determined tractive effort to the clutch hold pressure value represented in the look up table. In this way a clutch hold pressure is determined or calculated that is sufficient to lock the transmission so as to hold the vehicle in the current stationary or near stationary position i.e. resist the rolling of the vehicle .

Referring now back to after the transmission control module has determined the appropriate clutch hold pressure in block the method advances to block . In block the determined clutch hold pressure is applied to the clutch assembly . That is the transmission control module generates a clutch signal to engage one or more clutches of the clutch assembly to apply the clutch hold pressure as determined in block . In the illustrative embodiment two clutches e.g. clutches C and C of the clutch assembly are engaged to lock the transmission . However the number and selection of clutches engage in block may depend on for example the type of transmission the gearing system and or other criteria. After the clutch hold pressure is applied to the clutch assembly in block the method loops back to block .

Referring back to blocks and if the transmission control module determines that the hill ascent descent control feature is not enabled in block that the transmission is not engaged in block or that the throttle signal is greater than the throttle high threshold the method advances to block . In block any clutch hold pressure currently applied to the clutch assembly based on the method is dropped or otherwise released. The method subsequently advances to block see in which the transmission control module determines whether the current clutch hold pressure is substantially zero. If so the method loops back to block in which the transmission control module again determines whether the hill ascent transmission control feature is enabled. However if the current clutch hold pressure is not substantially zero the method advances to block in which the transmission control module again determines whether the transmission is engaged as discussed above.

Referring now back to block if the transmission control module determines that the brake signal is less than the brake pressure high threshold the method advances to block . In block similar to block the transmission control module compares the throttle signal received from the engine throttle sensor or from the engine control module to the throttle high threshold to determine whether the operator has applied enough accelerator to overcome the roll back or roll forward of the vehicle . If so the method advances to block wherein the any clutch hold pressure currently applied to the clutch assembly based on the method is dropped or otherwise released as discussed above. If however transmission control module determines that the throttle signal is less than the throttle high threshold in block the method advances to block see .

In block the transmission control module compares the throttle signal to a throttle medium threshold. The throttle medium threshold is less than the throttle high threshold and is selected so as to determine whether the operator of the vehicle is in the process of applying the accelerator pedal i.e. moving his her foot from the brake pedal to the accelerator pedal . In the illustrative embodiment the throttle medium threshold is equal to about 60 throttle displacement. Of course other throttle medium thresholds may be used in other embodiments based on the type of drive unit the type of transmission the type of vehicle load and or the like.

If the transmission control module determines that the throttle signal is greater than the throttle medium threshold i.e. greater than the throttle medium threshold and less than the throttle high threshold the method advances to block in which a ramp rate to decrease the clutch hold pressure is set to a relatively high ramp rate. The particular value of the high ramp rate may be determined or otherwise based on any one or more of a number of criteria such as the current clutch hold pressure the throttle signal the type of transmission and or other criteria. The ramp rate may be expressed in any suitable format such as for example a percentage of pressure drop per time period a magnitude of pressure drop per time period and or the like. In the illustrative embodiment the high ramp rate is about 15 PSI per second. Of course a high ramp rate having a different magnitude may be used in other embodiments.

After the ramp rate has been set to the high ramp rate in block the method advances to block in which a new clutch hold pressure is determined based on the current clutch hold pressure and the current ramp rate. To do so in the illustrative embodiment the transmission control module multiplies the current clutch hold pressure and the current ramp rate to determine the new clutch hold pressure. Of course in other embodiments other methods for calculating or otherwise determining the new clutch hold pressure based on the current clutch hold pressure and the current ramp rate may be used. For example in some embodiments a look up table may be used. As discussed above the ramp rate may be embodied as a reduction in pressure over time. In such embodiments the new clutch hold pressure continues to decrease over time according to the current ramp rate.

After the new clutch pressure has been calculated or otherwise determined in block the method advances to block in which the transmission control module again determines whether the clutch hold pressure is substantially zero. If so the method loops back to block in which the transmission control module again determines whether the hill ascent transmission control feature is enabled. However if the current clutch hold pressure is not substantially zero the method advances to block in which the transmission control module again determines whether the transmission is engaged as discussed above.

Referring back to block if the transmission control module determines that the throttle signal is equal to or less than the throttle medium threshold the method advances to block . In block the transmission control module compares the throttle signal to a throttle low threshold. The throttle low threshold is less than the throttle medium threshold and is selected so as to determine whether the operator of the vehicle has started applying the accelerator. In the illustrative embodiment the throttle low threshold is equal to about 30 throttle displacement. Of course other throttle low thresholds may be used in other embodiments based on the type of drive unit the type of transmission the type of vehicle load and or the like.

If the transmission control module determines that the throttle signal is greater than the throttle low threshold i.e. greater than the throttle low threshold and less than the throttle medium threshold the method advances to block in which the ramp rate is set to a relatively low ramp rate. The particular value of the low ramp rate may be determined or otherwise based on any one or more of a number of criteria such as the current clutch hold pressure the throttle signal the type of transmission and or other criteria. In the illustrative embodiment the low ramp rate is about 7.5 PSI per second. Of course a low ramp rate having a different magnitude may be used in other embodiments.

After the ramp rate has been set to the low ramp rate in block the method advances to block in which a new clutch hold pressure is determined based on the current clutch hold pressure and the current ramp rate as discussed above. It should be appreciated that the ramp rates are used to bleed off or otherwise reduce the clutch hold pressure according to where the operator is in the process of switching from the brake pedal to the full accelerator. If the operators has just released the brake and is initially applying the accelerator i.e. the throttle is less than the throttle medium threshold and greater than the throttle low threshold the clutch hold pressure is released or decreased at a relatively slow rate. However if the operator has related the brake and is in the process of fully applying the accelerator i.e. the throttle is less than the throttle high threshold and greater than the medium threshold the clutch hold pressure is released or decreased at a relatively high rate. In this way the method is responsive to the state of the acceleration from the stationary position of the vehicle .

Referring back to block if the transmission control module determines that the throttle signal is equal to or less than the throttle low threshold the method advances to block . In block a clutch hold pressure timer is incremented. The clutch hold pressure timer is used to ensure that the operator of the vehicle has not left the vehicle . That is the clutch hold pressure is held only for a reference time period when the transmission control module determines that the brake pedal not fully applied see block and the throttle is less than the throttle low threshold see block so as to prevent the vehicle from being held in a stationary or near stationary position while unattended.

After the clutch hold pressure timer is incremented in block the method advances to block in which the transmission control module compares the clutch hold pressure timer to a timer threshold. The value of the timer threshold may be selected or otherwise determined based on any one or more criteria such as the type of vehicle the type of transmission and or other criteria. In the illustrative embodiment the timer threshold is equal to about 3.0 seconds however timer thresholds having other values may be used in other embodiments.

If the transmission control module determines that the current clutch hold pressure timer is greater than the timer threshold the method advances to block in which the ramp rate is set to the low ramp rate to begin to bleed off the clutch pressure as discussed above. If however the transmission control module determines that the clutch pressure timer is not greater than the timer threshold the method advances to block in which a clutch hold pressure value is determined. To do so as discussed above with regard to block the transmission control module may execute the method see for determining the clutch hold pressure value as function of various vehicle operation and or characteristic signals. Subsequently in block the determined clutch hold pressure is applied to the clutch assembly . As discussed above with regard to block the transmission control module may generate a clutch signal to engage one or more clutches of the clutch assembly to apply the clutch hold pressure as determined in block to lock the transmission or otherwise apply an amount of transmission torque to the output shaft of the transmission to resist the rolling i.e. roll back or roll forward of the vehicle .

After the clutch hold pressure is applied in block the method advances to block in which the transmission control module again determines whether the clutch hold pressure is substantially zero. If so the method loops back to block in which the transmission control module again determines whether the hill ascent transmission control feature is enabled. However if the current clutch hold pressure is not substantially zero the method advances to block in which the transmission control module again determines whether the transmission is engaged as discussed above.
