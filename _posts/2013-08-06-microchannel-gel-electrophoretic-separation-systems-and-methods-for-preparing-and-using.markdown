title: Microchannel gel electrophoretic separation systems and methods for preparing and using
abstract: A micro-analytical platform for performing electrophoresis-based immunoassays was developed by integrating photopolymerized cross-linked polyacrylamide gels within a microfluidic device. The microfluidic immunoassays are performed by gel electrophoretic separation and quantifying analyte concentration based upon conventional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). To retain biological activity of proteins and maintain intact immune complexes, native PAGE conditions were employed. Both direct (non-competitive) and competitive immunoassay formats are demonstrated in microchips for detecting toxins and biomarkers (cytokines, c-reactive protein) in bodily fluids (serum, saliva, oral fluids). Further, a description of gradient gels fabrication is included, in an effort to describe methods we have developed for further optimization of on-chip PAGE immunoassays. The described chip-based PAGE immunoassay method enables immunoassays that are fast (minutes) and require very small amounts of sample (less than a few microliters). Use of microfabricated chips as a platform enables integration, parallel assays, automation and development of portable devices.

Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to gel electrophoretic immunoassay and more specifically to on chip electrokinetic methods for performing immunoassays. These immunoassays are fast minutes and require very small amounts of sample less than a few microliters . Use of microfabricated chips as a platform for the immunoassays enables integration parallel assays automation and development of portable devices.

There is a great demand for methods and devices for rapid detection of molecules of interest in applications such as medical diagnostics environmental monitoring biological defense and pharmaceutical research. For example in medical diagnostics detection and quantitation of biomarkers proteins indicative of a disease state in bodily fluids form the basis of diagnosis and treatment of many diseases such as cancer and HIV. Immunoassays are one of the most widely used and sensitive techniques for detection and quantitation of analytes such as viruses peptides polynucleotides proteins such as toxins antibodies and cytokines and other small molecules. Immunoassays are based on specific recognition and binding of a biological ligand to another molecule the prominent example being binding of an receptor molecule to an analyte such as an antigen where the receptor molecule may be any species having a specific binding affinity for another species. Reporter molecules may include but are not limited to polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies a Fab F ab 2 scFV or small chain fragment a peptide or a peptide nucleic acid an aptamer lectin one or more small ligands an antigen an enzyme an oligonucleotide a deoxyribonucleic acid a ribonucleic acid biotin and cellular receptor binding proteins. The generality of immunoassays stems from the fact that most analytes implicated in disease progression are either antigens or antibodies or are molecules against which an antibody can be generated by utilizing the immune system of a host animal. Typically either the antibody or the antigen or in many cases a secondary antibody is labeled with a signal generating molecule or reporter molecule such as a fluorescent molecule a chemiluminescent molecule an enzyme a quantum dot biotin or a spin label to transduce the binding event into a measurable signal.

A typical immunoassay such as in Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay ELISA is performed using a solid surface to immobilize one of the binding components antibody or antigen . Multiple subsequent incubations and washing steps are required to separate the bound from unbound species allowing for detection of only those species that have bound. In a sandwich ELISA using a microtiter plate the antibody to the antigen of interest is adsorbed to a solid surface in this example the bottom of the microtiter plate well. The surface is then blocked to eliminate nonspecific binding in subsequent steps by adsorbing a protein such as bovine serum albumin followed by aspiration and rinsing to remove the unbound protein. In the second step samples containing the antigen are incubated with the solid surface and the nonspecifically bound antigen is removed by washing. In the third step a second antibody also specific to the antigen which is conjugated to one enzyme or fluorescent reporter molecule is added. The amount of labeled antibody and hence the antigen is determined by assaying for the enzyme or detection of a fluorescent signal.

There exist numerous variations of immunoassays. ELISA as described above requires separation or washing steps the ELISA is classified as a heterogeneous immunoassay. Whereas homogeneous immunoassays are performed where there is no need to perform separation or washing before quantitation a signal is generated only from the bound analyte antibody complex.

The conventional immunoassays ELISA being the predominant variation take a long time hours to complete as there are multiple incubation and washing steps involved. These assays also involve many steps that either require extensive labor or if automated need large and expensive robotic liquid handling equipment.

There has been extensive commercial and research interest in developing immunoassays that are fast can be performed in portable devices and require minute amounts of sample and reagents.

Microfluidic chips for analysis of biological molecules have attracted significant attention recently as they offer a number of advantages including speed of analysis portability ability to multiplex and potential for integration.

Microfluidic systems employ microfabrication technologies borrowed from the microelectronics industry to form a network of microchannels 1 m 200 m in width and depth in common materials such as glass or plastic. Many biochemical processes such as mixing dilution concentration transport separation and reaction can be integrated and automated in a single chip. The ability to make multiple channels without additional cost or time of fabrication enables as many as 96 or more analyses to be performed simultaneously. Another key advantage offered by these systems is that they require and are capable of handling a very small amount of sample and reagent for each process a few tens or hundreds of nanoliters volumes that are impossible to analyze in conventional microtiter plates or vials as they will evaporate in seconds and are nearly impossible to handle.

In the last few years routine biochemical methods have been adapted to microfluidic platforms without loss in performance. In fact in many instances miniaturization improves the performance in addition to enabling high throughput operation using vanishing small amounts of a biological sample. Methods such as protein and DNA electrophoresis chromatography cell sorting and affinity assays e.g. immunoassays have been adapted to microchips. The microfluidic assays are typically faster use 100 1000 times lower sample and reagents and offer better separation resolution and efficiency than their conventional counterparts.

Another advantage that miniaturization offers is the ability to integrate different biochemical processes and components required to perform them. A complex microfluidic chip contains multiple liquid reservoirs fluid channels and materials to perform such diverse tasks as filtering pumping valving dialysis separation detection and the like. Compared to larger fluid handling and analysis systems an integrated microfluidic chip performs these tasks much faster using smaller amounts of reagents and has the potential to be significantly cheaper if mass produced. Integrating functions at microscale also greatly reduce sample loss and dilution potentially allowing detection of amounts not possible at larger scale operation.

As explained earlier a typical immunoassay is performed using a solid surface to immobilize one of the components antibody or antigen with multiple subsequent incubations and washing steps to separate the bound from unbound species. However conventional assay methods generally require long incubation periods hours and appreciable amounts of sample and reagents in order to obtain the desired response. Electrophoresis in microchannels has been demonstrated as an efficient means to separate an immune complex from reporter molecules. In such systems an immune complex and a reporter molecule such as a fluorophore are separated based upon differences in charge to mass ratios. Specific advantages of microdevice based separations relevant to electrophoretic based immunoassays include the potential for shortened incubation times as compared to solid phase systems simplified assay protocols as compared to the multiple wash and detection steps required for conventional immunodiagnostics such as ELISA and device form factors amenable to system integration and automation. Additionally electrophoretic immunoassays eliminate the need to immobilize analyte on a solid surface thus avoiding complexities associated with the solid phase. Several groups have demonstrated microdevices as an elegant architecture for conducting integrated immunoassays see for instances Chiem N. et al. 1997 v. 69 pp. 373 378 Koutny L. B. et al. 1996 v. 68 pp. 18 22 Qiu C. X. et al. 2001 v. 22 pp. 3949 3958 and Cheng S. B. et al. 2001 v. 73 pp. 1472 1479 .

Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis PAGE Immunoassays on Chips Advantage of Cross Linked Gels Integration Higher Sample Loading

To date the capillary or microchip based immunoassays are performed in an open or surface modified microfluidic channel and predominantly use electrophoresis as the basis of separation. The open channel assays suffer from a number of disadvantages 1 Attaining adequate species discrimination with electrophoresis based immunoassays however can be difficult since large analytes such as antibodies and immune complexes are known to vary little in charge to mass characteristics. 2 Open channel electrophoresis also suffers from non specific adsorption. Antibodies or analytes can adsorb to the walls leading to loss of sample as well as degradation in assay performance as the adsorbed molecules can significantly alter the flow in the channels. Various surface coatings both covalent and non covalent have been developed to reduce non specific adsorption but these coatings are not stable and lead to irreproducible results. Moreover in most cases these coatings reduce but do not eliminate non specific adsorption leading to significant changes in the flow profile and hence assay performance and reproducibility.

PAGE electrophoresis through a porous sieving polyacrylamide in the forms of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS PAGE and native PAGE is a widely used method for separation of proteins. At conventional scale PAGE is performed in cross linked polyacrylamide gels sandwiched between glass plates. Conventional PAGE takes hours to run needs large amounts of sample and is hard to automate and integrate. As explained in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 646 808 entitled Multidimensional Electrophoresis and Methods of Making and Using Thereof originally filed Aug. 25 2003 and which is herein incorporated by reference we have recently developed methods to implement slab gel electrophoresis in microchips. The major challenge in performing PAGE in a chip is the difficulty of placing solid cross linked gels in micron sized channels.

However we have overcome these difficulties and herein describe and have elsewhere reported Herr A. E. et al. On chip Native Gel Electrophoresis Based Immunoassays for Tetanus Antibody and Toxin . v. 77 2 Jan. 15 2005 pp. 585 590 and Herr A. E. et al. Photopolymerized cross linked polyacrylamide gels for on chip protein sizing . v. 76 16 Aug. 15 2004 pp. 4727 4733 both herein incorporated by reference a new method for providing a polyacrylamide gel in a microchannel and conducting separation assays for a variety of proteins including TTC tetanus toxin C fragment IL 2 recombinant human interleukin 2 FGF recombinant human fibroblast growth factor and IGF recombinant human growth factor I .

By using ultra violet UV light to initiate polymerization porous polymers can be formed in the channels of a microchip. Moreover because polymerization is initiated by UV light the channels can be photolithographically patterned. Using a mask the polymerization is restricted to UV exposed regions and monomers from the unexposed regions are flushed after the irradiation step. This allows polymer to be cast selectively in separation channels while injection channels and the detection window remain open. This allows for rapid and repeatable injection easy clean up of injection arms and more sensitive detection. The ability to photopattern will also facilitate multi dimensional separation by enabling multiple separate stationary phases in a single chip. Electrolytes are incorporated into the monomer mix allowing for generation of electrokinetic flow immediately after polymerization. This obviates need of pumps to condition the channels by removal of excess solvent and monomers.

SDS PAGE allows for excellent discrimination of species by size but sodium dodecyl sulfate can disrupt fragile immune complexes making quantization of these complexes nearly impossible. Non denaturing PAGE techniques both with and without a detergent have been shown to retain the biological activity necessary for intact immune complexes yet allow analyte discrimination. The ability to discriminate between antigen antibody and immune complexes based upon size as well as charge to mass ratio mitigates the sometimes poor resolution observed using non sieving electrophoretic immunoassay techniques. Our PAGE immunoassay is superior to zone electrophoretic immunoassays in many respects 1 high separation resolution due to low non specific binding 2 fast separations seconds using short length channels millimeters due to the high surface area of the gel 3 ready tailoring of gel porosity for specific applications and 4 spatial localization of photopatterned polyacrylamide useful in multiplexing and integration .

In this work we disclose a method of on chip electrophoretic immunoassays for rapid and sensitive detection of protein levels in buffers and biological fluids such as spiked serum whole saliva spiked and native and gingival crevicular fluid samples. The on chip immunoassays employ a native PAGE separation in lithographically photopatterned cross linked sieving gels for detection and quantification of antibody and protein levels. Use of in situ fabricated polymer matrices in microfluidic devices further aid in the development of chip based immunoassays.

Numerous microfabrication strategies including fabrication of channels in fused silica polymer devices and hybrid devices such as silicon and glass are acceptable. For the work presented here the microchips were fabricated from Schott D263 glass wafers obtained from the S. I. Howard Glass Co. Worcester Mass. . The wafers comprised a diameter of about 102 mm and a thickness of by 1.1 mm and were prepared using standard photolithography wet etching and bonding techniques as described previously by Throckmorton et al. 2002 v. 74 pp. 784 789 herein incorporated by reference. The chips contained offset double T junctions. Separation channels measured either about 61 mm or about 67 mm in length depending on the device used. The injection and buffer arms each measured about 5 mm in length. The channels were nominally 40 m deep and 100 m wide. To form buffer reservoirs NANOPORT assemblies from Upchurch Scientific Oak Harbor Wash. were attached to through holes formed in the cover plate by using thermally cured adhesive rings.

In order to prepare the chip for separation analysis the silica microchannels were first cleaned conditioned functionalized using acrylate terminated self assembled monolayers SAM s and subsequently filled with linear polyacrylamide which is immobilized in a manner similar to that described by Kirby et al. see 2003 v. 3 pp. 5 10 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety Singh et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 646 808 originally filed Aug. 25 2003 entitled Multidimensional Electrophoresis and Method of Making and Using Thereof herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

The microchannel cleaning was performed by flushing the channels with 1M NaOH for 10 minutes followed by a 10 minute deionized water rinse and a final filtered air purge. The conditioning step to provide exposed acrylate groups on channel interior surfaces comprised flushing the channels with a 2 3 5 mixture of 3 trimethoxysilyl propyl methacrylate glacial acetic acid and deionized water for 30 minutes. The conditioning mixture was prepared by vigorously agitating the solution while mixing the individual constituents especially during the addition of the water and then thoroughly degassing and sonicating the solution mixture for 5 minutes.

After the 30 minute conditioning step the channels were then purged with air and subsequently rinsed with deionized water for another 10 minutes.

To form the linear polyacrylamide channel coating the SAM coating within the channels a solution of 5 w v acrylamide containing 5 mg mL V 50 was introduced into the channels. The filled channels were then exposed to a 100 Watt mercury lamp for 10 minutes resulting in formation of the channel coating. The lamp was fan cooled to minimize heating. Other fabrication procedures such as projection lithography using a shaped laser light beam have been employed to fabricate gel structures with high spatial resolution structures smaller than 20 um in width . Following the coating procedure chips were flushed with deionized water for 5 min filled with water and stored at 5 C.

Following surface preparation polyacrylamide gels of various total acrylamide concentrations monomer plus cross linker were fabricated in the microdevices. NOTE The acrylamide used to fabricate the sieving gel is a neurotoxin absorbed through the skin. Proper handling procedures are required. Users should consult the appropriate MSDS for proper safety precautions. 

The polyacrylamide gel matrix is formed by the co polymerization of the two monomers acrylamide and bis acrylamide. The acrylamide polymerizes into long chains which are cross linked at intervals by the bis acrylamide thereby forming polyacrylamide. The porosity of the matrix can be altered by changing the percentage of acrylamide used and or the amount of crosslinker bis acrylamide present. The higher the percentage of acrylamide in a gel the more dense the gel and the better the separation of small proteins. In contrast the lower the percentage of acrylamide the more open the matrix which favors the separation of larger proteins.

Polyacrylamide gel matrixes having various concentration of total acrylamide T where T 4 6 and 10 were fabricated by adjusting the total volume of the 30 37.5 1 acrylamide bis acrylamide solution with Tris glycine run buffer gel containing 0.2 w v VA 086 photoinitiator. As used herein T is expressed as a percentage of the total weight of acrylamide plus bis acrylamide used to form the gel to the volume of the polymerized gel that is formed. Thus a T of 6 would indicate that there is a total of 6 grams of acrylamide plus bis acrylamide per 100 ml of gel. The amount of cross linking can also be adjusted to vary the pore size.

The exemplary separation channel in the microchip described above containing the immobilized polyacrylamide gel is shown schematically in . Sample introduction and separation were performed using common electrokinetic injection methods. The various sample waste and buffer reservoirs on a standard offset double T microdevice were filled with 1 Tris glycine SDS run buffer. Sample reservoir is filled with the sample solution not shown under analysis. Platinum electrodes not shown were inserted at each fluid reservoir and to provide electrical connectivity to a programmable high voltage power supply not shown . A typical voltage program was as follows during sample loading 300V cm was applied between the sample and sample waste reservoirs for 240 seconds separations were initiated by applying a positive high voltage at the buffer waste reservoir while grounding the buffer reservoir. No pullback voltage was necessary during injection as the high viscosity of the polymer matrix reduced leakage of sample from the loading arms into the separation channel.

Species transport was observed by using an epifluorescent microscopy technique and digital imaging while laser induced fluorescence LIF and single point detection were used to obtain electropherograms and sensitivity data. Images were collected using an inverted epifluorescent microscope IX 70 Olympus Melville N.Y. equipped with 4 and 10 objectives numerical apertures of 0.16 and 0.4 respectively . An x y translation stage Olympus Melville N.Y. was used to position the chip and various associated fixtures relative to the imaging optics. Excitation light Argon ion laser 488 nm was frequency modulated using a mechanical chopper 220 Hz modulation and reflected off of a dichroic mirror XF2010 New Focus Inc San Jose Calif. through the microscope objective lens that defined the detection point on the separation chip. A custom fixture mounted on a 3 axis translation stage allowed aligning and focusing the laser beam onto the separation channel. Excited fluorescence light was gathered spectrally filtered through a 535 nm notch filter XF3084 and spatially filtered through an iris before being directed into a HAMAMATSU H5784 photomultiplier tube PMT . The signal from the PMT was demodulated using a lock in amplifier obtained from Stanford Research Systems Sunnyvale Calif. and the generated data signal in the form of the PMT light response over time acquired by a computer interfaced to a National Instruments 6020E DAQPad data acquisition interface Austin Tex. . Data and system control was performed using an in house program written in LABVIEW National Instruments provided an output response in the form of an electropherogram.

It was found that thoroughly degassing the polyacrylamide gel solution and using a low flow rate channel filling protocol were essential to obtain high quality polymerized gels. Moreover an additional 3 minutes of UV exposure were required for full polymerization of gel filled channels near multiple inlet channels i.e. regions near a T junction . Voids or tears formed near the offset double T junction upon application of an electric field if this extended photo polymerization step was omitted. The tears may arise from stresses induced by electroosmotic flow in channels filled with a non uniformly polymerized gel. Chips containing polyacrylamide structures were stored submerged in buffer solution and refrigerated at 5 C.

In preferred embodiments the device of the present invention comprises either a single separation channel as depicted in or several separation channels attached to a single loading structure as depicted in wherein each channel has a different set of gel pore properties.

The separation channel thus prepared may be photopatterned using UV illumination in order or some amount of time to elapsed after introducing unpolymerized gel solutions 1 2 . . . n such that the different solutions are able to diffuse into each other. In this way the former embodiment now provides a separation channel containing a polymerized gel having a pore structure that varies in either a semi continuous or a step wise manner. In the second embodiment the polymerized gel comprises a structure whose pore sizes varies continuously within the separation channel s .

In both embodiments the unpolymerized solution is photopatterned using UV illumination as shown in . This results in a gel structure having a variable pore size determined by the total acrylamide concentration of the unpolymerized solution s at each point along the length of the separation channel. Moreover the overall length of time the solution is allowed to equilibrate will affect the final character of the pore size gradient.

A second example of this technique is used to fabricate a continuously varying pore size gradient by first filling the entire separation channels with a single acrylamide monomer and cross linker solution the unpolymerized gel solution 1 as shown in . However as depicted in in the present example only a portion of the separation channel several channel widths from the intersection is exposed to the UV light while the remainder is blocked by UV blocking material allowing for the definition of an end or terminus portion of the pore size gradient as is depicted in . Subsequently a different monomer solution is introduced using a channel network by first removing some or all of solution and re introducing two or more solutions e.g. solutions and as is depicted in .

Again a period of equilibration is provided as shown in which allows the unpolymerized solutions trapped in the separation channel due to the polymerized plug terminus to diffuse into each other and thus establishing a continuous variation in the unpolymerized solution composition along the length of the separation channel.

After the desired equilibration period has elapsed the entire separation channel is again exposed to UV light as shown in thereby providing the final polyacrylamide gel structure having a gradient in pore size as depicted in .

T1 below shows measurements of analyte mobility in this case several different proteins made at two different locations in the channel gel regions 1 and 2 located at 2 mm and 3 mm from the loading channel respectively in a gradient gel fabricated as described in . Migration of each protein was imaged using an epi fluorescence digital imaging technique. Frame to frame migration was used to calculate analyte velocity. With the known applied electric field 320 V cm species mobility was calculated. Two regions were investigated to provide information on analyte mobility imaging at 2 mm from the injection junction region having larger pore size and 3 mm from the injection junction region having smaller pore size . Preliminary data show significant changes in the measured mobility depending on which region of the device the species were migrating through. As shown in T1 the largest species Proteins 2 5 had a mobility that was more significantly impacted than did the smallest species Protein 1 as would be expected.

Lastly shows two parallel horizontal separation channels and each having a different gel concentration gradient. Reservoirs may or may not contain electrodes. If used electrodes would be immersed in the liquid contained within the reservoir and preferably comprise a thin platinum wire or a patterned thin film of gold on the substrate wafer not shown .

The polyacrylamide gels proved to be durable under limited current limited field strength operation. Several individual chips were successfully used for hundreds of separations each separation lasting 5 7 min when the current flow was limited to 10 mA and applied field strengths limited to 410 V cm. A few chips five were successfully employed for native PAGE immunoassays for several hours over several months of use. The mode of polymer failure has not been fully characterized. In agreement with published reports of in situ polymerized gel structure failure modes a drop in the electrical resistance of the gel filled microchannel correlated well with gel failure. In the gels presented in this work failure manifested itself through the formation of visible voids in the bulk of the polymer.

In order to characterize the native PAGE performance of in situ photopolymerized polyacrylamide gels apparent mobility measurements were made using three model proteins GFP BSA and TTC each transiting one of several different polyacrylamide gel concentrations while subjected to a variety of different applied electric field strengths. Species mobilities were calculated from the known applied field strength the measured frame to frame displacement of each species and the time between frames. No obvious dependence of apparent mobility of TTC on field strength was observed for field strengths ranging from 245 V cm to 410 V cm. Additionally GFP BSA and TTC showed a linear dependence between peak motion and time for all field strengths 245 V cm to 410 V cm and gel concentrations 4 6 and 10 considered n 27 R 0.982 .

T2 details the apparent mobilities for the native proteins moving under the influence of an electrophoretic field in gels of various polyacrylamide concentrations. All three protein species exhibited a marked decrease in apparent mobility as polyacrylamide concentration increased. The observed trend indicates that the separation mechanism consists of both an electrophoretic component and a sieving component due to the gel pore size expected to decrease as polyacrylamide concentration increases . Ferguson analysis can be employed to relate the polyacrylamide gel concentration to the measured apparent mobility of a protein through the retardation coefficient K. A plot of the natural logarithm of versus polyacrylamide concentration yields K as reported in T2. Kvalues reported by Gonenne and Lebowitz 1975 v. 64 pp. 414 424 for similar size native proteins agree within 25 with those reported in T2 below.

Separation resolution SR for an internal standard in this case free FITC dye and TTC was employed to further characterize the native PAGE behavior of 4 and 6 acrylamide gels at a range of applied electric field strengths ranging from about E 245 V cm to about E 410 V cm . Using the relation 4 where L is the peak to peak distance and is the average width 1 standard deviation of the two concentration distributions. SR was calculated by a least squares Gaussian fit to image data axial intensity distributions at a set elapsed separation time t 5s . SR showed a linear proportionality to square root over E for both the 4 SR 0.45 square root over E 5.8 R 0.98 and 6 gels SR 0.16 square root over E 1.4 R 0.90 over the range of electric field strengths E investigated. As expected SR was markedly higher in the 6 acrylamide gel than in the 4 acrylamide gel for all E investigated. Observed mobility and SR dependence on polyacrylamide concentration indicates that the gel characteristics can be readily tailored to satisfy assay resolution requirements.

Tetanus neurotoxin is produced by the anaerobic bacterium and is one of the most toxic substances known. The toxin binds to nerve cells and penetrates the cell cytosol where it blocks the release of neurotransmitter resulting in spastic paralysis.

Vaccination has proven to be the most effective intervention method for protecting human populations from tetanus and many other infectious agents. However the efficacy of these vaccines against these agents must be determined objectively typically by measuring the concentration of antibodies in serum known as an immunoassay. Conventional immunoassays such as ELISA are commonly used to measure concentrations of toxins in clinical samples or to assess antibody response to vaccination. Herein we report a microchip immunoassay for detection of tetanus antibody in buffer and diluted bovine serum.

Samples of TTC and anti TTC antibody having a known concentration were prepared in a 1 native Tris glycine buffer as well as in a diluted bovine serum solution. To perform direct immunoassays for anti TTC antibodies the initially prepared concentration of TTC was held constant among samples while the volume of anti TTC antibodies was varied within each sample to obtain the desired concentration of antibody in the final sample. All samples were adjusted to a final volume of 50 mL through addition of 1 native Tris glycine buffer or bovine serum . Samples were mixed by gently aspirating the sample through a pipette. Samples were then shielded from light and incubated in plastic tubes at room temperature for at least one hour. The immunoassays were conducted without boiling and without the inclusion of SDS in the sample in order to avoid protein denaturation and breakdown of antibodies into heavy and light chains.

The samples thus prepared were injected into the sample reservoir of the on chip microsystem prepared as described above and comprising one of a variety of polyacrylamide gel concentrations and launched into the separation column under the influence of an electrophoretic field of about 350 V cm. Fluorescence image shown in was taken after an elapsed separation time of 16 seconds after launching the sample from the sample reservoir loading area into a 6 polyacrylamide gel. In each sample TTC was used as the fluorescently labeled antigen and anti TTC antibodies were used as the analyte. Detection of a second peak having a lower apparent mobility than the mobility of free TTC indicates formation of a fluorescent TTC immune complex Ab TTC as the relative magnitudes of the TTC and Ab TTC peaks are directly related to the antibody concentration. As the amount of unlabeled TTC is increased the intensity of the TTC band decreases with a concomitant intensity increase in the immune complex band.

As shown in the immune complex is nearly resolved from the free TTC in less than 30 seconds and in a 7 mm long separation distance. By way of comparison capillary zone electrophoresis based immunoassays have been reported to complete in 2 to 3 minutes when using Fab antibody fragments 13 minutes when using the whole antibody while on chip free solution electrophoresis immunoassays have been reported complete in less than 40 seconds.

Quantitation of electropherogram peak height and peak area was employed to generate dose response curves for the tetanus system. To do this the peak area corresponding to the immune complex was normalized by the peak area of the free dye internal standard associated with the fluorescent labeling of the analyte and proportional in concentration to the amount of labeled analyte in the sample to correct for variation in the injected sample volume as well as for any uncorrected variations in excitation illumination. Furthermore the minimum detectable concentration MDC of immune complex Ab TTC was defined as the lowest concentration of analyte anti TTC antibody that resulted in a fluorescence signal response three standard deviations higher than the response at zero concentration. For the LIF PMT system described above this concentration was found to be an MDC of 6.8 10M of unlabeled anti TTC antibody which compares favorably with reported detection limits of 10M to 10M for conventional immunoassay methods e.g. enzyme linked immunosorbent assays . As noted earlier the amount of free TTC and the concentration of the internal standard in each of the initially prepared sample mixtures was held constant.

As illustrated in single point detection measurements yielded electropherograms for the native PAGE immunoassay of low concentration TTC samples. Just as in the full field images shown in the peak associated with the immune complex is clearly observable as the concentration of anti TTC antibodies increased from 0.2 10M to 5.4 10M. Moreover separation of the immune complex from free TTC is complete within about 150 seconds using the single point method.

The effects of interfering substances on the ability of the immunoassay to accurately determine the quantity of tetanus antibody in biological specimens was determined by measuring the normalized peak areas for direct anti TTC antibody immunoassays conducted in a 1 100 diluted bovine serum specimen containing 13 10M of TTC indicated by open or hollow data symbols . shows the normalized peak area measurements from the adulterated dilute serum specimen in comparison to the results from the buffer based immunoassay. Peak areas for both the buffer and diluted serum immunoassays were normalized to the value for each dose response curve. The peak area measurements from the diluted serum sample can be described by the same four parameter model used to generate the dose response curve obtained in buffer solutions.

In addition to direct immunoassays competitive format immunoassays for tetanus toxin C fragment were performed in the photopatterned cross linked gels. Sample solutions consisting of TTC TTC and anti TTC antibodies again having known concentrations were prepared in 1 native Tris glycine buffer off chip. The molar ratio of TTC to anti TTC antibody as well as the final sample volume was kept constant for all competitive samples. The concentration of unlabeled TTC added to the sample solutions was varied to obtain the desired final unlabeled TTC concentration. In all cases anti TTC antibody was the final component added to the competitive sample solutions. Incubation conditions were as described above for the direct immunoassays.

As conducted the competitive immunoassays were designed to use TTC as a fluorescently labeled antigen reporter and TTC as analyte both of which compete to form complexes with the anti TTC antibodies. shows the dose response curve for the competitive immunoassay where the detector response was normalized to the internal standard peak 2 and where E 300 V cm where the total column length was 6.1 cm. shows representative electropherograms from a competitive immunoassay having constant concentrations of TTC 13 10M and anti TTC antibodies 6 10M and TTC concentrations of 2.0 7.8 and 15.6 10M. Peaks 1 and 2 correspond to free dye peak 2 used a standard peak 3 is the free TTC and peak 4 is the complex.

Competitive immunoassays rely upon competition between fluorescently labeled antigen and unlabeled sample antigen to form an immune complex with the unlabeled antibody or antibody fragment . Quantitation of either the labeled antigen peak or the fluorescent immune complex peak should ideally allow determination of the amount of unlabeled antigen present in a given sample. As is seen in the fluorescent complex peak peak 4 height diminishes as TTC is added to the sample with a concomitant increase in the peak height of the free TTC peak 3 . These observations are indicative of expected competitive immunoassay behavior wherein an increase in sample antigen concentration results in both an increase in observed free labeled antigen and decrease in the observed fluorescent immune complex as the sample antigen antibody immune complex is not fluorescent. Eventually as the concentration of TTC is increased nonlinearity is observed in the dose response curve of and is presumably indicative of saturation of the anti TTC antibodies with TTC.

Native PAGE separations of proteins and immune complexes have been demonstrated therefore in an in situ photopatterned separation medium of cross linked polyacrylamide gels. Analysis of model proteins using native PAGE allowed extraction of retardation coefficients based upon measured apparent mobilities of each analyte in gels of various total acrylamide concentrations. A dose response curve for the direct immunoassay for antibodies to tetanus toxin C fragment was generated and showed limiting behaviors expected of conventional direct immunoassays as quantified through a four parameter logistic model. Furthermore direct immunoassays for antibodies to tetanus performed in a diluted serum solution also agreed with trends anticipated from a conventional immunoassay format. The minimum detectable antibody concentration was measured to be 6.8 10M. The microsystem was extended to include a competitive immunoassay for tetanus toxin C fragment which resulted in generation of an additional dose response curve. Both direct and competitive immunoassays were completed with separation times of less than three minutes.

The direct and competitive immunoassays reported illustrate the simplicity speed and quantization associated with on chip electrophoresis based immunodiagnostics. Other embodiments are possible including combining the assay with on chip mixing and metering extension of the system to include multi analyte detection in a parallel separation format and enhanced automation will enable high throughput analysis of complex samples devoid of user intervention.

In particular the invention may be deployed in kit form by providing as separate packages A a microfluidic separation system is first provided on a substrate such as glass silicon polysilicon quartz or similar material. The separation system itself would include as a minimum i at least one capillary separation channel disposed on the substrate wherein the separation channel contains a porous polymerized polyacrylamide gel as described above ii at least one fluid reservoir intersecting with the separation channel wherein the separation channel and the fluid reservoir contain a buffer fluid and iii electrodes for electrically connecting the fluid reservoirs and channels to an external power supply and B several sterile containers each containing a different antibody capable of immunoreacting with a different target antigen wherein each antibody is labeled with a reporter molecule such as a fluorophore.

The microfluidic diagnostic kit would be remain sealed until use and would be used by first mixing a small quantity of a body fluid component with the same type of buffer fluid used in the kit. Labeled receptor molecules e.g. fluorescently labeled antibodies with specificity for the analyte of interest are incubated with the body fluid as described above in the preceding text. A quantity of the fluorophore is also added as an internal standard. The process may be practiced also by introducing the tagged antigen mixture and the antibody directly into the reservoir of the microfluidic chip and incubating the analyte sample on the chip itself thereby reducing one of the handling steps. 

After incubating the analyte sample s as described above an individual sample is injected into the reservoir on the separation channel system electrophoretically separated stimulated by exposure to an excitation source e.g. laser Hg lamp and any induced fluorescent signal recorded electronically. This process is repeated for each analyte sample. Based upon measured calibration curves an estimate of the concentration of the analyte of interest can be made for each body fluid analyzed.

Alternatively incubation may be performed on chip. Analyte containing sample and receptor containing solutions must be mixed to allow binding of the analyte to the receptor molecule. This can require substantial incubation times on the macroscale i.e. in vitro . Using micron scale channels or compartments as mixing regions even when relying solely on diffusion to transport the species can result in efficient mixing of the various species. The reduced distances involved in such a mixing system reduce the amount of time necessary to complete the mixing process even under laminar flow conditions.

Prior to gel electrophoresis immunoassay analysis sample species can be mixed with either a single receptor or multiple receptors for determination of analyte presence in a particular sample. Using a microfabricated device such as is shown in all of the upstream mixing and metering can take place prior to analysis in a single device. Samples are introduced either electrokinetically or using pressure driven flow into a region of the device where they are substantially brought into contact with one or more reporter molecules. A region of the device prior to electrophoretic analysis in the polyacrylamide gel allows incubation and mixing of the analyte containing sample and receptor molecules. The mixing and incubation region of the device may be a straight channel a serpentine mixing channel a multi level mixing channel or any of a number of other geometries. In addition to a continuous pressure driven or electrokinetic flow a stopped flow protocol may be employed wherein species are allowed to incubate and mix without the presence of a net flow.
