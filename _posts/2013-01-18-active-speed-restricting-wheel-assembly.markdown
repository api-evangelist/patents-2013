This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 10 2012 0009534 filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Jan. 31 2012 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

Methods and apparatuses consistent with the exemplary embodiments relate to an active speed restricting wheel assembly and more particularly to an active speed restricting wheel assembly which is mounted onto transportation means used in daily lives to prevent extreme speed acceleration.

Wheels used in transportation means such as strollers walking assistance devices wheelchairs carriers and shopping carts etc. cause crash accidents due to over speed rotation in downhill roads and falling accidents due to high speed rotation by slipping causing loss of life and property.

In order to resolve this a transmission which uses a planetary gear and a vehicle using such a transmission were developed and filed for patent application 10 2006 0119401 . This patent application proposed a planetary gear transmission which consists of a multi stage gear transmission unit which includes two carriers wherein two planetary gear trains are combined to integrate a carrier of a planetary gear train on one side with a ring gear of a planetary gear train on the other side the two carriers operating separately by a driving side and an output side cooperate to form a housing of the transmission and having a plurality of planetary gears installed in each carrier two or more solar gears which interlock with each gear of the planetary gears and have a plurality of concaves for being combined with a home cam on an inner circumference and two ring gears interlocked with the planetary gears a central axis where the multi stage gear transmission unit is installed and a transmission control unit which fixates one of the plurality of solar gears selectively to the central axis and controls selective integration of two adjacent solar gears of among the plurality of solar gears.

In addition as an apparatus for restricting speed an auxiliary apparatus for safety in in line skating was filed for patent application 20 2007 0019331 . This invention related to a safety apparatus for restricting rolling of an in line skate wheel for safety in in line skating the apparatus comprising a side support fixture located in both sides of an in line skate wheel a gutter hook formed on the side support fixture an elastic foam combined with the side support fixture and a fastener which controls a distance of the side support fixture.

However these aforementioned existing speed restricting wheels have relatively complex structures and thus due to their high production costs there has been difficulty in widely applying such wheels to transportation means used in daily lives.

Therefore the purpose of the present invention is to resolve the aforementioned problems and more particularly to provide an active speed restricting wheel assembly which is mounted onto transportation means to prevent extreme speed acceleration thereby maintaining stability.

According to the present invention the above purpose is achieved by an active speed restricting wheel assembly which includes a casing of which one side is partially open and forms a circular accommodating hole eccentric from a center and of which a rotation hole is formed in a center of the other side a rotation rotor which is inserted inside the accommodating hole and rotates in an interlocked manner with the casing in a state where it is eccentric from a rotation center of the casing but which also forms a rotation space inside and a plurality of internal gear teeth dented radially from the rotation space a sun gear which is accommodated inside the rotation space and has a plurality of outwardly protruding external gear teeth in contact with the internal gear teeth and an axis member mounted onto a rotation center accommodated inside the rotation hole and a resistance fluid which is accommodated in a space between the external gear teeth and internal gear teeth and is compressed according to a space between the rotation rotor and sun gear deformed according to rotation of the rotation rotor.

In addition the number of the internal gear teeth may be greater than the number of the external gear teeth.

The rotation rotor may rotate around the sun gear which is in a halt condition when the casing rotates.

In addition a fluid flow route may be formed on the sun gear to penetrate the sun gear such that resistance fluid of both sides is mutually connected around any one of the external gear teeth.

In addition a rotation center of the rotation rotor may move along a circular orbit which has a rotation hole of the casing as the center when the rotation rotor rotates.

According to the present invention there is provided an active speed restricting wheel assembly which may actively restrict rotation speed of a wheel through a relatively simple structure using a trochoid type gear.

In addition it is possible to secure accuracy and stability of driving by filling incompressible resistance fluid having high viscosity in a space between a rotation rotor and sun gear.

In addition it is possible to easily control a degree of an overall rotation speed and speed restriction by designing a fluid flow route where resistance fluid may flow inside the sun gear.

Certain exemplary embodiments are described in higher detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.

In the following description like drawing reference numerals are used for the like elements even in different drawings. The matters defined in the description such as detailed construction and elements are provided to assist in a comprehensive understanding of exemplary embodiments. However exemplary embodiments can be practiced without those specifically defined matters. Also well known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the application with unnecessary detail.

An active speed restricting wheel assembly according to a first exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the accompanying views.

With reference to an active speed restricting wheel assembly according to a first exemplary embodiment of the present invention is an assembly mounted onto predetermined transportation means to prevent instant acceleration and induce stable movement The active speed restricting wheel assembly includes a casing rotation rotor sun gear cover member and wheel member .

The casing is a cylinder type member which has the wheel member on its external circumference and thus rotates simultaneously with the wheel member which is in contact with the ground.

Meanwhile one side of the casing is open such that a circular accommodating hole is formed and a center C of the circular accommodating hole is distanced and eccentric from a rotation center C of the casing . In other words due to rotation of the casing which rotates together with the wheel member the center C of the accommodating hole makes rotational motion with a certain radius from the rotation center C of the casing .

In addition on the other side of the casing a rotation hole is formed on the rotation center C of the casing so as to accommodate the axis member connected with the sun gear which is to be explained hereinafter.

In other words one side of the casing is open to form an accommodating hole while the other side of the casing is closed with the rotating hole formed only on the rotation center C of the casing .

The rotation rotor is accommodated inside the accommodating hole in a rotatable manner and is formed in a cylinder type having a size corresponding to a bottom depth of an internal diameter of the accommodating hole . Rotation space is formed in a center of the rotation rotor and a plurality of internal gear teeth are formed radially and dented from the rotation space .

Therefore since the rotation rotor is accommodated inside the accommodating hole the rotation center C of the rotation rotor rotates as it contacts the inner circumference of the accommodating hole in a state where it is distanced and eccentric from the first center C which is the rotation center of the casing . Meanwhile the rotation center of the rotation rotor becomes a second center C which will be explained hereinafter.

The sun gear is accommodated inside the rotation space of the rotation rotor . In addition the sun gear is fixated and maintains a halt condition unlike other constituents and has a plurality of outwardly protruding external gears teeth .

Meanwhile an internal gear tooth of the rotation rotor and an external gear teeth of the sun gear are formed as trochoid type gears and such that the number of teeth of the internal gear teeth is one more than the number of teeth of the external gear teeth . In addition although such numbers of teeth are not limited thereto the present exemplary embodiment has 5 internal gear teeth and 4 external gear teeth .

The axis member fixated to the rotation center C of the sun gear protrudes towards outside of the casing to be mounted and fixated to the predetermined transportation means in a state where it is accommodated inside the rotation hole of the casing . Therefore when the transportation means mounted with the active speed restricting wheel assembly of the present exemplary embodiment moves the sun gear fixated to the transportation means maintains its halt condition without rotating.

The resistance fluid is fluid of oil material which prevents rapid increase of speed of the rotation rotor which rotates around the sun gear which is in a halt condition. The resistance fluid is oil with high viscosity filled inside the rotation space where the sun gear is accommodated.

Therefore as the resistance fluid is compressed by a location change of the sun gear inside the rotation space which occurs from a rotation of the rotation rotor the rotation rotor is prevented from rotating extremely and the overall rotation speed of the wheel assembly can be controlled as well.

The cover member is a flat type member which is mounted onto the casing to finish the side of the casing which is opened by the accommodating hole . The cover member has a rotation hole formed on a location corresponding to the rotation center C of the casing .

That is the cover member finishes the accommodating hole which is mounted onto the side of the casing and accommodates the rotation rotor and the sun gear . Furthermore inside the rotation hole of the cover member the cover member supports the sun gear as it accommodates the axis member which is mounted onto the sun gear .

At the same time the cover member performs a role of sealing the resistance fluid filled inside the casing so that it does not trickle out. Furthermore in order to prevent leakage of the resistance fluid more rigidly an additional o ring may be inserted between a circumference of the casing and the cover member .

Meanwhile for smooth rotating of the cover member and casing around the axis member of the sun gear it is desirable that an additional bearing B is installed between the axis member of the sun gear and between the axis member of the sun gear and the casing .

The wheel member is mounted onto and fixated to the outer circumference of the casing and this is a member which directly contacts the ground to generate friction. There is no limitation to the material of the wheel member and any material may be used as long as it can increase the frictional force of contact with the ground.

Operations of the first exemplary embodiment of the aforementioned active speed restricting wheel assembly will be explained hereinbelow.

With reference to first of all in a state where the active speed restricting wheel assembly of the present exemplary embodiment is mounted onto the predetermined transportation means when transportation force is applied to the transportation means the wheel member rotates by frictional force while it is in contact with the ground.

In a state where the sun gear is fixated to the transportation means when the casing which is combined with the wheel member rotates on the first center C as the center the rotation rotor accommodated to the accommodating hole of the casing rotates as it contacts the sun gear which is in a halt state. That is interlocked with the rotation of the casing the rotation rotor rotates along the same rotation direction as each of the internal gear teeth interlocks with each of the external gear teeth of the sun gear which are formed on the rotation rotor .

In other words the casing rotates around the first center C as the center and the rotation rotor accommodated to the accommodating hole in an eccentric state rotates around the second center C interlocked with the rotation movement of the casing . In addition together with the rotation of the rotation rotor itself the second center C which becomes the rotation center of the rotation rotor rotates as it forms a circular orbit around the first center C. Therefore the second center C which is eccentric from the first center C which is the rotation center of the casing moves its location on a predetermined orbit along the rotation of the casing .

Herein in a case where excessive force is applied to the transportation means that is when the casing is rapidly accelerated an internal gear tooth and external gear tooth rotating and mutually contacting each other change orders and in the process where an external gear tooth is inserted inside an internal gear tooth the resistance fluid filled inside the internal gear tooth cannot escape quickly. In this process the resistance fluid receives compressive force by the external gear tooth being inserted into and the delay of time escaping from the internal space of the internal gear tooth of the resistance fluid which is in a liquid state of high viscosity reducing the speed at which the external gear tooth is inserted inside the internal gear tooth also restricting the rotation speed of the casing and wheel member .

However in a case where the rotation speed of the casing is slow or rapid acceleration is not generated the resistance fluid can sufficiently escape through a minute gap formed between the internal gear tooth and external gear tooth during rotation of the rotation rotor thereby forming a stable flow and maintaining a stable speed.

Next an active speed restricting wheel assembly according to a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention is explained in detail hereinbelow.

With reference to the active speed restricting wheel assembly according to the second exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a casing rotation rotor sun gear resistance fluid cover member and wheel member .

However the casing rotation rotor resistance fluid cover member and wheel member of the present exemplary embodiment are the same as the aforementioned constituents of the first exemplary embodiment and thus repeated explanation is omitted.

Just as in the first exemplary embodiment the sun gear is a member accommodated inside the rotation space of the rotation rotor and fixated so as not to rotate and has a plurality of external gear teeth protruding.

However the sun gear of the present exemplary embodiment has a fluid flow route penetrating the sun gear and which connects one side of the external gear tooth with the other side penetrating the sun gear . In addition by the rotation of the rotation rotor the resistance fluid may flow not only into a space between the external gear tooth of the sun gear and the internal gear tooth of the rotation rotor but also inside the fluid flow route .

Therefore according to the present exemplary embodiment an additional fluid flow route where the resistance fluid can flow is formed on the sun gear thus enabling flexible rotation operations.

In addition it is possible to control the effect of controlling the rotation speed of the casing by controlling the count and inside caliper etc. of the fluid flow route formed on the sun gear thereby controlling the flowing volume of the resistance fluid .

Although a few embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described it would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in this embodiment without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention the scope of which is defined in the claims and their equivalents.
