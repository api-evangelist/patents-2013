Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a node e.g. a transmission station or a transceiver node and a wireless device e.g. a mobile device . Some wireless devices communicate using orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA in a downlink DL transmission and single carrier frequency division multiple access SC FDMA in an uplink UL transmission. Standards and protocols that use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM for signal transmission include the third generation partnership project 3GPP long term evolution LTE the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.16 standard e.g. 802.16e 802.16m which is commonly known to industry groups as WiMAX Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access and the IEEE 802.11 standard which is commonly known to industry groups as WiFi.

In 3GPP radio access network RAN LTE systems the node can be a combination of Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network E UTRAN Node Bs also commonly denoted as evolved Node Bs enhanced Node Bs eNodeBs or eNBs and Radio Network Controllers RNCs which communicate with the wireless device known as a user equipment UE . The downlink DL transmission also known as a broadcast channel BC can be a communication from the node e.g. eNodeB to the wireless device e.g. UE and the uplink UL transmission also known as a multiple access channel MAC can be a communication from the wireless device to the node.

Downlink and uplink channels or transmissions can use time division duplexing TDD or frequency division duplexing FDD . Time division duplexing TDD is an application of time division multiplexing TDM to separate downlink and uplink signals. In TDD downlink signals and uplink signals may be carried on a same carrier frequency i.e. shared carrier frequency where the downlink signals use a different time interval from the uplink signals so the downlink signals and the uplink signals do not generate interference for each other. TDM is a type of digital multiplexing in which two or more bit streams or signals such as a downlink or uplink are transferred apparently simultaneously as sub channels in one communication channel but are physically transmitted on different resources. In frequency division duplexing FDD an uplink transmission and a downlink transmission can operate using different frequency carriers i.e. separate carrier frequency for each transmission direction . In FDD interference can be avoided because the downlink signals use a different frequency carrier from the uplink signals.

The eNB can have multiple antennas used for transmission to the UEs allowing the eNB to use multiple input and multiple output MIMO . MIMO is a smart antenna technology that refers to the use of multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to improve communication performance where input and output refer to a radio channel carrying the signal not necessarily to the devices having antennas. In MIMO up to eight transmit or receive antennas can be used or up to eight channels can be used for transmission of a resource.

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.

Before the present invention is disclosed and described it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures process steps or materials disclosed herein but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element. Numbers provided in flow charts and processes are provided for clarity in illustrating steps and operations and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence.

An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

A wireless communication system can be subdivided into various sections referred to as layers. In the LTE system communication layers can include the physical PHY media access control MAC radio link control RLC packet data convergence protocol PDCP and radio resource control RRC layers. The physical layer can include the basic hardware transmission components of a wireless communication system as illustrated in . A basic multiple input multiple output MIMO system is used for simplicity in illustrating the basic hardware transmission components but the components can also be adapted for a complex MIMO system a single input and single output SISO system or similar system. For example in a MIMO system at the transmitter binary input data can be protected through encoding using a channel encoder interleaved against fading phenomenon using an interleaver and mapped to improve reliability using a mapper . The mapped data can be separated into layers for antenna ports by a transmitter TX beamformer and the layers can be OFDM modulated into OFDM symbols using modulators A B. The modulators can use an inverse fast Fourier transform IFFT algorithm to compute the inverse discrete Fourier transform IDFT to generate modulated signals vector x for each antenna port . The modulated signals can be converted to analog signals with digital to analog converters DACs A B. The analog signals can be transmitted via radio frequency RF transmitters Txs A B configured to send the signal to transmitter antennas A B operable to communicate the signal. The analog signals will follow a path referred to as a channel. The analog signals travelling through that path can be referred to as a channel signal . The physical layer can include other components not shown such as series to parallel S P converters parallel to serial P S converters cyclic prefix CP inserters and deleters guardband inserters and deleters and other desired components.

The transmitted channel signal can be subject to noise and interference . The interference can include intra cell interference and intercell interference. Intra cell interference can refer to interference from other channel signals transmitted within the cell of the transmitter . Intercell interference can refer to interference from other channel signals transmitted by neighboring cells. The noise and interference is represented as an addition to the channel signal which can be received by receiver antennas A B and one or more radio frequency RF receivers Rxs A B at the receiver . The channel signal combined with the noise and interference can be converted to a digital modulated signal with analog to digital converters ADCs A B. The digital signal can be OFDM demodulated using demodulators A B. The demodulators can use a fast Fourier transform FFT algorithm to compute the discrete Fourier transform DFT to generate demodulated signals vector y for each antenna port . A channel estimator can use the demodulated signal to estimate the channel and the noise and interference that occurs in the channel. The channel estimator can include a feedback generator or be in communication with the feedback generator which can generate a physical uplink shared channel PUSCH feedback report such as a channel quality indicator CQI report a precoding matrix indicator PMI report a transmission rank indicator RI report or a physical uplink control channel PUCCH e.g. including RI or PMI . The CQI can be used to assist the MIMO transmissions modes. The demodulated signals can be combined using a MIMO decoder demapped using a demapper deinterleaved using a deinterleaver and decoded by a channel decoder to generate binary output data that can be used by other layers of the receiving station.

In one example the resource elements REs can represent elements of a radio frame structure transmitted on the physical PHY layer in a downlink transmission between a node e.g. eNodeB and the wireless device e.g. UE using a generic 3GPP long term evolution LTE frame structure as illustrated in .

Each slot for a component carrier CC used by the node and the wireless device can include multiple resource blocks RBs and based on the CC frequency bandwidth. The CC can have a carrier frequency having a bandwidth and center frequency. Each subframe of the CC can include downlink control information DCI found in the legacy PDCCH. The legacy PDCCH in the control region can include one to three columns of the first OFDM symbols in each subframe or physical RB PRB when a legacy PDDCH is used. The remaining 11 to 13 OFDM symbols or 14 OFDM symbols when legacy PDCCH is not used in the subframe may be allocated to the PDSCH for data for short or normal cyclic prefix .

The control region can include physical control format indicator channel PCFICH physical hybrid automatic repeat request hybrid ARQ indicator channel PHICH and the PDCCH. The control region has a flexible control design to avoid unnecessary overhead. The number of OFDM symbols in the control region used for the PDCCH can be determined by the control channel format indicator CFI transmitted in the physical control format indicator channel PCFICH . The PCFICH can be located in the first OFDM symbol of each subframe. The PCFICH and PHICH can have priority over the PDCCH so the PCFICH and PHICH are scheduled prior to the PDCCH.

Each RB physical RB or PRB can include 12 15 kHz subcarriers on the frequency axis and 6 or 7 orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM symbols on the time axis per slot. The RB can use seven OFDM symbols if a short or normal cyclic prefix is employed. The RB can use six OFDM symbols if an extended cyclic prefix is used. The resource block can be mapped to 84 resource elements REs using short or normal cyclic prefixing or the resource block can be mapped to 72 REs not shown using extended cyclic prefixing. The RE can be a unit of one OFDM symbol by one subcarrier i.e. 15 kHz .

Each RE can transmit two bits and of information in the case of quadrature phase shift keying QPSK modulation. Other types of modulation may be used such as 16 quadrature amplitude modulation QAM or 64 QAM to transmit a greater number of bits in each RE or bi phase shift keying BPSK modulation to transmit a lesser number of bits a single bit in each RE. The RB can be configured for a downlink transmission from the eNodeB to the UE or the RB can be configured for an uplink transmission from the UE to the eNodeB.

Reference signals can be transmitted by OFDM symbols via resource elements in the resource blocks. Reference signals or pilot signals or tones can be a known signal used for various reasons such as to estimate a channel and or noise in the channel. Reference signals can be received and transmitted by transmitting stations and mobile communication devices. Different types of reference signals RS can be used in an RB. For example in LTE systems downlink reference signal types can include a cell specific reference signal CRS a multicast broadcast single frequency network MBSFN reference signal a UE specific reference signal UE specific RS or UE RS or a demodulation reference signal DMRS positioning reference signal PRS and a channel state information reference signal CSI RS .

A MIMO wireless network can be used for beamforming. Beamforming or spatial filtering is a signal processing technique used in antenna arrays for directional signal transmission or reception. Beamforming can be achieved by combining elements in a phased array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. Beamforming can be used at both the transmitting and receiving ends in order to achieve spatial selectivity.

Cellular data demand continues to experience an increasing growth rate. Combined with the scarcity of available bandwidth wireless and cellular systems can use MIMO to deliver drastically increased spectral efficiencies to address the capacity demand. Single user SU and multi user MU MIMO systems are integral parts of 3GPP Long Term Evolution LTE specifications with antenna dimensions of up to eight antennas in a base station e.g. eNodeB . However an order of magnitude increase in the number of transmit antennas known as massive MIMO or full dimension MIMO can result in significantly higher spectral efficiency.

Per user data demand in wireless network continues to grow. The wireless link over the air between base station e.g. eNB and mobile device e.g. UE can be a major bottleneck. Techniques for solving this bottleneck can be provided by a massive number of antennas at the base station site e.g. eNB as illustrated by . depicts a large antenna array that includes eight rows and eight columns of antenna radiation elements . In an example each antenna radiation element can be treated as an antenna in massive MIMO. In another example the large antenna array can have more than eight antenna radiation elements or eight antennas such as 64 antennas.

With many even hundreds of antennas relatively large gains in terms spectrum efficiency in units of bit second Hertz bit s Hz can be achieved. Multiplexing e.g. spatial multiplexing can support parallel transmissions to multiple UEs without significant mutual interference to each other. However many practical and standard related challenges can occur with massive MIMO.

For example with legacy MIMO each antenna can have a separate feedback and or measurement e.g. CSI RS . Legacy MIMO can supports up to 8 antenna ports. Practical constraints may not allow per antenna channel state information CSI feedback for massive MIMO. In addition too much channel feedback can sacrifice precious resources for non data transmissions. Efficient and timely channel feedback and or measurement can be addressed for any meaningful implementation of massive MIMO. Another challenge can be UE selection and pairing for spatial multiplexing MU MIMO . For instance a benefit of massive MIMO can be massive MIMO s potential on supporting MU MIMO with minimal interference. With limited channel feedback and UEs scattering across the area addressing UE selection and pairing can be helpful on harnessing the massive MIMO. As with many technologies providing legacy support where a legacy UE can operate properly with a massive MIMO eNB can also be beneficial. This enables legacy UEs to not be hurt by the implementation of massive MIMO. Solving these challenges can allow for standardization and a practical implementation.

The technology e.g. eNBs UEs methods computer circuitry and systems as described herein can resolve challenges associated with massive MIMO and can provide further advanced techniques by taking advantage of other unique properties of massive MIMO. For example with massive MIMO a cell can be adaptively sectorized to support parallel transmissions to multiple users MU . In another example architecture for supporting intra cell and inter cell interference coordination can be provided. The technology can be used to smoothly incorporate legacy support and provide advanced features for advanced UEs at a same time. In another configuration the technology can provide a passive or active tracking mechanism so that a virtual cell can cover moving UEs for minimal feedback and or handover.

As illustrated in the eNB can apply multi user beamforming MU beamforming to form several beam cones A C which can cover a substantial area of a cell . The beam cones can serve the UEs B C of the cell. In an example the plurality of beam cones can cover a whole sector or cell. Each beam cone can represent a virtual legacy eNB cell so that each beam cone can include its own system information. For instance system information such as reference signals RSs cell identifier CID or cell ID antenna ports primary synchronization signals PSS secondary synchronization signals SSS system information blocks SIBs control channels e.g. a physical downlink control channel PDCCH and so forth can be communicated in each beam cone.

The separate and distinct system information between beam cones can make the virtual cells within the cell transparent to legacy UEs. Each beam cone may also have new control signaling e.g. DCI for massive MIMO enabled UEs to take further advantage of massive MIMO. In another example the eNB can adjust beam cones adaptively for better cell coverage and or beamforming. In another configuration the eNB can track UEs by adjusting beams either actively or passively. The eNBs or UEs may also perform inter cell cone coordination for interference coordination.

The following provides additional details of the examples. For illustration M number of transmit antennas can be assumed at the eNB. As used herein the terms beam cone cone virtual cell and virtual sector may be used interchangeably. illustrates a simple beam direction e.g. 90 of a beam in two dimensions 2D generated by an antenna array. In beamforming a beam or a main lobe can be generated. As part of beamforming side lobes can also be generated. Side lobes can be lobes e.g. local maxima of a far field radiation pattern that are not the main lobe i.e. the main beam from beamforming . The beams or beam cones can also be generated in three dimensions 3D . The each beam and can have a different direction to cover a different spatial region or area as illustrated in .

In an example the technology can be used to design multi cones. The eNB can design or generate a set of base layer precoding matrices. The precoding matrices can be used to form multiple cones that can divide the space into several cells e.g. virtual cells . The precoding matrices can provide a function e.g. g to generate the size shape and or angle of the beam cones. The size e.g. narrow or wide shape e.g. rectangular or circular and or angle e.g. of the beam cone can depend on the eNB implementation and or specific antenna array setup.

For example the eNB can use or generate a set of K precoding matrices F F F . . . FK where Fk is of dimension M L for a particular area in the sector or cone and K is a number of beam cones for space. M is the number of transmit antennas and L can be a number e.g. 1 2 4 8 16 32 or 64 corresponding to antenna ports. Different Fk s can cover different spatial regions of a 3D space which can depend on an antenna shape. In an example the set F . . . FK can attempt to cover a whole space or cell. The precoding matrices F can be dynamic and transparent to UEs.

From UEs point of view or a protocol side each cone e.g. virtual cell can be a real sector e.g. real cell . As previously stated each cone can have a distinct cell id distinct antenna ports distinct PSS and or SSS or distinct SIBs. For example the eNB can transmit the physical wireless signals for each virtual cell defined by Fk. The signal emitted from the eNB can be an aggregation of the various beam cones. The aggregated signal can have power normalization. For instance the eNB s signal on system information e.g. RS can be represented as F s F s . . . FK sK where sk is the system information.

In another example each cone can operate as a virtual sector or virtual cell. The UEs associated with the virtual sector can feed back a report e.g. CQI based on effective channels. For example with a UE j in cell k the UE j can measure channel HFS where His a channel impulse response for the UE j Fis a precoding matrix for the virtual cell k Sis a reference signal e.g. cell specific reference signal CRS for the virtual cell k. Thus the effective channel for UE j can be represented by HF.

For each virtual sector k a UE uk can be chosen based on the collected reports. In an example the eNB can select a UE uk based on a virtual sector k with a best report among the virtual sectors. The transmitted data signal from eNB can be represented by

In another configuration the virtual cones e.g. beam cones can be dynamically adapted to the conditions of a cell or sector. For instance an initial design or determination of the virtual cones may not be suitable for the cell due to various reasons such as changing UEs changing channels multipath due to reflection or gaps in coverage.

For example cone collisions can occur due to multipath and or scattering as illustrated in . illustrates multipath of multiple virtual cells defined by Fks where a second beam cone reflects on to a spatial region of a first beam cone so the signals collide with each other which can cause strong interference for a UE . With multipath the UE can observe a weak signal to interference plus noise ratio SINR which can be interpreted as a condition similar to the UE being on a cell edge between two cells. A signal to interference plus noise ratio SINR or signal to interference ratio S I or SIR also known as the carrier to interference ratio C I CIR refers to the quotient between the average received modulated carrier power S or C and the average received co channel interference power I i.e. cross talk from other transmitters than the useful signal .

To reduce interference and or improve coverage various mechanisms and protocols can be used to alter the beam cones. For example the eNB can consolidate the colliding cones F G as one virtual cell or beam cone H as illustrated in . illustrates consolidating beam cones D G for an eNB A into 3 beam cones D E and H for the eNB B. Each beam cone D H can service a UE D I. In an example one beam cone G can have the same system information as the consolidated beam cone H and another beam cone F disappears. In an example collision reduction via consolidation can be optimized based on UE locations.

In another example the eNB can shut off one cone without consolidation if no active UE is inside the cone. The UE can report interfering cones or cells based on feedback measurements such as CSI or SINR. The eNB can turn off the cone based on the feedback and observe feedback for further optimization.

In another configuration the eNB can move one cone away from an interfering position by adjusting or re defining the precoding matrix Fk. In another example the eNB can use FDD or TDD to avoid interference for the virtual cells just as if two legacy cells are cooperating.

With interference between two cones e.g. and or F and G the eNB can use frequency division multiplexing FDM for the pair. In an example the eNB can control all the cones in the cell by using backhaul link signaling.

In another example the plurality of beam cones can have non perfect cell coverage. Even though the number of antennas can be large any limited number of configurations may lead to imperfect cell coverage and beamforming. For example the cone defining beams may not be sharp e.g. not a focused direction for wider spatial areas or cone defining beams may not be perfectly orthogonal. A tradeoff may exist between sharpness and cell coverage where the cones defined by a specific set of K matrices F may not cover a whole space effectively. In this case at least two options can be implemented such as cell scanning.

In cell scanning several sets of matrices F e.g. F A and F B can be designed and the eNB can alternate turning on each set of matrices as illustrated by . illustrates the spatial area of two sets of beam cones used for cell scanning in a cell . The sets of beam cones can be rotated in the time domain to avoid interference with other sets of beam cones. Rotating between several sets of matrices F can provide greater coverage of a spatial area such as a cell. illustrates beam directions in 2D of alternative sets of precoding matrices e.g. F A and F B used for cell scanning. In an example each UE can feed back an SINR or CQI to the eNB for alternative sets of precoding matrices to select a best beam cone and set of precoding matrices for the UE.

An imitation variation or modification of a concept of eICIC can include a wide beam cone and the set of narrow beam cones as illustrated in . For example a set of matrices F can be designed for small coverage areas A B e.g. small cells with relatively sharp or narrow beams and a matrix F can be designed for wide overage area e.g. a fat cell as back up for general UEs not covered by the set of narrow beam. Then FDM e.g. inter cell interference coordination or TDM e.g. enhanced inter cell interference coordination eICIC or almost blank subframes ABS can be used between the set of narrow beam cones and the wide beam cone so that the transmission of the wide beam cone does not interfere with the transmissions of the set of narrow beam cones. In another example not shown a set of matrices F can be designed for wide coverage areas and a much larger set of matrices F can be designed for small coverage areas.

Legacy inter cell interference coordination ICIC or legacy enhanced ICIC eICIC may be used for resource coordination to reduce interference between the transmission stations or nodes . A network can support frequency domain inter cell interference coordination ICIC or time domain enhanced ICIC eICIC . In an example ICIC can be used to decrease interference between neighboring cells or nodes e.g. coordination nodes or cooperation nodes by lowering the power of a part of the subchannels in the frequency domain which then can be received close to the node. The subchannels do not interfere with the same subchannels used in neighboring cells and thus data can be sent to mobile devices with less interference on the subchannels close to the cell.

Enhanced ICIC eICIC can be used in the time domain for heterogeneous networks HetNets where a high power macro cell can be complemented with low power nodes LPN such as pico cells hotspots in shopping centers or at airports or femto cells hotspots in small areas such as homes or businesses . The low power nodes can exist inside a macro cell coverage area. The macro cell can transmit long range high power signals and the low power nodes can transmit low power signals over short distances. In an example to mitigate interference between the macro cell and the several low power nodes located within the macro cell coverage area eICIC can coordinate the blanking of subframes in the time domain in the macro cell. Alternatively to reduce interference in eICIC some macro downlink DL subframes can be converted into low interference subframes or almost blank subframes ABS when LPN are transmitting so subframes for a macro node can be categorized as regular subframes or ABS subframes. The concepts of eICIC can be applied to a wide beam cone and the set of narrow beam cones as previously described.

In another example the node e.g. eNB can provide active or passive UE tracking as illustrated by . When UEs move around or only a small number of UEs are active within a cell maintaining a virtual cell structure may be costly. Because the eNB can have a large number of antennas in the antenna array the eNB can utilize the observations e.g. angle of arrival AoA measurements to track UEs by adjusting the cone defining beams e.g. matrices F . When UE tracking is used the UE can be under a same virtual cell which can avoid handovers and extensive feedback. The eNB can adapt the virtual cones e.g. adjusting F so that the virtual cones cover the moving UEs. From the UE s perspective the serving cell and or CQI may not change even though the UE is actually moving.

For example in active UE tracking when a UE determines channel quality changes e.g. channel quality dramatically drops or fluctuates which can be due to movement the UE can actively send out triggering signals to the eNB for the eNB to initialize tracking. Channel quality changes can be determined by calculations based on downlink reference signals RS and or synchronization signals SS . Alternatively the UE can determine movement by a motion sensor or using global positioning system GPS . Depending on rate of the channel changes the eNB can request more frequent or less CQI reports or other similar channel quality report . The feedback reports can use standard channel feedback or differential channel feedback.

In another example passive UE tracking can be implemented where UE tracking is transparent to the UE. For example the eNB can determine which UEs are moving and determine to actively monitor channel changes in those UEs. For instance monitoring channel changes can be determined by calculations based on uplink RS SS. The eNB can used various mechanisms to determine how to adjust the cone direction.

In an example certain channel tracking parameters can be reciprocal in both TDD and FDD cases. The large number of antennas can provide accurate estimation on these parameters.

In an example each virtual cell generated by the set of matrices F can be treated as a separate cell. This allows a node e.g. eNB to use inter cell interference coordination ICIC as illustrated in . As discussed previously each eNB with an antenna array K L can define one or more sets of cone forming beams K L for a cell K L. The cone forming beams can serve UEs K L. For each eNB the eNB can alternatively turn on a set of beams for adaptive cell coverage or cell scanning. These beams can cause interference to neighboring cells e.g. physical or virtual cells just as in real cells. The ICIC can be used in a long term adaptation.

In an example an advanced UE can feedback the interference measurement e.g. virtual cell ID and time stamp to its serving eNB. The advanced UE can assist neighboring cells to coordinate a cone sweeping sequence to avoid interference. The UE can monitor neighboring cells to generate the interference measurements. The advanced UE can feedback interference measurement with IDs of several cones to eNB. This interference measurement information can be shared among neighboring eNBs over special links e.g. backhauls links or X2 interface . In an example the on off pattern of the matrices F can be fixed so neighboring cells can coordinate the patterns to avoid severe interference. In another example based on interference measurement information neighboring cells can generate better sweeping patterns to avoid certain severe interfering cones.

In another example the neighboring eNBs can jointly re design the cone defining beams F for better interference coordination. In another example a single eNB can coordinate between the cone defining beams F of multiple cells served by the single eNB.

The technology described provides various benefits. For example multiple virtual small cells can be created such that MU transmissions are supported. Independent cell IDs and or RSs can allow simple management and or standards. The virtual cells can actually move around e.g. by just adjusting a defining precoder set which allows virtual cells to be more flexible compared to fixed physical small cells. The use of virtual cells can be antenna topology e.g. square or circular cone independent. For example an operator can design the sectorization e.g. cones F using various cones shapes using different antenna topologies.

Another example provides functionality of computer circuitry of a processor and or transceiver on a node e.g. evolved Node B eNB operable to adaptively sectorize a spatial region for parallel multi user transmissions as shown in the flow chart in . The functionality may be implemented as a method or the functionality may be executed as instructions on a machine where the instructions are included on at least one computer readable medium or one non transitory machine readable storage medium. The computer circuitry can be configured to generate a set of precoding matrices for a set of beam cones in the spatial region wherein a precoding matrix in the set of precoding matrices is used for each beam cone each beam cone covers a beam cone spatial region that differs from another beam cone spatial region of another beam cone in the spatial region and each beam cone includes system information that differs from the system information of the other beam cones in the spatial region as in block . The computer circuitry can be further configured to generate a beam cone for multi user beamforming transmissions using the system information for the beam cone as in block .

In an example the system information for each beam cone can include a unique cell identifier CID antenna ports primary synchronization signals PSS secondary synchronization signals SSS system information blocks SIBs reference signals RSs control channels or physical downlink control channel PDCCH . RSs can include cell specific reference signals CRS channel state information reference signals CSI RS or demodulation reference signals DM RS . In another example the computer circuitry can be further configured to receive a channel quality indicator CQI for an effective channel HFfrom a user equipment UE j in a virtual cell k formed by the beam cone wherein the UE j measures channel HFS where His a channel impulse response for the UE j Fis a precoding matrix for the virtual cell k Sis a reference signal for the virtual cell k and j and k are integers. Fcan have a dimension M L where M is a number of transmit antennas with M 8 transmit antennas L is a number of corresponding antenna ports with L 1 2 4 8 and M and L are integers

In another configuration the computer circuitry can be further configured to select a user equipment UE uk for a virtual cell k based on a set of channel quality indicator CQI reports and transmit a data signal X to the UE u where X is represented by

In another example the computer circuitry can be further configured to Determine when two beam cones signals collide at a user equipment UE due to multipath signal scattering or signal reflection and modify a beam cone to avoid a signal collision. The modification can include Consolidating two beam cones by assigning two precoding matrices used in the colliding signals to a common cell identifier CID forming a single virtual cell turning off one of the beam cone when no UE within the one beam cone is actively communicating with the node moving one of the beam cones away from another beam cone by adjusting the CID for the one beam cone to another precoding matrix or using frequency division duplexing FDD or time division duplexing TDD on one of the beam cones to avoid the signal collision.

In another configuration the computer circuitry can be further configured to generate at least two different sets of precoding matrices for the set of beam cones and rotate between the at least two different sets of precoding matrices for cell scanning and better coverage of the spatial region. Each beam cone can include a cell identifier CID and each set of precoding matrices can cover different spatial regions from each other.

In another example the computer circuitry can be further configured to generate a wide area precoding matrix for covering a wide area with a wide beam cone generate a set of narrow region precoding matrices for covering narrow regions with a set of narrow beam cones and use frequency division multiplexing FDM time division multiplexing TDM or enhanced inter cell interference coordination eICIC for transmissions using the wide beam cone or the set of narrow beam cones. For example eICIC can be used to alternate between a normal subframe and an almost blank subframe ABS for the wide beam cone. In an example the set of narrow beam cones can be used within the wide area.

In another configuration the computer circuitry can be further configured to track a user equipment UE by adjusting the beam cone. The computer circuitry can implement active UE tracking or passive UE tracking. For active UE tracking the computer circuitry can be further configured to Receive a tracking trigger signal from the UE when a channel quality changes due to UE movement change the periodicity of receiving a channel quality indicator CQI via a request to the UE and adjust the precoding matrix of a beam cone representing a virtual cell serving the UE to another precoding matrix forming an adjusted beam cone covering a different spatial area from the beam cone of the precoding matrix when the other precoding matrix provides better channel quality than the beam cone of the precoding matrix. The virtual cell can be indexed by a cell identifier CID . For passive UE tracking the computer circuitry can be further configured to Monitor channel quality changes due to UE movement and adjust a beam cone direction by adjusting the precoding matrix of the CID serving the UE to another precoding matrix forming an adjusted beam cone covering a different spatial area from the beam cone of the precoding matrix. The adjusted beam cone direction can be based on uplink reference signals RS or synchronization signals SS .

In another example the computer circuitry can be further configured to Receive from a user equipment UE an interference measurement feedback message including system information of a neighboring cell and coordinate scheduling of a set of cone forming beams with the neighboring cell to avoid inter cell interference.
