Referring to the drawings like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding features throughout the several views.

Exemplary embodiments of the invention comprise a method of or system for incentivized advertising. For example certain embodiments of a method may comprise one or more of the steps of illustrated in . At block a content identifier e.g. a song title may be displayed on a user computing device. Such content identifier may for example identify a digital content item such as a song TV show movie downloadable software app or the like. Such digital content items are typically of the type available for a purchase price by the general public. At block a selection icon see for example in may be provided in visual association with the content identifier wherein the selection icon is preferably selectable by the user. In certain preferred embodiments the selection icon may further be provided in visual association with for example the name or a logo of the advertiser. At block if the selection icon is selected at least a portion of an advertisement media item is presented on the user computing device. The advertisement media item e.g. a video advertisement would preferably pertain to a product service or brand of an advertiser and would be presentable for at least an ad impression period. At blocks and if the advertisement media item is presented on the user computing device for at least the ad impression period the digital content item is imparted to the user at a discount. The discount may be a reduction in the purchase price or for free.

In certain embodiments the step of imparting is accomplished by issuing a respective redemption code to the user. The redemption code would typically be redeemable in exchange for the digital content item at the discount. In such embodiments for example the redemption code may be represented by an activatable redemption icon presented in simultaneous visual association with a message graphic the message graphic depicting at least one or more of a product service or brand of the advertiser. The redemption code may be issued by way of an email. Moreover in preferred embodiments the redemption code may electronically transferable by the user to a transferee thereby allowing the transferee to redeem the redemption code.

In particular embodiments of a method in accordance with the present invention the digital content item is chosen from the group consisting of a song a TV episode a movie a game and a software application. Moreover the advertisement media item which may be otherwise referred to herein as an ad media item may be a video advertisement. In preferred such embodiments the video advertisement may be streamed from a video server element such as the video sharing website represented in .

The ad impression period may be defined and implemented in various ways from one embodiment to the next. By way of example the ad impression period may be the full length of the video advertisement. Alternatively the ad impression period may be established as a fixed amount of time e.g. 20 seconds 30 seconds etc. equal to or less than the full length of the video advertisement. In further alternative the ad impression period may be an amount of time calculated as a fixed percentage of the full length of the video advertisement. For example the app running on the user computing device may be configured to require that the the video advertisement is presented e.g. played for at least 50 of the actual full video length before a redemption code may be issued to the respective user.

Referring to block of certain preferred embodiments of the methods described herein may comprise the further step of exhibiting on the user computing device an advertiser landing page see for example reference character in after the advertisement media item has been presented for at least the ad impression period. The landing page may preferably be a web page of the advertiser accessed or otherwise provided by way of the ad landing page URL. Further after the step of imparting or issuing a redemption code to a user a social media landing page see for example may be revealed on the user computing device . The social media landing page may include one or more selectable links e.g. on icons or buttons and by which the user may enter one or more respective social networking pages of the advertiser.

Embodiments may involve a non transitory computer readable storage medium storing a program that causes a user computing device such as the one represented at in to conduct a method comprising one or more steps such as those depicted in . For example referring block a content identifier may be displayed on the user computing device. The content identifier e.g. song title identifies a digital content item e.g. a song typically being of the type available for a purchase price by the general public through for example an Internet accessible digital content store. At block a selection icon such as the one illustrated at in may be provided in visual association with the content identifier wherein the selection icon is selectable by the user. At block if the selection icon is selected by the user at least a portion of a video advertisement is presented on the user computing device . The video advertisement may preferably be streamed from a remote server see for example in would pertain to a product service or brand of an advertiser and would be presentable for at least an ad impression period. In embodiments such remote server may preferably be operated by a third party. At block if the video advertisement is presented for at least the ad impression period the digital content item may be caused to be imparted to the user for free by way of a redemption code. Referring to for example such redemption code may preferably be represented by an activatable redemption icon button . The redemption button may for example be presented in simultaneous visual association with a message graphic . A message graphic may be in the form of a thank you message and may typically depict at least one or more of a product service or brand e.g. logo of the advertiser. Such a message graphic may also contain a further clickable link to for example an advertiser sponsored content URL see for example in .

In particular embodiments of the non transitory computer readable storage medium the method may comprise further steps. Referring to after the video advertisement has been presented for at least the ad impression period an advertiser landing page may be exhibited on the user computing device. In addition for example after the user presses the continue button illustrated at the top right of the view in a social media landing page as illustrated in may be revealed on the user computing device. As shown in for non limiting illustration the social media landing page may include one or more selectable links e.g. the icons or buttons at and by which the user may enter one or more respective social networking pages of the advertiser. The advertiser s usernames e.g. as shown at and corresponding to each of the social media pages may also be depicted on the social media landing page.

Referring again to a method in accordance with the present invention may be described or defined to include further steps and components. For example at block campaign data what may otherwise be referred to herein as campaign purchase data of an advertiser may be received by for example an administrator element . The campaign data may preferably include for example one or more of an advertiser name an ad media item URL and an ad landing page URL. The administrator element may be one or more natural persons one or more computers e.g. servers or related components or a combination thereof. At block an inventory of redemption codes may be acquired e.g. purchased or earmarked from or by for example a digital content store . As indicated before the redemption codes would typically be of the type redeemable in exchange for respective digital content items otherwise available for a purchase price by the general public e.g. directly from the digital content store . At block a software application is provided e.g. by way of an Internet accessible app store for installation on a user computing device of a user. Such software application may have a respective name or logo which may be displayed for example as shown at in .

Returning to the software application may preferably be configured to enable performance of a subseries of steps specifically performed by or through the user computing device. For example at block one or more content identifiers may be displayed on the user computing device wherein the content identifiers each identify a respective one of the digital content items. At block a respective selection icon may be provided in visual association with one or more of the content identifiers wherein the selection icons are selectable by the user. At block if one of the selection icons is selected at least a portion of a respective advertisement media item is presented e.g. played on the user computing device wherein each advertisement media item pertains to a product service or brand of the advertiser and is presentable for at least an ad impression period. The presentation of the advertisement media item on the user computing device may preferably be by way of direct streaming from a third party remote server .

Once the software application is downloaded and installed on the user computing device user registration data of the respective user may be obtained. Such user registration data may preferably include an electronic address e.g. email address of the respective registering user. At block the system by way of or in coordination with the functionality of the software application verifies whether the respective advertisement media item was presented for at least the requisite ad impression period. If it was a respective one of the redemption codes is issued to the user. Referring to for example the redemption code is preferably represented by an activatable redemption icon presentable in simultaneous visual association with at least one ad view e.g. advertisement message graphic and or social media landing page illustrated at . Each ad view typically depicts at least one or more of a product service or brand of the advertiser.

In certain embodiments of the method the message graphic may be included in the campaign data. As illustrated in the redemption code may be issued at least by way of the electronic address wherein the respective ad view is the message graphic . Alternatively or in addition as illustrated in at least one of the ad views may be an ad landing page presentable by way of the ad landing page URL.

Methods discussed herein may be carried out in a manner which involves further details and steps. For example the step of acquiring campaign data is preferably performed for each of a multiplicity of advertisers. Similarly the steps of providing the software application and obtaining user registration data are preferably performed for each of a plurality of users for example each by way of a respective user computing device . In such embodiments it is particularly valuable to allow advertisers to apply their campaign budgets in a manner which targets those users who are more likely to purchase their products or services. To accommodate this certain of the methods discussed herein may comprise additional target marketing steps or features. The campaign data may include one or more target profile parameters elected by the respective advertiser the target profile parameters including one or more of the demographic geographic location and interests of targeted users. Relatedly the user registration data may include secondary user data the secondary user data including one or more of the demographic geographic location and interests of the respective user. Further the computing device may provide additional data such as the active method of internet connections its user s current micro locations etc. Finally a rule may be applied by a portion of the system e.g. server whereby the advertisement media item presented to each respective user is based at least in part on a match between the target profile parameters of the respective advertiser and the secondary user data of the respective user.

Referring again to a system for incentivized targeted advertising may comprise an administrator element and a server element . The server element may include or be in electronic communication with one or more of a user info database digital content dataset database advertisement database and redemption database . The administrator element may be configured to a receive campaign data of an advertiser including at least an advertiser name and an ad media item URL and b acquire an inventory of redemption codes. The server element may be configured to i be in electronic communication between the administrator element and a user computing device of a user ii receive the campaign data from the administrator element iii receive user registration data from the user computing device iv provide one or more content identifiers to the user computing device for display thereon e.g. by way of a GUI v receive a verification from the user computing device that an ad media item has been played thereon for at least an ad impression period wherein the ad media item pertains to a product service or brand of the advertiser and is accessible by the user computing device by way of for example the ad media item URL and vi once the verification has been received e.g. by the server issuing a respective one of the redemption codes to the user. Referring to such redemption code may preferably be represented by an activatable redemption icon presentable in simultaneous visual association with at least one ad view. Each ad view would generally depict at least one or more of a product service or brand of the advertiser.

In certain preferred embodiments the administrator element may be comprised substantially of one or more computers. Further the administrator element may form an integral portion of the server element .

Embodiments of the present invention provide more direct engagement between the advertiser and the user of electronic media. For example the user may be gifted DRM free music for taking the time to view or listen to advertisements which may be targeted directly to that user or their demographic. As a reward for their engagement of the advertising content the user is able to own and or stream their selected music content or other digital content item for free. Advertisers are provided a new channel by which to deliver user interest targeted ads both nationwide and local geo targeted ads. The ads may be user interest based wherein the app and related system components detect user interests based on the content generated from the user s own social media pages.

Advertisers may take part in designing the ad by specifying the targeted ad video as well as a landing page. They may place bids on user s interest keywords and user locations e.g. which may be included in the secondary user data . In preferred embodiments advertisers may be charged only when users finish watching the video and interacting with the advertiser s landing page. By way of example Advertiser X may select a campaign budget of 129 a portion of which goes to an administrator s purchase of an inventory of redemption codes for 100 songs. The system serves 120 video engagements 110 landing page engagements 4 social engagements and 75 email engagements at more competitive cost per engagement CPE rates than conventional CPE rates. In particular embodiments Advertisers can also bid on specific songs or other digital content item to associate with their campaign and receive analytics including user demographics CPM CTR and CPE.

Preferred embodiments of the invention allow users to sign into the app with their social network accounts e.g. Facebook or Twitter . They may then browse a top 50 chart or the like and or search for any song in for example a digital content store such as iTunes or other media content library. The user may redeem a free song after watching a video ad targeted to their interests and or location. The user may be directed to the advertiser s web page in app for example as their song is being downloaded.

Users are rewarded with redemption codes for iTunes or similar digital content store with a digital content item database for watching sponsored videos. An inventory of redemption codes may be stored in a server side database . Redemption codes may be delivered to users via their email account upon successful completion of a sponsored video advertisement.

Video advertisement content may be hosted in YouTube and delivered via the YouTube API. Users must complete the video advertisements or a predetermined portion thereof in order to earn redemption codes.

The curated Top 50 list may be delivered via private server API. Users may browse the Top 50 list or search the entire iTunes catalog or equivalent . All music metadata song previews and query search results may preferably be delivered via the iTunes Search API or the like .

90 second song previews may be streamed from for example iTunes upon tapping the album artwork for an available song within the Top 50 or Search Library pages. Start Stop controls download progress and play progress may be displayed in place of the album art.

Users may be required to authenticate via their social network login e.g. Facebook in order to gain the full functionality of the app . Future live releases of the app may include a walk through tutorial upon initial launch of the app. Integration with the user s social networks would serve to verify user identity gather demographic data for ad targeting purposes and to acquire users email addresses for song redemption emails.

Advertisers may be provided with analytics integrated with the app to track user behavior demographics and other custom events.

A launch screen not shown may comprise a static image displayed each time the user launches the app from a closed state. In embodiments the launch screen may only be displayed until the app is finished loading into memory. For example the app logo otherwise referred to herein as an app title may stay on screen for several seconds then automatically transition to a login or authentication page. However in certain embodiments such transition may happen immediately if users touch anywhere on the screen of their computing device. In embodiments users who are already logged into their account e.g. on their respective user computing device would not be presented with a login prompt. Rather they may be moved directly to a main chart or Top 50 page see for example . Users who are not logged may be prompted by a pop up login box. The pop up box may preferably mimic the default style of the respective operating system used on the respective user computing device . Preferably no other functions within the app should be accessible until the user has logged in or otherwise authenticated.

An authentication page not shown may be displayed upon launch if the user is not currently logged into the app via their respective social media account. The authentication page may include for example a button to initiate the social media account authentication process e.g. specific to the user s OS version and whether or not they have logged into their social media account vie their OS settings . In preferred embodiments once the user has authenticated they will not log in again until they have explicitly logged out.

Referring to for illustration the Top 50 view or equivalent may be the default view of the app displaying immediately after launch. Referring to the Top 50 listing may be configured to show the up to date hand picked songs chosen by the administrator or operator of the system . Alternatively or in addition the choice and position of the Top 50 songs may be either manually input based on an existing third party chart automatically fed by a partnering music distributor s chart or after enough data has been gathered the chart may be internalized by the system to reflect most popular songs redeemed by all users of the app . This list may allow the user to scroll through the songs or other digital content items preview them and navigate to their respective redemption view. In preferred embodiments the navigation bar at the top of the view may display the app title and a button e.g. the gear button which segues into a setting page as shown for example at . The tab bar at the bottom of the view displays two selectable tabs one for Top 50 and the other for search and respectively . The user can toggle between these two tabs to view the handpicked Top 50 songs or to search the entire catalogue of a respective digital content store for specific titles and artists.

In particular embodiments on the Top 50 or main chart page a logo or other trademark of a sponsoring advertiser may appear under or near for example a selection icon in visual association with the song being sponsored by the advertiser.

Referring again to the Top 50 table view displays a cell for each of the songs chosen for example by the administrator or an operator of the system . This list of songs may be retrieved from the server each time the app is launched. Each table view cell may display a single song or other digital content item . The cell content e.g. album art artist name song title etc. may be retrieved from the digital content store e.g. iTunes Store using the song identifier included in the song list retrieved from the server . Such cell content may be referred to as content datasets and in certain embodiments may be input and stored within or in communication with the server . Tapping anywhere within the cell except the selection icon may initialize the song preview. The album or cover art space may display the art associated with the song and may transition into an animated song preview controller when the preview is loading or playing. The respective user may tap here again while the audio is loading or playing to stop the preview. The selection icon may initially display FREE. If the user taps this button it may animate to display REDEEM. If the user taps again the app may segue into the song redemption view an example of which is depicted in .

Referring to the Search view may be provided to allow users to search the entire digital content store catalog. The search results may be navigated and previewed in the same manner as the Top 50 view. The navigation bar in this page may display a search box or search button leading thereto as illustrated in where users can type in their queries. Referring to once the user taps the search button or selects a result from the results list the navigation bar may display a back button to the search box and search as its title. The results list e.g. above the keyboard if may display the matching results from the digital content store API. Selecting a result may be the equivalent of typing in that specific search query and tapping the search button from the keyboard.

Referring to a song redemption view may display song details and allow the user to redeem the song by watching for example a video advertisement. The user can navigate to this view by for example twice tapping the selection icon for a given song from either the Top 50 or Search views. The ad media content item e.g. video advertisement may be retrieved from a video sharing website such as YouTube . In this view the navigation bar may display the name of the song and a back button to the previous view. A video thumbnail may be provided for example at . The video thumbnail may display a single frame from the video advertisement overlaid with a play button to start the video. A song details section may show detailed song and artist information for the selected song. An instructions section may prompt the user with instructions on how to redeem the song. This section may update with new instructions if the user does not view the requisite amount of the video advertisement.

When the play button is tapped a separate video view not shown may be entered to maximize the usage of the screen area of the user computing device while displaying the streamed video advertisement. The media item URL e.g. the video URL may be retrieved from the server along with the song identifier. The video may then be streamed from a respective video content website e.g. YouTube via a respective API. The video may be overlaid with standard video control elements. In embodiments Previous and Next buttons as well as video scrubbing may be disabled. In particular embodiments a user s attempt to stop or fast forward the video before it completes may result in a pop up box or the like with text reminding the user to finish watching the video. In certain embodiments as a work around in the event that the embedded video s code cannot be altered a timed but phantom layer may be created so that if a user presses the next or similarly disruptive button before a complete ad impression period e.g. 30 seconds has passed they will be prompted with a finish watching message.

Referring to an advertiser landing view may be a modal view that may for example slide up from the bottom of the screen after the conclusion of the video advertisement. The majority of the view may contain a webview directed to the advertiser s mobile web page. The web URL also referred to herein as an ad landing page URL may be retrieved by the app from the server along with the song identifier. The webview may display for example HTML retrieved from the advertiser s mobile website. The navigation bar of this view may show the advertiser as the title as well as a Done or Continue button. Tapping the Done button may dismiss the landing view and again reveal the song redemption view beneath it. In the alternative tapping the Continue button may take the user to a social media page such as the one shown in .

The user may be presented with CAPTCHAs after a certain number of redemption within a given timeframe as a measure to prevent script abuses. CAPTCHAs may be in the form of numbers and letters recognition swipe pattern capture etc. After a certain number of failed attempts the user account may be banned for a specified amount of time. In addition user accounts may be banned upon detection of any attempts to run 3party scripts to automatically complete engagements.

The Redeem button may send a POST request to the server containing information about the user and the song redeemed e.g. in a user info database and the redemption database shown in . The user may be presented with a popup alert saying that the song has been redeemed. An Earn Another Song button may be provided to dismiss the current view and segue back to the Top 50 or Search view depending on which was used to redeem the current song.

Referring to a Settings view may display app and user information and may include links to various functions. The view may be accessed by tapping for example the gear icon in the navigation bar from the Top 50 or Search views. The navigation bar may show the title Settings as well as a Done button which dismisses the view and reveals the page beneath. The email line displays the email address where redemption codes will be sent. The user s email address may be automatically pulled from its social network account. The Like button may open a social network fan page of the app provider.

In particular embodiments a user may be presented with a profile page where they are asked to enter certain personalized information which for example may form all or part of the user registration data . This information may include one or more of the user s email address social media usernames age gender and zip code. Upon completion the user s selection of a save done or equivalent icon may direct the user to a page which allows them paid or free access to an upgraded version.

Referring to for illustration in certain embodiments users may land back on the landing page when they return to the app from song redemption via email or the music distributor s own app. The page may be powered by the operating system s default web browser and may be embedded within the app. In other embodiments users may land on the landing page post redemption or as digital contents are being downloaded for additional impressions and engagement period.

Referring to the content of the redemption email may be fully customizable to the advertiser but may preferably include a download button or link with the music distributor s redemption code for their song . The redemption button in the email may be hyperlinked to a specific redemption code of the partnering music distributor. Touching the button may exit the mail app and launch for example the iTunes app and direct users to either the sign in page for users not logged in or to the redeem page for those already logged in .

A player page may show the redeemed song being played in the default music app. Amazon for example currently supports a browser accessible cloud player after song redemption via Amazon mp3. In certain embodiments this type of capability may be embedded within the app of the present invention. It is envisioned that particular embodiments will stay up to date on the streaming options from the partnering music distributors and with therefore be ready for integration when those options become available.

Advertisers with a web presence may be provided with a login and platform enabling them to input their campaign data. Such campaign data may include for example their logo via upload or web link ad landing page URL ad media item URL thank you pop up message and ad message graphic for inclusion with the redemption emails. One or more algorithms may be provided which allow advertisers to target users and bid on access to such users by virtue of target parameters such as demographics location and keywords.

Certain embodiments may allow advertisers to customize their campaigns by way of for example a self serve platform or alternative medium such as a live representative or a simple fillable form. By way of non limiting example the advertiser may provide for each campaigned one or more of the following a an advertisement video file or a URL for the video b a landing page URL c a logo d one or more links to the advertiser s social profile s e an email in html or custom text email message and I a campaign budget.

Moreover in particular embodiments advertisers may be presented with multiple targeting options including one or more of the following location in profile real time location gender age interests e.g. as defined by Facebook Likes or user generated contents as tweets and posts social word cloud e.g. as detailed below and the like.

In particular preferred embodiments once the campaign begins running advertisers may have the ability to pause and start the campaign make changes to their campaign including budget and have access to the most up to date analytics.

In preferred embodiments analytics available to the advertiser may include detailed analysis of user engagements at each engagement point using a variety of metrics such as CPM CPE CTR and CPC. Alternatively or in addition certain systems and methods herein may provide advertisers with analytics of the engaged users demographics such as the percentage of males females or the number of engaged users at respective geographic locations. Further in the alternative or in addition embodiments of systems and methods herein may allow advertisers to access the engaged users data such as the users email address or Facebook profile.

The systems and methods described herein are adaptable to integrate with e.g. comprise or be comprised by a variety of platforms e.g. hosting platforms currently operated by third parties. Adaptations may take various forms depending on the nature of the hosting platform. For example the distribution components and processes may be different if the hosting platform is capable of dynamically generating content redemption codes in real time thus rendering a server or database to store redemption codes potentially unnecessary. Non limiting examples of various types of hosting platforms and how they may be integrated with or operate as part of the systems and methods discussed herein are listed below.

A music discovery platform such as Pandora Spotify Shazam Myspace and the like may integrate with the systems and methods disclosed herein thereby making such systems and methods part of its current user flow by for example offering its users an option to redeem songs of interest. A respective user option may take the form of for example a gesture controlled button or drop down option. Upon indication of user interests in redemption the hosting platform would serve engagements provided by embodiments of the present invention including for example video page landing page social engagement page redemption page followed by the distribution of songs to its users.

In addition to engagement side integration the music discovery platform may also facilitate the distribution internally. For example if the platform has sufficient resources to host a virtual music store it may distribute songs to its users via. direct links rather than relying on a third party content distributor

Digital music retailers like iTunes Google Play Amazon MP3 etc. may integrate systems or methods described herein into their virtual stores by offering their users an alternative option to redeem rather than to purchase their contents. Upon redemption confirmation these retailers may serve engagements by way of one or more systems and methods described herein followed by the distribution of the user selected content via their normal distribution processes.

Advertising entities such as Apple iAds Kiip Millenial Media may integrate with certain systems and methods in accordance with the present invention by incorporating some or all of their own engagement elements such as banner ads app installs and the like to bring their users content of higher value or to increase their revenue generated by user engagements.

Certain embodiments may enable users to be rewarded with direct links to download contents from a third party distributor upon completion of the prescribed ad impression period. These links may be stored in or generated on demand by the distributor s server database. A server provided by an operator of a system described herein may distribute the stored direct links to users through its own servers. Alternatively it may also make calls to the distributor s server to generate link then distribute to its users. These direct links may be distributed to users via email as well as embedded into a button on the redemption page to be opened by the in app or external web browser. Users may be prompted to authenticate their identity by the direct link landing page and these direct links may be re accessed at later times across different devices by the same user.

Certain systems and methods in accordance with the present invention may aggregate user demographics data including but not limited to age gender locations interests posts Likes Facebook Follows Twitter and the like through APIs from connected social networks and graphically organize common and connected data into Social Word Clouds. 

Each unique demographics data point may preferably have its own cloud and the Social Word Cloud sizes may vary depending on the number of users with matching demo data. The Word Cloud may be presented as part of the analytics delivered to advertisers to provide recommendations for improving their targeting practices and marketing efficiencies. The Word Cloud may also be presented as a targeting tool for advertisers to graphically select the demographics they wish to target in their campaigns.

In accordance with particular embodiments users may presented with an Ad Choice Screen after selecting a song for redemption. This screen may contain for example a list of advertisers whose targeted demographics matches that of the user. Referring to for non limiting illustration the matching advertisers may be presented to users in for example a scrollable list of horizontal rows or in square shaped blocks. Matching advertisers may preferably be displayed in order of the relevance of their ad as determined for example by the overall number of times the advertisers campaigns have been selected in the past. The system may load the selected advertiser s campaign and proceed to serve the respective video landing page engagement page and email as discussed herein.
