No. 11 031 667 filed on Jan. 6 2005 entitled Computing System and Method to Implicitly Commit Unsaved Data for a World Wide Web now U.S. Pat. No. 7 953 760 which issued on May 31 2011 which is a continuation of and is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 969 857 filed on Sep. 29 2001 entitled Computing System and Method to Implicitly Commit Unsaved Data for a World Wide Web . Both are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety and for all purposes.

The present invention relates to the World Wide Web Web . Specifically the present invention relates to implicitly committing to a database an unsaved record for a Web application responsive to a context change.

As technology continues to advance and the business environments have become increasingly complex and diverse more and more companies have relied on various customer relationship management CRM software and eBusiness applications to conduct and manage various aspects of their enterprise business. In general eBusiness applications are designed to enable a company or enterprise to conduct its business over an interactive network e.g. Internet Intranet Extranet etc. with its customers partners suppliers distributors employees etc. eBusiness applications may include core business processes supply chain back office operations and CRM functions. CRM generally includes various aspects of interaction a company has with its customers relating to sales and or services. At a high level customer relationship management is focused on understanding the customer s needs and leveraging this knowledge to increase sales and improve service. CRM application and software is generally designed to provide effective and efficient interactions between sales and service and unify a company s activities around the customer in order to increase customer share and customer retention through customer satisfaction.

Knowledge Management one of the important factors of an effective CRM implementation is the acquisition of information about a customer its analysis sharing and tracking. Also integral to the use of knowledge for competitive advantage is for employees to know what actions to take as a result of this knowledge.

Database Consolidation another important aspect of an effective and efficient CRM solution is the consolidation of customer information in a single database and the re engineering of business processes around the customer. The goal here is to have all interactions with a customer recorded in one place to drive production marketing sales and customer support activities.

Integration of Channels and Systems it is very important for a CRM application software to provide the capability to respond to customers in a consistent and high quality manner through their channel of choice whether that is the e mail the phone web based user interfaces etc. This may require the seamless integration of various communication channels with the customer or enterprise database. It also may require the integration of CRM with other parts of a company s business systems and applications.

Technology and Infrastructure to enhance customer services a CRM application software may include various tools to automate and streamline online customer service. For example a self help model typically can be implemented using a combination of tools e.g. knowledge bases with an intuitive search capability agent technology or automated email etc. .

Generally eBusiness applications are designed to allow organizations to create a single source of customer information that makes it easier to sell to market to and service customers across multiple channels including the Web call centers field resellers retail and dealer networks. Advanced eBusiness applications are typically built on a component based architecture and are designed to be Web based and to deliver support for various types of clients on multiple computing platforms including mobile clients connected clients thin clients and handheld clients etc.

With the recent proliferation of the Web it is desirable to provide the functionalities of the eBusiness applications in a Web based environment. Furthermore it is desirable for the eBusiness applications operating in a Web based environment to retain the look and feel of desktop based eBusiness applications with which the users are already familiar.

World Wide Web documents often include forms with user interactive data fields through which a user can enter information. The information typically includes alpha numeric characters. To save an entry into the server database the user typically presses a button labeled either save or submit. It can be time consuming tiresome and annoying for the user to press the save or submit button every time the user wishes to save an entry. Also if the user logs off or changes the Web browser view to another Web page before saving the information the information may be lost.

In one embodiment the invention is a computing system comprising a World Wide Web application with a user interactive record field is described. The record field receives a record field entry. The application receives a context change request. Responsive to the context change request the application dynamically transmits the record field entry to a server for storage in a database.

A computing system and a method are described in which unsaved data for a World Wide Web application a Web application are implicitly committed to a server responsive to a context change. The user does not have to for example press the save button.

In this description the terms transmit and post are used interchangeably. Also the terms save and commit are used interchangeably. Also the terms unsaved data changes and updates are used interchangeably.

The framework or infrastructure can support the interactive web client shown in and the mobile web client also shown in and is capable of meeting certain criteria such as increasing the interactivity and performance of the web client and the mobile web client and reducing the number of page refreshes for common actions.

The framework or infrastructure can include objects that can be dynamically created on the browser to mimic corresponding objects managed by the object manager. In one embodiment the objects managed by the object manager OM can be built using a programming language such as C supporting the object oriented paradigm.

As shown in exemplary objects managed by the OM can include an object representing a view CSSWEView . A view is generally a display panel consisting of a particular arrangement of applets. In one embodiment one active view can be displayed at any given time. Another exemplary object managed by the OM can be an object representing an applet CSSWEApplet . An applet is generally a visual application unit that appears on the screen as part of a view. Other exemplary objects managed by the OM can include an object representing a business component CSSBusComp an object representing a business object CSSBusObj and an object representing a frame CSSWEFrame . In one embodiment the business object may be designed as configurable software representations of the various business rules or concepts such as accounts contacts opportunities service requests solutions etc. In this embodiment the business components typically provide a layer of wrapping over tables and the applets reference business components rather than the underlying tables. In addition a frame is generally a sub component of a view and may comprise of one or more applets.

In one embodiment objects on the browser can be built using JavaScript. As shown in exemplary objects on the browser side may include JSSBusObj JSSBusComp JSSView and JSSApplet to respectively mirror CSSBusObj CSSBusComp CSSWEView and CSSWEApplet which are objects managed by the OM.

The server is coupled to the repository . The client objects include the proxy objects of the server objects. For example the application is a proxy of the frame manager the display is a proxy of the display the active applet is a proxy of the active applet the applet is a proxy of the applet and the business components and are proxies of the business components and respectively. The display is coupled to the business object . The business object is a proxy of the business object .

The communication requests between the client and the RPC module are processed through the application . The communication requests can include a context change request. In one embodiment of the present invention the context change request can include a user request for a new web page. In another embodiment of the present invention the context change request can include the user request to tab out of the active applet . In yet another embodiment of the present invention the context change request can include a context change request generated by the client .

The application can automatically transmit an unsaved datum request to the active applet responsive to receiving a context change request. The unsaved datum request inquires whether the active applet includes an unsaved datum. The active applet can automatically transmit a cache request to the business component responsive to receiving the unsaved datum request. The business component automatically determines if the cache includes any unsaved user entries responsive to receiving the cache request. The business component transmits a cache notification request to the active applet . The cache notification request either includes the unsaved data or a notification that the cache includes no unsaved data.

The active applet can trigger a post request responsive to receiving the cache notification request. The post request can include the unsaved data from the cache . The active applet can also transmit a no unsaved data request to the application . The no unsaved data request can indicate that the cache includes no unsaved data. The business component can clear the cache after transmitting the cache notification request.

The application can automatically transmit the context change request to the server through the RPC module responsive to receiving either the post request or the no unsaved data request. The application can forward the post request to the server through the RPC module .

The server can automatically process the post request responsive to receiving the post request. The server can process the post request by determining if it wants to commit the unsaved data to a database. The server can transmit a server notification to the client . The server notification can include either a success message indicating that the unsaved data was successfully saved in the database or an error message indicating that the unsaved data cannot be saved in the database.

The application can display the error message on the display responsive to receiving the error message from the server through the RPC module . The application can hold off the transmission of the context change request to the server responsive to receiving the error message from the server . Also the application can automatically transmit the context change request to the server through the RPC module responsive to receiving the success message from the server through the RPC module .

The server can automatically process the context change request responsive to receiving the context change request. The server can process the context change request by transmitting the requested new context to the client through the RPC module . The requested context can include an applet or a web page. The application can receive the new context through the RPC module . The web page received from the server can replace the web page displayed through the display . The applet received from the server can replace the applet as the active applet.

Objects on the browser and objects managed by the OM can be configured to reside and operate on one computing device or multiple computing devices. illustrates an exemplary configuration in which objects on the browser and objects managed by the OM reside and operate on multiple computing devices including a client and a server . illustrates an exemplary configuration in which objects on the browser and objects managed by the OM reside and operate on one computing device .

Returning to objects on the browser are generally synchronized with corresponding or mirrored objects managed by the OM. Synchronization can be accomplished through a remote procedure call RPC mechanism and a notification mechanism . The RPC mechanism and the notification mechanism will be described below in more details.

Of the objects on the browser the JSSApplication object typically exists throughout a user session. The JSSApplication object should be initially loaded when the user starts an application. An application would generally be started when the user invokes a subset of the application from an icon on the desktop or from the Start menu. The JSSApplication object generally performs a role similar to that of the CSSModel object . The CSSModel object is generally a global session object that provides access to repository objects that are in use the current business object instance in memory the relationships between the current business object and the business components contained in it and the user s global state information. The CSSModel object generally accesses a repository to obtain needed information. The repository is generally a set of object definitions used to define an application or a suite of applications. However the JSSApplication object is generally scaled down to track one view applets associated to the tracked view one business object and the business components that are in use in the view.

Unlike the JSSApplication object the JSSView object the JSSApplet object the JSSBusObj object and the JSSBusComp object are typically temporary or impermanent entities and are generally replaced when a page refresh occurs. For example a request to navigate to a new view may cause a new set of JSSView JSSApplet JSSBusObj and JSSBusComp objects to be created to run on the browser.

Accordingly objects on the browser can be generally described as lightweight representations of mirrored or corresponding objects managed by the OM. Each object on the browser would typically include a subset of the functionalities included in corresponding objects managed by the OM. For example the JSSView object similar to a CSSView object generally represents a collection of applets. The JSSBusObj object similar to a CSSBusObj object generally manages the various one to many relationships between active business components so that correct relationships are employed when these active business components are populated via queries. The JSSBusObj object generally exists on the browser for the life of the current view and should be kept in sync with the corresponding CSSBusObj object .

In one embodiment when the browser submits a request to navigate to a new view to the web engine the web engine would send a response containing the view layout that is devoid of data. Then the web engine would send a response containing a string of data to populate the view.

The JSSApplication object generally manages communications flowing into and out from objects on the browser. In one embodiment a method invoked on an object on the browser would typically be directed to the JSSApplication object if the invoked method should be retargeted to an object managed by the OM. The JSSApplication object would generally use the RPC mechanism to route the invoked method through the web engine to the appropriate object managed by the OM. The web engine would typically be employed to send return notifications and data from objects managed by the OM to objects on the browser. The web engine would generally use the notification mechanism to route notifications and data through the JSSApplication object to objects on the browser.

The browser objects generally use the remote procedure calls to invoke methods on the objects managed by the OM. These remote procedure calls are generally packaged as HTTP requests. Responses from the objects managed by the OM are packaged as HTTP responses containing notifications and associated status information and data. In one embodiment remote procedure calls are made with blocking enabled to ensure synchronization between the objects on the browser and the objects managed by the OM. With blocking enabled control would typically not be passed back to the calling code until the called remote procedure finishes executing.

The RPC model generally uses the same procedural abstraction as a conventional program but allows a procedure call to span the boundary between two computers. illustrates an example of how the RPC paradigm can be used to divide a program into pieces that can be executed on separate computing devices . This Figure generally shows a distributed program having multiple procedures. Main proc  proc  proc  proc  proc  and proc  reside and operate in the first computing device or the client and proc  and proc  reside and operate in the second computing device or the server . A solid line from procedure n to procedure m denotes a call from n to m. A dashed line shows how control passes from one computing device to another computing device during a remote procedure call.

As such a remote procedure call generally executes a procedure located in a separate address space from the calling code. The RPC model is generally derived from the programming model of local procedure calls and takes advantage of the fact that every procedure contains a procedure declaration. The procedure declaration defines the interface between the calling code and the called procedure. The procedure declaration defines the call syntax and parameters of the procedure. Calls to a procedure should typically conform to the procedure declaration.

Applications that use remote procedure calls look and behave much like local applications. However an RPC application is divided into two parts a server which offers one or more sets of remote procedures and a client which makes remote procedure calls to RPC servers. A server and its client s generally reside on separate systems and communicate over a network. RPC applications depend on the RPC runtime library to control network communications for them. The RPC runtime library generally supports additional tasks such as finding servers for clients and managing servers.

A distributed application generally uses dispersed computing resources such as central processing units CPU databases devices and services. The following applications are illustrative examples of distributed applications 

A calendar management application that allows authorized users to access the personal calendars of other users 

A manufacturing application that shares information about assembly components among design inventory scheduling and accounting programs located on different computers. RPC software should generally meets the basic requirements of a distributed application including 

Distributed applications include tasks such as managing communications finding servers providing security and so forth. A standalone distributed application needs to perform all of these tasks itself. Without a convenient mechanism for these distributed computing tasks writing distributed applications is difficult expensive and error prone.

RPC software typically provides the code called RPC stubs and the RPC runtime library that performs distributed computing tasks for applications. The RPC stubs and the RPC runtime library should be linked with client and server application code to form an RPC application.

Table 1 generally shows the basic tasks for the client and server of a distributed application. Calling the procedure and executing the remote procedure shown in italicized text are performed by the application code just as in a local application but here they are in the client and server address spaces. As for the other tasks some are performed automatically by the stubs and RPC runtime library while others are performed by the RPC runtime library via API calls in the application code.

The RPC client or the RPC server typically contains RPC application code segments and RPC interfaces and stubs and and the RPC runtime libraries and . The RPC application code segments are generally the code written for a specific RPC application by the application developer. The RPC application code segments generally implement and call remote procedures and also calls needed routines or procedures in the RPC runtime library. An RPC stub is generally an interface specific code module that uses an RPC interface to pass and receive arguments. A client and a server typically contain complementary RPC stubs for each shared RPC interface . The RPC runtime library generally manages communications for RPC applications. In addition the RPC runtime library should support an Application Programming Interface API used by RPC application code to enable RPC applications to set up their communications manipulate information about servers and perform optional tasks such as remotely managing servers and accessing security information.

RPC application code segments usually differ for clients and servers. RPC application code on the server typically contains the remote procedures that implement one RPC interface. RPC application code on the corresponding client typically contains calls to those remote procedures.

RPC stubs generally perform basic support functions for remote procedure calls. For instance RPC stubs prepare input and output arguments for transmission between systems with different forms of data representation. RPC stubs use the RPC runtime library to handle the transmission between the client and server . RPC stubs on the client can also use the local RPC runtime library to find appropriate servers for the client .

Marshalling generally converts input or call arguments into a byte stream format and packages them for transmission. Upon receiving call arguments a server RPC stub unmarshalls them. Unmarshalling is generally the process by which a stub disassembles incoming network data and converts it into application data using a format that the local system understands. Marshalling and unmarshalling both occur twice for each remote procedure call. The client RPC stub marshalls input arguments and unmarshalls output arguments . The server RPC stub unmarshalls input arguments and marshalls output arguments . Marshalling and unmarshalling permit client and server systems to use different data representations for equivalent data. For example the client system can use ASCII data and the server system can use Unicode data as shown in .

The IDL compiler a tool for application development generates stubs by compiling an RPC interface definition written by application developers. The compiler generates marshalling and unmarshalling routines for platform independent IDL data types. To build the client for an RPC application a developer links client application code with the client stubs of all the RPC interfaces the application uses. To build the server the developer links the server application code with the corresponding server stubs.

In addition to one or more RPC stubs each RPC server and RPC client should be linked with a copy of the RPC runtime library. The RPC runtime library generally provides runtime operations such as controlling communications between clients and servers and finding servers for clients on request. RPC stubs in the client and the server typically exchange arguments through the RPC runtime library that is respectively local to the client and the server. The RPC runtime library on the client typically transmits remote procedure calls to the server. The RPC runtime library on the server generally receives the remote procedure calls from the client and dispatches each call to the appropriate RPC stub on the server. The RPC runtime library then sends the results of each call to the RPC runtime library on the client.

RPC application code on the server must also contain server initialization code that calls routines in the RPC runtime library on the server when the server is starting up and shutting down. RPC application code on the client can also call RPC runtime library routines for initialization purposes. Furthermore RPC application code on the server and RPC application code on the client can also contain calls to RPC stub support routines. RPC stub support routines generally allow applications to manage programming tasks such as allocating and freeing memory.

In one embodiment remote procedure calls are made with blocking enabled to ensure synchronization between the objects on the browser and the objects managed by the OM shown in . With blocking enabled control would typically not be passed back to the calling code until the called remote procedure finishes executing.

Designing the application deciding what procedures are needed and which of the needed procedures will be remote procedures and deciding how the remote procedures will be grouped into RPC interfaces block 

Using the Universal Unique Identifier UUID generator to generate a UUID for each of the RPC interfaces block 

Using the Interface Definition Language IDL to describe the RPC interfaces for planned data types and remote procedures block 

Writing or modifying application code using a programming language that is compatible with the RPC stubs so that the application code works with the stubs block 

Linking the local RPC runtime library and the object code generated from the application code to generate executable code block .

Traditionally calling code and called procedures share the same address space. In an RPC application the calling code and the called remote procedures are not linked rather they communicate indirectly through an RPC interface. An RPC interface is generally a logical grouping of operations data types and constants that serves as a contract for a set of remote procedures. RPC interfaces are typically compiled from formal interface definitions written by application developers using the Interface Definition Language IDL .

In developing a distributed application an interface definition should be defined in IDL. The IDL compiler generally uses the interface definition to generate a header file a client stub file and a server stub file. The IDL compiler can produce header files in a standard programming language and stubs as source files or as object file. For some applications an Attribute Configuration File ACF accompanying the interface definition may be defined. If an ACF exists the IDL compiler interprets the ACF when it compiles the interface definition. Information in the ACF is used to modify the code that the compiler generates.

The header of each RPC interface typically contains a Universal Unique Identifier UUID which is a hexadecimal number that uniquely identifies an entity. A UUID that identifies an RPC interface is generally known as an interface UUID. The interface UUID ensures that the interface can be uniquely identified across all possible network configurations. In addition to an interface UUID each RPC interface contains major and minor version numbers. Together the interface UUID and version numbers form an interface identifier that identifies an instance of an RPC interface across systems and through time.

Returning to objects on the browser are generally synchronized with corresponding or mirrored objects managed by the OM so that changes can be reflected. Synchronization can be accomplished through a remote procedure call RPC mechanism and a notification mechanism .

The notification mechanism generally provides the means by which data in an object on the browser e.g. JSSBusComp can be updated when data or status is changed in a corresponding object managed by the OM e.g. CSSBusComp . In one embodiment the CSSSWEView object would collect one or more notifications and send them to the objects on the browser at the end of a view show cycle.

In one embodiment the following exemplary or illustrative notifications can be transmitted. It should be noted that some of the notifications listed below require parameters. In other cases the framework can understand the context for these notifications by simply knowing its current state.

NotifyStateChanged Indicates that there has been a change of state. An exemplary scenario in which a change of state may occur is when the system goes into a query state where the user can enter query conditions execute a query and then goes into a commit pending state where the user can update the data values .

NotifyBeginQuery Indicates that the business component is in a state ready to accept query conditions.

NotifyExecute Indicates that the business component has been executed i.e. has executed a query on the database and repopulated itself with fresh data . This notification can include an optional parameter to provide query specifications.

NotifyDeleteWorkSet Indicates that a record has been removed from the working set. This notification can include a parameter that provides the index of the working set row that needs to be removed.

NotifylnsertWorkSet Indicates that a record has been added to the current working set. This notification can include parameters to provide the index of the new record in the working set.

NotifylnsertWSFieldVals Indicates that certain value s need to be added to a field in the working set.

NotifyNewFieldData Indicates that a particular field has new data. This notification includes parameter that provides the name of the field.

NotifyNewRecordDataWS Indicates that a newly created record has new data that to be populated into the working set.

NotifyPageRefresh Indicates that the UI needs to be refreshed. This notification is typically used when a generally substantial change in the UI is required rather than just updating data. This notification can cause a server trip to fetch a new page and display it in the browser.

NotifyScrollData Indicates that the records need to be scrolled up or down. Certain User Interface objects such as list applets can use this notification to scroll up and down to show different rows.

NotifyChangeSelection Indicates that there has been a change in record selection i.e. the current row has either been selected or deselected .

NotifySelModeChange Indicates a change in the selection mode. In one embodiment there can be two modes of selection including i selection of one record at a time and ii selection of multiple records simultaneously e.g. deleting multiple records with one command .

NotifyTotalsChanged Indicates that total values need to be changed. In some cases when multiple records are displayed some fields may also display the summation of values in all the records. This notification indicates that total value has changed.

NotifyLongOpProgress Indicates that a long i.e. time consuming action is in progress. This notification is used by the User Interface to provide feedback to the user such as showing a progress or status bar showing how much of the task is currently complete.

NotifyGeneric This is a generic notification used to notify the User Interface object of some special conditions that are not covered by set of notifications listed and described above. Each type of generic notification can include a parameter providing a name for the generic notification so that one type of generic notification can be distinguished from another type of generic specification. Each type of generic notification can include its unique parameters.

As stated above objects on the browser and objects managed by the OM can be configured to reside and operate on one or multiple computing devices. As shown above illustrates an exemplary configuration in which objects on the browser and objects managed by the OM reside and operate on multiple computing devices and including a client and a server . illustrates an exemplary configuration in which objects on the browser and objects managed by the OM reside and operate on one computing device .

Continue This value generally indicate that the server side applet CSSWEApplet has performed its share of handling the invoke method or has no role to perform and that the JSSApplet on the browser needs to complete the action. Notifications are provided in the response but are often empty.

Completed This value generally indicates that the server side applet has completed the handling of the invoke method and that the browser needs to perform no further action other than to respond to notifications provided in the response.

NewPage This value generally indicates that the response to the invoke request or other command requires a page refresh on the browser including re a generation all the temporary browser side objects. A URL is sent to the browser so that the new page can be obtained. However there will no notifications. This value is typically set in cases such as when a drilldown to a different view is requested.

Error This value generally indicates that the invoke method request failed. Upon receiving an Error status the JSSApplet would typically display an error page.

When a browser side applet JSSApplet calls the server through the RPC the browser side applet typically looks at the status flag in the response and then handles it block . If the returned status is Error the browser side applet would show an error page. If the returned status is Completed the server is generally indicating that it had already handled the invoke method and that there s nothing left for the browser to do. If the returned status is Continue the server is generally indicating that it is not handling the invoke method. The browser side applet would generally respond to a returned status of Continue by redirecting the method to a JSSBusComp object by invoking the method directly on a JSSBusComp object. The JSSBusComp object may be able to satisfy the invoke method request or may have to send its own RPC call through the JSSApplication to its corresponding server side business component.

Completed This value generally indicates the server side business component CSSBusComp had generally processed the invoke method successfully. Notifications will typically occur.

Error This value generally indicates that the server side business component CSSBusComp had unsuccessfully processed the invoke method call. Upon receiving a returned status of Error the browser would typically display an error page.

In block the client side business component JSSBusComp examines the returned status flag and responds appropriately. It should be noted that the server will be contacted if an invoke method call performs actions that would require synchronization between the browser and server business components. It should be further noted that there could be circumstances where the JSSBusComp object may be able to handle the request locally without needing to contact the server. An example of such circumstances is when the user performs a next record operation and then a previous record operation without changing any data.

In one embodiment various user interface items or controls such as toolbars menus keyboard controls also called keyboard shortcuts or keyboard accelerators herein etc. are used to provide the means for the user to initiate various actions or commands. In one embodiment toolbars may be designed and configured to appear in their own frame near the top of the application in the browser window and the application menus e.g. File View and Help etc. may be designed and configured to appear beneath the primary tab e.g. 1st level navigation bar. In one embodiment the applet level menus can be invoked from the applet menu button in the control banner at the top of an applet. and illustrate examples of toolbars application level menus and applet level menus respectively. In one embodiment each user interface item or object in a toolbar application level menu applet level menu or a particular keyboard shortcut or keyboard accelerator e.g. CRTL N can be configured to be associated or mapped to a particular command to be executed in response to the user s selection or activation of the respective user interface item e.g. clicking on a menu item pressing a keyboard combination such as CTRL N etc. . In one embodiment each command can be defined and configured to invoke one or more particular methods to perform one or more particular functions or actions requested by the user. In one embodiment a data structure referred to herein as a command object can be defined and configured to represent a particular command the execution of which may result in the invocation of one or more particular methods associated with the respective command object. Command objects are described in more details below.

In one embodiment a selection or activation of a toolbar icon or menu item e.g. user s clicking on a toolbar icon or menu item etc. is normally translated into a call to an invoke method which may reside in a service on the browser or server or in classes in the browser application or server infrastructure e.g. applet or business component classes SWE frame manager or model etc. . In one embodiment a user interface item such as a toolbar icon a menu item or a keyboard shortcut may be configured to target a method name a method handler from which it may be automatically re targeted if not found and optionally a service.

In one embodiment application level items which may include both toolbar icons application level menus and keyboard shortcuts etc. can be implemented through the use of command object definitions in Tools which are then mapped to Toolbar Item or Menu Item object definitions. In one embodiment applet level menus do not utilize command object definitions but the set of properties used for targeting and invoking the corresponding method are similar to those found in the command object type.

In one embodiment in the web engine templates the toolbar tag can be used to specify a named toolbar where the name corresponds to the Name property in the Toolbar object definition in the repository and the toolbaritem tag between the toolbar start and end tags recursively retrieves all of the toolbar items for that toolbar from the repository.

In one embodiment a design time menu activation suppression feature is provided for applet level menus. This feature provides the capability to make a menu item available globally for applets of a given class and its subclasses and then suppress it in particular applets where it is not desired. In one embodiment the design time menu activation suppression feature can be implemented using the Class Method Menu Item object type which can be used to implement the menu item in the applet level menu of all applets of the specified applet class except where suppressed as defined by the Suppress Menu Item property. Applet method menu item class method menu item and the suppression of menu item are described in greater details below.

Creating one or more keyboard accelerator objects also called keyboard shortcuts shortcut keys herein at block 

In one embodiment a command object definition is created and configured to specify which invoke method is called when a toolbar icon or application level menu item associated with the command is executed. Furthermore a command object definition may be used to specify which bitmap appears on the toolbar icon for toolbar items. In one embodiment command object definitions are referenced by Toolbar Item or Menu Item object definitions. As illustrated in a Command object definition generally has the following properties 

Target property generally specifies which entity handles the invoke method the command calls. In one embodiment available options are the following 

Business Service property generally specifies the service either on the browser or server depending on the Target property that handles the invoke method. In one embodiment if the property is left blank the browser or server infrastructure is targeted rather than a specific service. In one embodiment if a service is specified it handles CanInvokeMethod and InvokeMethod for the method specified in the Method property.

Method property generally is used to specify the name of the method to invoke when a user interface item e.g. the menu item toolbar icon etc. is selected. In one embodiment this property is a required property.

Method Argument property generally is used to provide a mechanism to pass an argument to the invoke method specified in the Method property. For example a command item that opens a new window and navigates to a URL in that window can specify the GotoURL method in Method property and the URL to navigate to in the Method Argument property.

Show Popup property . In one embodiment this property is set to TRUE to specify that a new browser window is opened before invoking the method. It is set to FALSE to specify that the method is invoked in the current browser window.

HTML Popup Dimensions property . In one embodiment this property is used to specify the dimensions in pixels of the popup window when Show Popup property is TRUE. An example is 640 480 specified with the x and without blank spaces .

Tooltip Text property . In one embodiment this property is used to specify the tooltip text which appears when the cursor lingers on a toolbar icon. In one embodiment for built in methods the tooltip text should be left blank which indicates that the method will dynamically supply the text and language localization takes place as a part of this process. For developer defined methods literal text can be entered for this property. In one embodiment when the literal text is entered for this property it turns off language localization for this tooltip text.

In one embodiment for each toolbar in the application a Toolbar object definition can be created in the Object List Editor. This provides a named toolbar that the user can activate or deactivate in various applications and to which toolbar icons e.g. Toolbar Item object definitions can be associated or removed. Toolbar functionality for applications can be implemented using HTML toolbars. In one embodiment in an HTML toolbar the buttons are static images which may be dimmed to indicate unavailability but otherwise are not manipulated by program logic on the browser. In contrast CTI computer telephony integration applications may require toolbar icons that can be altered in response to events such as blinking a particular toolbar icon when a call is incoming. In one embodiment this may require the use of Java toolbars. In one embodiment to specify that a toolbar is of the Java type a class name is entered in the Class property. As shown in a toolbar object may include the following properties 

Class property . In one embodiment this property is left blank for an HTML toolbar and specified for a Java toolbar e.g. the name of the Java class that implements the toolbar is entered .

Name property . In one embodiment this property is referenced by other object definitions and by the toolbar tag in the name clause.

Display Name property . In one embodiment this property is used for the History button and to show or hide toolbars by name.

Popup Indicator Bitmap property . In one embodiment this property is used to specify a sideways toolbar popup.

In one embodiment a Toolbar Item object is defined and configured to associate a Command object definition which is identified by name as a property in the Command property of the toolbar item object with a Toolbar object definition which is the parent of the Toolbar Item object . In one embodiment this association places a toolbar icon whose bitmap image invoke method and target are specified in the Command object definition on the specified toolbar in a given location e.g. a position relative to the other toolbar icons on that toolbar . In one embodiment as illustrated in a toolbar item object may be defined to include the following properties 

Command property . In one embodiment this property specifies the name of the Command object definition that is to provide the bitmap method and target for the respective toolbar item. In one embodiment one or more hyphens can be specified instead of the name of a Command object to tell the system to insert a separator there between icons.

HTML Type 2520. In one embodiment this property is used to identify the type of control to be displayed in the corresponding toolbar in the browser. In one embodiment various options may include ComboBox Button Edit Label Hyperlink MiniButton and Timer etc.

Name property . In one embodiment this property specifies the name of the Toolbar Item. In one embodiment the name property needs to be unique within the scope of a toolbar.

Sequence property . In one embodiment this property specifies an integer that orders the toolbar item in the parent toolbar from left to right. For example a higher sequence number relative to other toolbar items places this icon further to the right than the others.

Position property . In one embodiment this property is used for sideways toolbars. For example a value of 0.1 0.2 etc. can be used.

In one embodiment a menu object can be defined and configured for each application level menu. In one embodiment a menu object is considered a parent of corresponding menu item objects. A menu item object is used to define an application main menu or menu item within the parent menu object definition.

Command property . In one embodiment this property specifies the name of the corresponding Command object definition that is used to provide the method and target for the respective menu item.

Caption property . In one embodiment this property specifies the text that is displayed in the menu or menu item.

Position property . In one embodiment this property specifies the position of the menu or menu item in the menu tree. For example the top level positions for menus rather than items within them can be single integers such as 1 2 and 3 or 10 20 and 30 . Position values for menu items e.g. 2nd level and below in the menu tree can be specified using a dot notation where the value to the right of the rightmost dot specifies the order of the item on its level and the value or values to the left of that dot specify the parent menu or menu item. For example 3.1 can be defined as the first item in the submenu of the third item of the top level menu. It should be noted that values on a level are not required to be consecutive for example the values and may be used to indicate four menu items on the same level and their sequence determines their order of display in the menu.

In one embodiment an applet method menu item object is used to define a menu item in the applet level menu for the parent Applet object definition. In one embodiment unlike application level menus applet menus are not based on Command objects. However the set of properties used for targeting the method are similar to those found in the command object type. shows a flow diagram of one embodiment of a process for creating an applet method menu item object in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. Creating an applet method menu item object can generally include defining an applet method menu item object at block and specifying the properties for the defined applet method menu item object at block .

Menu Text property. In one embodiment this property is used to specify the text displayed in the menu item.

Target property. In one embodiment this property is used to specify which entity handles the invoke method specified in the Method property. In one embodiment the following options are available 

Method property. In one embodiment this property is used to specify the method to be invoked when the corresponding menu item is selected.

Business Service property. If specified this property identifies the service on which to invoke the specified method. If unspecified the specified method is invoked on the applet class on the browser or server as specified in the Target property with subsequent retargeting if unhandled.

Suppress Menu Item property. In one embodiment the default for this property is set to FALSE. If this property is set to TRUE it causes the class level menu item of the specified name to be removed from the applet level menu in the applet where this property is specified. Position property. In one embodiment this property is used to specify the sequence of the menu item in the single level list of menu items.

Target property. In one embodiment this property is used to specify which entity handles the invoke method specified in the Method property. In one embodiment the following options are available 

Menu Text property. In one embodiment this property is used to specify the text displayed in the menu item.

Method property. In one embodiment this property is used to specify the method to be invoked when the corresponding menu item is selected.

Business Service property. If specified this property identifies the service on which to invoke the specified method. If unspecified the specified method is invoked on the applet class on the browser or server as specified in the Target property with subsequent retargeting if unhandled.

Suppress Menu Item property. In one embodiment the default for this property is set to FALSE. If this property is set to TRUE it causes the applet level menu items of the specified name to be removed from the applet level menu in all applets derived from this class and its subclasses.

Position property. In one embodiment this property is used to specify the sequence of the menu item in the single level list of menu items.

In one embodiment of the present invention menu items e.g. both application level and applet level and toolbar items can be enabled or disabled at runtime by using the CanInvokeMethod mechanism. In one embodiment CanInvokeMethod for the method specified in the Command Applet Method Menu Item or Class Method Menu Item object etc. will be called automatically for each item prior to displaying the menu or toolbar. If CanInvokeMethod returns FALSE the toolbar item or menu item disabled e.g. is not displayed . The CanInvokeMethod logic generally is retargeted from the browser application to the applet class hierarchy on the server and from there to the business component class hierarchy. The targeting sequence is described in more details below.

As described herein in one embodiment suppression and activation of individual applet level menu items at design time is supported by using the Suppress Menu Item property in the Class Method Menu Item and Applet Method Menu Item object types. In one embodiment this mechanism or feature is applicable to applet level menus not application level menus or toolbars in which the item is added or removed explicitly. Design time menu activation suppression for applet level menus provides the mechanism to make a menu item available globally for applets of a given class and its subclasses and then suppress it in particular applets where it is not desired. For example various applet level menu items appear in virtually all applets such as Copy Edit and Delete etc. others appear in virtually all list applets such as Columns Displayed and so on but there can be some cases in which a standard menu item for the applet s class needs to be suppressed for a specific applet.

In one embodiment to add applet class level menu items a Class Method Menu Item is added for a standard menu item for a given applet class. In one embodiment this menu item would not need to be re included as Applet Method Menu Item object definitions in applets in which the menu item is to appear. In one embodiment Applet Method Menu Item object definitions are created in two circumstances to add a menu item not already provided by the applet s class to the applet or to suppress display of an applet class level item that the applet would normally inherit. In the latter case an Applet Method Menu Item object definition is created with the same name as the applet class level menu item which is to be suppressed and a value of FALSE is entered for the Suppress Menu Item property.

According to one embodiment of the present invention as described herein the Method Business Service and Target properties are included in the Command object type for use in toolbars and application level menus and in the Class Method Menu Item and Applet Method Menu Item object types for use in applet level menus . In one embodiment two settings or options are available for the Target property with the following behavior 

the method handler for this target can be the JavaScript application a JavaScript applet or a JavaScript service on the browser side. In one embodiment regardless of which entity is the method handler a method name needs to be specified in the Method property. In one embodiment a service is targeted if a service name is specified in the Service property. If a service is not specified in the Service property method handling differs based on whether the calling entity is application level or applet level as follows 

targets to the specified method in the JavaScript applet. If not handled retargets to the specified method in the corresponding JavaScript business component. There is no inheritance or additional retargeting in this case.

this target is for invoking a method on a server e.g. a method in a C class on the server either on a service or on the infrastructure. If a Service property value is not specified the invoke method is targeted to the infrastructure. It will target the infrastructure differently depending on whether the menu or toolbar icon invoking the method is applet level menu only or application level menu or toolbar as follows 

the method handler is initially the applet class to which the applet belongs and is retargeted successively up through the applet class hierarchy to CSSSWEFrame. If still unhandled handling is retargeted to the business component class of the applet s business component and successively upwards through the business component class hierarchy to CSSBusComp.

If a service is specified in the Service property the method handler is the specified service. This targeting is also dependent on whether the calling menu item or toolbar icon is applet level or application level as follows 

the method handler performs a SetBC call to set to the business component of the applet and then calls the specified OM service. There is no retarget in this case.

The following matrix or table illustrates the results of the possible settings of the Target and Business Service properties at the applet and application levels in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention 

Typically the value of a particular field may depend upon the value of another field. The dependency or inter dependency between field values may exist in various ways. For example assuming that a user wishes to enter an address which typically includes various fields the value that the user enters for a particular field e.g. State field may determine the set of valid values that the user can enter in another field e.g. City field . As another example a particular field may become disabled or read only when the value in another field changes. Furthermore there may be cases where the type of user interface control or format used to show a particular field may change based on the value entered in another field. For example the user interface control for a particular field may be configured to change from a text box in which a user can enter any value into a combo box where the user has to choose from a list of existing values.

Conventionally in a client server environment the client waits for the user to finish entering a set of changes post the changes to the server for processing and then shows the user another page with the dependent information between field values. For example in a convention application or system the client waits for the user to finish entering all the address information such as STATE CITY etc. and then posts all the changes to the server. The server will then send a new page to the client for display to the user which may include the relevant dependent information between fields. This conventional method or conventional way of handling and processing dependency or inter dependency between field values is not effective because changes due to the inter dependency between field values are not seen by the user immediately thus making the user interface environment much less interactive. For example after the user has changed the value of a particular field upon which the value and or layout of another field depends the user will not recognize or see the effect of the change until after all the changes have been posted to the server and a new page is displayed.

To solve the problem described above according to one aspect of the present invention a method is provided in which a change in value of a field upon which the values format or functionality of other fields depend will be immediately posted to the server for processing also referred to as the immediate post when change feature or immediate post when change mechanism herein .

According to one embodiment of the present invention the fields upon which the other field s depend are marked for immediate post when change in the repository. This information is therefore available as part of the meta data. In one embodiment the client side framework uses this information to decide when to send changes to field values to the server for processing. The server will then respond using the notification mechanism described above to send back dependent changes as a result of the changes processed by the server. For example upon detecting that the value of a particular field has changed this particular field is marked for immediate post when change the client will immediately submit the value of this particular field and the values of other client side fields that have changed to the server for processing. The server will then respond using the notification mechanism to send back the dependent changes for the client to take appropriate actions based on the dependent changes. For example if the change of value of a first field causes the value and or format of a second field to be changed upon receiving the notifications from the server the client will change the value and or the format of the second field accordingly. In one embodiment the logic to perform the immediate post when change process is implemented as part of the Javascript code running on the client side.

One of the problems experienced in a traditional HTML or web based application is that once a client e.g. the browser sends a request to a server for processing it will time out if the server does not respond within a certain period of time. This time out condition occurs in spite of the fact that certain requests may take a long time to process depending upon various factors such as the type of the request the available resources on the server and the number of requests being processed or waiting to be processed by the server etc. For example a client in a traditional web based or HTML application may submit a request that involves a very time consuming query operation in a large database. This request may not be finished before the time out condition occurs.

According to one embodiment of the present invention a mechanism is provided so that when a client submits a request to a server that involves long running or time consuming operations on the server side the server can inform the client accordingly using the notifications mechanism described above. Based upon the information provided by the server regarding the request the client can take appropriate actions to inform a user of the status of the request e.g. by displaying a progress bar showing how much of the task has been completed thus far etc. . In one embodiment the communications regarding the status and progress of the request can be managed as described in more details below.

In one embodiment upon determining that the request received from the client may take a long time to process e.g. the request involves long running server operations etc. the server will notify the client accordingly. In one embodiment once the client is informed by the server that the request may take a long time to process the client can inform the user that the request processing has started and lock the user interface during the time the request is being processed by the server. In one embodiment the server will continue to inform the client of the progress of the request and the client can take appropriate actions to inform the user accordingly until the request processing is finished. For example upon receiving the progress information from the server via the notifications the client can update a progress bar to show the user how much of the task has been completed at that point in time. In one embodiment the user interface will continue to be locked until the request processing is completed.

As stated above objects on the browser and objects managed by the OM can be configured to reside and operate on one or multiple computing devices. As shown above illustrates an exemplary configuration in which objects on the browser and objects managed by the OM reside and operate on multiple computing devices and including a client and a server . illustrates an exemplary configuration in which objects on the browser and objects managed by the OM reside and operate on one computing device .

A view or JSSView object and a plurality of applets or JSSApplet objects . . . where N is a positive integer are shown to be running on the browser . The JSSView object generally represents a view. As stated above a view is generally a display panel consisting of a particular arrangement of applets. As previously discussed an applet is generally a visual application unit that appears on the screen as part of a view. Each applet or JSSApplet object . . . represents an applet that is associated to the view represented by the view or JSSView object.

The client includes a cache to generally store views to improve performance. At times the user can navigate or switch to new views causing the client to submit corresponding requests to navigate to new views to the server . As previously discussed when the client submits a request to navigate to a view to the server the server would send a response or notification containing the view layout that is devoid of data. Accordingly a round trip to the server including a request from the client to the server and a response or notification from the server to the client would typically be needed to retrieve the view layout and the view custom options from the server . The view layout and the view custom options will be generally shown in and generally described below in the text that accompanies . It should be noted that each round trip would take up valuable computing resources and would cause time delays. After sending the view layout and the view custom options to the client the server would then send a response containing data to populate the view.

To improve performance one or more view layouts and view custom options can be stored in the cache. Once its layout and customer options are stored in the cache the view can generally be referred to as a cached view. If the user navigates to a cached view the client can retrieve the view layout and view custom options from the cache instead of the server. By retrieving the view layout and the view custom options from the cache a round trip to the server can be eliminated thereby improve system performance.

In one embodiment each cache entry . . . can also be designed to customized options associated with the view. In one embodiment the view customized options can include keyboard accelerators and preferences . A keyboard accelerator is generally a sequence of keys or keystrokes that is mapped to a command object. An exemplary command object is shown and generally described above. Preferences are generally either default or user selected display options. Exemplary preferences can include font font size font colors width of columns and rows etc.

If the view is currently saved in the cache the client retrieves the view layout and the view custom options from the cache block . It should be noted that the client would save a round trip to the server by retrieving the view layout and the view custom options from the cache thereby improving system performance. After retrieving the view layout and the view custom options the client displays the view using the view layout block and applies the view custom options to the view . After displaying the view the client retrieves data for the view from the server block . After receiving the data from the server the client populates fields in the view with the retrieved data block .

These and other embodiments of the present invention may be realized in accordance with these teachings and it should be evident that various modifications and changes may be made in these teachings without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. The specification and drawings are accordingly to be regarded in an illustrative rather than restrictive sense and the invention measured only in terms of the claims.

In addition the instructions to perform the methods as described above could alternatively be stored on other forms of computer readable mediums. A machine readable medium includes any mechanism that provides e.g. stores and or transmits information in a form readable by a machine e.g. a computer . For example a machine readable medium includes read only memory ROM random access memory RAM magnetic disk storage media optical storage media flash memory devices electrical optical acoustical or other form of propagated signals e.g. carrier waves infrared signals and digital signals .
