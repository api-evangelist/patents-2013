This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 704 969 filed Feb. 12 2010 and entitled OPEN WIRELESS ARCHITECTURE OWA UNIFIED AIRBORNE AND TERRESTRIAL COMMUNICATIONS ARCHITECTURE which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.

This invention relates to an Open Wireless Architecture OWA Unified Airborne and Terrestrial Communications architecture with open radio transmission technologies between aircrafts and ground cells and between different aircrafts in ad hoc or mesh network manner to build the unified broadband information delivery platform across the airborne networks and the terrestrial networks wherein the same OWA mobile device can be used seamlessly and continuously both in the aircrafts and on the ground.

Commercial wireless mobile communications including terrestrial cellular network and airborne network have been developed for long time. However their architecture remains very closed especially the airborne network technology is still in the earlier dates.

As the ground networking technology is expanding to the space domain which is to develop the next generation Internet technology for the ground air infrastructure a unified airborne and terrestrial networking solution becomes the mission critical demand for everyone in the industry.

This technology has been in the industry for about 50 years. However satellite equipments both in aircrafts and skies are very expensive and because of power issues in the satellite the transmission speed is must limited which is not a cost effective solution in providing broadband connections for users in the aircrafts. In addition most commercial mobile devices do not support satellite communications except a purely broadcasting satellite receiver.

Commercial networks require both cost effective and performance efficient solution among the features of transmission speed mobility handover and network capacity. Satellite network has problems in cost issue and transmission speed issue and therefore is not appropriate for commercial applications.

This solution was proposed in 1960s for the airborne networks. However VHF very high frequency and UHF Ultra high frequency are mostly used for terrestrial broadcasting one way services and there are not enough two way transceivers on the ground. Furthermore VHF UHF has been already used by airline industry for airborne radio navigation information and flight information mostly in the form of voice text fax and short video etc. In addition the transmission speed over VHF UHF channel is quite limited and not appropriate for broadband high speed connections between the aircrafts and the ground.

This solution was proposed by Aircell and other companies which use one CDMA code division multiplex access technology to connect the aircrafts with the ground cellular towers. Though the CDMA EVDO Evolution Data Optimized standard has many cellular towers in some regions this solution has the following two fatal problems 

Furthermore in the above solution there is no transmission safety control scheme in the airborne in flight connections and so various wireless equipments supporting WiMax and PCS etc are used in the aircrafts which generate a serious radio interference problems with the airborne aviation navigation and airborne aviation communication systems. Such separate radio transmission technologies in the closed architecture without an efficient control will not work at all in the commercial airborne networks.

Software Defined Radio SDR technology was used for airborne network in 1990s which supports multiple wireless standards in the aircraft ground connections. Though it has been used already by the military applications it has never been used successfully in commercial environment because 

In conclusion all of these known systems fail to meet one or more of the following goals for the airborne network connections 

The present invention is based on a technology called Open Wireless Architecture OWA platform. OWA is different from SDR software defined radio as OWA basically maps various wireless standards into open interface parameters and maintain the system platform including RF baseband networks and applications an open architecture. Hence in OWA systems different modules both hardware and software can be from different vendors. It is similar to the open computer architecture in personal computer system and open network architecture in packet router system.

SDR uses broadband transceiver to support multiple wireless standards which is very expensive in the commercial environment. However OWA converges multiple air interfaces or called wireless standards or radio transmission technologies RTTs in an open system platform to maximize the transmission bandwidth and system performance but each wireless transmission still uses the narrowband transceiver therefore maintaining the system in a cost effective way which is very important for the commercial business.

By using OWA technology we can converge multiple wireless standards in one open system to support both broadband high speed radio transmission and seamless fast mobility capability in a mobile fast fading propagation model environment while maintaining the very high mobile network capacity for the commercial mobile business.

In addition OWA allows allocating multiple air interfaces into an external card so that the users can simply change wireless standards by updating such air interface card without having to change the mobile device or mobile terminal system.

Based on the research report released on Feb. 11 2010 by Berkeley Wireless Research Center University of California at Berkeley three most important and critical issues in wireless communication terminal device are in power energy radio spectrum and open wireless architecture OWA . As long as we have the OWA system it can help improve the energy efficiency and spectrum efficiency greatly. This is extremely important for the future converged networks between the terrestrial network and the airborne network and between the wireless access network and the mobile cellular network and further between the wireless network and wireline network.

An object of the invention is to overcome at least some of the drawbacks relating to the compromise designs of prior art systems and methods as discussed above.

In order to solve the problems existed in the conventional airborne communications and meet the goals as discussed improvement of the current wireless transmission and system architecture is the only and final solution. The Open Wireless Architecture OWA approach has been proposed to achieve the above goals and shifted the wireless mobile technology from a transmission specific radio system to an interface based open system platform for the complete openness and simplicity of the future unified wireless terrestrial and airborne communications.

This invention discloses a new architecture in converging the terrestrial cellular networks and the airborne communication networks seamlessly and adaptively by utilizing the OWA technology and enables an OWA based mobile device being used continuously and seamlessly in both the terrestrial networks and the airborne networks with optimal transmission performance between the aircraft and the ground and in the airborne in flight network.

Based on our long time research on wireless transmissions and seamless mobility management no SINGLE wireless standard or call radio transmission technology RTT can support both broadband high speed transmission and seamless mobility in a commercial environment and therefore the broadband transmission seamless mobility and network capacity are the three contradictory elements in a SINGLE wireless RTT of commercial environment. To meet all these three requirements we need to converge multiple wireless standards or RTTs on an open platform in both transmission level and system level and therefore the Open Wireless Architecture OWA technology was proposed and developed.

The OWA technology is extremely important for the unified terrestrial and airborne communications in terms of spectrum efficiency transmission efficiency energy efficiency performance efficiency as well as cost effectiveness in a commercial environment.

The details of the present invention are disclosed in the following drawings descriptions as well as the claims based on the abovementioned elements.

The various aspects features and advantages of the disclosure will become more fully apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon careful consideration of the following detailed description thereof with the accompanying drawings described below.

The present inventions now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which some examples of the embodiments of the inventions are shown. Indeed these inventions may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein rather these embodiments are provided by way of example so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.

The present invention relates to an Open Wireless Architecture OWA unified airborne and terrestrial communication networks providing optimal high speed connections with open radio transmission technologies RTTs between aircrafts and ground cells and between different aircrafts in Ad Hoc or Mesh group to construct the multi dimensional unified information delivery platform across the airborne networks and the terrestrial networks wherein the same OWA mobile device or OWA mobile computer can be used seamlessly and continuously both in the aircrafts and on the ground.

The moving aircrafts equipped with OWA.Air Transceivers connect to the Ground Cell towers with OWA.Ground Transceivers through the Airborne Mobile Handover protocol. Since the aircraft navigation routes are predictable and pre loaded in the airborne system and the ground cells information is also known in advance this airborne mobile handover is actually well planned when in flight.

Furthermore because the airborne handover is fully predictable the associated ground cells of handover will be able to form the narrow antenna beams well in advance and prepare for handover in an optimal way to maximize the transmission throughput.

In addition the aircrafts may use space time technologies of multiple antennas to connect the ground cells for the high speed broadband transmission.

OWA technology allows open radio transmission technologies between the ground cells and the aircrafts so that the Up Link from ground to aircraft and Down Link from aircraft to ground connections are always optimized.

The moving aircraft equipped with aforementioned OWA.Air Transceivers connects to other moving aircraft with aforementioned OWA.Air Transceivers in an Ad Hoc or Mesh network topology to construct the broadband high speed transmission channels as the Over the Air Information Delivery and Relay Platform.

The Ad Hoc or Mesh group comprises the aircrafts with the shortest distance and or slowest speed between each other within certain amount of time and the group is updated frequently at certain interval.

If the moving aircraft is close to a ground airport either after take off before landing or passing by this moving aircraft equipped with the aforementioned OWA.Air Transceiver further connects to the assigned ground airport by separate OWA aircraft ground links to connect the Ad Hoc or Mesh network with the ground backbone network and dispatch the airborne traffics to the ground network and vice verse.

Again OWA technology allows open radio transmission technologies between the moving aircrafts of the Ad Hoc or Mesh group and between the moving aircraft and its assigned ground airport to maximize the broadband high speed transmissions over the Air Link.

By utilizing the above integrated high speed transmissions the unified air networks called AirNet are established and the bandwidth of the aircrafts with the aforementioned OWA.Air Transceivers can be optimized.

The Broadcast Satellite though not required for this OWA unified AirNet can be helpful in updating the ground cells information ground airports information and the airborne navigation routing information etc.

The ground Virtual Mobile Server VMS is utilized to support the OWA Mobile Cloud infrastructure where any mobile users information in the AirNet can be synchronized in this VMS. In addition many processing tasks including signal processing and application processing can be done in this VMS as well.

Both OWA.Air transceivers and OWA.Ground transceivers as set forth above support open radio transmission technologies RTTs in a spectrum efficient bandwidth optimal and cost effective way wherein the RTTs include Code Division Multiplex Access CDMA Time Division Multiplex Access TDMA OFDMA Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex Access SDMA Space Division Multiplex Access and their combinations etc but not limited thereto.

Inside the aircraft cabins the information received by aforementioned OWA.Air Transceivers from the aforementioned Ground Cells or Ad Hoc Mesh network will be routed to the in flight mobile users in flight Passengers through the OWA.onBoard Wireless Router and Access point and vice verse.

The aforementioned OWA.Air Transceivers in the aircrafts support open radio transmission technologies RTTs in a spectrum efficient and bandwidth optimized way wherein the RTTs include Code Division Multiplex Access CDMA Time Division Multiplex Access TDMA OFDMA Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex Access SDMA Space Division Multiplex Access and their combinations but not limited thereto. The aforementioned OWA.Air Transceivers can also enable different RTTs in the Up Link from ground to aircrafts and Down Link from aircrafts to ground channels subject to spectrum service and specific transmission requirements but not limited thereto.

The aforementioned OWA.onBoard Wireless Router and Access Point support the low power and flight safe wireless local area network WLAN and or wireless personal access network or called personal area network WPAN so that the in flight mobile users can access to the OWA.onBoard Wireless Router and Access Point as set forth above wirelessly and seamlessly inside the aircraft cabins. The aforementioned in flight wireless network by aforementioned WLAN and or WPAN is fully controlled and monitored by aforementioned OWA.onBoard Wireless Router and Access Point to avoid any frequency interference with any aviation communication and navigation systems.

The Up Link from the Ground Cells to the Aircrafts is a broadband high speed link wherein the Ground Cells Transceivers as set forth above form the narrow beams adaptively with strong transmitting powers and directional antennas or antennas array to connect to the associated OWA.Air Transceivers as set forth above to construct the very high speed transmission link. In comparison the Down Link from the Aircrafts to the Ground Cells is a regular transmission link because most of the transmission traffics are in the Up Link direction.

In order to increase the transmission bandwidth and optimize the link performance in both directions Up Link and Down Link many Space Time transmission processing technologies such as Multiple In Multiple Out but not limited thereto can be utilized in both the OWA.Air Transceivers and the OWA.Ground Transceivers as set forth above.

The Airborne mobile handover among multiple Ground Cells is based on preloaded navigation routing information and Ground Cells information and therefore the aforementioned airborne connection handover is predictable and well planned. This kind of predictable and on schedule handover can optimize the AirNet connections more effectively and more stably.

The Broadcast Satellite can help broadcast useful Ground information and navigation information etc for the Airborne networks AirNet and help adjust the Airborne Mobile Handover protocol as well as update the Ad Hoc or Mesh network information with other aircrafts in the same Airborne Group.

The OWA.Ground Transceiver as set forth above is a modified terrestrial cellular transceiver system based on OWA platform which can support any cellular radio transmission technology RTT including CDMA TDMA OFDMA and SDMA etc as set forth above. The aforementioned OWA.Ground Transceivers are equipped with Beam forming technologies and or advanced antenna array technologies to generate the strong narrow beams in connecting the airborne OWA.Air Transceivers as set forth above to construct the aforementioned broadband high speed Up Link.

In the regular Down Link from the OWA.Air Transceivers to the OWA.Ground Transceivers as set forth above the aforementioned OWA.Ground Transceiver increases its receiving sensibility by utilizing space time receiving technologies such as antenna array or distributed MIMO multiple in multiple out with multiple antennas but not limited thereto and maximize its receiving performance across one or multiple OWA.Ground Transceivers as set forth above.

Because both the Up Link and the Down Link use the patented OWA transceiver technology U.S. Pat. No. 7 522 888 Application No. 20080146178 and so on etc the AirNet wireless transmission performance can be optimized and the spectrum efficiency is therefore maximized especially for the future open spectrum management strategy as well as spectrum sharing spectrum sensing and or spectrum recycling strategies.

Based on our long time research on wireless transmissions and seamless mobility management no SINGLE wireless standard or call radio transmission technology RTT can support both broadband high speed transmission and seamless mobility in a commercial environment and therefore the broadband transmission seamless mobility and network capacity are the three contradictory elements in a SINGLE wireless RTT of commercial environment. To meet all these three requirements we need to converge multiple wireless standards or RTTs on an open platform in both transmission level and system level and therefore the Open Wireless Architecture OWA technology was proposed and developed.

In a commercial AirNet environment the wireless transmission link between the aircraft and the ground cell is very high speed and the aircrafts move very fast. Furthermore the aircrafts may fly over many different regions with different RTTs or wireless standards in the terrestrial cellular networks. Hence the OWA technology is the best solution to converge various RTTs in an optimal way for the best wireless connections between the Aircrafts and the Ground Cells as set forth above to construct the open AirNet architecture which can be applied in any commercial airborne communication environment.

The OWA.onBoard Wireless Router and Access Point as set forth above supports the following radio transmission technologies RTTs 

When the aforementioned OWA.inFlight Mobile Device or Mobile Notebook is in In Flight mode it performs the following tasks immediately 

During In Flight mode the aforementioned OWA.inFlight Mobile Device can push any information to the aforementioned VMS or retrieve any information from the aforementioned VMS. In this way the OWA mobile device is fully synchronized between the terrestrial mode and the in flight mode when the mobile users travel across the airborne networks and the terrestrial networks.

By using OWA Mobile Device of unified terrestrial and in flight modes the mobile users can continue seamless communications from the Ground networks to the Airborne networks and from the Airborne networks to the Ground networks. Furthermore the OWA.inFlight Mobile Device as set forth above is in full compliance with the airborne regulations on safety and security and the users or passengers do not have to turn off the mobile devices when on board the aircrafts.

As mobile device becomes the most important communication and information equipment on the worldwide basis the aforementioned unified terrestrial and in flight OWA mobile device will drive this future direction in delivering the truly service oriented information to the mobile users anywhere anytime and with anyone.

After the users get on board in the aircraft and the aircraft gets ready for takeoff or in flight or by some airborne regulations as long as the aircraft leaves the airport Gate an In Flight Pilot Signal will be broadcasted to all the OWA mobile devices or mobile notebooks in the aircraft cabins.

If the OWA Mobile Device does not receive the aforementioned In Flight Pilot Signal it remains in the Terrestrial mode with the Ground cellular networks. Otherwise the aforementioned OWA Mobile Device immediately turns off all the terrestrial radio transceivers of the device and switch to the In Flight Mode accordingly.

When in the In Flight mode the aforementioned OWA.inFlight Mobile Device checks whether the WLAN.Air radio transmission technology RTT as set forth above is available for the in flight connection. If available the aforementioned OWA.inFlight Mobile Device is set in the aforementioned WLAN.Air connection mode otherwise it further checks whether the WPAN.Air radio transmission technology RTT as set forth above is available for the in flight connection. If available the aforementioned OWA.inFlight Mobile Device is set in the aforementioned WPAN.Air connection mode.

If both the WLAN.Air and WPAN.Air RTTs as set forth above are not available for the in flight connection the aforementioned OWA.inFlight Mobile Device further searches the standard WLAN radio transmission technology RTT or standard WPAN radio transmission technology RTT . If either of them is available the aforementioned OWA.inFlight Mobile Device first reduces its radio transmitting power of the aforementioned RTT to the minimal level then connects to the OWA.onBoard Wireless Router and Access Point as set forth above in the aforementioned RTT connection mode.

If all the WLAN.Air WPAN.Air WLAN WPAN RTTs as set forth above are not available for the in flight connection the aforementioned OWA.inFlight Mobile Device also supports the wireline connection mode by plugging into the OWA.onBoard Wireless Router and Access Point as set forth above through a networking cable or other forms of wiring in the aircraft.

If all of the aforementioned connections are failed the aforementioned OWA.inFlight Mobile Device will restart the access control again from the beginning.

It is emphasized that as long as the aircraft leaves the airport Gate in flight taxing taking off landing the In Flight Pilot Signal as set forth above remains ON and continues broadcasting to all the OWA mobile devices or mobile notebooks in the aircraft cabins. Therefore the aforementioned OWA.inFlight Mobile Device maintains in the In Flight Mode all the time.

Only after the aircraft returns back and stop completely to the airport Gate the aforementioned In Flight Pilot Signal can be turned off and so the aforementioned OWA.inFlight Mobile Device can be switched back to the Terrestrial mode for the ground cellular networks.

Based on different airborne regulations and rulings in different regions the time to release or turn off the aforementioned In Flight Pilot Signal may vary. However for airborne safety consideration we strongly suggest to turn off the aforementioned In Flight Pilot Signal after completely returning to the airport gate.

The search order of the connection modes between the OWA.inFlight Mobile Device and the OWA.onBoard Wireless Router and Access Point as set forth above can be re configured or re set by the mobile users or the aircrafts. By default the search order is by WLAN.Air WPAN.Air WLAN WPAN Wireline as set forth above.

The aforementioned WLAN.Air and WPAN.Air are the completely safest modes for the In Flight connection. The aforementioned WLAN and WPAN modes must turn the radio transmitting power to be the lowest possible in compliance with the airborne regulations and must be fully monitored at all times for the In Flight connection.

The aforementioned OWA.onBoard Wireless Router and Access Point manages and monitors the aforementioned flight safe RTTs to ensure there is no frequency interference with the aircraft communication and navigation systems.

The aforementioned In Flight Pilot Signal is broadcasted to the OWA Mobile Device through a separate broadcasting channel by certain short distance radio broadcasting technology in the airborne cabins or aircrafts.

The aforementioned OWA.Air OWA.Air Transceiver and its controller loads the aircraft navigation routing information and the Ground Cells information. Then the aforementioned OWA.Air detects the current and next Ground Cells for the airborne mobility handover control based on the detection of signal strengths received from the Ground Cells and the updated Ground Cells sequence by pre loaded or updated Ground Cells information. When the moving aircraft is ready for handover the aforementioned OWA.Air transceivers connect and handover among the detected Ground Cells accordingly. After this handover is completed the aforementioned OWA.Air updates the Ground Cells information for the next handover to come and repeats the above steps again.

Because the airborne mobility handover is predictable and fully on schedule both the Up Link from ground to aircraft and Down Link from aircraft to ground connections of the Airborne Networks can be seamless and lossless during the handover period.

Furthermore by utilizing advanced space time transmitting and receiving technologies such as space diversity antenna arrays smart antennas and Multiple In Multiple Out antenna technologies but not limited thereto in OWA.Air Transceivers and or OWA.Ground Transceivers as set forth above the aforementioned Up Link and Down Link connection bandwidth can be maximized and optimized which absolutely improves the airborne network performance.

Furthermore the OWA.Ground Transceivers as set forth above actively and adaptively send strong narrow beams to the associated OWA.Air Transceivers as set forth above based on the advanced antenna beam forming technology to ensure the broadband high speed connections in the aforementioned Up Link channels.

Again OWA technology allows open radio transmission technologies between the ground cells and the aircrafts so that the Up Link from ground to aircraft and Down Link from aircraft to ground are always optimized.

Further OWA technology enables same or different radio transmission technologies RTTs in Up Link and Down Link as set forth above to maximize the transmission efficiency and performance in different commercial environments because in some regions the wireless spectrum availability in each link may be different and the available RTTs in each link may also be different but not limited thereto.

In addition in order to combat and overcome the Doppler effect or Doppler shift and or transmission delay for the fast moving aircrafts the aforementioned OWA.Ground Transceivers can perform additional transmission processing by using antenna calibration technology and or signal processing technology on the ground.

The aforementioned OWA.Air OWA.Air Transceiver and its controller in one aircraft loads the Airborne Group Ad Hoc or Mesh network Group information and the Ground Airports information where the aforementioned Airborne Group comprises the aircrafts with the shortest distance and or slowest speed between each other within certain amount of time and the group is updated frequently at certain interval.

The aforementioned OWA.Air in one aircraft then requests the aforementioned Group member s for Ad Hoc network connection or mesh network connection based on the different airborne networks topology in different regions. The aforementioned OWA.Air keeps sending such request until it is accepted by one new Group Member as set forth above.

Then the aforementioned OWA.Air in one aircraft connects the aforementioned new Group Member for Ad Hoc or Mesh network connection.

If the moving aircraft is close to a ground airport either after take off before landing or passing by this moving aircraft equipped with the aforementioned OWA.Air Transceiver further connects to the assigned ground airport by separate OWA aircraft ground links to connect the Ad Hoc or Mesh network with the ground backbone network and dispatch the airborne traffics to the ground network and vice verse.

Again OWA technology allows open radio transmission technologies between the moving aircrafts of the Ad Hoc or Mesh group and between the moving aircraft and its assigned ground airport to maximize the broadband high speed transmissions over the Air Link.

The aforementioned airborne Ad Hoc or Mesh networks with OWA.Air Transceivers as set forth above provide an optimal way to construct the Over the Air high speed information delivery and information relay platform for the airborne communication networks which can also be utilized to build the next generation network or Internet technology fully converging the terrestrial and airborne communication networks in an open and unified infrastructure.

By utilizing the aforementioned integrated high speed transmissions with different network topology the unified airborne networks called AirNet are established and the connection bandwidth of the aircrafts with the ground backbone network can be optimized.
