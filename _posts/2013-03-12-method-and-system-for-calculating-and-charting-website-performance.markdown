Aspects of the present disclosure involve networks and more particularly to a computerized method and system of evaluating network site performance.

While managing website downtime is important managing slow website performance can be just as vital. Companies rely on websites to market to customers conduct e commerce and run internal business among other functions. In today s business environment it is increasingly important to have a website that loads consistently quickly and provides a rich experience. An Internet user s attention span can quickly be lost if a web page fails to load or fails to load in an agreeable time. Similarly an Internet user s attention may be lost when a website does not include rich graphics videos or other rich content. For companies conducting e commerce there can be a direct financial benefit to having a faster performing rich website. When web pages load quickly customers are less likely to abandon shopping carts more likely to complete purchases and more likely to be satisfied customers.

There are a number of website performance tools available on the Internet. These tools typically provide a number of performance statistics such as web page loading time and web page size. While this information may be helpful the tool leaves it to the user to decide how to interpret the performance data. Additionally there is no metric to compare data points with other websites or to gauge the end user s overall browsing experience.

It is with these inadequacies and concerns in mind among others that various aspects of the present disclosure were conceived and developed.

Implementations described and claimed herein address the foregoing problems by providing a computerized method and system of evaluating network site performance. The method and system is performed by using at least one computing device where the computing device s receives an identification of at least one network site to be tested which can be a website that is tested over the internet. The computing device s sends an automated command to a testing server which includes the identification of at least one network site or website to be tested. The testing center performs a plurality of performance tests on each of the network sites and receives the testing data. A web performance calculator then accesses the testing data and calculates an index based on aggregating at plurality of operations that is performed on the testing data. The index is stored in a user interface server for display of the index for each of the tested network sites. In one embodiment the plurality of operations to be aggregated are functions of the fully loaded page time the document complete time the time to first byte and the fully loaded page size.

Aspects of the present disclosure involve a web performance index tool along with related systems and methods for calculating and charting website performance that provide a single metric snapshot indicating how an end user would perceive the performance of a website. The metric provides an objective way to evaluate website performance by using an algorithm that measures the speed quantity and quality of the web content.

The web performance index may test hundreds of the world s most popular websites everyday in order to provide an adequate sample size to gauge performance. With this information the web user s relative browsing experience is measured in relation to their experience with other websites. The user can choose an industry sector as well as a date range for comparison. Current web performance tools typically do not provide an objective metric to evaluate performance as compared to other websites but instead force the user to interpret the data subjectively among other distinctions.

In one specific example the web performance index tool uses a web performance testing engine such as provided by totalsiteperformance.com to collect web performance data and then uses a unique formula to calculate a single website user experience measurement. The computed experience measurement for a given website can then be used to compare the performance of various websites in an objective way. It is also possible to use other mechanisms to collect or calculate web performance.

The index tool may be completely automated. Referring to the tool is setup to collect performance data from an inputted list of websites. In a first embodiment the tool tests five hundred different websites but the exact number and specific websites on the list can vary. The specific websites are chosen in order to provide an adequate sample size within a variety of industry sectors. Each day the tool schedules a set of performance tests. In one specific example the tool uses an application programming interface to pass testing parameters to the performance testing engine at totalsiteperformance.com which then initiates the necessary tests. When a signal is received or otherwise the performance testing engine conducts a performance test against each of the websites on the list or a subset of the sites identified and collects the raw data. In the first embodiment the performance tests for a subset of sites on the list are scheduled to take place hourly. Over the course of some period of time all of the websites are tested and then testing begins again to update performance results. Again the frequency of testing can be altered to provide an accurate picture of web performance.

During the tests the tool collects the following data points for each site tested fully loaded page time document complete time time to first byte and fully loaded size. The fully loaded page time is a measurement of the time it takes for the web page to completely load. This metric shows how long the user must wait before she can interact with the complete web page. The document complete time is a measurement of the time it takes to load enough of the web page so that the user can begin to interact with the page. The time to first bye is a measurement of the amount of time it takes before the first element of the web page begins to load. This measures the initial responsiveness of the website. Finally the fully loaded size is a measure that shows the relative richness of the content provided to the end user. This is a measure of the amount of digital information displayed on the website. All of the factors listed above contribute to website performance and a web user s overall browsing experience. Since websites are designed for interaction with a web user collecting data points that measure the amount of time it takes to load website information provides an objective way to gauge a web user s experience. Furthermore taking into account the size of the web page has a normalizing effect so that a rich web page with a lot of data to load can be objectively compared to a skinny web page with not much data to load.

The corresponding performance test results are stored in a results database. The web performance index tool then accesses the performance testing results and computes the web performance index as per the equation in . The results can be classified by industry and plotted on a graph. The frequency of calculations the size of the sample and the specific list of websites can vary accordingly.

Three of the factors are measured in seconds time to first byte document complete time fully loaded page time. The time to first byte is going to be the shortest time calculated since it is a measure of the time it takes for the first byte of data begins to load. Correspondingly the fully loaded page time will be longest time calculated since it is a measure of the time it takes for the web page to completely load. But the time differences between the factors can be quite miniscule when considering the amount of possible data to load and the Internet connection speed. Each of the three factors is measured differently when calculating each expression as indicated by the equation in . More particularly the numerator of each of the three expressions provides a relative weight for each of the three factors so that when the factors are aggregated the sum provides an accurate assessment of overall web performance. For example in the expression dealing with the fully loaded time is calculated by dividing 200 by the fully loaded time whereas the expression dealing with document complete time is calculated by dividing 75 by the document complete time. The exact weight given to each of the three factors i.e. the value of the numerator of each expression can vary accordingly or can be calculated through a wholly different operation in order to provide an accurate index of web performance.

The fourth factor in the web performance index fully loaded size is measured in bytes. Taking into account the amount of digital information on the website will normalize the results so that a website with few bytes of data to load can be compared on the same footing with a website with much more data to load. The expression in that deals with the fully loaded size is calculated by multiplying 10 to the logarithm of the fully loaded size to base 10. As discussed previously the exact expression used to measure the amount of information that the web page loads can change accordingly. For example the amount of bytes displayed on a typical web page could significantly change in the future which would necessitate a change to the expression in order to accurately portray overall web performance.

The sum of the expressions in the equation is a single number or index called the web performance index. The value of the index represents a consideration of all of the factors previously discussed and provides the user with an objective snapshot of overall web performance. The user can view the web performance index for certain industry sectors over a chosen timeline. This information can be displayed graphically in order to easily gauge web performance over a chosen timeframe.

Additionally other factors can be considered when computing the web performance index. For example additional metrics that occur between time to first bye and document complete time can be considered when computing the index. The factors in the equation of are not exhaustive but merely representative of a first embodiment of factors to be considered when computing a web performance index.

The disclosure of the web performance index is made in the context of websites on the Internet but the web performance index is equally applicable to other computer networks and sites within those networks that users may access through a network such as an intranet within an organization. The disclosure of the web performance index in relation to websites on the Internet is not meant to be limiting but merely representative of a type of computer network to which the web performance index is applicable.
