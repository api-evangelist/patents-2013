In an age of information data stores to store and access information are ubiquitous. Some information may be confidential with only a limited number of parties granted access to the information. However identifying unauthorized access or use of the information may not always be possible.

The present disclosure relates to techniques for identifying potentially malicious activity through automated placement of decoy data into a response to an access of a data store and detection of the decoy data in locations other than where it was placed. Various criteria may be used to select the locations for placement of the decoy data while the decoy data itself may be predefined or generated based on a set of encoding rules using for example steganographic and or cryptographic techniques. Client applications making legitimate access requests to the data store may use an application framework in order to adapt or normalize any decoy data present in the response from the data store. The application framework may implement configurable policies in order to distinguish legitimate authorized requests from unauthorized requests on the basis of various criteria. Signature data may be created to concisely describe the decoy data which may then be distributed to one or more sentinels to begin examination. The sentinels may detect the decoy data based on comparison of the signature data with the data under examination. Various actions may be undertaken upon detection of decoy data that may be based upon the particular decoy data detected as well as the role and location of the detecting sentinel. In the following discussion a general description of the system and its components is provided followed by a discussion of the operation of the same.

With reference to shown is a networked environment according to various embodiments. The networked environment includes a computing device in data communication with one or more clients and a computing device by way of the network . In some embodiments other computing devices such as the remote devices may also be in data communication with the computing device . The network includes for example the Internet intranets extranets wide area networks WANs local area networks LANs wired networks wireless networks or other suitable networks etc. or any combination of two or more such networks. Data communication transiting the network may be forwarded and or examined by a network device .

The computing device may comprise for example a server computer or any other system providing computing capability. Alternatively the computing device may comprise a plurality of servers or other computing devices that are arranged for example in one or more server banks or computer banks or other arrangements. For example the computing device may comprise a cloud computing resource a grid computing resource and or any other distributed computing arrangement. The computing device may be located in a single installation or may be distributed among many different geographical locations.

Various applications and or other functionality may be executed in the computing device according to various embodiments. Also various data is stored in a data store that is accessible to the computing device . The data store may be representative of a plurality of data stores as can be appreciated. As a non limiting example the data store may comprise one or more relational databases object oriented databases document oriented databases and or other types of data stores as can be appreciated. The data stored in the data store for example is associated with the operation of the various applications and or functional entities described below.

The components executed on the computing device for example include a marking service a data store manager an application framework a sentinel service and other applications services processes systems engines or functionality not discussed in detail herein. The marking service is executed in order to facilitate identifying and or creating tables within the data store and including decoy data in responses to access of the given tables. To this end the marking service may insert the decoy data into the table to be included in responses and or the marking service may insert decoy data only into the responses without insertion into the table. Despite the organizational view of tables stored as rows and columns the data values may be stored in a different structure suitable for the particular data store . The decoy data may include the addition of data to the pre existing data of a table and or response as well as potential modifications to the pre existing data. As a non limiting example the modifications may include for example digital watermarks steganography cryptography and or other techniques for marking data as can be appreciated. In some embodiments the marking service may include coding rules a transaction log and or other possible data.

The coding rules comprise rules for identifying and or creating tables within the data store for marking as well as the type of marking to be performed for a given table. The transaction log comprises data associated with historical modifications of the tables and or responses made by the marking service . For a given table modified by the marking service the transaction log may include an identifier for a modified table an identifier for one or more attribute types e.g. columns of decoy data inserted into the table an identifier for one or more records e.g. rows of decoy data inserted into the table decoy data values inserted a time stamp for the access authentication credentials associated with the access and or other data associated modifications to tables by the marking service .

The data store manager is executed in order to facilitate creation maintenance and use of one or more tables within the data store . The data store manager may support query languages or other types of access languages to specify criteria with which to report insert modify and or delete data values associated with the tables. The data store manager may further provide facilities for controlling data access enforcing data integrity managing concurrency control as well as maintaining database security. In some embodiments the data store manager may further offer an application programming interface API or other programmatic interface through which applications and or plug in program modules may interface with the data store manager to extend features and functionality.

The application framework is executed in order to facilitate an authorized communication session between the data store manager and the client device . To that end the application framework may use various authentication authorization techniques as well the policy data . The policy data may include various heuristics that may be used to distinguish legitimate access of the data store from an improper access. In some embodiments the policy data may further specify responsive actions based in part upon the determined legitimacy of the access and or other possible factors.

The sentinel service is executed in order to facilitate identifying the presence of decoy data located outside of the tables of the data store as well as potentially act upon the identified decoy data. As a low level service with privileged operating system permissions the sentinel service may operate in a manner similar to an antivirus or antimalware service. The decoy data may be identified based upon a comparison with portions of the signature data . The signature data may contain various types of information that may be employed to positively identify a given piece of data as being decoy data. As a non limiting example the signature data may comprise text strings checksums hash values metadata decoding rules and or other types of identification data as can be appreciated. In some embodiments the signature data may further specify actions e.g. transmitting an alert to be taken in response to decoy data based upon the particular decoy data detected the computing device in which the sentinel service is executing and or other possible criteria. The actions may include modifications and or other possible actions to be initiated upon the decoy data or co mingled non decoy data based upon the circumstances in which the decoy data is encountered.

The sentinel service may examine data present in memory in a table of the data store other than where it was placed stored in non volatile storage transiting a network interface and or in other locations of the computing device in which the sentinel service is executing such as the computing device . The sentinel serve may communicate with the computing device and or other computing devices using various protocols such as for example hypertext transfer protocol HTTP simple object access protocol SOAP representational state transfer REST user datagram protocol UDP transmission control protocol TCP and or other protocols for communicating data over the network .

The data stored in the data store includes for example tables and potentially other data. Each table in the tables is a set of data values organized using a model of vertical columns and horizontal rows wherein a table has a specified number of columns but may have any number of rows. The types of data values represented in the tables may include customer records payment information payment instruments e.g. credit card information debit card information gift card information prepaid card information and stored value account information confidential information personally identifiable information order histories user credentials salary information sales information gift certificates web browser cookies music medical information and or other data as can be appreciated. Each of the tables generally has associated metadata such as constraints on the table and or on the values within particular columns descriptors for the table and or columns or other metadata as can be appreciated. Despite the organizational view of tables stored as rows and columns the data values may be stored in a different structure suitable for the data store .

The client is representative of a plurality of client devices that may be coupled to the network . The client may comprise for example a processor based system such as a computer system. Such a computer system may be embodied in the form of a desktop computer a server a laptop computer a personal digital assistant a cellular telephone set top box music players web pads tablet computer systems game consoles or other devices with like capability.

The client may be configured to execute various applications such as an application framework a client application a sentinel service and or other applications. During the course of execution the client application may obtain via the application framework data from the data store potentially containing both decoy data and non decoy data. The sentinel service as executed in the client embodies the signature data and is executed in order to facilitate identifying and responding to the presence of decoy data. The sentinel service may examine data present in memory stored in non volatile storage transiting a network interface and or other locations of the computing device in which the sentinel service is executing such as the client . In some embodiments the functionality of the application framework and or sentinel service may be embodied within the client application . In other embodiments the application framework and or sentinel service may function as a plug in module to the client application .

The application framework sentinel service and client application may communicate with other computing devices using various protocols such as for example HTTP SOAP REST UDP TCP and or other protocols for communicating data over the network . The client may be configured to execute applications beyond the application framework sentinel service and client application such as for example a browser application email applications instant message applications and or other applications.

The computing device may comprise for example a server computing device or any other system providing computing capability. Alternatively a plurality of computing devices may be employed that are arranged for example in one or more computer banks or other arrangements. For example a plurality of computing devices together may comprise a cloud computing resource a grid computing resource and or any other distributed computing arrangement. Such computing devices may be located in a single installation or may be distributed among many different geographical locations. For purposes of convenience the computing device may be referred to herein in the singular. Even though the computing device is referred to in the singular it is understood that a plurality of computing devices may be employed in the various arrangements as described above.

Various applications and or other functionality may be executed in the computing device according to various embodiments. Also various data is stored in a data store that is accessible to the computing device . The data store may be representative of a plurality of data stores as can be appreciated. The data stored in the data store for example is associated with the operation of the various applications and or functional entities described below.

The components executed on the computing device for example include a threat management service and other applications services processes systems engines or functionality not discussed in detail herein. The threat management service may correspond to a management application for the marking service and the sentinel service . To that end the threat management service may communicate with the marking service application framework and sentinel service over various protocols such as for example HTTP SOAP REST UDP TCP and or other protocols for communicating data over the network . In some embodiments the threat management service may carry out some or all of these communications over a management network. The management network may be partitioned from the network or may be a virtual private network overlay upon the network . The threat management service may also present a user interface accessible through a web browser and or other applications on the client or other computing device.

The data stored in the data store includes for example coding rules a transaction log policy data signature data service data alert data and potentially other data. The service data may comprise identifiers and authentication data associated with various deployed instances of the marking service the application framework and the sentinel service . The service data may further comprise network location information and or priority information for the computing devices on which instances of the marking service the application framework and or the sentinel service are executing. The alert data may comprise a set of alerts as reported by the deployed instances of the sentinel service . The alerts may comprise an identifier for the computing device on which the sentinel service is executing the decoy data detected where it was detected the action attempted result of the attempted action and or other possible data related to the incident as can be appreciated.

The remote device may be configured to execute various applications such as a sentinel service and or other applications. The sentinel service as executed in the remote device embodies the signature data and is executed in order to facilitate identifying the presence of decoy data. The sentinel service may examine data present in memory stored in non volatile storage transiting a network interface and or other locations of the computing device in which the sentinel service is executing such as the remote device . The sentinel serve may communicate with the computing device and or other computing devices using various protocols such as for example HTTP SOAP REST UDP TCP and or other protocols for communicating data over the network . The remote device may be configured to execute applications beyond the sentinel service such as for example a browser application email applications instant message applications and or other applications.

The network device is representative of a plurality of network devices that may forward and or examine communication data transiting the network . The network device may comprise for example a processor based system such as a computer system. Such a computer system may be embodied in the form of a server network router a network switch a network proxy or other devices with like capability.

The network device may be configured to execute various applications such as a sentinel service and or other applications. The sentinel service as executed in the network device embodies the signature data and is executed in order to facilitate identifying and responding to the presence of decoy data. The sentinel service may examine data present in memory stored in non volatile storage transiting a network interface and or other locations of the computing device in which the sentinel service is executing such as the network device . The sentinel service may communicate with the computing device and or other computing devices using various protocols such as for example HTTP SOAP REST UDP TCP and or other protocols for communicating data over the network .

Next a general description of the operation of the various components of the networked environment is provided. To begin an operator defines the instances of the marking service the application framework and the sentinel service to be used in the service data . The definitions may include a network address authentication data a location of the computing device on which the service is executing a priority of the service and other possible information about each service as can be appreciated.

Additionally the operator may provide coding rules to the threat management service . The coding rules identify specific tables or types of tables to be created and or modified with decoy data as well as the type s of marking to be performed for a given table. The marking may include specific decoy data to be inserted into the tables and or responses rules for modifying pre existing data to be decoy data rules for generating decoy data rules for creating tables and or other marking techniques as can be appreciated. The coding rules policy data and the service data may be input through a user interface of the threat management service or predefined elsewhere and imported into the data store .

As a non limiting example one of the coding rules may be to identify tables containing confidential information such as name address telephone number geolocation uniquely identifying information personal non public information and personally identifiable information. The rule for these tables may further include direction to add a column to the table of non decoy actual data to include credit card information as decoy data. The credit card information may be decoy data provided by credit card issuers and or the decoy credit card numbers may be locally generated. Locally generated numbers may be created randomly from a credit card number algorithm and or using other techniques as can be appreciated. In some embodiments the locally generated credit card numbers may contain a valid credit card number check digit such that upon a cursory validation of the number the credit card number would appear to be valid.

The operator may further specify various policy data to be used by the application framework . The policy data may include various heuristics that may be used to evaluate legitimacy of access of a data store during the course of a communication session with the data store . In some embodiments the policy data may further specify responsive actions based in part upon the legitimacy of the access. As a non limiting example the policy data may indicate that the tables are typically accessed by selecting one record at a time and that the maximum rate of record retrieval by a client is one record per second. In the event the access policy is violated during the course of a communication session i.e. not likely a legitimate access the policy data may specify that any response retrieved from the access of data store should be discarded. Alternatively if the user request is characterized as legitimate the policy data may direct that the decoy data should be removed from a response from the data store modifications to be made to the decoy data in the response and or other possible actions as can be appreciated.

The threat management service may use the coding rules to generate the decoy data detection portion of the policy data and signature data . The signature data may be used to detect decoy data and may comprise for example text strings checksums hash values metadata detection rules and or other types of identification data as can be appreciated. As a non limiting example the coding rules may comprise an instruction to insert a decoy credit card number of 4123 0987 5678 7890 into a table associated with customer order data. The signature data may contain the text string 4123 0987 5678 7890 to be matched a cyclical redundancy check CRC checksum of the text string a detection rule that a sum of the digits of the credit card number are a particular value and or other possible criteria for detecting decoy data as can be appreciated.

The threat management service may distribute the coding rules policy data and signature data to the respective instances of the marking service application framework and sentinel service the instances being defined in the service data . The distribution may occur using HTTP HTTP over Transport Layer Security TLS Secure Sockets Layer SSL File Transfer Protocol FTP FTP Secure FTPS or other data transfer protocols as can be appreciated. As described previously in some embodiments all or a portion of the distribution may occur over a management network.

The distribution may further use authentication credentials to confirm the identity of the instances of the marking service application framework and sentinel service . In some embodiments only portions of the coding rules policy data and or the signature data may be distributed to the respective services based at least upon location and or function of the computing device in which the service is executing. As a non limiting example a coding rule associated with inserting decoy data into tables of customer information may not be applicable for a computing device without tables containing customer information.

Thereafter the instances of the marking service may begin an examination of the tables to identify and or create tables conforming to the criteria of the coding rules and include decoy data in responses to access of the tables accordingly. To this end the marking service may insert the decoy data into the table to be included in responses and or the marking service may insert decoy data only into the responses without insertion into the table.

In some embodiments the decoy data inserted may be unique to the data store unique to a user accessing the tables unique to a client device unique to a particular access of the tables and or uniquely identifiable upon another basis as can be appreciated. Among other possible benefits the use of uniquely identifiable decoy data may aid in tracing the decoy data to the original source. The marking service may identify pre existing tables based upon metadata for the tables examination of the data values within the tables and or other possible techniques. As a non limiting example the coding rules may instruct the marking service to identify ones of the tables having customer names where none of the customer names include a middle initial. The coding rules may further instruct the marking service to insert decoy data of randomly generated letters as middle initials into the customer name field for responses to access of those tables having a customer name.

Activities of identification and marking performed by the marking service may be stored in the transaction log . The transaction log may be periodically transmitted to the threat management service for collection. In some embodiments the signature data may be adjusted based upon the transaction log . For example if the signature data includes detection techniques for decoy data that the transaction log indicates has never been used the particular detection technique may be removed from the signature data until the transaction log indicates the decoy data has actually been applied.

The client application may access the tables of the data store through a communication session with the data store manager . The communication session may be facilitated by one or more instances of the application framework executing in the computing device and or client device . The policy data as embodied by the application framework may further specify modifications and or other possible actions to be initiated upon any decoy data encountered in the response to the access of the data store based upon the circumstances in which the decoy data is encountered. The actions may be based on the identity of the user accessing the data the computing device in which the access is carried out the manner in which the data is accessed and or other circumstances as can be appreciated.

As a non limiting example various user records and a column of credit card information have been previously added as decoy data to a table of customer information. The policy data may specify that credit card information should never be legitimately accessed while legitimate requests may include the decoy user records. The policy data may further provide a general directive that if the data store is accessed in the manner specified in the policy data then any decoy data present in a response should be removed. Continuing the example if a user accesses the credit card information the application framework may interrupt delivery of a response to the client application . However if the user issues a request from the data store that includes the decoy user records but no credit card information the threshold for legitimacy has been met and the decoy data e.g. the decoy user records may be removed from the response. As described previously various criteria may be specified in the policy data to distinguish legitimate requests of the data store from improper requests.

In various embodiments rather than removing the decoy data the policy data may direct the application framework to modify the decoy data with a counter a timestamp an identifier and or other possible modifications. The modification may be carried out be replacing a portion of the decoy data inserting additional data in the response performing an exclusive disjunction XOR operation on a portion of the decoy data and or other techniques as can be appreciated. Thereafter if the client application communicates the response including the decoy data to other client devices through the application framework the decoy data may be further modified through similar operations.

The sentinel service may be executed in the computing device the client device the remote device the network device and or other computing devices in order to detect the presence of decoy data outside the data store or other data stores in which it was placed. The decoy data may be identified based upon a comparison with portions of the signature data . The signature data may contain various types of information that may be employed to positively identify and react to a given piece of data as being decoy data.

The sentinel service may examine data present in memory in a table of the data store other than where it was placed stored in non volatile storage transiting a network interface and or other locations of the computing devices in which the sentinel service is executing. Descriptors of the various decoy data as well as possibly actions to initiate upon detection of the decoy data may be specified in the signature data embodied in each instance of the sentinel service 

In response to detection of decoy data the sentinel service may take a variety of possible actions as may be defined in the signature data . The actions may also include for example logging the details about the circumstances of the detected incident transmitting an alert to the threat management service quarantine the data associated with the decoy data terminating the process accessing the decoy data and or other possible actions as can be appreciated. The action s taken may depend in part upon the particular decoy data detected the location of the computing device in which the sentinel service is executing the priority of the computing device in which the sentinel service is executing and or other possible criteria.

As a non limiting example the sentinel service executing in a network device near the source of the decoy data may simply transmit an alert for detected decoy data on a network interface because false positives at this location may be high and the risk of consequential damage is low due to the location. However a network device operating at an exit point of a network may choose to interrupt the data communication containing the decoy data as well as non decoy data because of the high risk that the data access may not have been authorized.

In some embodiments the sentinel service may be executed by computing devices such as the remote devices that are not within the same administrative domain as the other devices of the networked environment . As a non limiting example these remote devices may include personal computers for home use servers used by other businesses routers and switching devices used by Internet service providers and or other types of computing devices as can be appreciated. It may be desirable to identify decoy data that has been removed from the administrative domain in which it originated. Using the signature data the sentinel service executing in the remote devices may identify given decoy data as originating at particular source. If this decoy data is detected by the sentinel service executing in a remote device a notification of the event may be sent to the specified source.

Thereafter the sentinel service executing in the remote device may provide the decoy data to the threat management service for examination. Using various techniques previously described such as for example using unique decoy data and marking decoy data with identifiers and or counters the threat management service may analyze the data to support investigating the data breach. Likewise the signature data used by computing devices within any administrative domain may be configured to recognize decoy data originating in other domains. Notification of decoy data detection may be sent to these other domains by the detecting computing device itself and or by a centralized reporting service such as the threat management service .

In some embodiments within a remote device neither the sentinel service nor the signature data may indicate precisely what portion of the data is the actual decoy data. The decoy data may be obfuscated in this manner in order to provide a measure of confidentiality that may prevent malicious users from rapidly detecting and removing any decoy data present. To that end signature data provided to instances of the sentinel service executing in remote devices may be encrypted use decoy data detection operations that may not be easily reversed such as cryptographic hashing and or other possible techniques.

Referring next to shown is a flowchart that provides one example of the operation of a portion of the application framework according to various embodiments. It is understood that the flowchart of provides merely an example of the many different types of functional arrangements that may be employed to implement the operation of the portion of the application framework as described herein. As an alternative the flowchart of may be viewed as depicting an example of steps of a method implemented in the client device and or other computing devices shown in the networked environment according to one or more embodiments.

This exemplary execution of the application framework may be carried out in tandem with a client application executing in the client device . This portion of the execution of the application framework may be executed subsequent to the client application accessing the data store on behalf of a user. Beginning with block the application framework may obtain the data received in the response to the access of the data store .

Next in block the application framework examines available data of the response in order to detect the presence of decoy data outside the data store or other data stores in which it was placed. The decoy data may be identified based upon a comparison with portions of the policy data . Then in block the application framework determines if the examination indicates the presence of decoy data. If the examination of the data does not indicate the presence of decoy data thereafter this portion of the execution of the application framework ends as shown. The application framework may be re invoked when additional response data from the data store is to be examined.

Alternatively if the examination does indicate the presence of decoy data in block the application framework determines whether the prior access of the tables by the client application was legitimate. As described previously the policy data may provide various factors for determining legitimacy of an access such as traditional user authentication authorization techniques thresholds behavioral classifiers and or other possible factors as can be appreciated. If the access does not appear to be legitimate in block the application framework may interrupt delivery of the response to the client application and or other possible actions as may be specified in the policy data . Thereafter the execution of the application framework may proceed to block . However if the access by the user appears to be legitimate then in block the application framework may remove the decoy data from the data of the response. It should be noted that the policy data specifies the actions and the circumstances in which they are to be carried out. The actions described here are merely some of the possible actions that have been described previously.

Next in block the application framework may provide the data of the response including any modifications back to the client application . Then in block the application framework logs details of the decoy data encountered and the action s undertaken. The application framework may store a log locally and or transmit the information to the computing device to be stored in the transaction log . Thereafter this portion of the application framework ends as shown. The application framework may be re invoked when additional response data from the data store is to be examined.

Turning now to shown is a flowchart that provides an example of the operation of a portion of the sentinel service according to various embodiments. It is understood that the flowchart of provides merely an example of the many different types of functional arrangements that may be employed to implement the operation of the portion of the sentinel service as described herein. As an alternative the flowchart of may be viewed as depicting an example of steps of a method implemented in the computing device and or other computing devices shown in the networked environment according to one or more embodiments.

This portion of the execution of the sentinel service may be executed based on the presence of unexamined data and or an update to the signature data . Beginning with block the sentinel service examines available data in order to detect the presence of decoy data outside the data store or other data stores in which it was placed. The decoy data may be identified based upon a comparison with portions of the signature data . The signature data may contain various types of information that may be employed to positively identify a given piece of data as being decoy data. The sentinel service may examine data present in memory in a table of the data store other than where it was placed stored in non volatile storage transiting a network interface and or other locations of the computing devices in which the sentinel service is executing.

Next in block the sentinel service determines if the data under examination matches the signature data thus indicating the presence of decoy data. If the data under examination does not match the signature data execution of the sentinel service proceeds to block . Alternatively if the data under examination does match the signature data in block the sentinel service determines if a specific action is defined for the decoy data detected.

The actions may include for example logging the details about the circumstances of the detected incident quarantining the data associated with the decoy data terminating the process accessing the decoy data and or other possible actions as can be appreciated. The action s taken may depend in part based upon the particular decoy data detected the location of the computing device in which the sentinel service is executing the priority of the computing device in which the sentinel service is executing and or other possible criteria. If no specific action is defined in block the sentinel service may initiate a default action such as for example logging details associated with detection of the decoy data. Alternatively if an action is defined for the decoy data then in block the action may be initiated by the sentinel service 

Next in block the sentinel service may transmit an alert to the threat management service and or other computing device on the network . Then in block the sentinel service determines whether additional data remains to be compared to the signature data . If no further data exists this portion of the execution of the sentinel service ends as shown. This portion of the sentinel service may be reactivated upon receiving additional data to examine and or changes to the signature data . Alternatively if additional data does exist to examine execution of this portion of the sentinel service returns to block .

With reference to shown is a schematic block diagram of the computing device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The computing device includes at least one processor circuit for example having a processor and a memory both of which are coupled to a local interface . To this end the computing device may comprise for example at least one server computer or like device. The local interface may comprise for example a data bus with an accompanying address control bus or other bus structure as can be appreciated.

Stored in the memory are both data and several components that are executable by the processor . In particular stored in the memory and executable by the processor are the marking service the data store manager the application framework the sentinel service and potentially other applications. Also stored in the memory may be a data store and other data. In addition an operating system may be stored in the memory and executable by the processor .

It is understood that there may be other applications that are stored in the memory and are executable by the processors as can be appreciated. Where any component discussed herein is implemented in the form of software any one of a number of programming languages may be employed such as for example C C C Objective C Java Javascript Perl PHP Visual Basic Python Ruby Delphi Flash or other programming languages.

A number of software components are stored in the memory and are executable by the processor . In this respect the term executable means a program file that is in a form that can ultimately be run by the processor . Examples of executable programs may be for example a compiled program that can be translated into machine code in a format that can be loaded into a random access portion of the memory and run by the processor source code that may be expressed in proper format such as object code that is capable of being loaded into a random access portion of the memory and executed by the processor or source code that may be interpreted by another executable program to generate instructions in a random access portion of the memory to be executed by the processor etc. An executable program may be stored in any portion or component of the memory including for example random access memory RAM read only memory ROM hard drive solid state drive USB flash drive memory card optical disc such as compact disc CD or digital versatile disc DVD magnetic tape or other memory components.

The memory is defined herein as including both volatile and nonvolatile memory and data storage components. Volatile components are those that do not retain data values upon loss of power. Nonvolatile components are those that retain data upon a loss of power. Thus the memory may comprise for example random access memory RAM read only memory ROM hard disk drives solid state drives USB flash drives memory cards accessed via a memory card reader optical discs accessed via an optical disc drive magnetic tapes accessed via an appropriate tape drive and or other memory components or a combination of any two or more of these memory components. In addition the RAM may comprise for example static random access memory SRAM dynamic random access memory DRAM or magnetic random access memory MRAM and other such devices. The ROM may comprise for example a programmable read only memory PROM an erasable programmable read only memory EPROM an electrically erasable programmable read only memory EEPROM or other like memory device.

Also the processor may represent multiple processors and the memory may represent multiple memories that operate in parallel processing circuits respectively. In such a case the local interface may be an appropriate network that facilitates communication between any two of the multiple processors between any processor and any of the memories or between any two of the memories etc. The local interface may comprise additional systems designed to coordinate this communication including for example performing load balancing. The processor may be of electrical or of some other available construction.

Although the marking service the data store manager the application framework the sentinel service threat management service and other various systems described herein may be embodied in software or code executed by general purpose hardware as discussed above as an alternative the same may also be embodied in dedicated hardware or a combination of software general purpose hardware and dedicated hardware. If embodied in dedicated hardware each can be implemented as a circuit or state machine that employs any one of or a combination of a number of technologies.
