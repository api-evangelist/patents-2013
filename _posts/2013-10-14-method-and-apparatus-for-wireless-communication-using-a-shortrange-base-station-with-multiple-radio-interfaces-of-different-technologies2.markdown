title: Method and apparatus for wireless communication using a short-range base station with multiple radio interfaces of different technologies
abstract: A method and an apparatus is provided for conducting wireless data communications using whitespace and non-whitespace channels. A short-range base station with an interface for whitespace channels and another interface for non-whitespace channels communicates with user equipment outfitted with equivalent interfaces. The short-range base station has a preference for using the interface for the whitespace channels, where the whitespace channels are whitespace spectrum bands that are available during periods when a primary user is not actively utilizing the whitespace. A spectrum server analyzes spectrum occupancy database information and whitespace spectrum sensing measurements to determine lists of available whitespace spectrum bands for use by the short-range base station.

This application is a non provisional application that claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 714 257 filed on Oct. 16 2012 the entire contents of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This application was made with government support under Contract No. CNS 0831762 by the National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the invention.

Example embodiments relate generally to wireless communication and more particularly to a method and or apparatus for use of a small low power short range base station equipped with radio interfaces operating at least two complementary technologies. The two technologies may include a technology based on underutilized or unused spectrum called whitespace spectrum such as TV whitespace spectrum blocks RADAR spectrum blocks etc. and a non whitespace technology such as the cellular operator s own licensed spectrum technology or spectrum bands that are entirely unlicensed and available to all users .

Spectrum is a scarce resource in wireless communication systems and is considered especially so in wide area cellular data communication networks. For instance in the United States it is anticipated that cellular data traffic volume will reach several exa bytes per month by 2014 1 exa byte 1 million terabytes roughly equaling the traffic volume of the entire global Internet demand in 2006 putting a stress on the limited available spectrum.

Besides improving the underlying technologies for wireless communication to relieve the strain on spectrum two popular approaches to address this challenge include 1 enabling greater spatial re use through deployment of many low power short range mini base stations sometimes called small cells due to their short range coverage area such as indoor femto cells or outdoor micro pico cells and 2 perform cellular traffic offloading to unlicensed spectrum bands such as WiFi access points . However the use of mini base stations using licensed spectrum bands may cause regular interference with existing full sized base stations deployed outdoors often called macro cells and the use of conventional unlicensed spectrum bands such as 2.4 GHz ISM and 5.8 GHz U NII bands do not generally offer a reliable source of capacity.

As demand for new spectrum to increase wireless capacity to meet traffic growth increases new spectrum bands called whitespace spectrum are being considered by the regulatory bodies such as the Federal Communication Commission FCC . An example of such spectrum bands is the DTV whitespace recently made available by FCC guidelines for opportunistic use in specific scenarios. In the United States TV whitespace often refers to unused portions of TV broadcast spectrum specifically lower VHF channels 2 6 54 88 MHz upper VHF channels 7 13 174 216 MHz and UHF channels 14 51 470 698 MHz with the exception of channel 37 which is reserved for radio astronomy. Whitespace is allocated to a primary user such as a digital DTV broadcaster a public safety agency a municipality or government or an organization or a facility owner with wireless microphones for instance . While this whitespace spectrum is generally utilized by the primary user to broadcast TV channels or broadcast sounds using wireless microphones some or all of the spectrum may remain unused or under utilized for varying periods of time. FCC guidelines now allow a secondary user to use this whitespace on a do no harm basis as secondary users may use the whitespace assuming their use does not interfere with the primary user. Therefore wireless communication service providers may utilize the whitespace spectrum as secondary users. In particular whitespace may be utilized by wireless communication service providers secondary users under three scenarios 1 a whitespace band may be unlicensed to secondary users meaning that any secondary user may use the band as a secondary user 2 a whitespace band may be exclusively licensed to a secondary user meaning that only one specifically identified secondary user may use the band as a secondary user or 3 a whitespace band may be lightly licensed meaning that a restricted number of unidentified secondary users or a small number of specifically identified secondary users may use the band as a secondary user. To that end the FCC has mandated that unlicensed devices be able to either detect the presence of TV stations with a received signal strength as low as 114 dBm and wireless microphones with a received signal strength as low as 126 dBm or have the capability to contact a TV spectrum occupancy database so the unlicensed user may know to vacate the band if a primary user is detected in order to guarantee the primary user s use of the spectrum.

Other examples of whitespace spectrum are spectrum bands used by United States Federal Government systems for example 3550 3700 MHz used by Naval Radars .

Example embodiments provide a method and or an apparatus for use of a low power short range base station capable of switching between at least two radio interfaces operating under different technologies and spectrum bands. Specifically the base station may include an interface providing a whitespace spectrum such as a TV whitespace spectrum and another interface using non whitespace spectrum. The base station may primarily use the whitespace spectrum for data communications while relying upon non whitespace spectrum for control signaling and stop gap data communications when the whitespace spectrum is disrupted degraded or not immediately available .

At least one example embodiment relates to a method of wireless communication using whitespace channels including exchanging at a short range base station data communications with a user equipment on a first whitespace channel determining at the short range base station whether the first whitespace channel will be lost and switching at the short range base station the data communications to a second whitespace channel if the determining step indicates that the first whitespace channel will be lost the first and second whitespace channels being channels that are licensed to a primary user and utilized by a wireless communication service provider as a secondary user.

At least another example embodiment relates to a short range base station including a first radio interface configured to carry a non whitespace channel a second radio interface configured to carry a first whitespace channel and a processor configured to control the base station to exchange data communications with a user equipment on the first whitespace channel determine whether the first whitespace channel will be lost and switch the data communications to a second whitespace channel if it is determined that the first whitespace channel will be lost wherein the first and second whitespace channels are channels that are licensed to a primary user and utilized by a wireless communication service provider as secondary user wherein the non whitespace channel is a channel that is exclusively licensed to a wireless communication service provider and unlicensed to all users.

At least another example embodiment relates a method of wireless communication using whitespace and non whitespace channels comprising sending at a user equipment a connection request to a short range base station on a non whitespace channel via a first interface on the user equipment exchanging at the user equipment data communications with the short range base station on a first whitespace channel via a second interface on the user equipment receiving at the user equipment a switch channel request from the short range base station on the non whitespace channel and switching at the user equipment data communications to a second whitespace channel based on the switch channel request wherein the first and second whitespace channels are channels that are licensed to a primary user and utilized by a wireless communication service provider as secondary user wherein the non whitespace channel is a channel that is exclusively licensed to a wireless communication service provider and unlicensed to all users.

At least another example embodiment relates a method of analyzing whitespace spectrum including checking at a spectrum server a spectrum occupancy database for available whitespace spectrum band information within a whitespace spectrum generating at the spectrum server a list of the available whitespace spectrum bands based on the available whitespace spectrum band information and transmitting at the spectrum server the list of the available whitespace spectrum bands to at least one short range base station.

Similarly the transmission medium may be twisted wire pairs coaxial cable optical fiber or some other suitable transmission medium known to the art. The example embodiments not limited by these aspects of any given implementation.

At least one of the radio interfaces of the base stations may provide communication channels of non whitespace channels which are channels that are either exclusively licensed to a cellular operator or channels that are unlicensed to all users and available for use by any user . This interface may be considered a stable interface. The channels of licensed spectrum technology may also be used by a conventional macro cell that provides the cellular operator s network to a wide coverage area . At least another one of the radio interfaces of the base stations may provide communication channels of whitespace spectrum technology as described in more detail herein . This interface may be considered a whitespace interface. 

User equipment UE may connect to a short range base station using a bonded wireless link spanning both spectrum blocks and technologies in order to be able to communicate with the short range base station . The base stations maintain backhaul data connectivity to the cellular operator s network via common broadband services that are conventionally available such as DSL cable modem fiber etc. where the base station may for instance connect to the network via an in home router

As described herein in more detail the spectrum server may compile and analyze whitespace spectrum sensing measurements taken from the base stations . The spectrum server may also have the capability to access a TV spectrum occupancy database to obtain coarse timescale information about available whitespace channels also described herein .

The information derived from the whitespace sensing of the base stations may be in the form of a localized measurement radio environment LMRE at various time instances T T etc. that includes snap shots over a period of time and at regular time increments where this information is then sent through the network backhaul to the spectrum server for actual whitespace assignment. Spectrum server may construct a spatial map of the whitespace spectrum over a particular geographic region using the LMRE information.

The base station may interface with a user equipment The user equipment may include a processor that controls the user equipment . A virtual interface controls routes a flow of communication between interfaces described below and a TCP IP layer where the TCP IP layer communicates with an application layer .

The goal of the base station configuration is to maximize use of the whitespace interface using channels of whitespace spectrum technology . This is because use of this interface may offer larger capacity data communication demands as compared to the conventional licensed spectrum channels which are exclusively licensed to a wireless communication service provider while also ensuring that the base station does not directly interfere with conventional macro cells as shown in . However disadvantages to the use of the whitespace interface include the fact that the whitespace spectrum may be overtaken by a primary user at any time and shared use of an available whitespace channel i.e. a channel that is unused by the primary user by an overpopulation of secondary users may cause the channel to become degraded. Therefore to combat these unreliable aspects of the whitespace spectrum the stable interface using non whitespace channels which are channels that are not whitespace channels may be utilized as a stop gap communication link when the whitespace interface is not operational due to a lack of viable usable whitespace spectrum and an appropriate alternate whitespace channel is searched. The stable interface may also be used as a reliable means of sending and receiving control signals to and from the service providers network and spectrum server while data payload may mainly be transferred via the whitespace interface .

Each interface of base station is configured to communicate with a respective whitespace interface using whitespace spectrum and stable interface using a conventional channel that is exclusively licensed to a wireless communication service provider or a channel that is entirely unlicensed and available to all users of the UE . The interaction between base station and UE is described in more detail in the discussion of below.

In step S UE may send a connection request in the form of a beacon or a succession of beacons to base station . In step S base station may respond by sending a request grant S to UE . The request grant S may include the identity of a currently available whitespace channel or channels which may vary in width generally in bands that are between 5 MHz and 20 MHz that may be utilized by UE and base station . The identity of the currently available whitespace channel or channels which is included the request grant S may have been previously obtained by base station from spectrum server as described in the detailed example below. In step S payload data communications may then be freely exchanged between base station and UE until a primary user is detected as described below. It should be noted that the connection request S and request grant S along with all other control signaling may preferably occur via stable interfaces . The connection request S and request grant S may also include authentication information that authenticates UE for use with base station .

In step S the base station becomes aware that a primary user will imminently be accessing the whitespace channel it is using or the channel is degraded due to excessive secondary devices. This awareness may arise from available channel list information that may periodically be sent from the spectrum server to the base station indicating the imminent return of the primary user or change in ranking of spectrum channel due to increased secondary user activity. In these cases the base station may actively disconnect the whitespace channel from UE and work with spectrum server to locate another whitespace channel. Because finding an efficient alternative whitespace channel may potentially take on order of tens of seconds sometimes 60 120 seconds depending on interference parameters and the availability of whitespace bands especially in highly populated areas where whitespace is a premium base station switches to the stable interface during this search for a new whitespace band as described herein. Switching to the stable interface also affords the base station and or spectrum server more time to thoroughly measure and identify a new whitespace band.

Following step S base station may send a switch channel message S to UE to instruct UE to switch to the stable interface in order to rely upon non whitespace channels for future data communications until another whitespace channel may be obtained which may take as many as 60 120 seconds during periods of high interference for instance . Therefore in step S the base station and UE continue uninterrupted payload data communications though this communication in step S now occurs over a non whitespace channel which may be considered a stop gap communication link during a period when the base station searches for a new whitespace band . In the event that the UE does not receive the switch channel message S the base station disconnects the UE in which case the UE automatically resorts to using the stable interface to reconnect to the base station.

Following step S base station also sends an available whitespace channel list request S to spectrum server which may be sent at approximately the same time as the switch channel message S . The available whitespace channel list request S is received by spectrum server whereupon spectrum server transmits an available whitespace channel list S to base station based upon information the spectrum server is in possession of at the time. This available whitespace channel list S may be in the form of an actual whitespace channel assignment providing base station with the identity of a whitespace channel that may be used by UE . Or the available whitespace channel list S may be in the form of an actual listing of possible whitespace channels that may be further probed by the base station .

If spectrum server provides a listing of available whitespace channels S rather than the identity of one lone whitespace channel for UE use base station may undergo whitespace sensing in step S . This whitespace sensing S may involve sensing one or more whitespace channel bands based upon a restricted list of whitespace channels which may be provided via the available whitespace channel list S . Optionally but not preferably base station may simply search all known whitespace spectrum independently of any input from spectrum server during the whitespace sensing S in which case the available whitespace channel list request S and available whitespace channel list S need not be exchanged between base station and spectrum server .

In step S base station sends a switch to whitespace message to UE with the identity of an available whitespace band that is to be utilized in future data communications. Therefore in step S the base station and UE continue uninterrupted payload data communications though this communication in step S now occurs over a new whitespace channel.

It should be understood that spectrum sensing performed in step S of is not a required step of the embodiment. Because spectrum server may access a publicly available TV spectrum occupancy database mandated by the FCC spectrum server may obtain information on available whitespace spectrum without relying on spectrum sensing. However the TV spectrum occupancy database is based on 1 computations that use propagation models and 2 information available on a coarse timescale where spectrum availability is collected and reported using information that is updated every few hours or updated as infrequently as every 48 hours pertaining to primary users i.e. TV and microphone transmitters . Therefore the TV spectrum occupancy database is not entirely accurate at measuring available whitespace. Additionally the TV spectrum occupancy database does not account for any secondary user use of whitespace bands. Therefore even if the TV spectrum occupancy database indicates available bands of whitespace these bands may have already become overpopulated by secondary users prior to or during the time that base station accesses these available bands. For these reasons spectrum sensing conducted by base station and described in step S above provides valuable real time data on available whitespace bands that also accounts for secondary user use of the bands. It should also be understood that the embodiment of may rely solely on spectrum sensing as described in step S without the spectrum server obtaining any information from the TV spectrum occupancy database. Also the spectrum server may use both the TV spectrum occupancy database information as spectrum server may obtain this information to narrow the list of potential whitespace channel bands based upon the coarse timescale information included in the database and spectrum sensing so that base station may obtain more accurate real time data that also accounts for secondary user use of whitespace bands .

The spectrum sensing information collected by the base station can include a multitude of measurements such as a energy spectrograms b cyclostationary spectrogram features c local estimates of channel availability e.g. coded in form of 0 available 1 occupied fraction f probability of occupancy .

While embodiments may rely on both the TV spectrum occupancy database information and spectrum sensing embodiments may also have the spectrum server and base station obtain this information at regular intervals of time both before and during the base stations use of the whitespace interface . Embodiments may also exchange this information between the spectrum server and base station on a regular basis. This is to ensure that the base station possesses the most accurate information on available whitespace at any period of time. A benefit of conducting these regular exchanges of information includes the base station being prepared for a connection request S see by a new UE at any time thus ensuring that base station may immediately respond to the connection request S by sending a request grant S with the identity of an available whitespace channel as the alternative to sending a request grant S for a whitespace channel would be to send a grant that begins data communication only on the stable interface which is not preferable . Another benefit of conducting these regular exchanges of information includes reducing time period in which the base station and spectrum server may react to the loss of an initial whitespace band in the event a primary user returns to the band thus reducing a time that would otherwise be required to conduct steps S S and S . These benefits of the spectrum server regularly accessing the TV spectrum occupancy database and the base station regularly conducting spectrum sensing with spectrum server and base station regularly sharing this information may of course be weighed against power usage requirements associated with obtaining this information in order to arrive at a balance between power usage and the benefits of possessing accurate real time information on whitespace availability.

Sensing of the whitespace spectrum may be accomplished during periods when the base station is idle or not transmitting on the whitespace interface . If sensing is accomplished collaboratively with the help of other base stations the sensing may be performed by two or more base stations transmitting simultaneously on a same whitespace channel and measuring a fractional increase in error rate due to a particular user in order to estimate channel quality. Using such a pairwise error the spectrum server may incrementally build a conflict graph to determine a degree of interference from various base stations from the perspective of one particular base station . This allows spectrum server to suggest multiple candidate channels with an expected quality for a particular base station while accounting for the particular base stations own geographic area and transmit power for a given instance in time such that the particular base station may then focus on these candidate channels in order to conduct more in depth whitespace sensing. If sensing is accomplished individually i.e. through the investigation of a single base station operating independently of other base stations the sensing may also be accomplished by transmitting on a particular whitespace channel to measure parameters such as packet error rates on the particular whitespace channel.

A frequency of collecting measurements with spectrum server collecting TV spectrum occupancy database information and analyzing spectrum sensing information from base station may also be customized based on properties of primary users. For example TV station broadcasts can for all practical purposes be assumed to always be present. Meanwhile wireless microphones another source of whitespace spectrum may generally be expected to be transient. Therefore machine learning techniques which may be incorporated into spectrum server or base station for instance may learn the operational patterns of primary users to tailor the frequency of running whitespace spectrum detection.

The actual selection of a whitespace channel for use which may be accomplished via the spectrum server making the selection or the base station making the selection may rely on any appropriate method. Three example methods are described below.

The base station and or spectrum server may pick a random set of whitespace channels conduct measurements and select the best channel among the random set.

The base station and or spectrum server may pick a set of recently observed good channels and conduct new measurements to pick the best channel from among this list.

The spectrum server may specify an initial set of candidate channels and the base station then may measure to select the best channel among these choices that may offer the least interference.

Alternative to the base station becoming aware that a primary user will imminently be accessing the whitespace band currently utilized by UE step S of the base station may simply become aware that the whitespace band being used by base station has failed or is failing due to interference a dip in quality of the channel below a threshold quality level or for other unknown reasons . In response to such an event the method of may still proceed by having base station send a switch channel message S to UE and an available whitespace channel list request S to spectrum server thereby prompting UE to switch to the stable interface and prompting spectrum server and base station to seek a new whitespace band.

It should also be understood that whitespace sensing conducted in step S of by base station may include the base station regularly seeking channel error input information from UE in the event that UE is actively using the whitespace channel of interest as well as other sensing measurements such as energy spectrograms. Or base station may collaborate with other base stations that may also be interfacing with other UEs to obtain whitespace channel information on channels of interest. Likewise spectrum server may collaborate with other spectrum servers or other base stations in order to obtain accurate real time information on whitespace channels that may be used to then reduce a list of viable whitespace channels for further investigation and analysis prior to sending the available whitespace channel list step S of to base station . Both the spectrum server and base station may also rely upon past channel information data in order to maintain and or update future lists of viable whitespace channels.

The embodiment of was also described above via a working example involving a single spectrum server a single base station and a single UE . However example embodiments are not limited to this configuration as a system may involve a plurality of each of these three elements. In embodiments with multiple UEs being served by a base station a loss of a whitespace channel due to the return of a primary user or for other channel quality reasons may be handled by the base station only switching a single UE that is using the lost whitespace channel to the stable interface as shown in step S . Or alternatively the base station may instead switch some or all UEs to the stable interface even those UEs that are not currently experiencing whitespace channel issues . It should also be understood that a UE rather than base station may first detect a drop in whitespace channel quality in which case the UE may send a whitespace channel quality error message to the base station. This would then prompt the base station to become aware that the base station should switch to stable interface i.e. the whitespace channel quality error message would precede step S of .

In the absence of a macro cell base station using a licensed channel or in addition to use of a macro cell such that at least three radio interfaces may be used WiFi radio channels may be used as a stable interface or as a second option for a stable interface .

Alternatively to the method described by both interfaces the stable interface and whitespace interface may be used simultaneously to carry payload data communications to UE as opposed to the interfaces each trading off this task. Likewise both interfaces may be used simultaneously to carry control signaling messages.

Example embodiments having thus been described it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the intended spirit and scope of example embodiments and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.
