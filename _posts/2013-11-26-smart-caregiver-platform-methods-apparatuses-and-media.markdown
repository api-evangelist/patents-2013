Applicant hereby claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 to U.S. provisional patent application No. 61 730 121 filed Nov. 27 2012 entitled SMART CAREGIVER PLATFORM METHODS APPARATUSES AND MEDIA .

The entire contents of the aforementioned applications are herein expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety.

This disclosure describes SMART CAREGIVER PLATFORM METHODS APPARATUSES AND MEDIA hereinafter SCGP . A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright and or mask work protection. The copyright and or mask work owners have no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records but otherwise reserve all copyright and mask work rights whatsoever.

People with memory problems may sometimes e.g. when rushing to leave for work in the morning have difficulty remembering to take important items e.g. their medicine with them and or may leave behind items they bring with them. Furthermore people with memory problems may sometimes e.g. when it is dark and difficult to see have difficulty remembering how to get to various destinations e.g. from a grocery store to home and or may forget where they are going and may wander aimlessly. While many people with memory problems can live independently these difficulties may make it harder for them to do so and are of concern to their caregivers.

The SCGP helps people with memory problems lead a safe and more independent life while providing peace of mind for their caregivers e.g. family members healthcare professionals . The SCGP may accomplish this by creating direct communication between people with disabilities e.g. Autism ADHD and vision problem and their caregivers via an SCGP mobile app. None of the products currently in the market has a solution to directly connect people with memory problem to their caregivers. As a result the caregivers have to spend too much time taking care and staying informed about their loved one s condition.

The SCGP mobile app may be installed on smart phones of the caregiver and of the user with memory problems. The person with memory problems may also receive a smart bracelet a smart pillbox smart tags and or the like. For example the smart bracelet may include a personal help button a fall detector and a communication sensor. In one embodiment the SCGP may remind the user with memory problems to take his personal belongings with him and may give the user a warning if he leaves his smart phone or other items behind. The SCGP may also notify the caregiver if the user loses any of these items and may generate reports e.g. via text charts graphs showing the caregiver situations in which the user is likely to lose items. In another embodiment the SCGP may provide a smart location guide e.g. via GPS to help keep the user from wandering off and getting lost. The SCGP may help the user travel independently via bus car and on foot. The SCGP may also notify the caregiver if the user wanders off or gets lost and may generate reports e.g. via text charts graphs showing the caregiver situations in which the user is likely to wander off or get lost. In yet another embodiment the SCGP may facilitate staying in touch with the user by allowing the caregiver to send the user reminders and important information and to share pictures videos text messages and voice messages with the user.

In another embodiment the user may wish to go from the park to home. The SCGP may be configured to help the user navigate if the user is lost and or wandering. Accordingly if the SCGP detects that the user is not taking an approved route between approved locations e.g. the direct route between home and the park the SCGP may alert the user that the user is lost and or wondering and or may provide the user with turn by turn navigation directions to the user s home via the user s client. If the user does not follow the directions the SCGP may alert the caregivers. The caregiver may utilize the SCGP to track the user s current location via the caregiver s client and or to help the user get home. For example the caregiver may call the user and provide the user with directions home while tracking whether the user is following the caregiver s directions.

In one embodiment the SAP request may be a request to add a new SAP entry. For example a caregiver and or a user overseen by the caregiver may wish the caregiver and or the user to be notified if the user forgets to take an umbrella. The caregiver and or the user may attach a smart tag e.g. a smart tag utilizing Bluetooth low energy BLE technology to the umbrella and add a SAP entry that facilitates detecting whether the umbrella was lost and or forgotten. In various implementations the smart tag may have a small size low power consumption rechargeable battery and or the like. The proximity of the umbrella to the user may be tracked by calculating the distance between the smart tag and a tracking device e.g. a smart bracelet with a BLE communication sensor worn by the user the user s smart phone with a BLE communication sensor .

Conditions associated with the SAP entry may be obtained at . For example the caregiver may specify that the umbrella should be considered to be forgotten if the user leaves the umbrella at home on a rainy day. In another example the caregiver may specify that the user s smart phone should be considered to be forgotten if it is not within twenty feet of the user s smart bracelet. In yet another example the caregiver may specify that the user may be considered to have forgotten to take his medicine if the user does not open his smart pillbox during a specified time e.g. between 3pm and 4pm . In various implementations conditions may include weather temperature geographic location and or direction of travel distance from item time of day date and or time day of the week month season and or the like. For example the conditions may be obtained from the Conditions field of the SAP request.

The SAP entry may be added to the list of SAP entries at . For example the name of the item e.g. umbrella the identifier of the smart tag associated with the umbrella conditions associated with detecting that the umbrella was lost and or forgotten and or the like may be added to the SAP Entries data store using one or more SQL queries substantially in the following form 

In another embodiment the SAP request may be a notification by the SCGP that a condition of a SAP entry has been triggered. In one implementation this may be detected by periodically checking conditions of entries in the SAP Entries data store . For example the SCGP may detect that the smart tag associated with the umbrella is too far away from the user s smart bracelet and or smart phone on a rainy day. In another example the SCGP may detect that the user s smart phone is too far away from the user s smart bracelet. In yet another example the SCGP may detect that the caregiver set a calendar entry to remind e.g. via an audio message a video message a picture message a text message the user to take his medicine at this time. In yet another example the user may be provided with a smart pillbox which may automatically detect if the user forgets to take his medicine e.g. based on whether the smart pillbox was opened during a specified time range .

A reminder for the user may be produced at . For example a reminder e.g. an audio message such as a beep a notification on the screen of the user s smart phone via an SCGP app a notification on the screen of the user s smart bracelet such as a smart watch via an SCGP app may be produced for the user to remind the user to retrieve the forgotten item e.g. the umbrella the user s medicine . In another example the smart pillbox may communicate with the user s smart bracelet and or smart phone e.g. via BLE to instruct the user s smart bracelet and or smart phone to produce a reminder for the user to take his medicine.

A determination may be made at whether the user retrieves the forgotten item. For example if the user returns to within a specified distance of the item and or opens the smart pillbox to take his medicine and or acknowledges the reminder e.g. by pressing an OK button displayed by the SCGP app the SCGP may conclude that the user retrieved the item. Otherwise the SCGP may conclude that the user did not retrieve the item. In some implementations the user may be given a specified time period e.g. thirty seconds five minutes during which the user may retrieve the item. If the user does not retrieve the item within the specified time period the SCGP may conclude that the user did not retrieve the item. In some implementations the SCGP may consider the user s movement during this determination. For example if the SCGP determines e.g. using the GPS of the user s smart phone that the user is moving toward the item the SCGP may conclude that the user retrieved the item and or may give the user additional time to retrieve the item. Otherwise the SCGP may conclude that the user did not retrieve the item.

If the SCGP determines that the user retrieved the item the SCGP may avoid notifying the caregiver regarding the incident at . If the SCGP determines that the user did not retrieve the item the SCGP may notify the caregiver regarding the incident at . For example the SCGP may send an alert to the caregiver s smart phone. In some implementations the alert may include the location of the forgotten item and or the location of the user and or the SCGP may facilitate tracking of the forgotten item and or tracking of the user.

The SCGP may log the occurrence of the incident at . For example the information associated with the incident e.g. the identifier of the forgotten item the identifier of the associated smart tag the identifier of the smart pillbox conditions associated with the incident whether the user retrieved the item may be added to the SAP Logs data store . In some implementations the SCGP may utilize such information to provide the caregiver with useful reports. For example such reports may facilitate understanding when the user is likely to lose and or forget items e.g. during cold hot rainy weather during a particular time of day when performing certain activities in particular locations .

The client may send a request to add the SAP entry to a SCGP server . For example the add SAP entry request may be in XML format and may include data such as the caregiver s username and or password an entry type information associated with an item conditions associated with the SAP entry the date and or time of the request and or the like. In one implementation the add SAP entry request may be in XML format substantially in the following form 

The SCGP server may send a request to update SAP entries to the client e.g. a smart phone a smart bracelet of the user with memory problems . For example the SAP entries update request may be in XML format and may include data such as an entry type information associated with an item conditions associated with the SAP entry and or the like. In one implementation the SAP entries update request may be in XML format substantially in the following form 

In one embodiment the user s smart bracelet may communicate with a smart tag associated with the user s item such as an umbrella to determine the status of the item. In one implementation the smart bracelet may periodically send a SAP item check request to the smart tag. For example the SAP item check request may include the identifier of the smart bracelet the identifier of the smart tag and or the like and may prompt the smart tag to confirm that it is within range via a SAP item check response . In one implementation the SAP item check request may be in XML format substantially in the following form 

For example the SAP item check response may include the identifier of the smart bracelet may include the identifier of the smart tag may be analyzed e.g. based on the strength of the signal to determine the distance between the smart bracelet and the smart tag may include data such as the smart tag s battery power indicator e.g. OK low percentage of batter power remaining and or the like. In one implementation the SAP item check response may be in XML format substantially in the following form 

The smart bracelet may provide a SAP item status to the user s client. For example the SAP item status may include data such as the item s name the item s smart tag identifier the smart tag s signal strength the smart tag s power indicator and or the like. In one implementation the SAP item status may be in XML format substantially in the following form 

The user s client may periodically analyze SAP entries conditions based on statuses of items associated with SAP entries to determine whether a condition indicating that an item has been lost and or forgotten has been triggered. For example SAP entries conditions may include weather temperature geographic location and or direction of travel distance from item time of day date and or time day of the week month season and or the like. Data regarding such conditions may be obtained based on statuses of SAP items based on the client s sensor readings e.g. current temperature based on information from third party providers e.g. predicted weather and or the like.

If the SCGP concludes that such a condition has been triggered a SAP reminder output may be provided to the user. For example the SAP reminder output may be an audio beep and a textual message informing the user which item e.g. umbrella has been lost and or forgotten. In another example the SAP reminder output may be a video message from the caregiver e.g. reminding the user to take his medicine before heading to an adult day care center .

An SAP notification may be sent to the SCGP server to inform the SCGP server regarding the incident. For example the SAP notification may be in XML format and may include data such as the identifier of the forgotten item the identifier of the associated smart tag the identifier of the smart pillbox conditions associated with the incident whether the user retrieved the item and or the like. In one implementation the SAP notification may be in XML format substantially in the following form 

The SCGP server may send a SAP alert to the caregiver s client. The SAP alert may be in XML format and may include data such as the identifier of the forgotten item the identifier of the associated smart tag the identifier of the smart pillbox conditions associated with the incident whether the user retrieved the item and or the like. In one implementation the SAP alert may be in XML format substantially in the following form 

In one embodiment the SWA request may be a request to add a new SWA entry. For example a caregiver and or a user overseen by the caregiver may wish the caregiver to be notified if the user is wandering. The caregiver and or the user may specify approved locations and if the user moves outside the approved locations the SCGP may consider the user to be wandering.

Approved locations associated with the SWA entry may be obtained at . For example the caregiver may specify that the user should be considered to be wandering if the user is not at one of the approved locations and or travelling between approved locations e.g. via an approved route . In another example the caregiver may specify that the user should be considered to be wandering if the user is outside a designated safe area. In yet another example the caregiver may specify that the user should be considered to be lost if the user is travelling erratically e.g. wandering in circles . In various implementations the caregiver may specify that locations are approved and or not approved depending on conditions such as weather temperature geographic location and or direction of travel time of day date and or time day of the week month season and or the like. For example approved locations data may be obtained from the Locations field of the SWA request.

The SWA entry may be added to the list of SWA entries at . For example identifiers of approved and or not approved locations geographic coordinates and or boundaries of approved and or not approved locations conditions associated with approved and or not approved locations and or the like may be added to the SWA Entries data store using one or more SQL queries substantially in the following form 

In another embodiment the SWA request may be a notification by the SCGP that the user is wandering. For example the SCGP may detect e.g. via a GPS of the client of the user with memory problems that the user is heading outside during a snowstorm. The user s designated safe area during a snowstorm may be limited to the user s residence. Accordingly if the user is heading outside during a snowstorm the SCGP may detect that the user is wandering. In one implementation this may be detected by periodically checking approved locations data of entries in the SWA Entries data store with regard to the user s current location and or bearing.

An alert for the user may be produced at . For example an alert e.g. an audio message such as a beep a notification on the screen of the user s smart phone via an SCGP app a notification on the screen of the user s smart bracelet such as a smart watch via an SCGP app may be produced for the user to inform the user that he is wandering. Directions may be recommended to the user at to help the user return to an approved location e.g. to the closest approved location . For example directions may be provided via a map application component e.g. utilizing Google Maps API .

A determination may be made at whether the user follows the recommended directions. For example if the user returns to a recommended approved location and or acknowledges the alert e.g. by pressing an OK button displayed by the SCGP app the SCGP may conclude that the user followed the recommended directions. Otherwise the SCGP may conclude that the user did not follow the recommended directions. In some implementations the user may be given a specified time period e.g. thirty seconds five minutes during which the user may return to the approved location. If the user does not return to the approved within the specified time period the SCGP may conclude that the user did not follow the recommended directions. In some implementations the SCGP may consider the user s movement during this determination. For example if the SCGP determines e.g. using the GPS of the user s smart phone that the user is moving toward the approved location the SCGP may conclude that the user followed the recommended directions and or may give the user additional time to return to the approved location. Otherwise the SCGP may conclude that the user did not follow the recommended directions.

If the SCGP determines that the user followed the recommended directions and or returned to the approved location the SCGP may avoid notifying the caregiver regarding the incident at . If the SCGP determines that the user did not follow the recommended directions and or did not return to the approved location the SCGP may notify the caregiver regarding the incident at .

In one implementation the approved locations update request may be in XML format substantially in the following form 

The SCGP may periodically determine location data associated with the user. For example the SCGP may utilize the GPS of the user s client to determine the user s geographic location and or direction of travel. The user s client may periodically analyze approved locations data with respect to the location data to determine whether a condition indicating that the user is lost and or wandering has been triggered. For example approved locations data may include geographic coordinates and or boundaries of approved and or not approved locations conditions associated with approved and or not approved locations and or the like. Data regarding such conditions may be obtained based on the client s sensor readings e.g. current temperature based on information from third party providers e.g. predicted weather and or the like.

If the SCGP concludes that such a condition signifying that the user is lost and or wandering has been triggered a directions output may be provided to the user. For example the directions output may be an audio beep and or a vibrating alarm and a textual message informing the user that the user seems to be lost and or wandering and directions to the nearest approved location e.g. provided via a map application component .

An SWA notification may be sent to the SCGP server to inform the SCGP server regarding the incident. For example the SWA notification may be in XML format and may include data such as the identifier of the approved location that the user left conditions associated with the incident whether the user followed the directions and or returned to the approved location and or the like. In one implementation the SWA notification may be in XML format substantially in the following form 

The SCGP server may send a SWA alert to the caregiver s client. The SWA alert may be in XML format and may include data such as the identifier of the approved location that the user left conditions associated with the incident whether the user followed the directions and or returned to the approved location and or the like.
