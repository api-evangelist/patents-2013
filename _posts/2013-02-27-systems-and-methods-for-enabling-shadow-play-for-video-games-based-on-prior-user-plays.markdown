This application claims the benefit of and priority to under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 746 401 filed on Dec. 27 2012 and titled Systems and Methods for Enabling Shadow Play for Video Games Based on Prior User Plays which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to systems and methods for enabling play of video games in a game cloud executed system.

Cloud systems using computing resources hardware and software deliver services over a network typically the Internet . The services in the context of gaming enable streaming of content to remote clients wherein most processing is done on servers which may be distributed. Input provided at the remote clients will in turn drive execution of the game without the need for dedicated gaming hardware at the client s location. Cloud gaming therefore has been increasing in popularity because users find it easier to access more titles without complex hardware restrictions and game suppliers find it easier manage game code from centralized locations.

Embodiments of the present invention relate to systems and methods for playing a video game over an online network. In particular the video game is executed by a game cloud system. In one configuration the game play will allow users to play using a shadow mode. As will be described below in greater detail a shadow mode will enable users to follow actions paths operations or along a game sequence taken by an earlier play by another of the game. Several inventive embodiments of the present invention are described below.

In one embodiment a method for playing a video game executed by a game cloud system is disclosed. The disclosed method includes generating a user interface for displaying game interactivity for playing the video game. The user interface includes controls for selecting a mode of play that includes a shadow mode. The method further includes detecting game play of the video game by a current user and identifying one or more previous plays of the video game by other users. After one of the other users is selected to be used in the shadow mode for a set period of time the shadow mode is enabled for the selected other user such that an image of the object controlled by the selected other user along a game sequence that is to be played by the current user of the video game is displayed. The disclosed method is executed by a processor.

In another embodiment a computer readable non transitory storage media having program instructions for playing a video game executed by a game cloud system over an online network is disclosed. The computer readable non transitory storage media includes program instructions for generating a user interface for displaying game interactivity for playing the video game. The user interface includes controls for selecting a mode of play that includes a shadow mode. The computer readable non transitory storage media further includes program instructions for detecting game play of the video game by a current user and program instructions for identifying one or more previous plays of the video game by other users. The computer readable non transitory storage media also includes program instructions for receiving selection from the current user identifying one other user to be used in the shadow mode and program instructions for enabling the shadow mode for the other user for a set period of time such that an image of the object controlled by the selected other user along a game sequence that is to be played by the current user of the video game is displayed.

Other aspects of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.

The following embodiments describe systems and methods for playing a video game executed by a game cloud system over an online network. The game cloud system may provide access and selection of a plurality of video games and each video game has particular characteristics. The characteristics of each video game define the type of game sequences that must be taken to play the game. For example a battle game may require moving characters around a scene to accomplish tasks a driving game may require moving a vehicle around a track or obstacles a board game may require moving game pieces to different locations at different times etc. Further the video games played may be either full video game titles or mini games defined from part of a full video game. When a user decides to play a video game the user will be provide with an option to play the game in shadow mode. Shadow mode is a function that enables game play in a form that enables following tracking or seeing what another player did during their game play while the user plays the game. The earlier game play may be shown as an overlay graphic integrated graphics tracks shadows semi transparent or fully rendered moving objects e.g. characters game pieces game objects etc. etc. Providing the shadow mode may enable a user to follow partially follow or see the earlier play during the play session of the user.

In one embodiment the shadow mode of a game play may include a follow shadow mode play and a pause shadow mode play. During the follow shadow mode play the object of the video game controlled by the current user is enabled to move behind the shadow form of the object of a selected prior user while the current user is playing the video game. The follow shadow mode includes settings for defining a follow separation that defines a time gap between the actions performed by the selected prior user in the prior game play to move the image of the object of the video game in a shadow form along the game sequence and the actions to be performed by the current user to move the image of the object of the video game along the game sequence. The game sequence is defined by characteristics of the video game.

In another embodiment during the pause shadow mode play the object of the video game controlled by the current user is paused during a defined time gap. During the time gap the shadow form of the object is shown progressing between a beginning point of a pause separation to an ending point of the pause separation. The pause separation is defined by a time gap between the actions performed by a selected prior user to move the image of the object of the video game in a shadow form along the game sequence during the prior game play and the actions to be performed by the current user to move the image of the object of the video game along the game sequence.

The game play in one embodiment is via a cloud based processing system that enables streaming of online game play while allowing users to provide interactive input from remote locations that are connected to the internet. In one embodiment method for defining mini games is provided. For example while the user plays the game a video recording of the game is created showing the game play activity from the game play session. In one embodiment a user is allowed to select a portion of the video recording. The selection of the portion of the video recording is used in one embodiment to define the portion of the mini game that is to be created. The user defined mini game will therefore be a segment or part of the full game with a defined start and end point as defined by the user. In one embodiment the segment may have all of the features of the full game and in other embodiments less features objects controls etc. than the full game has. In one embodiment the user defines the start and end points by selecting the start and end points in the video recording.

It will be obvious however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.

In one embodiment game cloud system includes a game execution engine a recording engine a mini game processor a tag processor a user processor a title index engine a game session manager user access logic a network interface and a social connection manager . Game cloud system may further include a plurality of gaming storage systems such as a game state store a game code store a recorded game store a tag data store a game title store and a game network user store . In one embodiment game cloud system is a system that can provide game applications services gaming related digital content and interconnectivity among systems applications users and social networks. Game cloud system may communicate with user device and social media providers via network interface that will enable wired and wireless communication methods. In one embodiment each social media provider includes at least one social graph that shows social network user interconnections.

In one embodiment a social media provider can be the game cloud system itself whereby user relationships are managed without the need for external social media providers . In still other embodiments the system can operate as a hybrid system wherein social relationships are managed using social graph data from third party social media providers via API interface accesses or the like and user relationships with other users as defined by the game cloud system.

In one embodiment a user e.g. user U can access the services provided by game cloud system and social media providers by way of user device . User device can include any type of device having a processor and memory wired or wireless portable or not portable. User device which is shown connected to Internet includes a display that can be a touchscreen or a display typically provided by a flat panel display a cathode ray tube CRT or other device capable of rendering a display. Alternatively user device can have its display separate from the device similar to a desktop computer or a laptop computer. In one embodiment user device can be in the form of a smartphone a tablet computer or hybrids that provide touch screen capability in a portable form factor. One exemplary device can include a portable phone device that runs an operating system and is provided with access to various applications apps that may be obtained over Internet and executed on the local portable device e.g. smartphone tablet laptop desktop etc. .

In one embodiment user device can install an application that enables executions and views of the games stored and shared by the game cloud system . Further user device can be used to communicate with one or more social media provider s via Internet such that user device may be used to execute a game play or view video recordings of the game plays shared in one or more social media providers . For example user Umay access a game posted in one of social media providers by selecting a link on a page stream news feed or post of the social media provider and then playing or viewing the game from user device .

In one embodiment while user Uis playing or executing a game stored in game cloud system user device is capable of receiving game video frames from game cloud system and transmitting user interactivity input to game cloud system . The received game video frames can be shown in display of user device .

User interactivity input may include the game control inputs generated by user Uto drive the video game during the game play the user selections for game play mode settings and tag data entered by the user during the execution or view of the video game. User Umay generate the user interactivity input via any device that is capable of transmitting user interactivity input to game cloud system . For example user Umay generate user interactivity input via a game controller a mouse a keyboard or a touch device which communicates with user device .

In one embodiment a user e.g. user U may create a user account and register the created user account with game cloud system . After the user account is registered with game cloud system game cloud system may provide a user ID to this registered user account and save the user ID in a user profile associated with the registered user account. The user profile associated with a user account will be described in more detail with reference to . In one embodiment the user profile associated with a user account may be saved in a user database in game network user store .

In one embodiment user access logic may be used to detect all accesses made by user U either through user device or other suitable devices and be used to verify the user log in information e.g. the name and password for the user account of user U . After user Ulogs in to his or her user account user access logic may communicate the user login information with user processor that in turn updates the user login information stored in the user profile. Further user access logic may communicate the user login information with social connection manager so that social connection manager can pull the names of the user s social network friends from one or more social media providers via network interface . The names of the user s social network friends may be received by social connection manager which in turn transmits the received information to game network user store to be saved in the user profile associated with user U.

After logging in the user can access services provided by game cloud system via game session manager . For example game session manager may inform user processor of the user login information so that user processor may record or update the user login information in the user profile associated with this user. In one embodiment the user profile is stored in game network user store . User processor may also communicate with title index engine to identify game titles associated with the user account. The game titles associated with the user account may be previously purchased by the user previously played by the user and or free game titles identified and made available by the game providers. In this example available game titles may therefore be stored in game title store .

In one embodiment after a user chooses an available game title to play a game session for the chosen game title may be initiated by the user through game session manager . Game session manager first accesses game state store to retrieve the saved game state of the last session played by the user for the selected game if any so that the user can restart the game play from a previous game play stop point. Once the resume or start point is identified the game session manager may inform game execution engine to execute the game code of the chosen game title stored in game code store . After a game session is initiated game session manager may pass the game video frames i.e. streaming video data via network interface to a user device e.g. user device .

During a game play game session manager may communicate with game execution engine recording engine and tag processor to generate or save a recording e.g. video of the game play or game play session as the game play processes. In one embodiment the video recording of the game play can include game tag data entered or provided during game play and other game related metadata. The video recording of game play may be saved in recorded game store . Any game tag data may be saved in tag data store and the metadata may be saved in game state store .

In one embodiment a mini game may be created using information from the video recording of the game play e.g. via mini game processor . For example after a user plays a game and the video recording is created the user can simply watch a reply of the video recording of his or her prior game play. When the user is watching a reply of the video recording the user may find one or more parts to be particularly interesting. For example the user may have achieved a high score or completed an interesting task during the game play. The user in one embodiment is provided with controls to select a portion of the video recording which will then be used by mini game processor to construct a mini game based on the selected portion of the video recording of the game play. In one embodiment the mini game will include the executable code necessary to render the functionality or part of the functionality that was used to create the content of the selected portion of the video recording.

Thus a user wishing to play the mini game will be provided with a substantially similar game play experience as the user that originally played the game that created the video recording. For instance if the original game play included a scene where the user is riding a bike over a jump and the user selects that portion from the video recording of his game play the new mini game would include code to enable similar or substantially similar game play. That is the mini game would enable the user or other users to play the mini game wherein game play would include riding a bike over a jump. In this case the user playing the mini game may or may not achieve the same game score for the jump.

In one embodiment the portion of the video recording associated with the created mini game may be saved in recorded game store and remaining portion of the video recording may be erased after a defined time period by recording engine . If no mini games are created for a video recording of a game play the video recording of the game play may be erased after a defined time period by recording engine .

In one embodiment the created mini game may be posted by user Uto a webpage in a social network via social connection manager to enable sharing with his or her social network friends. Alternatively the created mini game may be posted by user Uto a webpage in a game network maintained by game cloud system for sharing with his or her game network friends. Sharing however should not be limited to friends. Sharing can also be extended to other users that may have similar likes or game play similarities.

Similar to the way a full game is viewed or executed in one embodiment while user Uis executing or viewing a mini game stored in game cloud system user device is capable of receiving game video frames from game cloud system and transmitting user interactivity input to game cloud system . The received game video frames can be shown in display of user device .

In one embodiment the game code that defines a mini game can be the same code of the full game from which the mini game was created. During the creation of the mini game by mini game processor game play metadata which can include game state is used to identify what parts of the game code of the full game are needed to make an executable mini game. When the parts of the code of the full game are all identified the code that defines the mini game can in one embodiment be defined by pointers or references to the game code of the full game. By using points and or references the need to create new code packages for each produced mini game is reduced. As users create mini games from their game titles the code or pointers for the created mini games can be associated to the creating user in game network user store . This way each created mini game can be defined by its original creator and metrics regarding play of the mini games can be attributed or linked to the creating user. For instance if a particular user creates a mini game that is played and or shared often with other users the popularity of the mini game can be tracked and ranked against other mini games and users.

A user who creates mini games that are shared often or tagged with higher frequency can be provided with rewards. The rewards can be provided for example by the developer of the game title from which the mini games are created. As more mini games are made from particular game titles the game title may grow in popularity and will encourage users to purchase a full version. In one embodiment full versions of a game title are unlocked to enable mini game creation. In one embodiment play of a mini game will allow creation of video recordings of the mini game play but may not enable creation of mini games without having access to the full game title.

In one example mini game processor may instruct social connection manager via game session manager to post some or all of the mini games stored in recorded game store at one or more social media providers so that those mini games can be shared either viewed or played by the social network users. Social connection manager may periodically pull social network data associated with those shared mini games from social media providers and save the social network data in social network data store .

In one embodiment mini game processor may be used to analyze the tag data of a mini game and identify video frames with more tag content as a representative frame for the mini game. For example when a mini game is created the mini game may be shown as an icon or still image. The still image may be for example one of the video frames of the mini game. The more interesting the frame is the more likely it is that the mini game may be played by others. Thus in this embodiment the frame that is selected to be the still image may be automatically selected based on the tagging content associated with particular frames.

In another embodiment mini game processor may be used to manage the mini games stored in recorded game store . The mini game management may include but not limited to mini game classification mini game ranking based on the user interactions to the mini games mini game representative picture identification mini game view or execution initiation etc. For instance if certain mini games have a higher number of user interactions this may indicate that the content of the mini game is interesting and or is being shared the most. As such some mini games can be displayed more prominently on a website relative to other mini games based on the degree of tagging that such mini games experience.

Still continuing with in one embodiment during a game play user interactivity input entered by user Umay be transmitted to game session manager of game cloud system . User interactivity input besides input used to drive game play may include tag data e.g. texts images video recording clips etc. and game play mode setting selections. In one embodiment the user interactivity input may be recorded by recording engine in recorded game store .

In one example if user interactivity input is tag data the tag data may be received by game session manager which in turn informs tag processor and user processor that the tag data is received. Tag processor may be used to save the tag data to tag data store . User processor may be used to save a tag pointer that points to where the tag data is stored in tag data store to the user profile associated with user U.

In another example if user interactivity input is game play mode setting selections the game play mode setting selections entered by user Umay be received by game session manager which in turn informs user processor that is used to save the game play mode setting selections to the user profile associated with user U. In one embodiment one of the game play mode setting selections is shadow mode that enables an image of an object controlled by a prior game player to be displayed in a shadow form along a game sequence that is to be played by user U. The game sequence of the game play is defined by characteristics of the video game played by user U.

As shown in users U1 and U2 are geographically located closer GCS3 user U3 is located about in the middle of the distance between GCS2 and GCS5 user U4 is located in between GCS 5 and GCS 6 but is closer to GCS 6 users U6 and U7 are located near GCS4 users U8 and U9 are located near GCS1 and users U5 U10 and U11 are located near GCS6. Although six game cloud systems and eleven users are shown it is to be understood that in practice more or less game cloud systems may be included in game cloud network B and more or less users may access the services provided by game cloud network B.

In one embodiment each GCS in game cloud network B is located in a data center that houses computer systems and associated components to support multiple operating systems. As an example the structure of each GCS may be similar to GCS as shown in . Although it should be understood that a GCS may include fewer or more processing components or logic elements depending on the processing desired. In one embodiment each GCS in game cloud network B may communicate with other GCSs so that the information for various user profiles stored in respective game network user stores of a GCS can get updated and synchronized. Through the communication among the GCSs game cloud network B can dynamically distribute the work load to provide load balancing and assign users based on the work load of each GCS and distance factors.

In one embodiment when a user is trying to log into his or her user account online via a user device depending upon the geographical location of the user the user may be routed to a GCS that is closest to his or her user device. For example because user U1 along with his or her user device is located near GCS3 user U1 utilizes the game services provided GCS3 after his or her user device is connected to GCS3. Similarly user U2 may utilize the game services provided by GCS3 user U7 and user U6 may utilize the game services provided by GCS4 user U8 and user U9 may utilize the game services provided by GCS1 and user U5 user U10 and user U11 may utilize the game services provided by GCS6 based on geographical distance to respective CGSs.

In another embodiment when a user is located approximately in the middle of two GCSs the user may access the game services provided by both GCSs. For example user U3 is located approximately in the middle of GCS2 and GCS5. When user U3 is trying to log into his account the user device of user U3 may be connected to either GCS2 or GCS5 or both GCSs depending upon the work load and latency of the GCSs. In still another embodiment a user may be connected to a GCS that is not the closest one to this user because the GCS that is closest to this user is experiencing heavy work load. For example user U4 may be initially connected to GCS6 because user U4 is located closest to GCS6. Due to heavy work load of GCS6 user U4 may be disconnected from GCS6 and be connected to GCS5. During the period of switching from GCS6 to GCS5 user U4 may be temporarily connected to both GCS6 and GCS5 for a while and then get disconnected from GCS6 after GCS5 has replicated the game state of user U4 in GCS6. Thus the switching from one GCS to another GCS is transparent to the user without affecting the user s experience with the game. In another example user U4 may be directly routed to GCS5 because GCS5 has larger capacity than GCS6.

In one embodiment the Friends field may be populated automatically by accessing external social networks. In this embodiment the game cloud system may include code instructions that enable calls to external application programming interfaces APIs of social networks. The APIs can be used to query the social networks for data concerning the social grid and relationships stored in the social grid of the social network. The data obtained from the social grid may be used to introduce the mini games to friends of the user such as by automatically posting mini games to newsfeeds of friends or the like. These functions will enable wider sharing tagging rating and commenting on mini games as they are shared and used in greater extents.

In one embodiment the User Name field the User ID field and the User Password field are used to record the name of the user the ID assigned to the user when he or she created the user account in game cloud system and the password set up by the user. The User Login field is used to indicate whether this user is currently logged into his or her user account. As discussed above the user login information may be updated by user processor . The User Level field is used to indicate the game play levels of the user. The User Awards field shows the awards received by the user during previous game plays.

In one embodiment the Game Titles field shows all available game titles for the user. The available game titles may be those that the user is able to freely play because either the user purchased the game or the game is free to play. In still other embodiments the Game Titles field can show or identify the games that the user is able to see such as based on the rating of the games. If the play is a minor only selected games would be made accessible for that player.

As discussed above a user may create one or more mini games based on a video recording of a game title played by the user. If one or more mini games are created for the game title the created mini games will be shown under this game title. In this example there are three available game titles for the user Game Title 1 Game Title 2 and Game Title 3 and one mini game Mini Game is created from Game Title 2. In one embodiment the user can start to play a game by selecting clicking touching etc. on the available game title shown in user profile C. In still other embodiments mini games can be shown on a separate webpage where a user can select to play mini games created by the user or created by other users. The mini games shown can be organized based on game types genres age appropriate etc. Mini games having larger numbers of user interactions e.g. plays or tags maybe ranked higher or placed in a more prominent location on the webpage. From this webpage of mini games users can access to play such mini games or share the mini games with others within the game network or externally via social networks.

In one embodiment the User Tags field in user profile C lists tag data entered by the user. As discussed above the entered tag data is stored in tag data store . For each tag data listed in the User Tags field there is an associated tag pointer that points to the tag data stored in the tag data store . The tag data stored under the User Tags field may be a tag data entered by the user during a game play of the original full game title b tag data entered by the user while viewing the video recording from the game play of the full game title c tag data entered by any user viewing the portion of the video recording used to make or define the mini game or d tag data entered by any user while playing the mini game for the video portion the portion being the portion that was selected from the video recording to define the mini game .

In one embodiment a mini game may be created by a user that owns or has access to a full version of the game that is used to create the mini game. When a user plays the full version of the game a video recording is created of the game play. From this video recording the user can select a portion of the video recording e.g. a starting point and an ending point . This portion of the video is saved and associated to the user. In addition this portion is used to identify metadata and state data that was created when the full version of the game was played to create the video recording. This information is in turn used to identify the code parts of the full game code that will be required to create an executable mini game that will encompass at least the functionality seen in the portion of the video that was selected from the video recording. In one embodiment once the mini game is created the mini game may have two parts.

For example a first part is the portion of the video selected by the user from the full video recording. This portion can be posted and shared so that other users can see a video of the user s game play and the results which may have been interesting . Once a person views the video portion the person can elect to play a mini game for that portion of video.

Also for example a second part is the executable mini game. As in the example above if the portion of the video shows the user jumping an obstacle on a bike the mini game will provide code to allow another play to attempt the jump of the obstacle on the bike. The game scores achieved by the original player using the full game can then be compared to the score achieved by the other play. The other play may also get a good score which may be interesting to share.

Thus to provide further sharing a third part may be the creation of a secondary video portion that is a recording of game play of the mini game by other users. Thus as more players play the mini game there will be many secondary recordings of those game plays which will also be saved and associated with the original mini game and to the players.

In this example however the creator of the mini game is going to be the owner of the full version of the game. If the person playing the mini game wishes to make a mini game him or herself that person can purchase the full copy or full locked access and produce his or her own mini games that can be shared in the same way.

In one embodiment the Friends field in user profile C shows the user s friends in both game network and social network. In this example the user s game network friends are shown under the Game Network sub field and the user s social network friends are shown under the Social Network sub field. The user s friends who belong to both the game network and the social network may be listed under the Common sub field.

In one embodiment the shadow mode of a game play may be enabled to display an image of an object in the form of a shadow controlled by a selected prior user along a game sequence that is to be played by the user associated with the user profile C. The shadow form may be defined as one of a fully animated version a minimally animated version a grayed animation a dashed line animation a partially transparent animation or combinations or variance of degree thereof.

The shadow mode of a game play may include the follow shadow mode and the pause shadow mode. In this example the follow shadow mode is selected for the Shadow Mode field. When the follow shadow mode is selected the object of the video game controlled by the user associated with the user profile C is enabled to move behind based on a time gap the shadow form of the object of the selected prior user along the game sequence during one of the previous plays while the user associated with the user profile C is playing the video game. The time gap of the follow shadow mode defines a follow separation between the actions performed by the selected prior user to move the image of the object of the video game in a shadow form along the game sequence during one of the previous plays and the actions to be performed by the user associated with the user profile C to move the image of the object of the video game along the game sequence.

If the pause shadow mode is selected the object of the video game controlled by the user associated with the user profile C is paused during a time gap. During the time gap the shadow form of the object controlled by a selected prior user is shown progressing between a beginning point of a pause separation to an ending point of the pause separation. The pause separation is defined by the time gap between the actions performed by the selected prior user to move the image of the object of the video game in a shadow form along the game sequence during the previous play and the actions to be performed by the user associated with the user profile C to move the image of the object of the video game along the game sequence.

For a user profile stored in game network user store the User Name field the User Login field the User Level field the User Awards field and the Shadow Mode field may be viewable to other users in the game network while the other fields in the user profile may not be viewable to other users. In one embodiment a user may select whether to make the Friends field in his or her user profile to be viewable by other users.

In this embodiment after shadow mode is selected a window is popped up or shown in any other displayable configuration to enable the selection for either the follow shadow mode or the pause shadow mode and the selection for shadow mode view time. In one embodiment the shadow mode view time is user selectable and defines a period of time during which the shadow mode is enabled for the game play. In other embodiments the game system can set a default time or make the time adjustable depending on skill level. Further the view time can be set by the video game intermittently during the play of the video game at selected times during play of the video game or at times enabled by game cloud system .

Status window may be used to display the game play status the shadow mode selection for the game being played the selected time gap for a selected shadow mode the selected prior player or user the shadow mode view time selection etc. The game controls in control panel and the selections in window may be implemented in any forms such as radio buttons push buttons drop down menus touch icons voice activated etc.

In one embodiment input guide in control panel can be selected while shadow mode is enabled. When input guide in control panel is selected the game inputs entered by a selected prior user for at least one of the actions performed in the prior game will be displayed. The game inputs may be entered in the prior game in the form of inputs or a combination of inputs from a game controller a mouse a keyboard a touch device etc. In one embodiment the game inputs may be displayed in a pop up window or other display icon s .

During the pause shadow mode the object represented by the solid lined car in this example controlled by the current game player is paused during the selected time gap. When the time gap is set to 1 second the object represented by the dash lined car used for game actions performed by the selected prior player is shown progressing between the beginning point A and the ending point B. When the time gap is set to 2 second the object represented by the dash lined car used for game actions performed by the selected prior player is shown progressing between the beginning point A and the ending point C along the game sequence . In this embodiment the status window shows the selected pause shadow mode the selected time gap and the selected prior player player C .

In this example the object controlled by the current player is shown in solid lined form while the objects controlled by the prior user Player D are shown in dash lined forms. The game control inputs entered by player D during a prior game play is set to be displayed intermittently when the object controlled by player D is going to perform any major actions for example jumping over a wall jumping from the top of a stair diving into the water climbing up to shore etc. The inputs or combination of inputs entered by player D in this embodiment are shown in various pop up windows   to   associated with the identified actions.

At operation a user interface is generated for displaying game interactivity for playing the video game. The user interface may include controls for selecting a mode of play and the mode of play includes a shadow mode. In one embodiment the shadow mode includes a follow shadow mode and a pause shadow mode. The view time of the shadow mode may be set by the user during a part of the game play at selected time of the game play intermittently during the game play or at times enabled by game cloud system .

At operation a game play by a first user for an available game title is detected for example by game cloud system . The game played by the first user may be a full game title available to the first user or a mini game defined from a part of a full video game. The game may be executed by game execution engine of game cloud system .

At operation one or more previous plays of the video game by other users or prior users are identified. In one embodiment the other users are dynamically discovered by identifying friends of the first user from a social network e.g. from a social media provider by social connection manager of game cloud system .

At operation a selection from the first user identifying one other user to be used in the shadow mode is received. In addition to the selection of one of the other users to be used in the shadow mode a time gap may be selected by the first user to be used during the shadow mode game play.

At operation after setting a period of time the shadow mode of the selected other user is enabled. The enabling of the shadow mode displays an image of an object controlled by the other user along a game sequence that is to be played by the first user of the video game. The period of time is user selectable. In one embodiment the period of time can be during part of the video game intermittently during the play of the video game at selected times during the play of the video game or at times enabled by a game cloud system.

In one embodiment the cloud gaming system is configured to detect the type of client device associated with the user and also a type of controller available for the user to provide input to the cloud based video game. For example in one embodiment when a user logs in to the cloud gaming system they may be presented with an option to designate the type of client device with which they are accessing the cloud gaming system. In one embodiment a series of client device options are presented from which the user may select one corresponding to their client device. The user may also be presented with an option to designate the type of controller device they will use to play a video game. In one embodiment a series of controller options can be presented to the user from which the user may select to designate a controller type corresponding to their controller hardware. In other embodiments the cloud gaming system can be configured to automatically detect the client device type and or the controller device type.

For example at the time of login the client device may send information to the cloud gaming server identifying itself as well as a connected controller device e.g. in response to a request from the cloud gaming server . Based on this information the cloud gaming server may determine an appropriate video game output configuration and input parameter configuration to provide a gaming experience optimized for the user s client device and controller device. In one embodiment a look up table is employed to determine video game configuration and input parameter configuration based on a detected client device and a detected controller device.

It should be appreciated that a given video game may be developed for a specific platform and a specific associated controller device. However when such a game is made available via a cloud gaming system as presented herein the user may be accessing the video game with a different controller device. For example a game might have been developed for a game console and its associated controller whereas the user might be accessing a cloud based version of the game from a personal computer utilizing a keyboard and mouse. In such a scenario the input parameter configuration can define a mapping from inputs which can be generated by the user s available controller device in this case a keyboard and mouse to inputs which are acceptable for the execution of the video game.

In another example a user may access the cloud gaming system via a tablet computing device a touchscreen smartphone or other touchscreen driven device. In this case the client device and the controller device are integrated together in the same device with inputs being provided by way of detected touchscreen inputs gestures. For such a device the input parameter configuration may define particular touchscreen inputs corresponding to game inputs for the video game. For example buttons a directional pad or other types of input elements might be displayed or overlayed during running of the video game to indicate locations on the touchscreen that the user can touch to generate a game input. Gestures such as swipes in particular directions or specific touch motions may also be detected as game inputs. In one embodiment a tutorial can be provided to the user indicating how to provide input via the touchscreen for gameplay e.g. prior to beginning gameplay of the video game so as to acclimate the user to the operation of the controls on the touchscreen.

In some embodiments the client device serves as the connection point for a controller device. That is the controller device communicates via a wireless or wired connection with the client device to transmit inputs from the controller device to the client device. The client device may in turn process these inputs and then transmit input data to the cloud gaming server via a network e.g. accessed via a local networking device such as a router . However in other embodiments the controller can itself be a networked device with the ability to communicate inputs directly via the network to the cloud gaming server without being required to communicate such inputs through the client device first. For example the controller might connect to a local networking device such as the aforementioned router to send to and receive data from the cloud gaming server. Thus while the client device may still be required to receive video output from the cloud based video game and render it on a local display input latency can be reduced by allowing the controller to send inputs directly over the network to the cloud gaming server bypassing the client device.

In one embodiment a networked controller and client device can be configured to send certain types of inputs directly from the controller to the cloud gaming server and other types of inputs via the client device. For example inputs whose detection does not depend on any additional hardware or processing apart from the controller itself can be sent directly from the controller to the cloud gaming server via the network bypassing the client device. Such inputs may include button inputs joystick inputs embedded motion detection inputs e.g. accelerometer magnetometer gyroscope etc. However inputs that utilize additional hardware or require processing by the client device can be sent by the client device to the cloud gaming server. These might include captured video or audio from the game environment that may be processed by the client device before sending to the cloud gaming server. Additionally inputs from motion detection hardware of the controller might be processed by the client device in conjunction with captured video to detect the position and motion of the controller which would subsequently be communicated by the client device to the cloud gaming server. It should be appreciated that the controller device in accordance with various embodiments may also receive data e.g. feedback data from the client device or directly from the cloud gaming server.
