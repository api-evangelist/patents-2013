title: Method and apparatus for providing both audio/video visitation and VOIP telephonic visitation originated either by an inmate or by an outside visitor directly between inmates of a prison and an outside visitor without need of intervention by prison personnel
abstract: An Internet-based audio/video and VoIP telephone visitation system for prisons wherein audio/video and VoIP visitation may be originated by either an inmate or an outside visitor. An inmate uses an individual portable electronic device in his/her possession to communicate exclusively with the visitation system. Through the visitation system video messages, video visitations, and VoIP telecommunications may be exchanged between the inmate and a registered visitor having an Internet-enabled device. Communication requires no endpoint control by prison personnel. All communications may be subject to intervention, recordation, and monitoring by prison personnel. Payment for services is prepaid by visitors using an on-line payment service eliminating involvement of prison personnel. All non-privileged calls are recorded. All calls may be monitored. A fee-per-minute is charged. Time is tracked for each call. The call duration and time remaining for a call may be displayed for both the visitor and the inmate.

This application is a Continuation in Part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 363 498 filed Feb. 1 2012 entitled REMOTE WEB BASED VISITATION SYSTEM FOR PRISONS hereinafter the 498 application that is included herein in its entirety by reference.

The invention pertains to remote video and or VoIP telephonic visitation and more particularly to an Internet based system enabling outside originated video and or VoIP telephonic visitation with incarcerated persons from a remote site each incarcerated person typically possessing a personal electronic device for initiating and receiving communications to and from outside visitors.

When two parties want to communicate over great distances in real time the telephone has heretofore been the communication technology of choice. However advancements in communication technologies over the past several years now allow both audio and video communication between parties over great distances typically via the Internet. These forms of communication are commonly referred to as video conferencing. Modern video conferencing depending on the complexity and associated expense of the equipment involved can provide virtually real time communication among two or more parties.

Video conferencing typically requires local equipment associated with each person seeking to participate in the conference. When the conference is to be started the equipment at each location is used to call in e.g. conference in to a call center or the like. As each of these endpoints establishes a connection with the central location the video and audio signals may then be accessed by all of the participants so that a conversation with both audio and video can take place. One common type of video conferencing equipment uses especially dedicated equipment at each geographic location for the participants. Such equipment typically uses an Integrated Services Digital Network ISDN or similar data connection to transmit and receive audio video communication data during the video conference.

Unfortunately conventionally available video conferencing equipment of the prior art has a common characteristic each system requires initiation and or termination of the communication at the visitor s and or at the inmate s end i.e. end point control. Such end point control is problematic when the video conferencing system used is a remote Internet based visitation system where one participant is incarcerated i.e. a prisoner in a jail prison penitentiary etc. .

As used hereinafter the term inmate will be applied to such incarcerated persons and the term prison will be used to refer to any and all facilities where an inmate may be incarcerated.

To allow an inmate to have unrestricted Internet access in order to gain end point control of a video visitation system is universally disallowed. Prisons do not want inmates to have unrestricted access to the Internet. Consequently in such Internet based systems of the prior art prison personnel are required to be involved in audio video and telephonic visitation initiation and termination.

However the advantages of an Internet based video visitation system in the prison environment are many. Often an inmate is incarcerated in a location a great distance from his family or friends. Such distances often result in visitation of the inmate being inconvenient or even impossible due to travel time and expense for friends and family. Consequently an audio video conference with the inmate provides an alternative to an in person visit.

As noted the expense and complexity of traditional video visitation equipment and associated personnel cost incurred by the prison to facilitate end point control is significant. A critically important aspect of end point control within the prison is the need to make sure that the correct inmate is communicating with the correct visitor. This issue is addressed as positive party identification . A prison s Internet based VoIP and video visitation system must provide positive identification of the parties to the communication. By means of illustration it could be disastrous if a convicted child molester inmate was erroneously made a party to an incoming video visit from a minor child attempting to visit with another inmate.

Likewise while inmate originated telephone calls to outside visitors are well known in the prior art no system is known to the inventor that allows direct incoming phone calls to an inmate that is to say without the need for intervention by prison personnel. Rather only direct outgoing phone calls from the inmate to the visitor may be made. In addition to take part in a phone call the visitor has to wait for an inmate to have access to an inmate phone and then wait for the inmate to call. Of course the call can only be completed if the visitor is available.

The prior art discloses systems whereby an outside visitor may call in to an inmate in a prison. In such systems prison personnel must locate the inmate and cause the inmate to move to an available inmate phone equipped to receive incoming telephone calls. Prison personnel then need to transfer the call to that phone once the inmate is in position to receive the call. Prison personnel then still need to monitor the call.

None of the known prior art means of communications maximize the recognized beneficial result of keeping an inmate connected with his family and loved ones. The presently available prior art means of communications do not allow visitors to initiate VoIP telecommunications or video visits directly with the particular inmate spontaneously at the visitor s convenience.

While traditional video conferencing equipment may be used in the prison environment the above mentioned problems are present. To illustrate the point a VoIP telecommunication or video communication initiated outside of the prison over the Internet directed to an inmate using a traditional video visitation system must be received by one or more designated prison employees. The prison employee then has to contact prison employees working in the inmate s cell block and determine whether the inmate is available to receive the visit. If the inmate is available to receive a visit at that time the prison employees working in the inmate s cell block are then required to coordinate ushering the inmate to the designated video visitation station to receive the visit and the visit is connected. Outgoing Internet based video visitation using traditional systems also puts demands on prison personnel in that the system requires prison personnel to initiate the communication and coordinate placement of the correct inmate at the correct visitation station within his or her cell block to receive the communication in accordance with industry standard operating procedures for party identification.

Thus a traditional video visitation system using the Internet to facilitate the communication whether the communication is incoming or outgoing places a heavy labor burden on the prison and allows a risk of human error in the positive party identification. Further Internet based traditional video visitation using prior art systems cannot be initiated directly by an inmate without prison personnel intervention because prisons will not allow unrestricted inmate access to the Internet.

In the copending 498 application the applicant disclosed a system i.e. the HomeWAV Video Visitation System allowing inmate initiated video visitation with preregistered outside visitors that overcome known shortcomings of prior art video conferencing systems. That novel system requires no involvement by prison personnel to connect a video visit between the inmate and his visitor and contains many security safeguards. For purposes of disclosure a remote web based visitation system for prisons provided by HomeWAV LLC a limited liability company of the state of Virginia located in Virginia Beach Va. is described. HomeWAV and HomeWAV Web Access Visitation are trademarks of HomeWAV LLC.

The system disclosed in the 498 application utilizes prison hardened terminals located throughout the prison and usable by one inmate at a time during allowable time periods. Such an arrangement does not lend itself to receiving either video visitation or VoIP telephonic communication originated by an outside visitor wishing to communicate with an inmate. Simply put there is no positive identification established on the receiving end at the commencement of the communication. Rather any inmate walking past the receiving terminal could pick up the receiver and engage in a video visitation.

Accordingly what is needed is an Internet based video or telephonic visitation system that i permits video or telephonic visits between inmates and visitors that are initiated either by inmates or by authorized outside visitors under strictly controlled parameters and ii utilizes individual electronic devices in the possession of inmates to directly initiate and receive Internet based video or telephonic visitation.

Several attempts to solve some of the problems that are solved by the present invention may be found in the prior art. For example U.S. Pat. No. 5 382 972 for VIDEO CONFERENCING SYSTEM FOR COURTROOM AND OTHER APPLICATIONS issued Jan. 17 1995 to Deno Kannes teaches a conferencing system for interactive video and preferably also audio communication which includes a composite video signal generation means. The system preferably also includes a recording unit for producing a permanent combined video and audio record of a conference. The system includes a monitor for each conferee which displays a composite video signal including a principal video image in a large picture region of the monitor screen and secondary video images in small picture regions of the monitor screen.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 844 893 for RESTAURANT VIDEO CONFERENCING SYSTEM AND METHOD issued Jan. 18 2005 to William G. Miller et al. provides a system and method that combines restaurant services with video conferencing and multimedia access for diverse customer appeal. The MILLER et al. system and method employ a number of booths in a number of restaurants whereby each booth can video conference with each other booth particularly in different time zones while also providing multi media access such as satellite TV cable broadcast TV computer programs and gaming internet access. Each booth is linked to a local area network and is equipped with a display screen and video and audio controls. The local area network of each restaurant is linked to the local area network of each other restaurant forming a corporate intranet that allows media uses and various management capabilities such s scheduling accounting security training and the like.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 046 779 for VIDEO CONFERENCE SYSTEM AND METHODS FOR USE AT MULTI STATION SITES issued May 16 2006 to Thomas H. Hesse provides a video conference system that includes at each of several sites multiple participant stations and a control station. A conference coordinator e.g. a guard or receptionist operating the control station receives notice from the control station that a scheduled conference is about to begin and directs a person identified to be a participant of the conference to a station designated by the notice. Signals from participant stations are monitored and if a participant station is determined to be unavailable the conference may be rescheduled to replace the available station with an alternate available station. Notice sufficient to direct a participant to the alternate station is provided via the control station to the coordinator. The subject of detecting availability and rescheduling alternatives may be an item of equipment or an equipment capability e.g. a recorder channel to be used for recording the conference . Higher ranking requests may force rescheduling of already scheduled lower ranking conferences.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 061 521 for VIDEO CONFERENCE SYSTEM PROVIDING PRIVATE AND ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATIONS issued Jun. 13 2006 to Michael E. Bulriss et al. discloses a conference system that includes a first conference station generating at least one of audio and video signals from at least an attorney and a second conference station generating at least one of audio and video signals from the attorney s client the attorney and the attorney s client having a relationship protected by the attorney client privilege. The system also includes at least one communications link connecting the first and second conference stations that carries the audio and or video signals between the first and second conference stations. A signal processor is disposed within the communications link between the first and second conference stations to route signals between the first and second conference stations. At least one control panel communicates with the signal processor and provides control over audio and or video signals so that the attorney and the attorney s client are permitted to engage in a private communication without vitiating the attorney client privilege.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 256 816 for SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES FOR SCHEDULING AND CONDUCTING AUDIO VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS issued Aug. 14 2007 to John D. Profanchik et al. discloses methods of scheduling and conducting video visits as well as computer architecture for providing such scheduling and conducting where the participants in the visit are not required or able to interact with the audio video equipment for the initial connection to start the video visit. In some embodiments participants are also not able to interact with the equipment during the actual visit and thus the equipment employed during the video visit may be isolated from physical contact by the participants. To initiate or terminate a video visit a data center establishes a data connection with each participant and thus the flow of data between the participants moves across a computer network via the data center. The visit may be monitored in virtually real time by splitting the data transmitted between the participants and sending it to a monitoring terminal rather than establishing a separate connection for the monitoring.

United States Published Patent Application No. 2009 0228383 for SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROACTIVELY ESTABLISHING A THIRD PARTY PAYMENT ACCOUNT FOR SERVICES RENDERED TO A RESIDENT OF A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT FACILITY published Sep. 10 2009 upon application by Veronica Martinez et al. provides systems and methods for proactively establishing a third party payment account for services rendered to a resident of a controlled environment facility CEF . A campaign triggering event is detected which triggers contact of prospective third party 3party payers for a resident of a CEF in order to encourage such prospective 3party payers to establish 3 party payment accounts for the resident. In this manner the prospective third party payers are proactively contacted prior to an expected future demand for service by the resident. A method thus comprises identifying at least one prospective third party payer for a resident of a controlled environment facility and proactively contacting the identified at least one prospective third party payer prior to demand for service by the resident to encourage the identified at least one prospective third party payer to establish a third party payment account for payment for future service expected for the resident.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 054 756 for METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SPECIAL SERVICE CALL HANDLING issued Oct. 18 1977 to William Kirk Comella et al. discloses a for serving special service calls such as collect person to person and charge to third number on a wholly automatic basis without any operator intervention normally being required. The system requests specific information from the calling party such as his or her name for collect calls and utilizes the received answers in the formulation of additional announcements to the called subscriber. The system is responsive to information received from the called station or third party station for instituting billing for the requested call after a connection is established between the calling and called stations.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 158 621 for PRE PAID CALLING AND VOICE MESSAGING SERVICE FOR INMATES issued Jan. 2 2007 to Anthony J. Bayne discloses a system wherein inmates place free incoming calls to a call processing system and are prompted to choose between accessing a voice mail system and calling an outside party. If an outside party is to be called an inmate provides a phone number and an outgoing call is placed to the outside party. If the outside party provides payment for the call the inmate is connected to the outgoing call and the incoming call is terminated. If the outgoing call is not accepted the inmate may record a voice message for the outside party in a voice mailbox assigned to the inmate. For an access fee the outside party may access the voice mailbox assigned to the inmate. Advertising messages may be presented to inmates during incoming calls and or to outside parties during outgoing calls. Advertising revenue may cover incoming call charges. Inmates and or outside parties may record voice messages for advertisers

U.S. Pat. No. 8 064 580 for TELEPHONY SYSTEM AND METHOD WITH IMPROVED FRAUD CONTROL issued Nov. 22 2011 to Wesley Larry Apple et al. teaches an inmate communications system providing a feature rich platform with a high degree of flexibility and security employing call control facilities located off institutional premises. Authentication processes for calling and called party verification include biometric techniques in some embodiments. Distributed processing of call control and billing provide flexible interactive call payment processes. Preferred embodiments feature voice over IP transmission and control featuring controlled access to avoid addition of unauthorized third party call participants. Monitoring recording and selective forwarding of calls is provided under control of system administrators.

U.S. Pat. No. 8 160 219 for CONTROLLED THREE WAY CALLING issued Apr. 17 2012 to Anthony Jeremiah Bayne provides a system wherein an inmate calls a call processing system and provides two phone numbers to it. The first phone number is for a 2nd Party who will accept the inmate s collect call and who will agree to pay any additional charge for adding a third party to the collect call. The second phone number is for a 3rd Party the inmate would like added to the collect call. The call processing system places the inmate on hold while the system dials the 2nd Party. When the 2nd Party accepts the inmate s collect call and agrees to pay for an additional fee for establishing a three way call during the collect call the inmate is taken off hold and is connected to the 2nd Party.

None of the patents and the published patent application taken singly or in any combination are seen to teach or suggest the novel Method and Apparatus for Providing Both Audio Video Visitation and VoIP Telephonic Visitation Originated Either by an Inmate or by an Outside Visitor Directly Between an Inmate of a Prison and an Outside Visitor Without Need of Intervention by Prison Personnel of the present invention.

The present invention provides a VoIP telecommunication and video visitation system and method adapted for use in providing both inmate and outside visitor originated remote Internet based visitation with inmates incarcerated in a prison. The need for prison personnel to provide endpoint control to schedule initiate or terminate a visit is eliminated in the novel visitation system of the invention. Further all visitations are initiated or received by the inmates during defined visitation times established by the prison. Also importantly while this is a fee for services system with a programmable per minute charge no monies pass through the prison but rather are paid directly to the owner operator of the remote visitation system.

The jail hardened terminals disclosed in the 498 application may be replaced by individual electronic devices possessed by inmates and purchased leased or rented from the prison or the owner operator of the remote visitation system. All inmate visits are originated from or received by these individual electronic devices. Each inmate possessed electronic device communicates only with a security gateway under control of the prison.

Unless a visitor has been designated a clergy member or a legal representative with whom the inmate is entitled to privileged communication all visits whether video or telephonic are recorded. Visits with privileged visitors are not typically recorded.

Visitors need an Internet connected appliance which may be a desktop or notebook computer an Internet connected tablet a smart phone or any other suitable device capable of supporting video conferencing and Voice Over Internet Protocol VoIP telecommunications across the Internet.

Visitors using PayPal or a similar on line payment system prepay for visitation minutes with an individual inmate. A per minute charge may be set for each call made. As used herein the term call is used to refer to either a video visitation or a VoIP telecommunication. There is typically no minimum call length.

Time is tracked for each call. The call duration and the minutes remaining for a call based upon the maximum allowed call length and an inmate s available minutes are displayed for both the visitor and the inmate.

During a video visit video images of both the inmate and the visitor are displayed on both the inmate s device and the visitor s station. No video images are provided during a VoIP telecommunication.

It is therefore an object of the invention to provide an Internet based audio video visitation system for prisons that allows video conferencing and or VoIP telecommunication between an inmate in a prison and an outside visitor across the Internet.

It is another object of the invention to provide an Internet based audio video visitation system for prisons wherein an individual electronic device in possession of an individual inmate is used to originate or receive a video visit or a VoIP telecommunication.

It is an additional object of the invention to provide an Internet based audio video and or VoIP telecommunication visitation system for prisons wherein either an inmate or a preregistered outside visitor may initiate the video visit or VoIP telecommunication.

It is a further object of the invention to provide an Internet based audio video and VoIP telecommunication visitation system for prisons wherein each individual electronic device is constrained i.e. physically modified programmed or otherwise constrained so as to only allow secure communication between the device and a prison installed portion of the prison visitation system.

It is a still further object of the invention to provide an Internet based audio video and VoIP telecommunication visitation system for prisons wherein no endpoint control is required by prison personnel.

It is yet another object of the invention to provide an Internet based audio video and VoIP telecommunication visitation system for prisons wherein no monies flow through or are processed by the prison.

It is another object of the invention to provide an Internet based video and VoIP telecommunication visitation system for prisons wherein a prison administrator may block calls to or from either selected individual inmates or all inmates in the prison as well as block calls to or from designated visitors or all visitors.

It is an additional object of the invention to provide an Internet based video and VoIP telecommunication visitation system for prisons wherein a percentage of the per minute charge for calls may be paid to the prison.

It is a still further object of the invention to provide an Internet based audio video and VoIP telecommunication visitation system for prisons at no cost to the prisons.

It is another object of the invention to provide positive party identification without the need of prison personnel involvement.

It is still another object of the invention to provide an Internet based video visitation system for prisons displaying real time visual images of the inmate and visitor on the screen of an individual electronic device in possession of an inmate.

It is yet another object of the invention to provide an Internet based VOIP telecommunication and video visitation system for prisons that allows prison personnel real time monitoring and recording of VOIP telecommunications and video visits.

It is a further object of the invention to provide an Internet based VOIP telecommunication and video visitation system for prisons wherein individual electronic devices may be purchased and or leased from either the prison or the operator of the prison visitation system.

The present invention provides a system for providing video and or telephonic visitation between inmates incarcerated in a prison and visitors located remotely from the prison. Visitors each have an authorized Internet connected computer or other Internet appliance including Voice Over Internet Protocol VoIP capability. Visitation may be initiated by either the inmate or the remote visitor.

As used herein the term VoIP refers to a specific method of packaging voice signals for transmission over an Internet connection. However the applicant believes that other methods protocols etc. for packaging voice signals for Internet transmission may exist or may emerge in the future. Consequently as used herein the term VoIP is intended to include any and all existing or emerging voice transmission methods or protocols in addition to the specific method chosen for purposes of disclosure i.e. VoIP .

Referring first to and there are shown top plan schematic views of two possible form factors for a device in accordance with the present invention. shows a device in the form factor of a so called tablet computer while shows a device in the form factor of a so called smart phone. It will be recognized that devices may be provided in a wide range of form factors and consequently the invention is not considered limited to the form factors chosen for purposes of disclosure.

Each device has four fundamental elements depicted. Each device has a forward facing camera a screen a built in microphone shown schematically at reference numbers respectively and a headphone jack respectively.

Each device has a wireless communications interface. For purposes of disclosure a so called Wi Fi interface has been chosen as a communications interface. It will be recognized by those of skill in the art that other wireless interfaces currently exist and that the pace of development in wireless digital communication is rapid. Consequently the invention is not considered limited to a particular wireless communications interface. Rather the invention is intended to include any suitable wireless interface whether known or yet to be developed in addition to the Wi Fi interface chosen for purposes of disclosure.

Each device has a unique identifier that may be transmitted by the wireless interface to identify a particular device . Such unique identifiers include but are not limited to a Media Access Control address MAC address or the like. MAC addresses are most often assigned by the manufacturer of the wireless interface included within a device and are typically stored in the device s hardware not specifically identified for example in read only memory or some other firmware mechanism. Such MAC addresses are referred to as burned in addresses.

It will be recognized that exemplary devices contain electronic support circuitry and a power supply e.g. a rechargeable battery . Such devices are considered to be well known and may be purchased as off the shelf devices. Optionally such devices may be custom built for the application and may contain security features not specifically identified designed to allow more secure operation in a correctional facility environment.

In a prison any communication apparatus for use by inmates has heretofore been an apparatus constructed using prison hardened techniques and materials. Inmates have used such apparatus for all communications with the outside world.

The present invention supplements or replaces such apparatus with the devices individually owned i.e. purchased rented or leased by individual inmates from the prison or from the system operator of the prison visitation system. The HomeWAV Web Access Visitation for Correctional Facilities by HomeWAV LLC of Virginia Beach Va. USA hereinafter the HomeWAV system or simply the system is assumed to be the system operator for purposes of disclosure.

Referring now to there is shown a greatly simplified block diagram of the novel HomeWAV LLC prison visitation system in accordance with the invention generally at reference number . Hereinafter for purposes of brevity the HomeWAV prison visitation system is referred to as the HomeWAV system . The HomeWAV system provides gate keeping security functions that assure only valid authorized devices are allowed to communicate with the HomeWAV system . Further the HomeWAV system ensures that inmates may communicate only with authorized visitors as approved and controlled by the prison.

As used herein reference number is used to generically refer to any and all devices for example devices 

Using the devices with the system and methods of the present invention inmates may communicate only with the HomeWAV system. Each device is pre programmed such that it can only access the HomeWAV system. As used herein the term pre programmed refers to either software or hardware modifications or add ons that limit an off the shelf device to exclusive communication with the HomeWAV system. Prisoners are allowed access to only those applications and programs on the HomeWAV system that have been approved by the prison. Specifically device is pre programmed to prevent uncontrolled access to the Internet.

More specifically each device may be pre programmed so that it will only link with a particular wireless router located within the prison. It is especially important to note that no two devices are allowed to communicate directly with one another and each device will only be allowed to communicate with visitors who have been approved to visit with the inmate to whom the particular device has been assigned.

Communication capabilities usually associated with an off the shelf electronic appliance such as cell phones smart phones or tablet computers etc. may be modified. In device any existing cellular network communications or open wireless network communication i.e. Wi Fi is typically disabled.

HomeWAV system incorporates security features that make it practical for an individual inmate to posses his or her own device . For example each device may require biometric input from a particular inmate for the device to be activated. In most embodiments a unique prisoner generated personal identification number PIN may be required for device activation. Further HomeWAV system limits each device to communicating with the IP addresses of a particular inmate s approved visitors equipment as controlled by the HomeWAV LLC website via portion of the cloud . It will be recognized that while three cloud portions are shown on that representation is done for clarity in depicting the flow of information in the HomeWAV prison visitation system. There is of course only a single cloud representing the entire Internet.

Three devices representative of any number of such devices found in a prison are shown communicating with a wireless router via communications paths . . . using a built in Wi Fi communications interface not specifically identified within devices

Router may have an integrated server for example an Interface Device shown schematically at reference number or it may be connected along with other routers not shown with a server not shown located elsewhere in the prison. The prison s routers servers and associated connections none of which are shown constitute the prison s local area network LAN not specifically identified. The prison s LAN is in turn connected to the wide area network WAN outside of the prison via a communications portion that may include the prison s Internet Service Provider ISP not specifically identified. The prison s LAN is thereby connected to the Internet shown schematically as cloud portion

A prison administration workstation not shown but described in detail in the 498 copending application is connected to the HomeWAV website via another Internet connection shown schematically as portion of the cloud.

Outside visitors communicate with the HomeWAV website via the Internet shown schematically as cloud portion

The HomeWAV website maintains and accesses databases of visitors and of inmates and prisons . Using information from databases the HomeWAV visitation system acts as a gate keeper whereby only registered visitors are connected to registered inmates with whom that visitor is specifically authorized to visit.

Based on input from Prison Administration all or selective portions of an inmate s communication may be disabled. Single identified groups e.g. a cell block etc. or all devices may be disabled by prison administration . In addition to complete disabling of devices hours of operation may be imposed on a device by device basis at the discretion of prison administration . Additional control may be exercised by prison administration as also described in detail in the copending 498 application.

The HomeWAV system of relates only to prison visitation system using devices in possession of individual inmates. In the co pending 498 application there is disclosed a system for video visitation that allows inmates to initiate video visitation calls from secure terminals within the prison during allowed hours to pre approved outside visitors equipped with an Internet enabled computer or other similar appliance. These prisoner initiated video visitations do not rely on prison personnel to either establish schedule or monitor these visitations. All visits unless excepted by attorney client or clergy privilege are recorded for security purposes. The system of the 498 application however has no provision for video or telephone visitation originated by an approved outside visitor to an inmate.

The HomeWAV system of is assumed to have all necessary security enhancements to allow outside visitor originated video or telephonic visitation. Such system enhancements are discussed in detail hereinbelow.

The novel concept of letting inmates have individual communications devices under their own control opens numerous possibilities for enhanced visitation via VoIP telephone and or video visitation.

Once the inmate has entered his or her ID Number a status message that indicates that the information is being validated is displayed. In addition a rotating icon indicates that the device is processing the information. The entered Inmate ID Number is checked against a list of authorized inmate numbers possibly stored in device identification database . In addition the MAC Address or similar unique ID of the device is checked against a list of authorized devices . In some cases the MAC Address is checked against the Inmate ID Number to ensure that the correct inmate is using the device

Assuming that the MAC address etc. is valid and the inmate has entered a valid Inmate ID Number one of two screens will be displayed to the inmate.

If this is the first time signing into the HomeWAV system from device a new screen is displayed. On screen the inmate is instructed to Create a 4 Digit PIN in a field . After the inmate enters a 4 digit PIN the system informs the inmate that the PIN is being created screen .

If however it is not the first time the inmate has logged into the HomeWAV system from device then screens and and are not displayed. Instead screen is displayed and the inmate is instructed to enter his or her PIN in window using virtual keyboard .

Once the PIN is entered screen is displayed and a status message indicates that the PIN is being validated. Again rotating icon indicates that the device is processing the information.

Once the PIN is validated a new screen is displayed that indicates to the inmate that the application i.e. the HomeWAV system is loading.

When the loading is complete the Inmate sees screen . This is the home screen from which all inmate initiated HomeWAV visitation tasks are managed.

The device is constrained via hardware software firmware or by other means believed to be known to those of skill in the art such that the only options that an inmate may choose are displayed on screen . The four options are 1 viewing received video messages 2 creating and sending a video message 3 initiating a video visit with an authorized visitor and 4 initiating a VoIP phone call to an authorized visitor . The inmate selects the desired action by touching the appropriate controls on the screen of device

Screen presents the inmate a list of visitors who have registered and prepaid for minutes for visitation with that particular inmate. The co pending 498 application includes a complete discussion of visitor registration and payment procedure. Consequently neither visitor registration nor payment procedures are further discussed herein.

An Indicator Key link when selected produces pop up box . Pop up box shows the definitions of all possible colors of indicator s . Selecting control removes pop up box from the screen.

The message Welcome John Doe the actual inmate name is displayed is displayed at the top of the screen . A logout control near the upper right corner of screen when activated logs the inmate out of the HomeWAV system.

A Test your audio and video button allows the inmate to test the operational readiness of his or her device and to ensure that audio volume is properly adjusted.

One or more lines of information only one line shown for simplicity give the inmate the current status of all potential i.e. registered visitors. When multiple potential visitors are registered a line for each such visitor is displayed. The scrolling functions of device are used to select and highlight the desired visitor with whom the inmate wishes to communicate.

The Visitor Name is shown adjacent status indicator . Four option buttons allow the inmate to View Messages Send Message Send Video Call and Send Audio Call respectively.

A message typically provided in both English and Spanish reminds the inmate that any audio call or video visit may be monitored and or recorded.

Selecting View Messages control causes screen to be displayed. A status line displays which of the saved messages is currently being displayed.

A central portion of screen displays an image originated by the person leaving the message being viewed.

Another action selectable from home screen is to record and send a video message. This is accomplished using the Send Messages button . Pressing Send Messages button causes screen to be displayed. It should be noted that the message will be sent to the visitor previously selected on screen .

The name of the visitor to whom the inmate is sending a message is displayed near the top of screen . Again Exit button returns the inmate to home screen .

Most of screen needs no additional explanation as it is in large part a replication of screen previously discussed.

A status message indicates the amount of recording time remaining during which the inmate must complete his or her recording.

Two action buttons Stop Recording and Cancel perform the indicated functions. Selection of the Stop Recording button causes screen to be displayed.

The operation of the novel inmate visitation system of the present invention wherein either inmates or visitors may originate video visitations or VoIP telecommunications has been described in detail hereinabove. It will be recognized that the operation of the inventive system depends upon infrastructure described in detail in the 498 application. For that reason some points regarding the information described and claimed in the 498 application are reiterated below.

As has been described in detail in the co pending 498 application a prison administrator workstation PAWS may be located within the prison and also connected to either a network or directly to a network controller and or switch. In alternate embodiments the PAWS may have its own modem associated and connected directly to the Internet. Also the PAWS may be located outside the prison when desired.

An Internet connection is typically provided between Internet interface modem and the Internet cloud represented schematically at reference number 214 in FIG. 2 of the 498 application.

A visitor workstation or Internet appliance also described in detail in the 498 application is also connected to Internet by a suitable Internet connection.

A HomeWAV LLC website supports a web server. The web server runs application code that implements the applications of the novel remote web based visitation system of the invention. In the embodiment chosen for purposes of disclosure the applications discussed in detail hereinbelow are implemented in either JAVA or PHP http www.php.net . PHP is a server side HTML embedded scripting language that provides web developers with a full suite of tools for building dynamic websites. In addition some custom Adobe Flash ActionScript codes are provided to interact with flash.homeway.com discussed in detail in the 498 application. ActionScript is a dialect of ECMAScript i.e. it is a superset of the syntax and semantics of the language more widely known JavaScript and is used primarily for the development of websites and software targeting the Adobe Flash Player platform. ECMAScript is the scripting language standardized by Ecma International in the ECMA 262 specification and ISO IEC 16262 specifications. The language is widely used for client side scripting on the web.

It will be recognized that website design and implementation is believed to be well known to those of skill in the art. Consequently alternate web development tools languages may be utilized to develop similar applications. Consequently the invention is not considered limited to the development tools and or languages chosen for purposes of disclosure. Rather the invention is intended to include any suitable languages scripts etc.

The HomeWAV LLC website also embodies and supports storage provided to contain application code and the databases necessary to implement the remote web based visitation system of the invention.

A second website associated with the remote web based visitation system of the invention is Flash.HomeWAV.com website. Flash.HomeWAV.com website records and stores all audio video A V visits. As discussed in detail in the 498 application certain A V visits by clergy or legal representatives may be exempt from recording. Typically all other A V visits are recorded by one or more A V servers. Storage devices retain A V transcripts of all visits not exempt from the recording requirement.

Finally one or more HomeWAV Administrators at workstations that include a computer and a modem that are connected to the Internet through an Internet connection provide certain gate keeping and administrative functions by interacting with HomeWAV website. Such gate keeping and administrative functions are also discussed in detail in the 498 application.

Since other modifications and changes varied to fit particular operating requirements and environments will be apparent to those skilled in the art the invention is not considered limited to the example chosen for purposes of disclosure and covers all changes and modifications which do not constitute departures from the true spirit and scope of this invention.

Having thus described the invention what is desired to be protected by Letters Patent is presented in the subsequently appended claims.
