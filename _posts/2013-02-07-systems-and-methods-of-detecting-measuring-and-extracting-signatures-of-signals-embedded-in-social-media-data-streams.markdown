This application claims priority to and is a continuation in part of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 595 975 titled SYSTEMS AND METHODS OF DETECTING MEASURING AND EXTRACTING SIGNATURES OF SIGNALS EMBEDDED IN SOCIAL MEDIA DATA STREAMS the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.

The epic growth of the social web has created rich data sources for predictive analytics. The enormous volume and diversity of information propagating amongst large user communities on micro blogging platforms Twitter in particular and the emergence of social media data aggregation service providers such as GNIP Topsy and StockTwits enable new intriguing opportunities to leverage the information content embedded in social media. In addition to providing huge volumes of minable data for diverse commercial applications social media sources enable real time detection surveillance and estimates of social media signatures for events and entities thus extending the transformation of these data beyond estimation of the social media sentiment expressed for an entity.

The current practice of social media analytics has strongly focused on techniques to estimate the sentiment component of an entity s signature. These techniques employ methods from the discipline of Natural Language Processing NLP in varying degrees and complexity to produce coarse grained sentiment estimates oriented in terms of Positive Negative or Neutral for an entity. One disadvantage of coarse gained estimates is that they are highly sensitive to the thresholds selected to determine the entity s possible three state outcome. Further such discrete estimates are not suitable to time series normalization techniques which allow the detection of changes from an entity s normal sentiment levels or the comparison of one entity s sentiment level to another entity s level on a common measurement basis. The level of social media activity is also an important component of an entity s social media signature. Current analytic techniques estimate an entity s level or intensity of social media activity by counting the total number of mentions of the entity present in micro blogging data streams observed during a time interval or converting the total to an average value observed over the interval. However an activity metric driven solely by the total number of counts does not readily show significant deviations from the entity s normal level of social media activity nor does such a representation allow for comparison of one entity s activity level to another entity s level on a common basis. An example from the domain of stock trading is Apple Inc. stock symbol AAPL which is consistently the most frequently mentioned stock on Twitter. A comparison of the total number of tweets observed during a day for AAPL to the total number observed for a stock with less activity such as Caterpillar Inc. CAT is not useful because tweet volumes for AAPL will always dominate compared to CAT over any observation interval.

In one aspect of the present invention certain disadvantages of known techniques may be remedied by measuring an entity s sentiment on a continuous normalized scale enabling entity to entity comparisons and detection of changes in an entity s sentiment level relative to a sentiment universe such as a broad market sentiment index or a market sector sentiment index as an example drawn from the financial markets and trading application domain. In another aspect of the present invention certain disadvantages of known techniques may be remedied by expressing a stock ticker s level of social media activity on a continuous normalized scale enabling the direct comparison to other stocks using a common metric and the detection of significant changes of the stock ticker s activity level relative to the constituents of a market sector or broad market index.

In one example a system for scoring micro blogging messages includes a private infrastructure and a public infrastructure. The private infrastructure includes an extractor and evaluator a calculator and a publisher. The extractor may be configured to receive micro blogging messages via an application programming interface of at least one micro blogging source to access a set of terms of interest to detect received micro blogging messages having least one of the terms of interest to extract raw data from the micro blogging messages and to store the extracted raw data in a private database the extracted raw data including at least a posting account a posting time and message contents.

The evaluator may be configured to access the stored raw data to parse the stored raw data into tokenized data and to store the tokenized data in the private database. The evaluator may also be configured to detect terms of interest mentioned in the tokenized data to identify relevant micro blogging messages to tag in the private database micro blogging messages that contain a term of interest as being relevant to that term of interest and using a posting account of a micro blogging message to tag the micro blogging message as indicative. Micro blogging messages may be filtered to exclude micro blogging messages from low volume or malicious sources before the remaining messages are tagged as indicative. The evaluator may also be configured to eliminate duplicate micro blogging messages.

The calculator may be configured to access a sentiment dictionary and to access the stored tokenized data of micro blogging messages tagged as indicative. The calculator may be further configured to calculate a sentiment score based on sentiment values of words and phrases in the tokenized data for micro blogging messages tagged as indicative and to calculate a vector of sentiment metrics for a term of interest based on the sentiment scores associated with the term of interest and falling within a predetermined lookback period the calculator further configured to store the vector of sentiment metrics in the private database. The publisher may be configured to access the vectors of sentiment metrics corresponding to a plurality of micro blogging messages and to provide access to the vectors of sentiment metrics.

The public infrastructure may include a public database the public database being populated with vectors of sentiment metrics from the publisher and providing access to the sentiment metric to clients of the system for scoring micro blogging messages.

In one example the vector of sentiment metrics comprises at least a normalized representation of a sentiment time series score over the predetermined lookback period a smoothed weighted average of a sentiment time series score over the predetermined lookback period a volume of indicative micro blogging messages and a change in volume of indicative micro blogging messages relative to the average volume level of relevant micro blogging messages. In another example the vector of sentiment metrics comprises at least a normalized representation of a sentiment time series score over the predetermined lookback period and a measure of diversity of posting accounts contributing to the sentiment time series score. In another example the vector of sentiment metrics comprises at least a normalized representation of a sentiment time series score over the predetermined lookback period and a measure of the change in sentiment volume relative to the average level observed for a sentiment Universe.

The vector of sentiment metrics may further comprise a plurality of vectors of sentiment metrics wherein each vector represents sentiment metrics calculated periodically according a predetermined calculation interval. In one example the calculation interval is 15 minutes and the lookback period is a number of days.

In another example a system for scoring micro blogging messages may be implemented in a relational database having a term table a message table a digest table a digest score table and a sentiment dictionary. The system may also include an extractor an evaluator and a calculator.

The term table includes a set of tennis of interest such as but not limited to stock ticker symbols. The extractor may be configured to receive micro blogging messages via an application programming interface of at least one micro blogging source to detect received micro blogging messages having least one of the terms of interest to extract raw data from the micro blogging messages and to store the extracted raw data in a message table in the database the extracted raw data including at least a posting account a posting time and message contents.

The evaluator may be configured to access the stored raw data in the message table to parse the stored raw data into tokenized data to store the tokenized data in a digest table to detect terms of interest mentioned in the tokenized data to analyze the raw data for indications of relevance and to flag indicative micro blogging messages in a digest score table.

The sentiment dictionary may include sentiment values associated with words and phrases commonly expressed in relevant micro blogging messages. The sentiment dictionary may be included with the calculator.

The calculator may be configured to access a sentiment dictionary and to access the stored digest score table. The calculator may be further configured to calculate a sentiment score based on sentiment values of words and phrases in the tokenized data for micro blogging messages tagged as indicative and to calculate a vector of sentiment metrics for a term of interest based on the sentiment scores associated with the term of interest and falling within a predetermined lookback period. The calculator may be further configured to store the vector of sentiment metrics in a vector table. In one example at least one of the sentiment metrics comprises a normalized representation of a sentiment time series score.

Various aspects of the invention disclosed in the examples provided herein relate generally to the field of social media analytics and specifically to the detection and measurement of the signature of terms of interest as expressed in social media data sources such as the micro blogging platform Twitter. One particularly advantageous domain of application is the financial markets and the entities are the stocks of companies of interest to financial market traders and investors. Various aspects of the invention provide a framework and methods to extract and interpret sentiment signatures for the stocks of companies as expressed in the Twitter messaging stream. This framework can be extended and adapted to other application domains such as media marketing and healthcare where the expression of sentiment through social media is important. Throughout the description for the purposes of explanation specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. It will be apparent however to one skilled in the art that the present disclosure may be practiced without some of these specific details.

The Public Infrastructure maintains a relational database of sentiment signature results and enables public client access to real time and historical sentiment signatures for stocks that are members of the Universe list. The relational database may comprise a MySQL database or any other suitable relational database. The Public Infrastructure may further comprise a web server configured with HTML code and or PHP scripts. Public clients are able to access sentiment estimates using a web browser interface access sentiment estimates using mobile devices tablets and smartphones receive daily pre and post market sentiment reports via email establish stock watch lists to set sentiment signature alerts levels and receive email alerts if sentiment thresholds or target values are met for stocks on a client s watch list receive real time sentiment signatures by subscription to an RSS feed or access historical sentiment signature data via an FTP interface.

One example of a vector of sentiment metrics is known as S Factors. S Factors are a family of metrics which measure and represent the social media signature of an entity as a function of time. S Factors are defined as follows.

S Score is the normalized representation of a sentiment time series S t over a lookback period of W days. S t is computed by summing the sentiment level of all indicative tweets N contributing to an entity s sentiment signature during an observation interval t L t where L is the length of the interval.

S Score is the z score representation of the time series S t created to establish a common scale according to a local mean and standard deviation within a sliding window of W days before time t.

The z score representation transforms a time series to show fluctuations around a zero mean level and expressed on a scale of 1 standard deviation. The z score representation enables entity to entity comparisons of sentiment on a common measurement scale. S Score is a measure of sentiment deviation from a normal state. Typical values range from 2 to 2 with values greater than 4 or less than 4 indicating extreme positive or negative states.

S Scores are computed either weighted or un weighted with respect to the arrival times of contributing tweets. Un weighted means the contributing tweet scores are used directly as the summation is evaluated. Weighted means exponential scaling is applied to place stronger emphasis on recently arrived tweets as the summation is evaluated. A tweet s sentiment score is scaled by an exponential weight function that varies as a function of the arrival time. The weight function has a maximum at the time of the stock s sentiment estimate and decreases smoothly to a minimum at the start of the observation window L periods prior. S Mean is a smoothed weighted average of a sentiment time series S t over a lookback period of W days.

S Mean is viewed as a measure of the current normal sentiment state. A change in S Mean is a sign of a change in trend. It is not a measure of intensity but rather of a directional change. Typical values range between 0 and 4 with the majority less than 1.

S Delta is the percent change in S Score over a lookback period of W days and is a first order measurement of the sentiment trend. A monotonic S Delta over a short period of time can be a stronger indicator of changing sentiment levels.

S Volatility is a percent measurement of the variability of the sentiment level over a lookback period of W days. . Equation 5 where is the standard deviation of S Score within the lookback period t W t .

S Volume is the volume of indicative tweets contributing to a sentiment signature at an observation time t. This metric has a range between 10 and 1 000 for most stocks. Note that actual tweets volume can be 10 or greater. The Evaluator imposes a strong filter and only allows tweets that have financial market relevance to contribute to a stock s sentiment signature. A rapid change in S Volume is a good indication of unusual social media activity but not necessarily of a change in sentiment level. Many times S Volume is dominated by the most active securities in social media such as AAPL GOOG or AMZN. A better indicator is S Volume z the z score normalized representation of the S Volume time series over a lookback period of W days 

This representation enables the direct comparison of the activity of any stock to another using a common basis and the detection of significant changes of a stock s activity level relative to the constituents of a market sector or broad market index.

S Dispersion is a measure of the diversity of the Twitter users that are the source of indicative tweets contributing to a stock s sentiment signature. A dispersion level of 1 indicates that all indicative tweets come from distinct sources. A value near 0 implies that all counts originate from one or a small number of distinct sources.

All else being equal a high S Dispersion is in general desirable compared to a low level indicating that a diverse range of sources contribute to a stock s sentiment signature. The case of low S Dispersion warrants a closer look to assess validity or credibility of the contributing sources.

S Buzz is a measurement of abnormal activity. It compares a stock s change in sentiment volume to the average volume level for the sentiment Universe. Typical values range from 1 to 3 with 0 indicating almost no activity and 1 indicating normal activity. Values greater than 3 indicate an extreme unusual level of social media activity relative to the Universe.

Subject Mention Detection identifies the specific entities mentioned in the text of the tweets. Tweets having content that mentions members of the sentiment Universe are labeled as relevant and are tagged for the corresponding entities. Relevance Assessment is the final step and proceeds to analyze the set of relevant tweets with respect to ratings developed by the disclosed invention for the Twitter accounts that are the originators of the captured tweets. Operational experience has shown that 90 of the tweets determined to be relevant originate from about 10 of the observed Twitter accounts. The 10 portion of accounts that present relevant content are also high volume accounts meaning that these accounts have much higher total number and frequency of tweets presented over time compared to other accounts. Further accounts originating tweets that have content determined to be NOT relevant are typically from low volume sporadically active Twitter users. A filter may be applied to eliminate tweets from low volume originators or originators determined to be malicious transforming the set of relevant tweets to the set of indicative tweets for the entities that will be used in the signature estimation stage. The result of the Evaluator stage populates the DIGEST SCORE table .

Thus for a tweet containing n identified words and m identified two word phrases the tweet s sentiment score is the average value of the total identified sentiment content 

For an entity at time t the sentiment inferred from its associated indicative tweets has been stated previously. Results are stored in the HIT SCORE table .

Bucketing and Weighting takes all scores for an entity s indicative tweets and groups these into time period buckets based on the created time stamps of the tweets as defined in the HIT SCORE table . For the i th indicative tweet a weight function is applied to the tweet s sentiment score as 1 no weighting OR exponential weighting Equation 11 with exponential weighting placing more emphasis on recently arrived tweets.

Normalization and Scoring calculates the S Score and other metrics defined previously. Aggregation Scoring calculates S Score and other metrics for market indices market sectors and industry groups by aggregating the S Scores of the constituent entities. The results populate the BUCKETED SCORE table . These processes are performed for all members of the Universe domain and yield S Factors sentiment signatures .

The Distributor of pushes sentiment signature vectors to the Public database to populate the SUMMARY BY TICKER table .

The horizontal axes are the percentage overnight price change C O . The vertical axes are the percentage open to close price change O C . These data are observed from a sample space of 197 000 events for the stock Universe captured during the first Quarter of 2012. The plots show the events that satisfy the stated conditions on S Score and price.

The scatter plots show that pre market open S Score is a very good estimator of the direction of market at open price changes. The scatter plot for S Score 2.5 has a large number of points in the right two quadrants while the scatter plot for S Score

The table shows the relative frequency of open to close returns. The relatively large frequency of moves of greater than 2 and less than 2 demonstrates that the S Score filtered returns distribution has fat tails. For S Score 2.5 52 of open to close returns are up 36.5 are up greater than 1 and 24 are up greater than 2 . For S Score

The stocks with large positive S Scores significantly outperformed SPY over this period while the stocks with large negative S Scores significantly underperformed relative to the market benchmark. A measure of the risk adjusted performance for this sequence of portfolios is expressed in terms of their annualized Sharpe Ratios as shown in . The Sharpe Ratios were computed at the 95 confidence level with the R statistical programming language using the PerformanceAnalytics package.

In the pre market of Aug. 6 2012 Richard Schulze Founder and former Chairman of Best Buy Co. Inc. submitted a written proposal to the company s Board of Directors to acquire all outstanding shares of the company that he did not already own for a price of 24.00 to 26.00 per share in cash. The proposed purchase price was at a premium of 36 to 47 to Best Buy s closing stock price of 17.64 on Aug. 3 2012. At the time Schulze was Best Buy s largest shareholder controlling 20.1 of BBY shares.

The announcement occurred after 8 15 AM Eastern time. In this example the S Factor metrics are computed continuously at 15 minute bucketed intervals intraday. The S Factor metrics generated for BBY that day detected the leading edge of the social media signature of Schulze s announcement during the computation of the 8 30 AM bucket for Best Buy. Chart shows the dramatic change in Best Buy s S Score and S Volume levels as the news event unfolded. At that time the takeover bid was viewed very favorably resulting in a sharp transition to high positive sentiment levels and an unusual rapid increase in social media activity for the stock as indicated by S Volume.

The major financial news services Bloomberg Reuters and Wall Street Journal began publishing headline stories covering this development starting at 8 44 AM. This event is an excellent example showing that social media content and level of activity can be a leading indicator relative to traditional financial news services.

The company reported EPS of 0.12 in line with analysts estimates and revenues of 1.18 billion beating estimates by 2.6 . Yet the stock sold off sharply ending the week down 38 from its IPO price in May. The decline occurred amid concerns that revenues and user growth are slowing significantly and that business models remain immature even at Facebook the model of excellence for the new era of social networking media and advertising.

Facebook s sentiment signature entered a sustained down trend starting around Noon on July 24 and reached extreme negative levels after the close on July 25. On July 26 the day of the earnings announcement Facebook s S Score maintained negative levels up to the time of the earnings data release at 3 05 PM Central Time.

After the announcement sentiment levels relaxed to neutral after the close on July 26 and into the open of July 27. At the open of July 27 Facebook s S Score made a rapid decline to negative levels reaching high negative levels around 10 AM Central Time. Facebook s stock closed the day at 23.71 a decline of 11.8 .

The market map shows the result of resealing where the areas are a function of a stock s S Volume z metric. In this representation a number of stocks with extreme sentiment levels and unusual social media activity such as KLAC and ULTR are detected and emerge from the clutter of . JCP was retained in the resealing visualization because the stock had extreme negative sentiment and unusually high message volume on May 25. The high message volume stocks of that day such as AAPL and JPM occupy regions appropriate for their sentiment levels and historical normal message volume levels.

The foregoing examples are made for illustrative purposes and not to limit the present invention. The different embodiments and processes may be implemented in software including individual applications combined applications and scripting languages firmware hardware or combinations of the above.
