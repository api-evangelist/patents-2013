The present invention relates to peripheral neural interfaces and in particular to a method to fabricate neural interfaces using 3D projection micro stereolithography.

Peripheral neural interfaces are intended to facilitate the exchange of information between the nervous system and electrical circuits that can be used to control sensorimotor prosthetic devices to restore lost function due to nerve damage and to improve human understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of nervous system operation. This exchange of information can be bidirectional meaning that interfaces are capable of both recording and stimulating neural activity. While neural interface applications vary widely it is generally desirable for the devices to provide a high degree of selectivity i.e. to independently address large numbers of very small bundles of axons at geometries that approach the single micron scale and to stay in place for long periods of time up to many years if possible. Like other tissue interfaces and scaffolds the physical properties of neural interfaces must be carefully tailored to provide the desired function while maintaining the health of the surrounding tissue system. Electrical properties must be tuned to enable the interface to reliably generate and or sense the action potentials that travel in neurons. Recording electrodes are characterized primarily by their site impedance measured at the 1 kHz characteristic frequency which ranges from approximately 50 k to 1 M . Neural stimulation requires safe reversible charge injection typically at levels of tens of microamps for several milliseconds. Biphasic charge pulses are used to balance the total potential at the electrode tissue interface avoiding oxidation and protecting both the electrode and the surrounding tissue. Stimulating and recording microelectrodes typically range from tens of microns to several hundred microns in diameter while extraneural macroelectrodes are generally larger. To maintain the quality of electrical connection required neural interfaces intended for chronic use must also be highly biocompatible and must develop a healthy and intimate coupling to the nerve tissue. Therefore surface biocompatibility structural biocompatibility including the minimization of forces applied to the nerve as it grows and moves and conductivity of the nerve device interface are required for a good neural interface.

One of the more promising neural interfaces that may enable a high degree of interconnectivity is the regenerative or sieve electrode type. Regenerative electrodes require the nerve to be transected and to re grow through an artificial interface ultimately reconnecting with the original or alternative tissue target. The regenerative electrode presents an opportunity to establish a permanent integrated contact between the interface and the nerve. While highly invasive this approach makes sense in cases where the nerve is already severed or in cases such as amputation where the efferent and afferent receptors that the nerve addresses are missing.

However implementing a highly selective healthy regenerative interface has presented a number of challenges. See A. Mannard et al. 183 4124 547 1974 D. J. Edell . BME 33 2 203 1986 G. T. A. Kovacs et al. 39 9 893 1992 T. Akin et al. 41 4 305 1994 Q. Zhao et al. 18 75 1997 and A. F. Mensinger et al. 83 611 2000 . In general axons regenerate in greater numbers to greater length and with greater health through larger holes. See Q. Zhao et al. 18 75 1997 X. Navarro et al. 9 3 151 1996 and S. P. Lacour et al. 17 5 454 2009 . However larger holes decrease selectivity creating a fundamental tradeoff between selectivity and quality of regeneration. Moreover axons are sensitive to physical loading on the implant both during and after regrowth and such loadings can cause high rates of axonal degeneration. See D. J. Edell . BME 33 2 203 1986 . A successful regenerative implant that could be seriously considered for chronic use in humans would need to withstand loading due to patient movement both during and after regeneration and allow axons to grow without significant constriction.

Several approaches to interfacing between electronics and nerves have been evaluated previously and some have shown success including penetrating electrodes sieve electrodes and cuff electrodes. See A. Normann Richard 3 8 444 2007 W. L. C. Rutten 4 407 2002 K. H. Polasek et al. 6 6 066005 2009 . The elastic moduli of these state of the art interface materials are orders of magnitudes higher than the modulus of the peripheral nerves which is around 0.45 MPa. See B. L. Rydevik et al. 8 5 694 701 1990 . The compliance mismatch between the implant and the natural tissue creates stresses at the interfaces impacting interface longevity and nerve health.

Common materials used for neural interfaces have included stainless steel tungsten platinum platinum iridium alloys iridium oxide titanium nitride and PEDOT. See S. F. Cogan 10 275 2008 . Most common materials that are highly electrically conductive notably metals are characterized by also having a large modulus of elasticity low yield strain and high surface hardness meaning that they require large applied forces to deform significantly at either a surface or bulk level and that even small deformations are permanent. Structures that include such materials e.g. wires can be made somewhat flexible by reducing physical dimensions. However at the scale of peripheral nerves it becomes impractical to achieve additional flexibility by shrinking rigid conductive structures.

Therefore a need remains for a regenerative neural interface and a method to fabricate the same that can provide significantly more mechanical flexibility at the interface to the nerve to accommodate both normal movement and natural axonal regrowth. In particular a need remains for neural interfaces that are compatible with the mechanical properties of nerve tissue i.e. generally have low elastic modulus large yield strain and low surface hardness and simultaneously achieve high selective and controllable electrical conductivity.

Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description and the claims.

The present invention is directed to a method to fabricate a neural interface through which transected nerves can grow such that small groups of neurons come into close contact with electrode sites each of which can be connected to electronics external to the interface. The interface can be physically structured to allow neurons to grow through them by including specific openings for the axons or fascicles to grow through. They can be mechanically and biologically compatible with nerves such that they promote neuron growth and allow close integration with biological tissue but do not harm the nervous system. They can exhibit selective and structured conductivity to allow multiple electrically independent electrode sites and the electrical properties of the interface can be tuned to enable the bidirectional transmission of neural signals. Finally the interface can be physically and electrically connected to external circuitry e.g. through attached wires to each of the electrode sites.

The neural interface can be made of composite polymer materials that are tuned via molecular formulation and the addition of small particles to have mechanical properties that are compatible with the mechanical properties of nerve tissue while also having selective electrical conductivity to enable the transmission of electrical signals to and from the neurons. The polymeric composite mat can be mechanically flexible and stretchable so that it can move and flex with the nerve as the nerve moves and grows minimizing the forces that the interface applies to the nerve cells. The composite mat can be made of a biocompatible polymer base material that will interact in a safe and healthy manner with surrounding cells and tissue. For example the base polymer can comprise a polysiloxane such as polydimethylsiloxane PDMS an unsaturated polyester such as polybutylene fumarate PBF or polypropylene fumarate PPF as well as copolymers thereof e.g. PPF poly propylene fumarate diacrylate PPF PPF DA a polyolefin such as poly butadiene polybutadiene and polynorbornene copolymers a polyurethane PU such as PU copolymers including PU polycaprolactone PL PCL poly ester urethane urea PEUU poly ether ester urethane urea PEEUU and thermoplastic polyurethane TPU such as polyester based TPUs mainly derived from adipic acid esters or polyether based TPUs mainly based on tetrahydrofuran ethers a polyimide a polyethylene glycol PEG or poly ethylene oxide PEO including poly ethylene glycol fumarate PEGF oligo PEG fumarate OPF a hydrogel as well as PEG copolymers such as di and tri block polymers polycaprolactone polylactide PEG PEO PCL PLA PEO PEG PCL PEO PCL PCL PEG PLA PEG those including poly lactic acid co glycolic acid alt benzyl L glutamic acid PLGBG such as PLGBG PEG PLGBG those including poly lactic acid co glycolic acid alt L glutamic acid PLGG such as PLGG PEG PLGG PEG PCL PEG PEG poly DTE carbonate ethylene vinylacetate copolymer and poly ether ester amide s PEEAs formed by polycondensation of PEG and diester diamide to create an amphiphilic system or a ring opening metathesis polymerization ROMP formed polymer such as norbornene. It can have patterned holes channels or openings through which neurons can grow.

Further the composite mat can be made electrically conductive by adding some volume fraction of conductive particles e.g. carbon nanotubes and other particles and or conductive particle precursors e.g. graphene oxide or a metal salt which can be thermally reduced such as with silver nitrate to the polymer base material. As the volume fraction of particulate precursor is increased in the composite material the composite material s physical properties transition from being approximately equal to the properties of the polymer base material to approaching the properties of the particulate precursor. Therefore as the volume fraction of electrically conductive particles precursors is increased the electrical conductivity of the composite material increases accordingly. By selecting particles precursors with large aspect ratios ratio of length to diameter such as carbon nanotubes the electrical properties of the composite can be made to transition to the properties of the particles at a lower volume fraction than the mechanical properties. Therefore polymer composites can be created with high electrical conductivity approaching the conductivity of carbon nanotubes and with low elastic modulus and high yield strain approaching the mechanical properties of the base polymer . The interface can be made to be selectively conductive by locally varying the concentration of conducting particulates. That is specific regions of the mat proximate the electrode sites can be made electrically conductive by filling with a high local volume fraction of conducting particulates while other regions between the electrode sites can be made to be electrical insulators by using a low or zero local volume fraction of conducting particulates.

Electrically conductive regions or electrodes can be incorporated with the mat by any useful process. For instance such regions can be constructed by including electrically conductive particles e.g. carbon nanotubes and or by including conductive particle precursors e.g. photoreducible metal salts or graphene oxide . Another exemplary process includes use of thin evaporated metals e.g. gold to form flexible conducting electrodes. Other processes can be used so long as beneficial properties of the mat are retained. Such beneficial properties include e.g. maintaining appropriate flexibility of the implant e.g. a modulus approximately close to a nerve such as a peripheral nerve having a modulus of 0.45 MPa maintaining appropriate pore sizes e.g. to allow infiltration and interconnection of nerves etc.

The geometry required for optimal nerve growth can be determined from in vivo experiments. Holes or pores are preferably large enough to allow neurons to grow through but small enough to enable interfacing with specific neurons with tight spatial resolution. Previous designs that encouraged neuron growth through holes in rigid materials e.g. silicon caused a significant negative impact on the health of the nerve over time. See X. Navarro et al. 10 229 2005 . As the neurons grew they experienced increasing pressure from the rigid orifices ultimately resulting in neuron death. Therefore interfaces can be made out of materials that have mechanical properties similar to those of neurons. Although there is a potentially wide variation across different types of nerves the literature suggests that nerves behave viscoelastically and have elastic moduli of tens to hundreds of kPa the Young s modulus for a peripheral nerve has been estimated to be 580 150 kPa . See M. K. Kwan et al. 63 267 1992 and G. H. Borschel et al. 114 133 2003 . Proper stiffness can be achieved by manipulating the material properties of the base polymer the material properties and volume fraction of the particulates and the structural geometry of the neural interface.

Whether used for neural stimulation or recording impedance at the electrode is preferably low. For recording the literature suggests electrode site impedance on the order of 100 kOhm to 1 MOhm with lower being preferable. Site size is generally several thousand mor less. See S. Cogan 10 275 2008 . For stimulation the site acts as a current source and charge injection capacity is critical and typically varies widely between several C cmand several mC cm. Site impedance is preferably low enough to output adequate charge without voltage exceeding the electrolysis threshold around 1.2 V . Impedance is typically measured at the biologically relevant frequency of 1 kHz. Conductors preferably have impedance several orders of magnitude lower than the electrode sites in order to transmit the signals without distortion. They preferably also have minimal capacitance so as not to filter signals with content into at least the tens of kHz. Ideally cutoff frequencies can be in the hundreds of kHz or beyond.

The present invention is directed to a method to fabricate neural interfaces using three dimensional 3D projection micro stereolithography P SL . P SL can be used to create conductive porous networks to meet the materials requirements for improved prosthetic neural interface devices through which transected nerves may grow such that small groups of nerve fibers come into close contact with electrode sites. The neural interfaces can have material properties that support a healthy functional nerve device interface using biocompatible polymers such as polysiloxanes e.g. polydimethylsiloxane PDMS or polyesters e.g. polybutylene fumarate PBF which have lower modulus of elasticity relative to previously used silicon glass or metal interface materials. The mechanical properties of these polymers can be made similar to those of many biological tissues. In particular PDMS and similar polymers are widely used for biomedical and implantable applications and generally exhibit a high degree of biocompatibility. PDMS and similar polymers can also be made to be highly elastic supporting yield strains sometimes exceeding 100 . The polymers can be loaded with some volume fraction of multi walled carbon nanotubes MWNTs or other conducting particles to make the composite material electrically conductive while preserving the favorable mechanical and biocompatible properties of the base polymer. Key considerations include achieving high surface area and a porous structure to enable integration with the nerve biocompatibility and electrical conductivity.

P SL is a versatile low cost process that can be used to rapidly create highly complex micro 3 D polymer structures. Because P SL is an additive process it is possible to make highly complex structures which are not possible via etching or other removal processes. The process can produce very high aspect ratio structures 10 without limit in vertical direction. See J. Muskin et al. 87 5 512 2010 A. Bertsch et al. 107 1 3 275 1997 . As shown in a computer and LCD projector can be used to display an image of regular pores onto a substrate having a UV or photo curable polymer resin deposited thereon. Once a layer is polymerized the stage drops the substrate by a predefined layer thickness and the LCD projector displays the next image for the polymerization of the next layer on top of the preceding one. This proceeds iteratively until all the layers are complete. After exposure the patterned polymer can be developed to reveal the regular array of pores.

For example the polymer resin can comprise methacryloxypropyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane PDMS and the photoinitiator bisacyl phosphine oxide BAPO as shown in . However BAPO is not soluble in PDMS. Therefore chloroform CHCl can be used to disperse the BAPO within the methacrylate capped PDMS. Cross link density and rate can be controlled by the light intensity. The cross linked array structure can be developed using various solvent systems including dichloroethane hexane toluene and water.

As an example a solution of phenylbis 2 4 6 trimethylbenzoyl phosphine oxide 0.03 g was dissolved in 300 uL of CHCl. This solution was then added to methacryloxypropyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane 3 g and vortexed briefly to ensure solution homogeneity. A 1 1 inch silicon chip was placed on the stage of the printing apparatus to this chip was added 150 L of the PDMS BAPO solution. The solution is allowed to self level 2 minutes and then was exposed for 30 seconds. Upon exposure the cross linked structure was developed using various solvent systems. Once rinsed the structure was further cross linked via a UV source 365 nm .

Many solvents and solvent combinations can be used to determine the ideal development conditions and feature size. In particular the development solvent plays a key role in the final feature size as shown in . Combinations of solvents can be used as developers in order to fully develop and reveal the pores. As shown in the smallest pores can be fabricated using sequential development conditions for example starting with a toluene rinse followed by a water rinse. For example a toluene water solvent combination resulted in 79 m diameter pores.

To provide an electrically active material interface the P SL technique was also used to pattern regular arrays of pores with PDMS containing multi walled carbon nanotubes MWNT . Projection micro stereolithography of the MWNT loaded PDMS requires approximately two times as much exposure time to ensure patterning. The increased exposure time was due to light absorption by the MWNTs themselves which slows photo crosslinking of the methacryloxypropyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane. is an optical image of patterned holes fabricated in PDMS containing 10 w w MWNTs. The features sizes of the holes shown are approximately 910 m 687 m and 458 m. A large area 1 1 inch array of pores in PDMS was fabricated using the P SL technique in combination with a toluene developing solution . For this array pore diameters of 221 m with a pitch of 527 m were attained.

The present invention has been described as a method to fabricate neural interfaces using 3D projection lithography. It will be understood that the above description is merely illustrative of the applications of the principles of the present invention the scope of which is to be determined by the claims viewed in light of the specification. Other variants and modifications of the invention will be apparent to those of skill in the art.

The neural interface and or polymer mats of the invention can further include one or more therapeutic agents. Such therapeutic agents can be beneficial for promoting nerve regeneration and growth reducing inflammatory responses to implantation of a neural interface and or minimizing scar tissue formation.

The therapeutic agent can be included in the neural interface by any useful method. For instance during the fabrication steps one or more therapeutic agents can be dispersed within the photo curable polymer resin. This approach may be desired e.g. to store the therapeutic agent within the bulk of the polymer resin and or to promote time delayed release of the agent such as by degradation or surface erosion of the polymerized resin after implantation.

In another embodiment one or more therapeutic agents can be dispersed within the solvent system used for developing the imaged substrate. For example and without limitation such an approach may be desired if the therapeutic agent is photosensitive to the light source used in photocuring step. Using this approach the therapeutic agent can be deposited on the surface and within the pores of the neural interface by adsorption absorption or a combination thereof. Optionally the surface and pores of the neural interface are activated to promote covalent or non covalent binding between the surface and the therapeutic agent.

In yet another embodiment the neural interface is first formed using the P SL method and a subsequent functionalization step is used to include the therapeutic agent. Exemplary non limiting functionalization steps include immersing the porous polymer mat in a solvent e.g. water a buffer etc. including the therapeutic agent and or directly modifying the surface of the porous polymer mat with one or more therapeutic agents optionally using a tether e.g. a polyethylene glycol PEG linker a PEO PPO PEO linker having poly propylene oxide PPO and poly ethylene oxide PEO and or an alkane chain .

Another non limiting functionalization step includes coating the porous polymer mat with a biocompatible film containing a therapeutic agent. The film can be formed from any useful material including a polymer including ethylene vinyl acetate silicone PEG PEG copolymers polyethyleneimine PEI polyimide PI polyurethane PU polycaprolactone PCL PCL fumarate PCLF poly acrylonitrile PAN including PAN methacrylate polylysine including poly D lysine poly styrenesulfonate PSS PSS PEG copolymers poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate pHEMA poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate co methyl methacrylate pHEMA MMA a polypyrrole polyglycolic acid PGA polylactic acid PLA including poly L lactide PLLA and poly D lactide PDLA PGA PLA copolymers as well as copolymers of any of these a hydrogel including PEG and or a poloxamer e.g. a triblock copolymer including PPO and PEO such as PEO PPO PEO a natural scaffold material such as heparin laminin fibronectin agarose alginate chitosan cellulose e.g. methylcellulose or nitrocellulose collagen dextran fibrin or hyaluronan hyaluronic acid a conductive polymer such as polypyrrole PPy or polyaniline PANi and combinations thereof such as collagen PCL PAN methacrylate PEG collagen PPy PLGA PLLA PANi PCLF PPy or PPy chitosan e.g. in a multilayered film . The biocompatible film can be formed by any useful process including electrospinning coating casting spreading dipping and or spraying a solution including the therapeutic agent and the polymer monomer forming the film layer.

Furthermore the incorporation of one or more therapeutic agents can be optimized based on the type of agent. For instance one or more ECM molecules e.g. any described herein could be incorporated into the neural interface in any useful manner. In one embodiment the ECM molecule could be incorporated into the polymer resin solution prior to crosslinking allowing such molecules to be physically entrapped into the polymer matrix. In particular embodiments entrapment includes use of one or more hydrophilic polymers. In another embodiment the ECM molecule is adsorbed onto the surface of the implant. In yet another embodiment when the ECM molecule is a protein such protein sequences e.g. sequences including RGD IKVAV SEQ ID NO 1 or YIGSR SEQ ID NO 2 can be crosslinked into the polymer network by adding photoactive functional crosslinking groups to the protein sequence e.g. adding acrylate or methacrylate groups to end s and or using crosslinkable amino acid sequences such as amino acids including a sulfhydryl group an azide group an diazirine group a hydroxyl group an amino group or an aldehyde group . Crosslinking can optionally include use of a crosslinking agent such as disuccinimidyl suberate DSS bismaleimidoethane BMOE bis sulfosuccinimidyl suberate BS3 dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC sulfosuccinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate Sulfo SMCC n unit ethyleneglycol functionalized with succinimidyl and maleimido ends SM PEG n where n is 2 4 6 8 or 12 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDC N hydroxysuccinimide NHS N hydroxysulfosuccinimide Sulfo NHS psoralen such as succinimidyl 4 psoralen 8 yloxy butyrate SPB or p maleimidophenyl isocyanate PMPI . Although these embodiments include an ECM molecule a skilled artisan would understand that any therapeutic agent e.g. a drug a growth factor etc. could be incorporated in any of the steps described above.

In another example the neural interface is modified to deliver one or more therapeutic agents such as drugs growth factors cytokines chemokines peptides etc. or any described herein. In one embodiment the therapeutic agent is adsorbed onto the surface of the implant. In another embodiment the therapeutic agent is incorporated into the polymer resin solution prior to crosslinking. In this manner the agent is physically entrapped within the polymer matrix. In particular embodiments the resin includes one or more hydrophilic polymers. In other embodiment the agent is entrapped within microparticles e.g. degradable or nondegradable microparticles that are included in the polymer solution before crosslinking. This method may be beneficial to protect the therapeutic agent from harsh conditions as well as to tune the rate of controlled release.

In some embodiments the agent is included in the neural interface obtained after P SL. For instance the agent can be included in a degradable matrix which is further disposed within the pores of the polymer mat. In another instance the agent can be included in a degradable layer on one or both sides of the implant where the degradable layer includes a therapeutic agent that is optionally present in nanoparticles and or microparticles. The degradable layer can be included in any useful manner such as by coating casting spreading dipping and or spraying a solution including the therapeutic agent and the polymer monomer forming the degradable layer. In yet other embodiments one or more degradable or non degradable layers are included by electrospinning microfibers or nanofibers on one or both sides of implant where the implant and or the microfiber or nanofiber contains therapeutics for controlled release.

In other embodiments the agent is included in the neural interface during the P SL process. For instance the implant can be a multilayered device formed by P SL where the outermost layer includes a degradable delivery vehicle e.g. a degradable layer including one or more therapeutic agents optionally present in nanoparticles and or microparticles . In particular embodiments the implant include a plurality of degradable layers where each layer includes a different combination of therapeutic agents. In other embodiments each layer includes the same therapeutic agent having different release profiles.

For any methods and implants described herein any of the methods described herein can be used to include multiple agents. In some embodiments each agent can be released to have a unique release profile i.e. temporal control . In other embodiments each agent can be released in a manner that varies with the location of the agent i.e. spatial control where the location can be either within the z dimension of the implant e.g. along the thickness of the implant or the x or y dimension of the implant e.g. along the surface of implant provided in .

For any methods and implants described herein agents can be selected to promote nerve regeneration. For instance the agent can be those that target different cell types involved in regeneration e.g. one or more of nerves stem cells immune response cells etc. . In other embodiments the agent is a neurotrophin e.g. any described herein .

The therapeutic agent can be present in any useful form. For instance the therapeutic agent can be encapsulated in one or more particles or fibers e.g. microparticles microspheres beads nanoparticles microfibers and or nanofibers produced by one or more cells present in one or more degradable or non degradable films or coatings and or covalently or non covalently attached to the surface of the neural implant.

For any of the approaches described herein a skilled artisan would understand how to optimize the fabrication steps to promote particular release characteristics of the therapeutic agent. For instance the developing step can be optimized to control the crosslinking density of the polymer which can affect the release profile of the therapeutic agent by diffusion and or erosion of the polymer. Crosslinking density can be controlled in many ways such as by modifying the concentration of the polymer precursor in the polymer resin by adjusting the concentration of the photoinitiator and or ratio of photo crosslinkable reactive groups to non reactive groups and or by regulating the curing time of the resin or the light intensity used for stereolithography. The release profile of the therapeutic agent can be further optimized by fine tuning the pore size within the neural interface the loading amount of one or more therapeutic agents optionally encapsulated within a particle as described herein the composition of the polymer resin the affinity of a coating to the therapeutic agent etc. In addition release profiles can be controlled through selection of material and method of inclusion of the agent.
