In particular embodiments a concept node may represent a third party webpage or resource hosted by a third party system . The third party webpage or resource may include among other elements content a selectable or other icon or other inter actable object which may be implemented for example in JavaScript AJAX or PHP codes representing an action or activity. As an example and not by way of limitation a third party webpage may include a selectable icon such as like check in eat recommend or another suitable action or activity. A user viewing the third party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons e.g. eat causing a client system to send to social networking system a message indicating the user s action. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge e.g. an eat edge between a user node corresponding to the user and a concept node corresponding to the third party webpage or resource and store edge in one or more data stores.

In particular embodiments a pair of nodes in social graph may be connected to each other by one or more edges . An edge connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes. In particular embodiments an edge may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may indicate that a second user is a friend of the first user. In response to this indication social networking system may send a friend request to the second user. If the second user confirms the friend request social networking system may create an edge connecting the first user s user node to the second user s user node in social graph and store edge as social graph information in one or more of data stores . In the example of social graph includes an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user A and user B and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user C and user B. Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular edges with particular attributes connecting particular user nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes . As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent a friendship family relationship business or employment relationship fan relationship follower relationship visitor relationship subscriber relationship superior subordinate relationship reciprocal relationship non reciprocal relationship another suitable type of relationship or two or more such relationships. Moreover although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected. Herein references to users or concepts being connected may where appropriate refer to the nodes corresponding to those users or concepts being connected in social graph by one or more edges .

In particular embodiments an edge between a user node and a concept node may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user associated with user node toward a concept associated with a concept node . As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in a user may like attended played listened cooked worked at or watched a concept each of which may correspond to a edge type or subtype. A concept profile page corresponding to a concept node may include for example a selectable check in icon such as for example a clickable check in icon or a selectable add to favorites icon. Similarly after a user clicks these icons social networking system may create a favorite edge or a check in edge in response to a user s action corresponding to a respective action. As another example and not by way of limitation a user user C may listen to a particular song Ramble On using a particular application SPOTIFY which is an online music application . In this case social networking system may create a listened edge and a used edge as illustrated in between user nodes corresponding to the user and concept nodes corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application. Moreover social networking system may create a played edge as illustrated in between concept nodes corresponding to the song and the application to indicate that the particular song was played by the particular application. In this case played edge corresponds to an action performed by an external application SPOTIFY on an external audio file the song Imagine . Although this disclosure describes particular edges with particular attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes . Moreover although this disclosure describes edges between a user node and a concept node representing a single relationship this disclosure contemplates edges between a user node and a concept node representing one or more relationships. As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent both that a user likes and has used at a particular concept. Alternatively another edge may represent each type of relationship or multiples of a single relationship between a user node and a concept node as illustrated in between user node for user E and concept node for SPOTIFY .

In particular embodiments social networking system may create an edge between a user node and a concept node in social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation a user viewing a concept profile page such as for example by using a web browser or a special purpose application hosted by the user s client system may indicate that he or she likes the concept represented by the concept node by clicking or selecting a Like icon which may cause the user s client system to send to social networking system a message indicating the user s liking of the concept associated with the concept profile page. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge between user node associated with the user and concept node as illustrated by like edge between the user and concept node . In particular embodiments social networking system may store an edge in one or more data stores. In particular embodiments an edge may be automatically formed by social networking system in response to a particular user action. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user uploads a picture watches a movie or listens to a song an edge may be formed between user node corresponding to the first user and concept nodes corresponding to those concepts. Although this disclosure describes forming particular edges in particular manners this disclosure contemplates forming any suitable edges in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments one or more images e.g. stored on client system may be uploaded by a user to social networking system . As an example the user may manually upload images stored on client system to social networking system . As another example client system may automatically upload images stored on client system to social networking system through image synching e.g. depending on privacy settings of the user . In particular embodiments an application or operating system OS of client system may upload images to social networking . Social networking system may also receive images from a third party system a shared archive or space or any other image source. A user may designate as private or otherwise restrict access to one or more images or grant access to one or more images to certain other users of social networking system based at least in part on privacy settings of the user.

In particular embodiments images that have been uploaded to social networking system may be associated with metadata on the social networking system. The metadata may be manually generated by one or more users of the social networking system. As an example if an image is a photo including one or more users of the social networking system the photo may be tagged or labeled e.g. by the uploading user or by any user of the social networking system with the permission to do so with metadata indicating the names or identifiers of users in the photo. As another example if the image is a photo taken at a particular location or time the photo may be tagged with metadata including the location which may in particular embodiments correspond to a concept node in the social graph or with date or time information as well. Similarly if the image is a photo that contains buildings logos or brands or any other concepts associated with concept nodes in the social graph the photo may be tagged with metadata including the identifiers of the corresponding concept nodes. In particular embodiments the metadata associated with an image may be automatically generated by social networking system . As an example social networking system may automatically tag an image with metadata including the identifier of the user who uploaded the image. As another example the social networking system may automatically detect or recognize one or more faces in an uploaded image. This may for example be done using any suitable face detection or face recognition algorithm. As an example a face recognition algorithm may analyze facial characteristics found in an uploaded image and identify faces based on a comparison to facial characteristics associated with a known set of faces e.g. the faces of users of social networking system as determined from user photos . Based on the faces detected or recognized in the uploaded image social networking system may automatically determine that one or more users of the social networking system are present in the image and may depending on the users individual privacy settings tag the image with metadata including the identifiers of those users present in the image. As another example the social networking system may automatically detect or recognize objects including locations buildings logos or brands or concepts associated with concept nodes in the social graph in an uploaded image e.g. using any suitable computer vision algorithm or any suitable set of known objects . The social networking system may automatically tag the image with metadata including the identifiers of those concept nodes in the social graph that correspond to the automatically detected items.

In particular embodiments images e.g. images uploaded to social networking system may be displayed to one or more users of the social networking system. Images may be displayed for example using any suitable image layout algorithm. As an example images may be displayed in a grid format within a webpage. Each image in the grid may be displayed using a fixed size viewing region or viewport. In certain cases the size of an image may not be equal to the size of the viewport. In these cases the image may be displayed to fit entirely within the viewport e.g. with scaling or the addition of borders or the image may be cropped to the size of the viewport. Cascading Style Sheets CSS may be used to implement either display style using for example the background size property and the contain or cover values for background size. 

In particular embodiments an image may be scaled to a particular size e.g. to equal one or more dimensions of a viewport . The image may for example be scaled based on the size or dimensions of the viewport. In the example of image has a width that is greater than its height e.g. the aspect ratio of image is greater than 1 . In particular embodiments if the image to be scaled is more horizontal than the viewport e.g. the aspect ratio of the image is greater than the aspect ratio of the viewport then the image may be scaled to equal the height of the viewport. In the example of image has an aspect ratio that is greater than the aspect ratio of viewport so image may be scaled to equal the height of viewport . In particular embodiments if the image to be scaled is more vertical than the viewport e.g. the aspect ratio of the image is less than the aspect ratio of the viewport then the image may be scaled to equal the width of the viewport. An image may in particular embodiments be scaled before it is cropped to a particular size e.g. the size of the viewport .

In particular embodiments an image may be cropped to a particular size e.g. the size of a viewport . The image may be cropped based on the locations of one or more points of interest in the image and the size or dimensions of the viewport. In particular embodiments a point of interest in an image may be associated with or identified by a tag label or other metadata associated with the image. A point of interest may include as examples a person e.g. a user of the social networking system a portion of a person e.g. a face a location a building a logo a brand text an object or a user or concept associated with a node in the social graph of the social networking system. illustrates an example image with five points of interest and which may for example correspond to faces of five people e.g. automatically detected by social networking system or manually tagged by users of the social networking system . In particular embodiments once an image is scaled to equal a dimension of a viewport the image may be cropped based on the locations of its points of interest along an axis corresponding to a second dimension of the viewport. In the example of image may first be scaled to equal the height of viewport before image is cropped based on the locations of its points of interest along a horizontal axis corresponding to the width of viewport . The locations of points of interest and along the horizontal axis are represented respectively by the Xs marked and .

In particular embodiments an image may be cropped to fit a viewport that is positioned to include the maximum number of points of interest of the image. illustrates five possible viewport test positions and for viewport with respect to locations of the points of interest of image along the horizontal axis. The width of viewport the dimension of the viewport corresponding to the horizontal axis is represented by the width of the shaded box at each viewport test position. In particular embodiments the number of points of interest falling within the viewport when the viewport is located at each point of interest is determined. The viewport may for each test position be located such that a boundary of the viewport in a particular dimension of the image coincides with the location of a point of interest. In the example of the leftmost boundary of the viewport with respect to the horizontal axis corresponding to the width of the image is placed at the location of each point of interest. When viewport is located at viewport test position only two points of interest and are within the viewport. When viewport is located at viewport test position three points of interest and are within the viewport. When viewport is located at viewport test position only two points of interest and are within the viewport. When viewport is located at viewport test position only two points of interest and are within the viewport. Finally when viewport is located at viewport test position only one point of interest is within the viewport. The maximum number of points of interest of image that may fit in viewport is therefore determined to be 3. Thus viewport test position is determined to be the viewport position including this maximum number of points of interest. Image may be cropped to fit viewport when viewport is located at viewport position .

In particular embodiments once the viewport test position including the maximum number of points of interest is determined the viewport position may be adjusted before cropping the image. As illustrated in the viewport test position e.g. including the maximum number of points of interest may not be centered about the points of interest. There may for example be an amount of image space or padding d that remains in viewport . In particular embodiments a viewport may be repositioned to be centered about the points of interest it contains before cropping the image to fit in the viewport. In the example of viewport may be centered such that the padding may be d on either side of the three points of interest contained by the viewport. In particular embodiments if more than one viewport test position includes the maximum number of points of interest the test position including the most padding e.g. the test position for which d is greatest may be chosen as the viewport position for cropping the image. In particular embodiments one or more of the points of interest may be required to be in the final cropped image. In these embodiments only those viewport test positions located at points of interest that may be contained in a viewport with the required point of interest may be tested. As an example in point of interest corresponding to location is a required point of interest e.g. it must be in the final cropped image . Because a viewport located at location may not contain both point of interest and point of interest corresponding to location point of interest and location are removed from the set of viewport test positions. Similarly point of interest and location are removed from the set of viewport test positions. Thus in the case when point of interest is a required point of interest there are only three viewport test positions from which one will be chosen based on the number of points of interest it contains. In particular embodiments one or more of the points of interest may be assigned a numerical weight or value based e.g. on data from social graph such that the viewport test position associated with the highest numerical value calculated e.g. by summing the weights or values of each point of interest included in the viewport test position is chosen as the viewport position for cropping the image.
