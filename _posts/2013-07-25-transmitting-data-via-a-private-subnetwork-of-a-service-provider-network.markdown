title: Transmitting data via a private sub-network of a service provider network
abstract: A first device may receive data associated with a second device from within a first network and independently of a second network. The second device may include a sensor or an application to form or process a data record. The first device may establish a bearer between the first device and a particular user device, of multiple user devices, in accordance with a bearer policy; and provide the data towards the particular user device via a first sub-network, of multiple sub-networks, of the second network and via the bearer. The first sub-network may be independent of a second sub-network of the multiple sub-networks. The second sub-network may permit user device data to be transmitted between the multiple user devices. The first sub-network and the second sub-network may consume different levels of network resources.

Data flows are sometimes transmitted over a network such as a cellular network to data requestor data repository an application server and or some other location. Transmitting data flows over the cellular network can be costly particularly when a provider associated with the cellular network provides greater network resources than is needed to transmit the data flows. Also access of the cellular network via individual client devices can be costly when a service provider associated with the cellular network charges for cellular network access of each client device.

The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.

Systems and or methods as described herein may provide a private sub network hereinafter referred to as a private network within a service provider network to transmit data to from multiple client devices e.g. machine to machine M2M devices and or some other type of client devices . In some implementations the private network may prevent direct access of the client devices and of data gathered by the client devices thereby improving security of the client devices and the security of the data. In some implementations the private network may include bearers that that provide sufficient network resources to transmit data to from the client devices without providing excess network resources that may not be needed to transmit the data.

In some implementations the private network may provide fewer network resources than the public network while providing sufficient network resources to transmit data to from the client devices. For example client device data e.g. data relating to data gathered by client devices and or processed by associated app devices may be require fewer network resources for transmission than data associated with user devices.

In some implementations an access server may receive a request e.g. from a requesting user device to communicate with the central app device e.g. via a portal or via some other technique in order to receive data gathered by one or more client devices connected to the central app device provision the client devices send a control instruction to the client devices and or communicate with the client devices in some other manner. Based on receiving the request the access server may provide the request to the central app device via the private network. In some implementations the central app device may receive the request and may communicate with the one or more client devices to process the request within a local sensor network connecting the one or more client devices and the central app device. In some implementations the central app device may form a response to the request and may provide the response to the requesting user device via the private network.

As shown in client device data e.g. data relating to data gathered by the client devices may be transmitted via the private network instead of via the public network. As described above the private network may provide fewer network resources than the public network while providing sufficient network resources to transmit the client device data. As a result network load on the service provider network may be reduced by transmitting the client device data via a private network that provides fewer network resources than the public network resources without degrading the transmission of the client device data.

The software instructions contained in main memory may direct processor to perform processes that will be described later. Alternatively hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes described herein. Thus implementations described herein are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.

In some implementations device may include additional components fewer components different components or differently arranged components than are shown in .

As shown in data structure may include central app device information field data information field bearer policy field and transmission instructions field .

Central app device information field may include information that identifies a particular central app device associated with a particular instance of data structure . For example central app device information field may store an identifier of central app device e.g. a serial number a broadcast identifier a network address or the like . Additionally or alternatively central app device information field may store information that identifies authorization information that access server may use to authorize user device to communicate with central app device e.g. to provide a communication request having a request for data gathered processed by client device and or app device a control instruction for client device etc. . For example central app device information field may include a list of user IDs a list of device IDs a list of geographic locations and or some other information list that may be used to authorize user device to communicate with central app device . In some implementations the lists may be white lists and or black lists.

As an example assume that user device provides a communication request to access server to request to communicate with central app device . In some implementations the communication request may include a user ID a device ID information identifying a location of user device and or some other authorization authentication related information e.g. biometrics information a security key a password etc. . Based on the information included in the communication request central app device may authorize user device to communicate with central app device when the information included in the communication request matches the information stored by central app device information field . In some implementations e.g. when less than all of the information in the communication request matches the information stored by central app device information field central app device may allow partial access e.g. to allow user device to receive a particular subset of data gathered processed by client device and or app device or may deny access to data gathered processed by client device and or app device completely.

In some implementations central app device information field may also include information identifying tasks that user device may perform. For example central app device information field may identify particular user devices that may provide a particular control instruction and or a particular management instruction to client device . Additionally or alternatively central app device information field may identify particular user devices that may provide provisioning information and or updates to provisioning information for client device and or app device e.g. data gathering instructions processing instructions etc. .

Data information field may store information identifying network topology associated with sensor network . Further data information field may store information identifying one or more sensor types implemented by client device an ID of client device a data class associated with data gathered by client device an ID of an app device used to process data gathered by client device information identifying an application used by app device to process the data and or some other information associated with data gathered by client device and or processed by app device .

For example assume that the client device having the ID 123 includes a temperature sensor. Further assume that data gathered by the temperature sensor is categorized as class 1 data. Further assume that the client device having the ID 123 is to provide the data to the app device having the ID A123 and that the app device having the ID A123 is to use application 1 to process data gathered by the temperature sensor. Given these assumptions data information field may store information to identify that client device having the ID 123 includes a temperature sensor that the data gathered by the temperature sensor is categorized as class 1 data that the data is processed using application 1 by the app device having the ID A123. As described below the data class may correspond to a particular transmission policy. That is class 1 data may be associated with a different transmission policy than class 2 data.

Bearer policy field and transmission instructions field may store transmission policies for the transmission of client device data e.g. data gathered by client device and or processed by app device . In some implementations the client device data may be transmitted via a private network of service provider network . As shown in a transmission policy may be based on a data class. Bearer policy field may store information identifying how data corresponding to the transmission of client device data is to be treated e.g. network resources that may be provided to transmit the data . For example bearer policy field may store information that identifies Quality of Service QoS policies for a bearer that is to be used to transmit the data.

In some implementations central app device may establish a particular bearer to transmit data based on information stored by bearer policy field and based on a class of the data. As an example assume that class 1 data is to be transmitted via a bearer that provides less than a 100 kilobits per second kbps bit rate less than 300 ms of latency and less than 300 ms of jitter. Given these assumptions bearer policy field may store information that identifies that central app device is to establish for class 1 data a bearer that provides less than a 100 kilobits per second kbps bit rate less than 300 milliseconds ms of latency and less than 300 ms of jitter. As described in greater detail below central app device may establish the bearer by signaling information for the bearer to a PCRF associated with a private network of service provider network .

Transmission instructions field may store information that identifies instructions for the transmission of client device data. For example transmission instructions field may store information that identifies a time at which client device data is to be transmitted an interval e.g. a frequency at which the client device data is to be transmitted a recipient that may receive access the client device data e.g. based on an IP address of the recipient a short message service SMS address of the recipient an e mail address of the recipient or the like and whether the client device data is to be provided based on receiving a request or provided automatically. For example the client device data may be provided automatically at a particular time and or at a particular frequency. Additionally or alternatively the client device data may be provided based on an alert that is triggered when the value of the client device data satisfies a particular threshold.

As an example an alert may trigger when a temperature sensor detects a temperature that exceeds or drops below a particular threshold. Additionally or alternatively the alert may trigger when a motion detector detects a motion when a meter detects that a resource level drops below a particular threshold when a facility alarm switch is triggered based on unauthorized access etc. In some implementations data may be transmitted at off peak times in order to reduce network load and to reduce costs associated with transmitting the client device data.

As described above transmission instructions field may store information that identifies recipients that may receive access client device data. For example transmission instructions field may store information identifying particular user devices that may receive the client device data. Additionally or alternatively transmission instructions field may store information that identifies that client device data of a particular class may be made public and may be made available to any user device .

In some implementations transmission policies stored by bearer policy field and or transmission instructions field may be based on a subscription level of a user of user device . For example different bearer policies and different transmission instructions may be associated with users of different subscription levels.

In some implementations an operator of user device may communicate with central app device e.g. via a web portal to select transmission polices based on charges that the operator of user device may be willing to incur to receive the client device data. In some implementations information stored by bearer policy field and or transmission instructions field may be based on the transmission policies selected by the operator.

While particular fields are shown in a particular format in data structure in practice data structure may include additional fields fewer fields different fields or differently arranged fields than are shown in . Also illustrates examples of information stored by data structure . In practice other examples of information stored by data structure are possible. For example data structure may store billing information that identifies charges associated with providing data gathered by client device . In some implementations the charges may be based on the bearer policies and or the transmission instructions. For example the charges may be based on the time of day at which data is transmitted e.g. lower charges for data transmitted at off peak times .

As shown in process may include receiving a communication request and processing the communication request within a sensor network block . For example central app device may receive the communication request from user device via access server e.g. via a web portal an application or some other technique . In some implementations central app device may receive the communication request via access server based on access server authorizing user device to access service provider network in order to communicate with central app device .

In some implementations the communication request may include a request for client device data e.g. data relating to data gathered by client device and or processed by app device . For example the communication request may include a request for particular data records formed by client device that meet particular criteria. Additionally or alternatively the data request may include a request for an alert when data record meeting the criteria is gathered. Additionally or alternatively the data request may include a one time request for data records and or a request to receive data records at recurring intervals.

In some implementations the communication request may include a control instruction to be provided to client device via app device e.g. an instruction to adjust a sensor metering device of client device to adjust how data is gathered by client device etc. . Additionally or alternatively the communication request may include updates to provisioning information associated with client device and or app device stored by data structure e.g. updates to transmission policies processing instructions and or devices authorized to communicate with client device and or app device . Additionally or alternatively the communication request may include some other communication request associated with client device and related to data records formed by client device .

In some implementations central app device may process the communication request within sensor network . For example central app device may identify one or more particular app devices and or client devices that may be involved in processing the communication request e.g. to receive client device data from the particular app devices and or client devices . In some implementations communications between client device app device and or central app device e.g. communications relating to processing the communication request may occur within sensor network thereby reducing load on service provider network .

Process may also include receiving client device data for transmission via a private network block . For example central app device may receive the client device data from app device and may prepare to transmit the client device data via the private network associated with service provider network . In some implementations central app device may prepare to transmit the client device data based on receiving the communication request. Additionally or alternatively central app device may prepare to transmit the client device data based on a transmission instruction stored by transmission instructions field e.g. an instruction to transmit the client device data at particular times such as off peak times an instruction to transmit the client device data based on an alert etc. . As described above central app device may connect with the private network and may not connect with the public network such that client device data may be transmitted via the private network to reduce network load on service provider network .

In some implementations the client device data may be received based on processing the communication request and may correspond to a response to the communication request e.g. a response to a request data gathered by client device processed data formed by app device data records meeting particular criteria a response to a control instruction that indicates that the control instruction has been received and executed etc. .

Additionally or alternatively the client device data may be received without receiving a communication request. For example the client device data may be received from app device e.g. data that may be automatically provided by app device at particular times data that may be automatically provided by app device based on detecting an alert that may be triggered when the value of the data satisfies a particular threshold etc. . In some implementations the client device data may be continuously provided by app device within sensor network e.g. such that central app device may store the client device data and transmit the client device data via service provider network at an off peak time in accordance with transmission instructions stored by transmission instructions field .

Process may also include determining a data class associated with the client device data block . For example central app device may determine the a data class based information stored by a header in one or more packets of the data that identifies an application associated with the client device data e.g. an application used to provide and or process the client device data . Further central app device may determine the a data class based on information stored by data information field that identifies the a data class corresponding to the application associated with the client device data. Additionally or alternatively the a data class may be determined based on some other information.

Process may further include determining a bearer policy associated with the a data class and establishing a bearer block . For example central app device may determine the bearer policy associated with the a data class based on information stored by bearer policy field that identifies the bearer policy corresponding to the a data class. In some implementations central app device may establish the bearer between central app device and a recipient of the client device data by signaling information associated with the bearer policy and information identifying the recipient of the client device data to a PCRF associated with a private network of service provider network . Additionally or alternatively central app device may establish the bearer by signaling information identifying the a data class to the PCRF such that the PCRF may identify the bearer policy corresponding to the a data class.

In some implementations the information identifying the recipient of the client device data may include an identifier ID an IP address a telephone number or the like of a user device that provided the communication request or of a user device that is to receive the client device data based on transmission instructions stored by transmission instructions field .

In some implementations the PCRF may enforce the bearer policy by providing instructions to network devices of service provider network e.g. an SGW a PGW an MME or the like to minimize packet loss to implement a packet delay budget to provide a guaranteed bit rate GBR to provide a particular latency and or to perform other activities associated with enforcing the bearer policy. Additionally or alternatively the PCRF may implement a scheduling algorithm to schedule the transmission of the client device data based on the bearer policy. For example the PCRF may implement a GBR scheduling algorithm a round robin scheduling algorithm a best effort scheduling algorithm and or some other type of scheduling algorithm.

In some implementations central app device may establish the bearer without involving the PCRF. For example central app device may provide the instructions to the network devices of service provider network to enforce the bearer policy. Additionally or alternatively central app device may implement the scheduling algorithm to schedule the transmission of the client device data based on the bearer policy.

Process may also include providing the client device data via the private network and via the established bearer block . For example central app device may provide the client device data based on receiving an indication from the PCRF of service provider network that the bearer has been established. In some implementations central app device may encrypt the client device data and may provide the data via a secure bearer to prevent an unauthorized device from receiving the client device data.

While shows process as including a particular quantity and arrangement of blocks in some implementations process may include fewer blocks additional blocks or a different arrangement of blocks. Additionally or alternatively some of the blocks may be performed in parallel.

As further shown in central app device may process the communication request within sensor network . For example central app device may identify app devices and client devices involved with the communication request such as app devices and client devices that may gather process data requested by user device via the communication request a control instruction and or a provisioning update for app devices and or client devices etc. As an example assume that central app device identifies that app device app device client device and client device are involved with the communication request. Given this assumption central app device may communicate with app device app device client device and client device in order to receive client device data corresponding to a response to the communication request. Additionally or alternatively central app device may receive the client device data independently of receiving the communication request. For example central app device may receive the client device data based on a transmission instruction that directs app device to automatically provide the client device data to central app device e.g. to continuously provide client device data within sensor network for storage by central app device .

In some implementations central app device may provide the client device data e.g. based on receiving the communication request and or based on a transmission instruction to provide the data at particular times or based on detecting an alert . For example central app device may identify a bearer policy based on a data class of the client device data and may transmit the client device data via the established bearer. Further the established bearer may be used to receive communication requests from user device .

In some implementations user device may communicate with user device via a public network using predetermined public network bearers. As further shown in the client device data may be transmitted via the private network instead of via a public network of service provider network . As described above the private network may provide fewer network resources than the public network while providing sufficient network resources to transmit client device data to from the client devices. As a result network load on service provider network may be reduced by transmitting client device data via a private network that provides fewer network resources than the public network resources without degrading the transmission of the client device data.

While a particular example is shown in the above description is merely an example implementation. In practice other examples are possible from what is described above in .

Referring to central app device may provide the client device data e.g. at a time specified by the transmission instructions . For example at the time specified by the transmission instructions central app device may identify a bearer policy based on a data class of the client device data establish a bearer based on the bearer policy and provide the client device data towards user device using the established bearer and via a private network of service provider network . As a result service provider network may be used to provide the client device data at off peak times e.g. when the client device data may not be immediately needed or requested and using the private network that may consume fewer network resources than a public network of service provider network .

While a particular example is shown in the above description is merely an example implementation. In practice other examples are possible from what is described above in .

As described above a private network associated with service provider network may consume fewer network resources than a public network of service provider network while providing sufficient network resources to transmit client device data. As a result network load on service provider network may be reduced when central app device transmits the client device data via the private network that consumes fewer network resources than the public network without degrading the transmission of the client device data. Further client device app device and or central app device may communicate within sensor network thereby reducing network load on service provider network to process a communication request and or store client device data for transmission at particular times e.g. off peak times .

The foregoing description provides illustration and description but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the possible implementations to the precise form disclosed. Modifications and variations are possible in light of the above disclosure or may be acquired from practice of the implementations.

It will be apparent that different examples of the description provided above may be implemented in many different forms of software firmware and hardware in the implementations illustrated in the figures. The actual software code or specialized control hardware used to implement these examples is not limiting of the implementations. Thus the operation and behavior of these examples were described without reference to the specific software code it being understood that software and control hardware can be designed to implement these examples based on the description herein.

Some implementations are described herein in conjunction with thresholds. The term greater than or similar terms as used herein to describe a relationship of a value to a threshold may be used interchangeably with the term greater than or equal to or similar terms . Similarly the term less than or similar terms as used herein to describe a relationship of a value to a threshold may be used interchangeably with the term less than or equal to or similar terms . As used herein satisfying a threshold or similar terms may be used interchangeably with being greater than a threshold being greater than or equal to a threshold being less than a threshold being less than or equal to a threshold or other similar terms depending on the context in which the threshold is used.

Even though particular combinations of features are recited in the claims and or disclosed in the specification these combinations are not intended to limit the disclosure of the possible implementations. In fact many of these features may be combined in ways not specifically recited in the claims and or disclosed in the specification. Although each dependent claim listed below may directly depend on only one other claim the disclosure of the possible implementations includes each dependent claim in combination with every other claim in the claim set.

No element act or instruction used in the present application should be construed as critical or essential unless explicitly described as such. Also as used herein the article a is intended to include one or more items and may be used interchangeably with one or more. Where only one item is intended the term one or similar language is used. Further the phrase based on is intended to mean based at least in part on unless explicitly stated otherwise.
