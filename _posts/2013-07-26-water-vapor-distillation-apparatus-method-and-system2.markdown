The present invention relates to water distillation and more particularly to a water vapor distillation apparatus method and system.

A dependable source of clean water eludes vast segments of humanity. For example the Canadian International Development Agency reports that about 1.2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water. Published reports attribute millions and millions of deaths per year mostly children to water related diseases. Many water purification techniques are well known including carbon filters chlorination pasteurization and reverse osmosis. Many of these techniques are significantly affected by variations in the water quality and do not address a wide variety of common contaminants such as bacteria viruses organics arsenic lead mercury and pesticides that may be found in water supplies in the developing world and elsewhere. Some of these systems require access to a supply of consumables such as filters or chemicals. Moreover some of these techniques are only well suited to centralized large scale water systems that require both a significant infrastructure and highly trained operators. The ability to produce reliable clean water without regard to the water source on a smaller decentralized scale without the need for consumables and constant maintenance is very desirable particularly in the developing world.

The use of vapor compression distillation to purify water is well known and may address many of these concerns. However the poor financial resources limited technical assets and low population density that does not make it feasible to build centralized large scale water systems in much of the developing world also limits the availability of adequate affordable and reliable power to operate vapor compression distillation systems as well as hindering the ability to properly maintain such systems. In such circumstances an improved vapor compression distillation system and associated components that increases efficiency and production capability while decreasing the necessary power budget for system operation and the amount of system maintenance required may provide a solution.

Definitions. As used in this description and the accompanying claims the following terms shall have the meanings indicated unless the context otherwise requires.

The term fluid is used herein to include any type of fluid including water. Thus although the exemplary embodiment and various other embodiments are described herein with reference to water the scope of the apparatus system and methods includes any type of fluid. Also herein the term liquid may be used to indicate the exemplary embodiment where the fluid is a liquid.

The term evaporator condenser is used herein to refer to an apparatus that is a combination evaporator and condenser. Thus a structure is referred to as an evaporator condenser where the structure itself serves as both. The evaporator condenser structure is referred to herein as an evaporator condenser evaporator condenser or evaporator and condenser. Further in some instances where either the evaporator or the condenser is being referred to individually it should be understood that the term is not limiting and refers to the evaporator condenser structure.

The term unclean water is used herein to refer to any water wherein it is desired to make cleaner prior to consuming the water.

The term cleaner water is used herein to refer to water that is cleaner as product water than as source water.

The term purifying as used herein and in any appended claims refers to reducing the concentration of one or more contaminants or otherwise altering the concentration of one or more contaminants.

The term specified levels as used herein refers to some desired level of concentration as established by a user for a particular application. One instance of a specified level may be limiting a contaminant level in a fluid to carry out an industrial or commercial process. An example is eliminating contaminant levels in solvents or reactants to a level acceptable to enable an industrially significant yield in a chemical reaction e.g. polymerization . Another instance of a specified level may be a certain contaminant level in a fluid as set forth by a governmental or intergovernmental agency for safety or health reasons. Examples might include the concentration of one or more contaminants in water to be used for drinking or particular health or medical applications the concentration levels being set forth by organizations such as the World Health Organization or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The term system as used herein may refer to any combination of elements including but not limited to a water vapor distillation apparatus which may be referred to as a water system or a water vapor distillation system and a water vapor distillation apparatus together with a power source such as a Stirling engine.

Herein is disclosed an apparatus for distilling unclean water known as source water into cleaner water known as product water. The apparatus cleanses the source water by evaporating the water to separate the particulate from the source water. The term purifying as used herein and in any appended claims refers to substantially reducing the concentration of one or more contaminants to less than or equal to specified levels or otherwise substantially altering the concentration of one or more contaminants to within a specified range.

The source water may first pass through a counter flow tube in tube heat exchanger to increase the temperature of the water. Increasing the temperature of the source water reduces the amount of thermal energy required to evaporate the water within the evaporator condenser. The source water may receive thermal energy from the other fluid streams present in the heat exchanger. Typically these other streams have a higher temperature than the source water motivating thermal energy to flow from the higher temperature streams to the lower temperature source water.

Receiving the heated source water is the evaporator area of the evaporator condenser assembly. This assembly evaporates the source water to separate the contaminants from the water. Thermal energy may be supplied using a heating element and high pressure steam. Typically the heating element will be used during initial start up thus under normal operating conditions the thermal energy will be provided by the high pressure steam. The source water fills the inner tubes of the evaporator area of the evaporator condenser. When the high pressure steam condenses on the outer surfaces of these tubes thermal energy is conducted to the source water. This thermal energy causes some of the source water to evaporate into low pressure steam. After the source water transforms into a low pressure steam the steam may exit the outlet of the tubes and pass through a separator. The separator removes any remaining water droplets within the steam ensuring that the low pressure steam is dry before entering the compressor.

Upon exiting the evaporator area of the evaporator condenser the low pressure steam enters a compressor. The compressor creates high pressure steam by compressing the low pressure steam. As the steam is compressed the temperature of the steam increases. With the steam at an elevated temperature and pressure the steam exits the compressor.

The high pressure steam enters the condenser area of the evaporator condenser. As the steam fills the internal cavity the steam condenses on the tubes contained within the cavity. The high pressure steam transfers thermal energy to the source water within the tubes. This heat transfer causes the steam to condense upon the outer surface of the tubes creating product water. The product water is collected in the base of the condenser area of the evaporator condenser. The product water leaves the evaporator area of the evaporator condenser and enters the level sensor housing.

The level sensor housing contains level sensors for determining the amount of product and blowdown water within the apparatus. These sensors allow an operator to adjust the amount of product water being produced or the amount of incoming source water depending on the water levels within the apparatus.

The water vapor distillation apparatus as described herein with respect to various embodiments may further be used in conjunction with a Stirling engine to form a water vapor distillation system. The power needed by the water vapor distillation apparatus may be provided by a Stirling engine electrically connected to the water vapor distillation apparatus.

Referring to one embodiment of the water vapor distillation apparatus is shown. For the purposes of this description the embodiment shown in will be referred to as the exemplary embodiment. Other embodiments are contemplated some of which will be discussed herein.

Similarly illustrates another embodiment of the apparatus not including the level sensor assembly and bearing feed water pump from .

Referring now to in the exemplary embodiment of the water vapor distillation apparatus the heat exchanger may be a counter flow tube in tube heat exchanger assembly . In this embodiment heat exchanger assembly may include an outer tube a plurality of inner tubes and a pair of connectors illustrated in . Alternate embodiments of the heat exchanger assembly may not include connectors .

Still referring to the heat exchanger assembly may contain several independent fluid paths. In the exemplary embodiment the outer tube contains source water and four inner tubes . Three of these inner tubes may contain product water created by the apparatus. The fourth inner tube may contain blowdown water.

Still referring to the heat exchanger assembly increases the temperature of the incoming source water and reduces the temperature of the outgoing product water. As the source water contacts the outer surface of the inner tubes thermal energy is conducted from the higher temperature blowdown and product water to the lower temperature source water through the wall of the inner tubes . Increasing the temperature of the source water improves the efficiency of the water vapor distillation apparatus because source water having a higher temperature requires less energy to evaporate the water. Moreover reducing the temperature of the product water prepares the water for use by the consumer.

Still referring to in the exemplary embodiment the heat exchanger is a tube in tube heat exchanger having an outer tube having several functions. First the outer tube protects and contains the inner tubes . The outer tube protects the inner tubes from corrosion by acting as a barrier between the inner tubes and the surrounding environment. In addition the outer tube also improves the efficiency of the heat exchanger by preventing the exchange of thermal energy to the surrounding environment. The outer tube insulates the inner tubes reducing any heat transfer to or from the surrounding environment. Similarly the outer tube may resist heat transfer from the inner tubes focusing the heat transfer towards the source water and improving the efficiency of the heat exchanger .

Still referring to the outer tube may be manufactured from any material but low thermal conductivity is desirable. The low thermal conductivity is important because the outer tube insulates the inner tubes from the surrounding environment. The low thermal conductivity of the outer tube improves the efficiency of the heat exchanger because a low thermal conductive material reduces thermal energy losses or gains to the surrounding environment. In addition low thermal conductive material lowers the amount of thermal energy that may be transferred from the inner tubes to the outer tube . This resistance to heat transfer allows more thermal energy to be transferred to the source water rather than escaping from the apparatus through the outer tube . Thus an outer tube manufactured from a material having a low thermal conductivity allows more thermal energy to be transferred to the source water rather than lost or gained to the surrounding environment.

Still referring to in the exemplary embodiment the outer tube is manufactured from a clear silicone. In addition to having a low thermal conductivity silicone material is also corrosion resistant. This is an important characteristic to prevent corrosion of the heat exchanger . The source water within the outer tube may contain chemicals and or other highly reactive materials. These materials may cause outer tubing made from other materials to breakdown reducing the service life of the heat exchanger . In alternate embodiments the outer tube may be manufactured from other materials such as plastic or rubber having high temperatures resistance. Also in one embodiment the outer tube is made from convoluted tubing to enhance mixing which increases heat transfer efficiency.

Referring now to another desirable characteristic is for the outer tubing to be sufficiently elastic to support installation of the heat exchanger within the water vapor distillation apparatus . In some applications space for the distillation apparatus may be limited by other environmental or situational constraints. For example in the exemplary embodiment the heat exchanger is wrapped around the evaporator condenser. In other embodiments the heat exchanger may also be integrated into the insulated cover of the water vapor distillation apparatus to minimize heat lost or gained from the environment. In the exemplary embodiment the heat exchanger is configured in a coil as shown in . To achieve this configuration the inner tubes are slid into the outer tube and then wound around a mandrel. An elastic outer tube assists with positioning the ends of the heat exchanger at particular locations within the apparatus. Thus having an elastic outer tube may facilitate in the installation of the heat exchanger within the water vapor distillation apparatus .

Still referring to the elasticity of the outer tubing material may also be affected by the wall thickness. Tubing having a thick wall thickness has less flexibility. The thicker wall thickness however may improve the thermal characteristics of the tubing because the thicker wall has greater resistance heat transfer. In addition the wall thickness of the tubing must be sufficient to withstand the internal pressures generated by the source water within the tubing. Tubing having an increased wall thickness however has decreased elasticity and increases the size of the heat exchanger assembly. Thicker walled tubing requires a larger bend radius affecting the installation the heat exchanger . Conversely tubing having too little wall thickness tends to kink during installation. This distortion of the tubing may restrict the flow of source water through the outer tube causing a reduction in the efficiency of the heat exchanger .

The diameter of the outer tube may be any diameter capable of containing a plurality of inner tubes . The larger the diameter however lowers the flexibility of the tubing. Any reduction in flexibility may adversely affect the installation of the heat exchanger into the water vapor distillation apparatus . In the exemplary embodiment the diameter of the outer tube is one inch. This diameter allows the tube in tube heat exchanger to be wrapped around the evaporator condenser upon final installation and contains four inner tubes for transporting product and blowdown water. In alternate embodiments the heat exchanger may have as few as two inner tubes . Similarly in other embodiments the heat exchanger may have more than four inner tubes .

Now referring to the inner tubes may provide separate flow paths for the source product and blowdown water. In the exemplary embodiment these tubes contain product and blowdown water. However in other embodiments the inner tubes may contain additional fluid streams. The inner tubes separate the clean and safe product water from the contaminated and unhealthy source and blowdown water. In the exemplary embodiment there are three inner tubes for product water and one inner tube for blowdown. The source water travels within the outer tube of the heat exchanger . In various other embodiments the number of inner tubes may vary i.e. greater number of inner tubes may be included or a lesser number of inner tubes may be included.

Still referring to the inner tubes conduct thermal energy through the tube walls. Thermal energy flows from the high temperature product and blowdown water within the inner tubes through the tube walls to the low temperature source water. Thus the inner tubes are preferably made from a material having a high thermal conductivity and additionally preferably from a material that is corrosion resistant. In the exemplary embodiment the inner tubes are manufactured from copper. The inner tubes may be manufactured from other materials such as brass or titanium with preference that these other materials have the properties of high thermal conductivity and corrosion resistance. For applications where the source and blowdown water may be highly concentrated such as sea water the inner tubes may be manufactured from but not limited to copper nickel titanium or thermally conductive plastics.

In addition to the tubing material the diameter and thickness of the tubing may also affect the rate of thermal energy transfer. Inner tubing having a greater wall thickness may have less thermal efficiency because increasing the wall thickness of the tubing mat also increase the resistance to heat transfer. In the exemplary embodiment the inner tubes have 0.25 inch outside diameter. Although a thinner wall thickness increases the rate of heat transfer the wall thickness must be sufficient to be shaped or formed without distorting. Thinner walled tubing is more likely to kink pinch or collapse during formation. In addition the wall thickness of the inner tubes must be sufficient to withstand the internal pressure created by the water passing through the tubes.

Still referring to additional methods for improving the rate of heat transfer of the inner tubes may include unequal inner tube diameters and extended surfaces on the inner tubes to enhance heat transfer fins pins ribs . . . . In addition the outer tube may have a textured interior surface causing turbulence in the flow of the source water to enhance heat transfer. The rate of heat transfer is increased because the texture surface produces a turbulent flow within the tube . The turbulence increases the amount of water that contacts the outer surfaces of the inner tubes where the heat transfer occurs. In contrast without a texture surface the water may flow in a more laminar manner. This laminar flow will allow only a limited amount of water to contact the outer surfaces of the inner tubes . The remaining water not in contact with the inner tubes receives less thermal energy because the convective thermal transfer between the water near the inner tubes and the remaining water is not as efficient as the heat transfer near the outer surface of the inner tubes . Some examples of textured surfaces may include but are not limited to dimples fins bumps or grooves. In another embodiment may shrink to fit outer tube to increase shell side flow velocity and therefore enhance heat transfer.

Referring now to typically the inner tubes are positioned parallel to one another. In some embodiments however the inner tubes are braided or twined together to form a helix or a substantially helical shape as illustrated in . The helix shape increases the amount of surface area for heat transfer because the length of the inner tubes is longer than inner tubes of the parallel arrangement. The increased surface area provides more area for heat transfer thus increasing the efficiency of the heat exchanger . In addition the helical shape may cause a turbulent flow of source water within the outer tubing improving the heat transfer efficiency as previously described. In the exemplary embodiment the heat exchanger has four inner tubes arranged in a helical shape illustrated on .

The total length of the tubes in tube heat exchanger is governed by the desired efficiency of the apparatus. A heat exchanger having a longer length yields better efficiency. In the exemplary embodiment the heat exchanger is approximately 50 feet long. This yields approximately 90 efficiency. Alternatively a length of 25 feet yields an efficiency of approximately 84 .

Referring now to the heat exchanger assembly may also include a connector at either end of the heat exchanger . In the exemplary embodiment the heat exchanger has two connectors located at either end of the assembly. These connectors along with the outer tube define an inner cavity for containing the source water. In addition the connectors attach to the ends of the inner tubes and provide separate fluid paths for the product and blowdown water to enter and or exit the heat exchanger . The connectors allow the heat exchanger assembly to be mechanically connected to the evaporator condenser and other apparatus components. In some embodiments an extension may be included within the heat exchanger to provide an additional port to remove or supply water to the heat exchanger .

Referring now to these figures illustrate an alternate embodiment of the heat exchanger having three inner tubes passing through connectors . The connectors are sealed and attached to the inner tubes and the outer tube at either end of the heat exchanger to contain the source water inside the outer tube . An o ring may be installed within the connectors to seal the interface between the connector and the inner tubes . This type seal may allow the inner tubes to move freely and independently of the connector . Furthermore the inner tubes may be arranged in a helical shape as shown in . Referring also to another embodiment of the connector is shown which may be used in any of the embodiments described herein.

Referring to these figures illustrate an alternate embodiment for the heat exchanger . In this embodiment the heat exchanger is a plate heat exchanger having metal plates and plastic plates . The metal plates may be manufacture from any metallic materials such as stainless steel. Other embodiments may include but are not limited to plates manufactured from titanium or metal alloy. The plastic plates are made from any type of plastic capable of performing. In one embodiment the plate heat exchanger is made from alternately metal and plastic plates. In other embodiments metal plates may be followed by two or more plastic plates as illustrated in . The plate heat exchanger may begin and or end with a plate manufacture from the same or different material as the previous plate. In alternate embodiments plate may be manufactured from a metallic or plastic material. The metal plates consist of two metal plates stacked onto one another creating channels for fluid flow as shown in .

Referring now to the exemplary embodiment of the counter flow tube in tube heat exchanger may include a fitting assembly . The fitting assembly supports installation of the heat exchanger within the water vapor distillation apparatus . In addition the fitting assembly allows the heat exchanger to be easily disconnected from the apparatus for maintenance. The assembly may consist of a first connector Also identified as connector of and a second connector shown on . See also for cross section views of the fitting assembly .

Still referring to in the exemplary embodiment of the fitting assembly is manufactured from brass. Other materials may be used to manufacture the fitting assembly including but are not limited to stainless steel plastic copper copper nickel or titanium. For installation purposes having the fitting assembly manufactured from similar material as the tubing that attaches to the assembly is preferred. Similar materials allow for the assembly to be installed within the water vapor distillation apparatus using a soldering or welding technique. The fitting assembly is preferably manufactured from materials that are corrosion resistant and heat resistant 250 F. . In addition the materials preferably allows for a fluid tight connection when the assembly is installed. For applications where the source and blowdown water may be highly concentrated such as sea water the fitting assembly may be manufactured from but not limited to copper nickel or titanium.

Still referring to the first connector includes a first end and a second end . The first end attaches to the heat exchanger as shown in . The connector may be attached to the heat exchanger by clamping the outer tube using a hose clamp against the outer surface of the first end of the connector . The inner tubes of the heat exchanger may also connect to the connector at the first end . These tubes may be soldered to the heat exchanger side of the connector . Other methods of attachment may include but are not limited to welding press fitting mechanical clamping or insert molding. See also for cross section views of fitting assembly .

Now referring to in this embodiment the first end of the connector may have five ports. Three ports may be in fluid connection with one another as shown on . This configuration may combine multiple streams of product water into one stream. Multiple streams of product water increases the amount of heat transfer from the product water to the source water because there is more product water within the heat exchanger to provide thermal energy to the source water. The remaining ports are separate and provide fluid pathways for blowdown and source water illustrated in . Alternate embodiments may not have any ports in fluid connection with one another.

Still referring to connector has a second end for mating with the second connector . This second end may have three ports providing flow paths for product source and blowdown water. The product flow path may include an extension . The extension supports assembling connectors and together because the extension allows for the o ring groove within the body of the second connector rather than on the mating surface . Having the o ring groove within the body of the second connector allows the flow paths through the connector assembly to be positioned near one another without having overlapping sealing areas.

Now referring to the second connector includes a first end and a second end . The first end mates with the first connector as shown on . This end may also include an extension as shown in . The extension allows for the o ring groove to be located within the body of the first connector rather than within the surface of end of the first connector . In addition this connector may have a leak path on the first end . This path is located around the port for the product water to prevent source or blowdown water from entering the product stream. Blowdown and source water may contain contaminants that affect the quality and safety of the product water. The leak path allows the blowdown and source water to leave the fitting rather than entering the product stream through a drain illustrated on . In addition to the drain the exemplary embodiment may include three independent fluid paths within the connector illustrated on .

The first connector may be assembled to the second connector using a Marmon clamp to allow for serviceability of the apparatus. This type of clamp provides an even clamping force and ease of disassembly reassembly of the connection. Other methods of assembling the connectors together include but are not limited using a C clamp or fasteners i.e. bolts and nuts . In addition the circumference of the connectors and may be tapered as shown on and I J to receive the clamp during installation of the fitting assembly . In other embodiments the fitting assembly may be permanently joined by welding or soldering the connectors together.

Now referring to the exemplary embodiment of the evaporator condenser also herein referred to as an evaporator condenser assembly may consist of an evaporator condenser chamber having a top and bottom. The chamber may include a shell an upper tube sheet and a lower tube sheet . Attached to the lower tube sheet is a sump assembly for holding incoming source water. Similarly attached to the upper tube sheet is an upper flange . This flange connects the steam chest to the evaporator condenser chamber . Within the evaporator condenser chamber are a plurality of rods where each rod is surrounded by a tube as illustrated in . The tubes are in fluid connection with the sump and upper flange . See also illustrating an alternate embodiment of the evaporator condenser assembly .

Now referring to the sump assembly also identified as on may include an upper housing a lower housing a drain fitting drain pipe and heating element . See also for an exploded view of the sump assembly and for detailed view of the upper housing . The sump assembly contains and heats source water as well as collects particulate carried by the source water. When the source water changes state from a fluid to a vapor particulate is left behind and is collected in the sump assembly .

Still referring to the sump assembly may be made from material that is corrosion and high temperature resistant. A corrosion resistant material is preferred because the sump is exposed to high temperatures moisture and corrosive source water. In the exemplary embodiment the sump is manufactured from stainless steel. In an alternate embodiment the sump may be manufactured from RADEL or other high temperature plastic in conjunction with an alternate configuration for attaching the heating element . For applications where the source water may be highly concentrated such as sea water the sump assembly may be manufactured from but not limited to titanium copper nickel naval bronze or high temperature plastic.

Still referring to the source water may be heated using a heating element of the sump assembly . The heat element increases the temperature of the source water during initial start up of the water vapor distillation apparatus . This element provides additional thermal energy causing the source water to change from a fluid to a vapor. In the exemplary embodiment the heat element may be a 120 Volt 1200 Watt resistive element electric heater.

Still referring to the sump assembly may include a bottom housing having an angled lower surface in order to assist with the collection of particulate. The bottom housing may have any angle sufficient to collect the particulate in one area of the housing. In the exemplary embodiment the bottom housing has a 17 degree angled lower surface. In other embodiments the bottom housing may have a flat bottom.

Still referring to the exemplary embodiment may include a drain assembly consisting of a drain fitting and a drain pipe . The drain assembly provides access to inside of the evaporator area of the evaporator condenser to remove particulate buildup without having to disassemble the apparatus. The drain assembly may be located near the bottom of the sump to reduce scaling buildup of particulates on the tubes inside the evaporator condenser. Scaling is prevented by allowing periodic removal of the scale in the sump assembly . Having less particulate in the sump assembly reduces the likelihood that particulate will flow into the tubes of the evaporator condenser. In the exemplary embodiment the drain assembly is positioned to receive particulate from the angled lower surface of the bottom housing . The drain assembly may be made of any material that may be attached to the bottom housing and is corrosion and heat resistant. In the exemplary embodiment the drain fitting is a flanged sanitary fitting manufactured from stainless steel. Referring now also to a sump drain fluid pathway is shown. In some embodiments sump drain fluid pathway may be used to facilitate the cleaning or flushing of the apparatus . In some embodiments the sump drain fluid pathway may be sealed to the outside environment by a valve for example but not limited to a manual ball valve. In some embodiments the valve may be a non manual valve for example an actuated valve controlled by the control system and in some of these embodiments the cleaning and flushing may be at least partially automated.

Still referring to attached to the drain fitting may be a drain pipe . The drain pipe provides a fluid path way for particulate to travel from the drain fitting out of the evaporator condenser assembly . The drain pipe may be manufactured from any material with preference that the material is corrosion and heat resistant and is capable of being attached to the drain fitting . In the exemplary embodiment the drain pipe is manufactured from stainless steel. The diameter of the drain pipe is preferably sufficient to allow for removal of particulate from the sump assembly . A larger diameter pipe is desirable because there is a less likelihood of the drain pipe becoming clogged with particulate while draining the sump assembly .

Now referring to the exemplary embodiment of the evaporator condenser chamber also identified as of may include a shell also identified as of a lower flange also identified as of of a lower tube sheet also identified as of a plurality of tie rods a plurality of tubes also identified as of an upper flange also identified as of and an upper tube sheet also identified as of . See also for an assembly view evaporator condenser chamber .

Still referring to the shell defines an internal cavity where thermal energy is transferred from the high pressure steam to the source water. This heat transfer supports the phase change of the source water from a fluid to a vapor. In addition the heat transfer also causes the incoming steam to condense into product water. The shell may be manufactured from any material that has sufficient corrosion resistant and strength characteristics. In the exemplary embodiment the shell is manufactured from fiberglass. It is preferable that the shell has an inner diameter sufficient to contain the desired number of tubes . Within the internal cavity of the shell is a plurality of tubes having surface area for transferring thermal energy from the high pressure steam entering the chamber to source water within the tubes .

Still referring to the evaporator condenser chamber defines an inner cavity for the condensation of high pressure steam. Within this cavity is a plurality of tubes that transfer thermal energy from high pressure steam to source water within the tubes as the steam condensing upon outer surfaces of the tubes. The heat transfer through the tube walls causes the source water to undergo a phase change through a process called thin film evaporation as described in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. US 2005 0183832 A1 published on Aug. 25 2005 entitled Method and Apparatus for Phase Change Enhancement the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.

Still referring to in the tubes of the evaporator condenser a Taylor bubble may be developed which has an outer surface including a thin film in contact with an inner surface of the tubes . The Taylor bubble is heated as it rises within the tube so that fluid in the thin film transitions into vapor within the bubble.

Now referring to typically an evaporator may operate in either of two modes pool boiling mode or thin film mode. In thin film boiling a thin film of fluid is created on the inner wall of the tubes facilitating heat transfer from the tube wall to the free surface of the fluid. The efficiency of phase change typically increases for thin film mode as compared to pool boiling mode. shows the difference in the rate of distillate production as a function of condenser pressure for pool boiling and thin film boiling under similar conditions for a representative evaporator. The bottom curve corresponds to pool boiling while the middle curve corresponds to thin film boiling. As will be noted from these two curves thin film boiling mode offers significantly higher efficiency than pool boiling mode. Thin film boiling is more difficult to maintain than pool boiling however. Thin film evaporation is typically achieved using apparatus that includes very small openings. This apparatus may easily clog particularly when the source fluid contains contaminants. Additionally in thin film mode the water level is typically held just marginally above the tops of the tubes in a vertical tube type evaporator. For reasons such as this the apparatus may also be sensitive to movement and positioning of the apparatus.

Referring back to in the exemplary embodiment the tubes have an outer diameter of 0.75 inches and may be manufactured from copper. In alternate embodiments the tubes may be manufactured from other materials including but not limited to nickel copper or other composite materials. In various other embodiments the diameter of the tubes may different i.e. may be smaller or larger. For possible applications where the source water may be seawater the tubes may be manufactured from copper nickel or titanium material. These materials have high corrosion resistant properties to maintain the heat transfer characteristics of the tubes when exposed to highly concentrated source water such as salt water. The diameter of the tubes may also vary depending on many variables. The diameter of the tubes may be limited by the inner diameter of the shell and the desired amount of heat transfer efficiency. Another constraint may be serviceability. A smaller diameter is more difficult to remove scale from because the reduced diameter restricts access to the inner surfaces of the tube walls. The length of the tubes may be determined by the length of the inner cavity defined by the shell and the thickness of the tube sheets and . In the exemplary embodiment the tubes extend beyond the ends of the tube sheets into the lower flange and upper flange .

Referring now to in the exemplary embodiment the tubes also identified as of have a bead near each end. The bead prevents the tubes from sliding through the apertures in the lower tube sheet and the upper tube sheet .

Referring now to improved efficiency of a phase change operation may be achieved by providing packing within the evaporator condenser tubes . The introduction of such packing may allow the evaporator to take on some of the characteristics of thin film mode due to the interaction between the fluid the packing and the tube . The packing may be any material shaped such that the material preferentially fills the volume of a tube near the tube s longitudinal axis versus the volume near the tube s interior wall. Such packing material serves to concentrate the vapor near the walls of the tube for efficient heat exchange. For example in the exemplary embodiment the packing may comprise a rod . Each rod may be of any cross sectional shape including a cylindrical or rectangular shape. The cross sectional area of each packing rod may be any area that will fit within the cross section of the tube. The cross sectional area of each rod may vary along the rod s length. A given rod may extend the length of a given evaporator tube or any subset thereof. It is preferable that the rod material be hydrophobic and capable of repeated thermal cycling. In the exemplary embodiment the rods are manufactured from glass fiber filled RYTON or glass fiber filled polypropylene.

Still referring to each rod may be positioned anywhere within the tube including preferentially in the upper portion of the tube. In one specific embodiment each rod is approximately half the length of the associated tube and is positioned approximately in the top half of the tube. The top curve in shows the increase in boiling efficiency for thin film boiling for a representative evaporator where the evaporator tubes include packing material in approximately the top half of the tubes. With such packing the phase change efficiency is also advantageously much less sensitive to changes in the fluid level above the tubes the orientation of the tubes with respect to the vertical the feed pressure for the tubes and other operating parameters for the evaporator. In the exemplary embodiment the rods have approximately the same length as the tubes .

Referring now to in the exemplary embodiment the rods may have a plurality of members extending out from the center and along the longitudinal axis of the rod . These members maintain the rod within the center of the tube to produce the most efficient flow path for the source water. Any number of members may be used however it is preferential that there is a sufficient number to maintain the rod in the center of the tube . In alternate embodiments the rods may not have members . In alternate embodiments the rod may be held in place within the tube by wrapping the rod in a wire or cross drilling holes within the rod to support installation of pins to position the rod within the tube .

Referring back to the tubes Also identified as of of are secured in place by the pair of tube sheets and . These sheets are secured to each end of the shell using the tie rods . The tube sheets and have a plurality of apertures that provide a pathway for the source water to enter and exit the tubes . When the tubes are installed within the chamber the apertures within the tube sheets and receive the ends of the tubes . The lower tube sheet also identified as on is attached to the bottom of the shell . See for a detail view of the lower tube sheet. The upper tube sheet also identified as on is attached to the top of the shell . See A for a detail view of the upper tube sheet. Both tube sheets have similar dimensions except that the upper tube sheet has an additional aperture located in the center of the sheet. This aperture provides an opening for the high pressure steam to enter the evaporator condenser chamber .

Still referring to in the exemplary embodiments the upper tube sheet and the lower tube sheet may be manufactured from RADEL . This material has low creep hydrolytic stability thermal stability and low thermal conductivity. Furthermore tube sheets manufactured from RADEL may be formed by machining or injection molding. In alternate embodiments the tube sheets may be manufactured from other materials including but are not limited to G10.

Still referring to the size of the plurality of apertures within the tube sheets and for receiving the tubes is governed by the outside diameter of the tubes . These apertures must be sufficient to receive the end of the tubes and also include a seal. Typically an o ring groove is provided within the tube sheets to receive an o ring. This o ring provides a water tight seal between the inner tubes and the tube sheets and . In addition this type of seal simplifies construction facilitates the use of dissimilar materials within the evaporator condenser and allows the tubes to move during repeated thermal cycles. This seal prevents the product water from entering into the sump of or source water entering the chamber . In alternate embodiments the tubes may be installed within the apertures of the tube sheets and by the using the methods of but not limited to soldering welding press fitting bonding i.e. silicone RTV epoxy . . . brazing or swaging depending on the tube sheet material.

Now referring to in the exemplary embodiment the o ring grooves are located at various depths in the tube sheets and . The different depths of the o ring grooves allows the tubes to be positioned more closely together because the o ring grooves from adjacent tubes do not overlap one another. Overlapping o ring grooves do not provide a sufficient seal thus each o ring groove must be independent of the other o ring grooves within the tube sheet. As a result of varying the location of the o ring grooves at different depths within the tube sheet adjacent o ring grooves do not overlap one another allowing the tubes to be positioned closer together. Thus having the tubes located closer to one another allows more tubes to be positioned within the evaporator condenser chamber .

Referring back to the tube sheets and are also secured to the lower flange and the upper flange using the tie rods . The lower flange also identified as of of connects the sump of to the evaporator condenser chamber of . In addition the lower flange provides a fluid connection for the source water within the sump to the inlet of tubes positioned on the lower tube sheet . The lower flange may have any height with preference that the height is sufficient to allow for an even distribution of the source water entering the tubes . Typically a flange having a height of one to two inches provides for an even distribution of source water into the tubes . In alternate embodiments the height of the flange may be larger to increase the capacity of the sump to collect particulate.

Still referring to the upper flange also identified as of provides a fluid connection between the outlet of the tubes and the steam chest of . In addition the upper flange collects the source water removed from the low pressure steam as the steam passes through the steam chest . This water is then transferred out of the apparatus through the blowdown port located within the side of the upper flange of .

Still referring to the lower flange and upper flange may be manufactured out of any material having sufficient structural strength and corrosion and temperature resistant properties. In one embodiment the flanges may be manufactured from RADEL . In the exemplary embodiment the flanges may be manufactured from nickel plated aluminum. In other embodiments the lower flange may be manufacture from material including but not limited to stainless steel titanium and copper nickel.

Referring to located near the outer edge of the lower flange and the upper flange is a plurality of apertures to receive the tie rods . These rods are axially positioned on a bolt circle concentric to and along the outside perimeter of the shell . The length of the tie rods is governed by the length of the shell and the thickness of the lower tube sheet lower flange upper flange and upper tube sheet . The tie rods may have threaded ends for attaching a threaded fastener onto each end of the rod securing the components of the evaporator condenser together. In addition the tie rods may be manufactured from any material that is of sufficient strength for the purpose such as stainless steel. Tie rods may be manufactured from other materials including but not limited to bronze titanium fiberglass composite materials and carbon steel. In the exemplary embodiment the tie rods may have flats machined near each end to provide a flat surface for receiving a device to hold the rods in place during installation.

Referring now to connected to the upper flange also identified as of may be a steam chest also identified as in . In the exemplary embodiment the steam chest may include a base a steam separator assembly a cap and a steam tube . The base defines an internal cavity for receiving the low pressure steam created within the tubes of the evaporator area of the evaporator condenser chamber . The base may have any height such that there is sufficient space to allow water droplets contained within the vapor to be separated. The height of the steam chest allows the water droplets carried by the steam and forcibly ejected from outlets of the tubes from the rapid release of steam bubbles to decelerate and fall back towards the upper flange also identified as on .

Still referring to within the base may be a steam separator assembly . This assembly consists of a basket and mesh not shown in . The basket contains a quantity of wire mesh. In the exemplary embodiment the steam separator assembly removes water droplets from the incoming low pressure steam by manipulating the steam through a layer of wire mesh. As the steam passes through the mesh the water droplets start to collect on the surfaces of the mesh. These droplets may contain contaminants or particulate. As the droplets increase in size the water falls onto the bottom of the basket. A plurality of apertures may be located in the bottom of the basket to allow water to collect within the upper flange . In addition these apertures provide a fluid path way for low pressure steam to enter the steam separator assembly . In addition the wire mesh provides a barrier from the splashing blowdown water located within the upper flange of the evaporator condenser.

Still referring to in alternate embodiments the steam separator assembly may contain a series of plates for collecting the water droplets from the low pressure water vapor as the vapor passes through or around each plate. The plates manipulate the steam to cause water droplets to collect onto the plates. The water is collected in the assembly because the plates are arranged creating sharp bends in the flow path of the steam. These bends reduce the velocity of and change the direction of the steam. The water droplet may continue along their initial trajectory due to momentum. The droplets may then impact the walls or plates of the assembly where the droplets are collected. When enough droplets have collected on the walls or plates of the assembly the water droplets may fall down towards the upper flange of the evaporator condenser.

Still referring to the base may also have an observation window . This window allows people operating the apparatus to visually observe the internals of the steam chest to determine if the apparatus is functioning properly. In other embodiments the steam chest may not include an observation window . This alternate embodiment is illustrated in . In still other embodiments the size and shape of the window may vary. In some embodiments the steam chest may include multiple windows.

In the exemplary embodiment the steam separator assembly may be manufactured from stainless steel. Other materials may be used however with preference that those materials have corrosion and high temperature resistant properties. Other types of materials may include but are not limited to RADEL titanium copper nickel plated aluminum fiber composites and high temperature plastics.

Still referring to attached to the base is the cap . The cap and base define the internal cavity for separating the water from the low pressure steam. In addition the cap may have two ports an outlet port and inlet port shown on . The outlet port provides a fluid path way for the dry low pressure steam to exit the steam chest . In the exemplary embodiment the outlet port is located near the top surface of the cap because the locating the port away from the outlets of the tubes of the evaporator condenser promotes dryer steam. In alternate embodiments however the outlet port may have a different location within the cap . Similarly the inlet port provides a fluid path way for high pressure steam to enter the high pressure steam tube within the steam chest . In the exemplary embodiment the inlet port is located near the top surface of the cap . In alternate embodiments the inlet port may have a different location within the cap . In the exemplary embodiment the cap is manufactured from plated aluminum. Other types of materials may include but are not limited to stainless steel plastics titanium and copper nickel. The size of these ports may affect the pressure drop across the compressor.

Still referring to connected to the inlet port within the steam chest is a steam tube . This tube provides a fluid path way for the high pressure steam to pass through the steam chest and enter the condenser area of the evaporator condenser chamber. The inner diameter of the steam tube may be any size such that the tube does not adversely affect the flow of high pressure steam from the regenerative blower to the evaporator condenser chamber. In the exemplary embodiment the steam tube may be manufactured from stainless steel. Other materials may be used to manufacture the steam tube but these materials must have sufficient corrosion resistant and high temperature resistant properties. Such materials may include but are not limited to plated aluminum plastics titanium and copper nickel. For applications where the source water may be highly concentrated such as sea water the steam chest may be manufactured from but not limited to titanium nickel bronze nickel copper and copper nickel.

Referring now to an alternate embodiment of the evaporator condenser assembly is shown. In this embodiment the evaporator condenser assembly includes a sump an evaporator condenser chamber a mist eliminator assembly a plurality of tie rids a lower flange and an upper flange . See for a detail view of the evaporator condenser assembly without the sump .

Now referring to the evaporator condenser chamber may include a shell a plurality of tubes a lower flange and an upper flange . The evaporator condenser chamber defines an inner cavity for the condensation of high pressure steam. Tubes transfer thermal energy from the high pressure steam to source water within the tubes when the steam condenses upon the outer surface of the tubes . In this embodiment the tubes may have an outer diameter of 0.75 inches and manufactured from copper. In alternate embodiments the tubes may be manufactured from other materials including but not limited to nickel copper or other composite materials. The diameter of the tubes may also vary depending on many variables. See previous discussion in the exemplary embodiment concerning the diameter of the tubes. The length of the tubes may be determined by the length of the inner cavity defined by the shell and the thickness of the lower flange and upper flange .

Still referring to the tubes are supported within the inner cavity defined by the shell by the lower flange and upper flange as shown on . Each flange has a plurality of apertures located axially around the center of the flange. These apertures may contain the ends of the tubes . In addition the lower flange and upper flange also secure the shell in place and provide pathways to the sump and the mist eliminator assembly . As the source water fills the sump some water begins to fill the tubes located in the inner cavity of the shell . As thermal energy is transferred to the source water in the tubes the water begins to evaporate. The source water vapor travels through the tubes and into the mist eliminator assembly . The vapor enters the mist eliminator through the apertures located in the upper flange .

Still referring to the shell is secured to the lower flange and upper flange using a plurality of tie rods . These tie rods are positioned outside axially around the perimeter of the shell . In addition the tie rods also secure the mist eliminator to the upper flange and the sump to the lower flange . The length of the tie rods is governed by the length of the shell and the thickness of the lower flange upper flange sump and mist eliminator . The tie rods may have threaded ends for attaching a threaded fastener onto each end of the rod securing the components of the evaporator condenser together. In addition the tie rods may be manufactured from any material that is of sufficient strength such as stainless steel. Tie rods may be manufactured from other materials including but not limited to bronze titanium fiberglass composite materials and carbon steel.

Still referring to in the exemplary embodiment the shell is manufactured from fiberglass. Other materials may be used with preference that those materials are corrosion resistant have low thermal conductivity and sufficient structural strength to withstand the internal pressures developed during the operation of the evaporator condenser assembly . See discussion for the exemplary embodiment relating to the size of the inner diameter of the shell.

Still referring to the sump is connected to the lower flange and is in fluid connection with the tubes of the evaporator condenser assembly chamber . The sump collects the incoming source water from the heat exchanger. The source water enters the sump through an inlet port locate within the side wall of the sump. In other embodiments the inlet port may be located at a different location i.e. on the bottom . In this embodiment the sump is made from a composite material G10 plastic. In other embodiments the sump may be manufactured from any other material having sufficient corrosion and high temperatures resistant properties. Other materials include but are not limited to aluminum RADEL and stainless steel. The sump may also include a heating element to provide thermal energy to the source water. This thermal energy assists the source water in changing from a fluid to a vapor.

Referring now to attached to the upper flange is the mist eliminator assembly also identified as of . This assembly may consist of a cap steam pipe and mist separator illustrated on . The cap contains the low pressure steam that is created from the evaporator side of the evaporator condenser. The cap may have three ports and as shown . See discussion for the steam chest of the exemplary embodiment relating to the height of the volume for removing the water droplets. In addition the cap defines a cavity that contains the mist separator shown on .

Still referring to the first port may be located in the center of the top surface of the cap and is for receiving the first end of the steam pipe . This port allows the high pressure steam created by the compressor to re enter the evaporator condenser through first end of the steam pipe . The steam pipe provides a fluid path way for high pressure steam to enter the evaporator condenser through the mist eliminator assembly without mixing with the low pressure steam entering the mist eliminator assembly . In this embodiment the steam pipe is manufactured from stainless steel. In other embodiments the steam pipe may be manufactured from materials including but not limited to plated aluminum RADEL copper nickel and titanium. The length of the steam pipe must be sufficient to allow for connecting with the compressor and passing through the entire mist eliminator assembly . The second end of the steam pipe is received within a port located at the center of the upper flange . The inner diameter of the steam pipe may affect the pressure drop across the compressor. Another effect on the system is that the steam pipe reduces the effective volume within the mist eliminator to remove water droplets from the low pressure steam.

Still referring to the steam pipe also may have a plurality of exterior grooves for receiving the mist separator . The mist separator is circular plate having an aperture. This aperture allows the low pressure steam to pass through the plate. In one embodiment a plurality of mist separators are installed within the grooves of the steam pipe . These plates would be oriented such that the aperture is located 180 from the preceding plate. In addition the plate nearest to the outlet port would be orientated such that the aperture was 180 from the port. In alternate embodiments the plates may include grooves on the top surface of the plates to collect water droplets. These grooves may be tapered to allow the collected water to flow off the plate and fall down towards the base of the mist eliminator assembly . The mist separator may be secured to the steam pipe using a pair of snap rings and a wave washer.

Still referring to the second port may be located also in the top surface of the cap and allows the dry low pressure steam to exit the mist eliminator assembly . See previous discussion for the exemplary embodiment concerning the size and location of the outlet port.

Still referring to the third port may be located within the side wall of the cap . This port allows water removed from the low pressure steam to exit the apparatus. The location of the port is preferably at a height where the blowdown water may exit the mist eliminator assembly without an excessive buildup of blowdown water within the assembly. In addition the height of the port preferably is not too low but rather preferably is sufficient to maintain a level of blowdown water covering the outlets of the tubes. In the exemplary embodiment a tube may be connected to port and the blowdown water may pass through a level sensor housing and heat exchanger before exiting the apparatus .

Still referring to the mist eliminator assembly may be manufactured from any material having sufficient corrosion and high temperature resistant properties. In this embodiment the mist eliminator assembly is manufactured from stainless steel. The assembly may be manufactured from other materials including but not limited to RADEL stainless steel titanium and copper nickel.

The water vapor distillation apparatus may include a compressor . In the exemplary embodiment the compressor is a regenerative blower. Other types of compressors may be implemented but for purposes of this application a regenerative blower is depicted and is described with reference to the exemplary embodiment. The purpose of the regenerative blower is to compress the low pressure steam exiting the evaporator area of the evaporator condenser to create high pressure steam. Increasing the pressure of the steam raises the temperature of the steam. This increase in temperature is desirable because when the high pressure steam condenses on the tubes of the condenser area of the evaporator condenser the thermal energy is transferred to the incoming source water. This heat transfer is important because the thermal energy transferred from the high pressure steam supplies low pressure steam to the regenerative blower.

The change in pressure between the low pressure steam and the high pressure steam is governed by the desired output of product water. The output of the product water is related to the flow rate of the high pressure steam. If the flow rate of steam for the high pressure steam from the compressor to the condenser area of the evaporator condenser is greater than the ability of the condenser to receive the steam then the steam may become superheated. Conversely if the evaporator side of the evaporator condenser produces more steam than the compressor is capable of compressing then the condenser side of the evaporator condenser may not be operating at full capacity because of the limited flow rate of high pressure steam from the compressor.

Referring now to the exemplary embodiment may include a regenerative blower assembly for compressing the low pressure steam from the evaporator area of the evaporator condenser. The regenerative blower assembly includes an upper housing and a lower housing defining an internal cavity as illustrated in . See for detail views of the upper housing and lower housing . Located in the internal cavity defined by the upper housing and lower housing is an impeller assembly . The housings may be manufactured from a variety of plastics including but not limited to RYTON ULTEM or Polysulfone. Alternatively the housings may be manufactured from materials including but not limited to titanium copper nickel and aluminum nickel bronze. In the exemplary embodiment the upper housing and the lower housing are manufactured from aluminum. In alternate embodiments other materials may be used with preference that those materials have the properties of high temperature resistance corrosion resistance do not absorb water and have sufficient structural strength. The housings preferably is of sufficient size to accommodate the impeller assembly and the associated internal passageways. Furthermore the housings preferably provide adequate clearance between the stationary housing and the rotating impeller to avoid sliding contact and prevent leakage from occurring between the two stages of the blower. In addition to the clearances the upper housing and the lower may be mirror images of one another.

Referring now to the upper housing and lower housing may have an inlet port and an outlet port . The low pressure steam from the evaporator condenser enters the blower assembly through the inlet port . In the exemplary embodiment the inlet port is shaped to create a spiral flow around the annular flow channel in the upper housing and lower housing . After compressing the low pressure steam the higher pressure steam is discharged from the outlet port . Between the inlet ports and the outlet ports of the upper housing and lower housing the clearances are reduced to prevent the mixing of the high pressure steam exiting the blower assembly and the low pressure steam entering the assembly. The exemplary embodiment may include a stripper plate . At this plate the open flow channels provided in the upper housing and lower housing allow only the high pressure steam that is within the impeller blades to pass through to an area near the inlet port called the inlet region.

Still referring to the carryover of the high pressure steam through the stripper plate into the inlet region may irreversibly mix with the incoming low pressure steam entering the blower assembly from the inlet port . The mixing of the steam may cause an increase in the temperature of the incoming low pressure steam. The high pressure steam carryover may also block the incoming flow of low pressure steam because of the expansion of the high pressure steam in the inlet region. The decompression duct in the upper housing and lower housing extracts the compressed steam entrapped in the impeller blades and ejects the steam into the inlet region blocking the incoming low pressure steam.

Still referring to the distance between the inlet ports and outlet ports is controlled by the size of the stripper plate . In the exemplary embodiment the stripper plate area is optimized for reducing the amount of high pressure steam carryover into the inlet region and maximizing the working flow channels within the upper housing and lower housing .

Referring now to in the exemplary embodiment the shaft is supported by pressurized water fed bearings that are pressed into the impeller assembly and are supported by the shaft . In this embodiment the bearings may be manufactured from graphite. In alternate embodiments the bearings may be manufactured from materials including but not limited to Teflon composites and bronze alloys.

Still referring to the water supplied to the pressurized water fed bearings is preferably clean water as the water may enter the compression chamber of the blower assembly . If the water enters the compression chamber the water will likely mix with the pure steam. Contaminated water mixing with the pure steam will result in contaminated high pressure steam. In the exemplary embodiment product water is supplied to the bearings.

Hydrodynamic lubrication is desired for the high speed blower bearings of the exemplary embodiment. In hydrodynamic operation the rotating bearing rides on a film of lubricant and does not contact the stationary shaft. This mode of lubrication offers the lowest coefficients of friction and wear is essentially non existent since there is no physical contact of components.

Operating in the other lubrication regimes like Mixed Film Lubrication and Boundary Lubrication results in higher power loss and higher wear rates than hydrodynamic operation. In the exemplary embodiment the blower may operate having hydrodynamic lubrication film lubrication or a combination of both. The running clearance between the rotating bearing and the stationary shaft rotating speed of the bearing and lubricating fluid pressure and flow may affect the bearing lubrication mode.

Referring to in a hydrodynamic bearing the limiting load factor may be affected by the thermal dissipation capabilities. When compared to an un lubricated or a boundary lubricated bearing a hydrodynamic bearing has an additional mechanism for dissipating heat. The hydrodynamic bearing s most effective way to reject heat is to allow the lubricating fluid to carry away thermal energy. In the exemplary embodiment the bearing feed water removes thermal energy from the bearings . In this embodiment the volume of water flowing through the bearing are preferably sufficient to maintain the bearing s temperature within operational limits. In addition diametrical clearances may be varied to control bearing feed water flow rate however these clearances preferably are not large enough to create a loss of hydrodynamic pressure.

Still referring to the amount of bearing feed water supplied to the bearings is preferably sufficient to maintain hydrodynamic lubrication. Any excess of bearing feed water may adversely affect the blower assembly . For example excess water may quench the high pressure steam unnecessarily reducing the thermal efficiency of the apparatus. Another adverse affect of excess bearing feed water may be power loss due to shearing of the fluid water when the excess bearing feed water is ejected outward from the impeller assembly and forced between the housing wall and the passing impeller blades.

Referring to in the exemplary embodiment a return path for the bearing feed water is provided within the blower to prevent excess bearing feed water from entering the impeller buckets.

Referring back to in the exemplary embodiment the bearing feed water pump maintains a pressure of two to five psi on the input to the pressurized water fed bearings . The bearing feed water flow rate may be maintained by having a constant bearing feed water pressure. In the exemplary embodiment the pressure of the bearing feed water may be controlled to ensure the flow rate of bearing feed water to bearings .

Still referring to in the exemplary embodiment the impeller assembly may be driven by the motor using a magnetic drive coupling rather than a mechanical seal. The lack of mechanical seal results in no frictional losses associated with moving parts contacting one another. In this embodiment the magnetic drive coupling may include an inner rotor magnet a containment shell an outer magnet and drive motor .

Still referring to the inner magnet rotor may be embedded within a cup. In the exemplary embodiment the magnets are axially positioned. In other embodiments the magnets may be positioned radially. This cup may be manufactured from plastic or metallic materials. In some embodiments the cup material may be but is not limited to RYTON ULTEM or polysulfone. Similarly the magnets may be manufactured from materials including but not limited to Ferrite aluminum nickel cobalt samarium cobalt and neodymium iron boron. In the exemplary embodiment the cup is attached to the impeller assembly . In the exemplary embodiment the cup is press fit onto the shaft . Other methods of attaching the cup may include but are not limited to keyseat and setscrews.

Still referring to the magnetic coupling shell is positioned between inner rotor magnet and the outer rotor magnet . The magnetic coupling shell is the pressure vessel or the containment shell for the blower assembly . This shell seals the steam that is being compressed within the blower assembly preventing the steam from escaping into the surrounding environment.

Still referring to Eddy current losses may occur because the shell is located between the inner rotor magnet and the outer rotor magnet . If the shell is electrically conductive then the rotating magnetic field may cause electrical currents to flow through the shell we may cause a loss of power. Conversely a shell manufactured from a highly electrically resistive material is preferred to reduce the amount of Eddy current loss. In the exemplary embodiment titanium may be used for manufacturing the magnetic coupling shell . This material provides a combination of high electrical resistivity and corrosion resistance. Corrosion resistance is preferred because of the likelihood of contact between the bearing feed water and the shell . In other embodiments the shell may be manufactured from plastic materials having a higher electrical resistivity and corrosion resistance properties. In these alternate embodiments the shell may be manufactured from material including but not limited to RYTON ULTEM polysulfone and PEEK.

Still referring to the outer rotor magnet may be connected to a drive motor . This motor rotates the outer rotor magnet causing the inner rotor magnet to rotate allowing the impeller assembly to compress the low pressure steam within the cavity defined by the upper housing and the lower housing . In the exemplary embodiment the drive motor may be an electric motor. In alternate embodiments the drive may be but is not limited to internal combustion or Stirling engine.

Still referring to the blower assembly may be configured as a two single stage blower or a two stage blower. In the operation of a two single stage blower the incoming low pressure steam from the evaporator side of the evaporator condenser is supplied to both the inlet ports of the two separate stages of the blower simultaneously. The first stage may be at the bottom between the lower housing and the impeller assembly and the second stage may be at the top between the upper housing and the impeller assembly . As the impeller assembly rotates the incoming low pressure steam from the inlet port of both stages is compressed simultaneously and the high pressure steam exits from the outlet port of the upper housing and the outlet port of the lower housing .

Still referring to in contrast the two stage blower has two distinct compression cycles. During the first compression cycle the low pressure steam from the evaporator of the evaporator condenser is supplied to the inlet of the lower housing. The compressed steam from the first stage exits through the outlet port in the lower housing and is supplied to the inlet port of the upper housing . This steam compressed in the first stage is compressed again during the second stage. After the second compression cycle the steam may exit the blower assembly through the outlet port of the upper housing at an increased pressure.

For a given blower design both the two single stage blower and the two stage blower configurations have a unique pressure flow curves. These curves indicate that the two single stage blower produces a higher flow rate of steam compared to the two stage blower that produces higher pressure differential. Based on the system operating differential pressure the flow rate and the efficiency of the blower is dependant on the flow characteristics of the blower. Depending on the differential pressure across the blower assembly one configuration may be preferred over the other. In the exemplary embodiment the blower assembly has a two Single stage blower configuration.

Now referring to within the internal cavity defined by the upper housing and lower housing is the impeller assembly also identified as of . The impeller assembly includes a plurality of impeller blades on each side of the impeller and a spindle . In the exemplary embodiment the impeller may be manufactured from Radel and the impeller spindle may be manufactured from aluminum. In alternate embodiments these parts may be manufactured from materials including but not limited to titanium PPS ULTEM . Other materials may be used to manufacture these parts with preference that these materials have high temperature resistant properties and do not absorb water. In addition impeller spindle may have passages for the return of the bearing feed water back to the sump. These passages prevent the bearing feed water from entering the impeller buckets.

Still referring to the blades are designed on each side of the impeller periphery to produce a series of helical flows as the impeller is rotating. This flow causes the steam to repeatedly pass through the blades for additional energy as the steam flows through the open annular channel. The number of blades and the bucket volume may be designed to optimize the desired flow rate and the pressure differential. The number of blades and bucket volume is inversely proportional to each other thus increasing the number of blades creates higher pressure differential but lower flow rate. The labyrinth grooves on the outer periphery of the impeller prevents steam leakage across the stages of the blower assembly thereby increasing the blower efficiency.

Referring back to the shaft is attached to the upper housing and lower housing and is stationary. In the exemplary embodiment the shaft may be manufactured from titanium. In other embodiments the shaft may be manufactured from materials including but not limited to aluminum oxide silicon nitride or titanium and stainless steel having coatings for increasing wear resistance and corrosion resistance properties. In addition the shaft may have passages channeling the bearing feed water to the bearings .

Still referring to the blower assembly in a two stage blower configuration may create a downward axial thrust force. This force is generated because the second stage at the top of the impeller assembly is at a higher pressure compared to the first stage that is at the bottom of the impeller assembly . In an alternate embodiment this thrust force may be balanced by an equal and opposite magnetic force created by offsetting the inner rotor magnet and the outer rotor magnet . This configuration prevents excessive wear of the thrust face of the lower pressurized water fed bearing .

Referring now to an alternate regenerative blower embodiment is shown. This embodiment may include an impeller housing assembly a mounting plate and a mounting flange . See for cross section views of regenerative blower assembly . See also for an exploded view of the regenerative blower assembly .

Referring now to the lower housing and upper housing define an interior cavity containing the impeller assembly . This cavity provides a volume for the impeller to compress the incoming low pressure steam. Steam may enter the impeller housing assembly through inlet ports located within the lower housing and the upper housing . After the low pressure steam is compressed by the impeller assembly the high pressure steam may exit through outlet ports located in the lower housing and the upper housing . See for a detail view of the lower housing . In addition the lower housing and the upper housing may be manufactured from but not limited to aluminum titanium PPS and ULTEM .

Still referring to the upper housing may include an access cover attached to the top surface of the housing. See showing a top view of the upper housing with the access cover installed. This cover allows for access to the ports located within the upper housing cover. See providing a top view of the upper housing without the access cover installed. This view illustrates the inlet and outlet ports located within the upper housing .

Referring now to the lower housing and the upper housing may include a decompression duct and a strip plate on the inner surface of the housings. These features perform similar functions as those described in the exemplary embodiment of the blower assembly .

Referring now to the inner cavity defined by the lower housing and upper housing contains the impeller assembly also identified as of . This assembly may include a spindle and impeller having blades as shown on . As the low pressure steam enters the inner cavity of the impeller housing the impeller assembly compresses the steam as the assembly is rotated.

Still referring to the drive motor provides the rotational energy to rotate the impeller and blades. Located between the inner surface of the spindle and the shaft may be bearings . These bearings support the shaft and allow the impeller to rotate freely. The bearings may be located near the ends of the spindle .

In alternate embodiments of the apparatus low pressure steam may be compressed using a liquid ring pump as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2005 0016828 A1 published on Jan. 27 2005 and entitled Pressurized Vapor Cycle Liquid Distillation the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.

Referring now to the exemplary embodiment of the water vapor distillation apparatus may also include a level sensor assembly also identified as in . This assembly measures the amount of product and or blowdown water produced by the apparatus .

Referring now to the exemplary embodiment of the level sensor assembly may include a settling tank and level sensor housing . The settling tank collects particulate carried within the blowdown water prior to the water entering into the blowdown level sensor tank . The tank removes particulate from the blowdown water by reducing the velocity of the water as it flows through the tank. The settling tank defines an internal volume. The volume may be divided nearly in half by using a fin extending from the side wall opposite the drain port to close proximity of the drain port . This fin may extend from the bottom to the top of the volume. Blowdown enters through the inlet port and must flow around the fin before the water may exit through the level sensing port . As the blowdown enters into the body of the vessel the velocity decreases due to the increase in area. Any particles in the blowdown may fall out of suspension due to the reduction in velocity. The settling tank may be manufactured out any material having corrosion and heat resistant properties. In the exemplary embodiment the housing is manufactured from RADEL . In alternate embodiments the settling tank may be manufactured from other materials including but note limited to titanium copper nickel and stainless steel.

Still referring to the settling tank may have three ports an inlet a drain and a level sensor port . The inlet port may be located within the top surface of the settling tank as shown on and may be adjacent to the separating fin and opposite the drain port . This port allows blowdown water to enter the tank. The drain port may be located in the bottom of the settling tank as shown on . The drain port provides access to the reservoir to facilitate removal of particulate from the tank. In the exemplary embodiment the bottom of the tank may be sloped towards the drain as illustrated in . The level sensor port may be located within the top surface of the tank as illustrated in and also adjacent to the separating fin but on the opposite side as the inlet port . This port provides a fluid pathway to the blowdown level sensor reservoir . A fourth port is not shown in . This port allows blowdown water to exit the level sensor assembly and enter the heat exchanger. This port may be located within one of the side walls of the upper half of the settling tank and away from the inlet port .

Still referring to in the exemplary embodiment a strainer may be installed within the flow path after the blowdown water exits the blowdown level sensor reservoir and settling tank . The strainer may collect large particulate while allowing blowdown water to flow to other apparatus components. The strainer may be manufactured from material having corrosion resistant properties. In the exemplary embodiment the strainer is manufactured from stainless steel. In addition the filter element may be removable to support cleaning of the element. The strainer removes particulate from the blowdown water to limit the amount of particulate that enters the heat exchanger. Excess particulate in the blowdown water may cause the inner tubes of the heat exchanger to clog with scale and sediment reducing the efficiency of the heat exchanger. In addition particulate may produce blockage preventing the flow of blowdown water through the heat exchanger.

Still referring to the settling tank is in fluid connection with the level sensor housing . This housing may have three interior reservoirs including but not limited to a blowdown level sensor reservoir a product level sensor reservoir and a bearing feed water reservoir . The blowdown level sensor reservoir is independent of the other reservoirs to prevent contamination from mixing the product water with the blowdown water. The level sensor housing may be manufactured out any material having corrosion and heat resistant properties. In the exemplary embodiment the housing is manufactured from RADEL . In other embodiments the housing may be manufactured from other materials including but not limited to titanium copper nickel and stainless steel. In other embodiments the housing may be shaped differently with preference that the ball float may have a range of movement of 45 degrees and during this movement there is a constant change in volume of the fluid level.

Still referring to within the level sensor housing there is a blowdown level sensor reservoir . This reservoir is in fluid connection with the settling tank through measuring port located within the top surface of the tank . The reservoir provides a location where the rate of blowdown water generated by the apparatus may be measured using a level sensor . As the blowdown water fills the settling tank some of that water flows through the measuring port into the blowdown level sensor reservoir . In addition a vent port may be located within the top of the reservoir. This port allows air to escape the reservoir allowing blowdown water to fill the cavity. The volume of the reservoir must be sufficient to maintain a level of water. Housings having too small volume may quickly fill and drain adversely affecting the function of the level sensors. In contrast reservoirs having a large volume may have slower level sensor response times due to the small fluid level height changes for a given increase or decrease in volume. A larger volume may also dampen out the any fluctuations in the water level produced by the operation of the apparatus. Referring now also to in some embodiments a blowdown drain fluid pathway may be included and in fluid connection with the level sensor assembly. In some embodiments the blowdown drain fluid pathway may be used to facilitate the cleaning or flushing of the apparatus . In some embodiments the blowdown drain fluid pathway may be sealed to the outside environment by a valve for example but not limited to a manual ball valve. In some embodiments the valve may be a non manual valve for example an actuated valve controlled by the control system and in some of these embodiments the cleaning and flushing may be at least partially automated.

Still referring to the product level sensor reservoir may be located next to the blowdown level sensor reservoir . The product level reservoir has an inlet port and an outlet port . Product water enters the reservoir through the inlet port and exits the reservoir through the outlet port . The outlet port may be located below the low end measurement point of the level sensor to improve flow of water out of the reservoir. Similarly the inlet port may be located below the low end measurement point of the level sensor to minimize disruption caused by the incoming water. In the exemplary embodiment the inlet port and outlet port are located on the side of the level sensor housing as shown in . This reservoir provides a space for measuring the rate of product being generated by the apparatus. In addition a vent port may be located within the top of the reservoir. This port allows air to escape the reservoir allowing product water to fill the cavity.

Still referring to the product level sensor reservoir is in fluid connection with the bearing feed water reservoir . An external port provides a fluid pathway for the product water to flow between the product level sensor reservoir and the bearing feed water reservoir shown on . Product water enters the bearing feed water reservoir through the external port . In addition the bearing feed water reservoir has a supply port and a return port shown on . The supply port provides a fluid pathway to lubricate the bearings within the regenerative blower assembly. Similarly a return port provides a fluid pathway for the product water to return from lubricating the bearings of the regenerative blower assembly. The supply and return ports may be located on the side of the level sensor housing as shown in .

Still referring to to monitor the amount of product water within the bearing feed water reservoir an optical level sensor may be installed. In the exemplary embodiment the optical level sensor may be located at approximately height in the bearing feed water reservoir . This sensor senses when water is present within the reservoir indicating that there is sufficient water to lubricate the bearings. The sensor may be installed by threading the sensor into the level sensor housing . The sensor may include an o ring to provide a water tight seal. In other embodiments the sensor may be but is not limited to conductance sensor float switches capacitance sensors or an ultrasonic sensor.

Referring now to an alternate level sensor housing having two reservoirs is shown. Within the level sensor housing there is a blowdown level sensor reservoir . This reservoir is similar to and performs the same function as the previously described blowdown reservoir within the level sensor housing . In contrast the product level sensor reservoir now contains product water to feed the bearings of the regenerative blower. The bearing feed water reservoir of level sensor housing is eliminated from this configuration. Instead product water is withdrawn from the product level sensor reservoir to supply water for the regenerative blower.

Still referring to the product level sensor reservoir may have an inlet port an outlet port a return port and a supply port . The inlet port allows product water to enter the reservoir. Similarly the outlet port provides a fluid pathway for product water to leave the housing. Furthermore the supply port allows product water to leave the reservoir to lubricate the bearings of the regenerative blower. After passing through the bearings of the regenerative blower product water may re enter the product level sensor housing through the return port . These ports may be located any where in the housing but locating the supply port and the return port near the bottom of the housing may limit any adverse effect on the function of the level sensor.

Referring now to a sensor may be positioned on the outside of the level sensor housing to receive input from the level sensor assembly . Upon receiving input from the level sensor assembly the sensor may signal that the water level in the tank is within a particular range or at a particular level. In the exemplary embodiment the sensor may be a continuous analogue sensor. This type of sensor provides continuous feedback as to the position of the level sensor assembly . When the magnets within the level sensors change their position a change in voltage occurs that is measured and used to determine the location of the sensor. Other embodiments may include but are not limited to a hall sensor or reed switch. illustrates one possible alternate embodiment for a level sensor assembly including a set of float magnets and position magnets . The position magnets are attached to the side of the level sensor housing .

Now referring to within the blowdown level sensor reservoir and the product level sensor reservoir are level sensors also identified as of . These sensors may include a base an arm and a float ball .

Referring still to the exemplary embodiment of the level sensors may include a base supporting the arm and the float ball . The assembly also includes two magnets not shown . The base is connected to the arm and float ball assembly and the assembly pivots on a small diameter axial not shown . In addition the base holds two magnets. These magnets are located 180 degrees from one another and are located on face of the base and parallel to the pivot. In addition there magnets may be positioned coaxially to the pivot point within the base . In the exemplary embodiment the magnets may be cylinder magnets having an axial magnetization direction.

Referring still to the level sensors measure the rotation of the arm and ball assembly with respect to the pivot. In the exemplary embodiment the maximum angle of displacement is 45 degrees. In this embodiment the level sensors are installed to prevent the float ball from being positioned directly below the pivot. In other embodiments the maximum angle of displacement may be as large as 80 degrees. The sensor may monitor the magnets through the wall of the housing. This configuration allows the sensors not to be exposed to corrosive blowdown water and to seal the level sensor housing. The base may be manufactured from any material having corrosion resistant heat resistant and non magnetic properties. In the exemplary embodiment the base is manufactured from G10 plastic. In alternate embodiments the base may be manufactured from other materials including but not limited to RADEL titanium copper nickel and fiberglass laminate.

Still referring to attached to the base is an arm . The arm connects the base with the float ball . In the exemplary embodiment the arm is manufactured of G10 plastic material. Other materials may be used to manufacture the arm with preference that those materials have sufficient high temperature resistant properties. Other materials may include but are not limited to stainless steel plastic RADEL titanium and copper nickel. The length of the arm is governed by the size of the level sensor reservoirs. In addition the exemplary embodiment has a plurality of apertures located along and perpendicular to the arm s longitudinal axis. These apertures reduce the weight of the arm and allow the arm to be more sensitive to level changes.

Still referring to affixed to the other end of the arm is a float ball . The float ball provides surface area for the flow of water to contact. The forces applied to the float ball by the water cause the level sensor assembly to pivot about the small diameter shaft. This change in position of the arm will indicate the amount of water in the apparatus. The float ball may be manufactured from any material having corrosion and thermal resistant properties. In addition the material preferably has a low rate of water absorption. In the exemplary embodiment the float ball is manufactured from hollow stainless steel. For applications where the source water is highly concentrated such as sea water the float ball may be manufactured from any highly corrosion resistant material including but not limited to plastic titanium and copper nickel. Furthermore the float ball is preferably of the proper size to be positioned within the level sensor housing such that the float is capable of freely moving. In addition the size of the float ball is governed by the size of the level sensor reservoirs.

Referring now to connected to the supply port of the bearing feed water reservoir may be a bearing feed water pump also identified as on . The pump enables the product water to flow from the bearing feed water reservoir to the regenerative blower. In the exemplary embodiment the flow rate is 60 ml min with a pressure ranging from 2 psi to 2 psi. Any type of pump may be used with preference that the pump can supply a sufficient quantity of water to maintain the proper lubricating flow to the bearings within the regenerative blower. In addition the pump preferably is heat resistant to withstand the high temperature of the surrounding environment and of the high temperature product water passing through the pump. In the exemplary embodiment the bearing feed water pump is a GOTEC linear positive displacement pump model number ETX 50 VIC. In alternate embodiments other pump types such as a centrifugal pump may be used with preference that the pump is capable of operating in high temperatures.

The apparatus may also include a control manifold having a plurality of control valves for the different water flow paths. Typically this manifold may include a control valve within the inlet piping for the source water to controls the amount of water that enters the apparatus. At excessive pressures the control valve could fail to open or once open may fail to close thus a regulator may be included in inlet piping to regulate the pressure of the source water.

Similarly the manifold may also include a control valve within the outlet piping carrying blowdown water out of the apparatus. This valve may allow the operator to control the amount of blowdown water leaving the apparatus.

The control manifold may also include a control valve within the outlet piping for the product water. This valve may allow the operator to control the amount of product water leaving the apparatus. In the exemplary embodiment there is one control valve for each section of outlet piping. Similarly the apparatus includes a vent valve to release gaseous compounds from the evaporator condenser. The vent valve maintains operating conditions of the apparatus by venting off small amounts of steam. Releasing steam prevents the apparatus from overheating. Similarly releasing steam also prevents the buildup of compounds in the condenser space that may prevent the apparatus from functioning.

Typically the control valves may be same type. In the exemplary embodiment the controls are solenoid type valves Series 4BKR manufactured from SPARTAN SCIENTIFIC Boardman Ohio 44513 model number 9 4BKR 55723 1 002. In alternate embodiments the controls may be but are not limited to proportional valves. The control valves are electronically operated using an electrical input of zero to five volts.

Moreover the apparatus may include a backpressure regulator as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2005 0194048 A1 published on Sep. 8 2005 entitled Backpressure Regulator the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.

The water vapor distillation apparatus may include a voltage regulator. Typically the apparatus may receive single phase power provided from a traditional wall outlet. In other countries however the voltage may differ. To account for this difference in voltage a voltage regulator may be included in the apparatus to ensure the proper type of voltage is supplied to the electrical components of the apparatus.

In addition a battery may be included within the system to provide electrical energy to the apparatus. When electrical energy is supplied from a battery the apparatus will preferably include an electrical inverter to change incoming electricity from direct current to alternating current. In other embodiments the apparatus may receive electrical energy from a Stirling and internal combustion engine. These embodiments may also require an electrical inverter. In other embodiments the apparatus may include a boost loop to increase the amount of voltage supplied to the apparatus to power the electrical components.

Also disclosed herein is a method of water vapor distillation including the steps of straining the source water heating the source water using a heat exchanger transforming the source water into low pressure steam removing water from the source vapor to create dry low pressure steam compressing the dry low pressure steam into high pressure steam and condensing the high pressure steam into product water.

Referring now to source water is contaminated water that is transformed into a vapor and later condenses into clean and pure water called product water. illustrates the source water fluid paths within the apparatus disclosed previously. The source water enters the apparatus through an inlet tube connected to the heat exchanger as illustrated in . Typically a pump may be installed to cause the source water to flow through the inlet tube into the heat exchanger. Within the inlet tube there may be a strainer installed between where the source water enters the tube and the connection with the heat exchanger see . In other embodiments a regulator may be positioned within the inlet tube to regulate the flow of the source water into the apparatus. Similarly in one embodiment a valve may be positioned within the inlet tube to isolate the apparatus from the water source.

Referring still to in operation source water passes through a strainer to remove large particulates. These large particulates may adversely affect the operation of the apparatus by clogging the inlet and blowdown valves or the inner tubes of the heat exchanger. In addition particulate may be deposited onto the tubes of the evaporator condenser reducing the efficiency of the apparatus. In the exemplary embodiment the strainer is located before the control valves. In other embodiments the strainer may be positioned before the inlet pump not shown . In the exemplary embodiment the strainer has a 50 micron user cleaner unit. In alternate embodiments the apparatus may not include a strainer . After the source water passes through the strainer the water enters the heat exchanger .

Referring now to upon entering the heat exchanger the source water may fill the outer tube of the heat exchanger . In the exemplary embodiment the heat exchanger is a counter flow tube in tube heat exchanger. The source water enters the heat exchanger at approximately ambient temperature. Conversely the product and blowdown water enter the heat exchanger having temperature greater than ambient. The source water enters the heat exchanger at one end and the product and blowdown water enter the heat exchanger at the opposite end. As the source water flows through the heat exchanger the high thermal energy of the product and blowdown water is conducted outwardly from the inner tubes of the heat exchanger to the source water. This increase in the temperature of the source water enables the water to more efficiently change into steam in the evaporator condenser.

Referring now to once the source water passes through the counter flow tube in tube heat exchanger the water exits the heat exchanger and enters the regenerative blower motor cooling loop. During operation the regenerative blower motor creates thermal energy. This thermal energy must be removed from blower motor for the blower to operate properly. As the source water passes through the blower motor cooling loop the thermal energy created by the blower motor is transferred to the source water. The heat transfer allows the blower motor to maintain a lower operating temperature and raises the temperature of the source water. The higher temperature of the source water increases the efficiency of the apparatus because less energy is required to produce the phase change of the source water to a vapor. The source water leaves the regenerative blower motor cooling loop enters the evaporator condenser through the sump illustrated in .

Referring now to also present in the apparatus is highly concentrated source water called blowdown water. This water removes particulate from the apparatus to prevent scaling on the tubes of the evaporator condenser. This fluid may contain any non volatile contaminants that were present in the source water. These contaminants may include but are not limited to be scale from foulants heavy metals or organic compounds. Specifically these foulants may include but not limited to calcium carbonate magnesium carbonate In addition blowdown water transfers thermal energy to the source water when passing through the heat exchanger. shows the blowdown water fluid paths within the apparatus disclosed previously. The blowdown water is collected in the steam chest as shown in . As the low pressure water vapor passes through the steam chest water droplets are separated from the water vapor. These droplets accumulate in the bottom of the steam chest and are added to the existing blowdown water. As the level of blowdown water increases the water exits the steam chest through a port. Through this port the blowdown water leaves the steam chest and enters the level sensor housing illustrated in .

Referring now to the blowdown water enters the level sensor housing and fills the settling tank . As the blowdown water passes through the settling tank particulate within the water settles to the bottom of the tank and thus separating the water from the particulate. Separating the particulate from the water prevents the particulate from entering the heat exchanger. The heat exchanger may be adversely affected by the presence of particulate in the water. Particulate may collect in the inner tubes of the heat exchanger causing the heat exchanger to have a lower efficiency. Particulate may reduce flow of blowdown through the inner tubes reducing the amount of thermal energy capable of being transferred to the source water. In some instances the collection of particulate may produce a blockage within the inner tubes preventing the flow of blowdown water through the heat exchanger. As blowdown water fills the settling tank the water may also fill the blowdown level sensor reservoir illustrated in .

Referring now to upon exiting the level sensor housing the blowdown water may pass through a strainer before entering the heat exchanger shown on . The strainer removes particulates within the blowdown water that remain after flowing through the settling tank of the level sensor housing . Removing particulates from the blowdown water reduces particulate build up in the heat exchanger and valves within the system. The blow down water enters the heat exchanger fills one of the inner tubes as shown in . The water fills the heat exchanger as shown in . As the blowdown water passes through the heat exchanger thermal energy is conducted from the higher temperature blowdown water to the lower temperature source water through the tube containing the blowdown water. The blowdown water exits the heat exchanger illustrated on . After leaving the heat exchanger blowdown fluid may pass through a mixing can to prevent steam being released from the apparatus potentially harming a person or adjacent object. Steam may be periodically vented from the condenser space to maintain the apparatus energy balance. Similarly gaseous vapors ex. volatile organic compounds air must be purged from the condenser space to maintain proper operation of the apparatus. Both the steam and gaseous vapors are released into the mixing can having low temperature blowdown water. By mixing the steam into the blowdown water the steam condenses allowing for steam to be released safely. In other embodiments there may be a valve positioned in the tubing connecting the heat exchanger and mixing can to isolate the mixing can from the apparatus or adjust the flow rate of the blowdown water exiting the apparatus.

Referring now to product water is formed when high pressure steam condenses when contacting the outer surface of the tubes within the evaporator condenser. shows the product water fluid paths within the apparatus disclosed previously. The product water is created in the evaporator condenser as shown in . As the high pressure steam condenses against the outer surface of the tubes of the evaporator condenser forming water droplets. These droplets accumulate in the bottom of the evaporator condenser creating product water. As the level of product water increases the water exits the evaporator condenser through a port and enters the level sensor housing illustrated in .

Referring now to the product water may enter the level sensor housing through a port connected to the product level sensor reservoir shown on . This reservoir collects incoming product water and measures the amount of water created by the apparatus. The water exits the product level sensor reservoir and enters the heat exchanger illustrated in . While passing through the heat exchanger the high temperature product water transfers thermal energy to the low temperature source water through the inner tubes of the heat exchanger . illustrates the product water passing through the heat exchanger . After passing through the heat exchanger the product water exits the apparatus as illustrated in . In the exemplary embodiment the apparatus may include a product divert valve and product valve . The product valve allows the operator to adjust the flow rate of product water leaving the apparatus. Typically the once the reservoir is 50 percent full then the product valve is cycled such that the amount of water entering the reservoir is equal to the amount leaving the reservoir. During initial start up of the system the first several minutes of production the product water produced is rejected as waste by opening the product divert valve . Once it has been determined that the product is of sufficient quality the product divert valve closes and the product valve begins operation.

Referring now to as product water fills the product level sensor reservoir water may also enter the bearing feed water reservoir . The bearing feed water reservoir collects incoming product water for lubricating the bearings within the regenerative blower . Product water exits the bearing feed water tank and may enter a pump as shown in . The pump moves the product water to the regenerative blower. After leaving the pump the product water enters the regenerative blower illustrated on .

Referring now to upon entering the blower the product water provides lubrication between the bearings and the shaft of the blower. After exiting the regenerative blower the product water may re enter the level sensor housing through the bearing feed water reservoir see .

Now referring to to support the flow of the water throughout the apparatus vent paths may be provided. These paths support the flow of the water through the apparatus by removing air or steam from the apparatus. The vent paths are shown in . illustrates a vent path from the blowdown level sensor reservoir to the steam chest of the evaporator condenser . This path allows air within the reservoir to exit allowing more blowdown water to enter the reservoir. Similarly illustrates a vent path from the product level sensor reservoir to the evaporator condenser . This path allows air within the reservoir to exit allowing product water to enter the reservoir. Finally shows a vent path from the condenser area of the evaporator condenser to allow air within the apparatus to exit the apparatus to the surrounding atmosphere through a mixing can . In addition this vent path assists with maintaining the apparatus equilibrium by venting small quantities of steam from the apparatus.

Referring now to in operation source water enters the sump of the evaporator condenser in the manner described in . When source water initially enters the sump additional thermal energy may be transferred to the water using a heating element. Typically the heating element may be used during initial start up of the water vapor distillation apparatus. Otherwise the heater will not typically be used. As the amount of source water in the sump increases the water flows out of the sump and into the tubes of the evaporator condenser through ports within a plate positioned between the sump and the evaporator condenser illustrated in . During initial start up of the apparatus the evaporator section of the evaporator condenser is flooded with source water until there is sufficient amount of water in the blowdown level sensor reservoir. After initial start up the tubes remain full of source water.

Referring now to once in the tubes the source water is heated from conduction of thermal energy through the tube walls from the high pressure steam present on the outside of the tubes . illustrates the wet low pressure steam flowing through the tubes of the evaporator condenser . The wet low pressure steam travels through the tubes of the evaporator condenser and enters the steam chest illustrated in . As steam flows through the interior of the steam chest the water droplet within the steam are separated from the steam. These droplets collect at the base of the steam chest and are added to the blowdown water already present in the base see . Blowdown water flows out of the apparatus in manner described in . The dry low pressure steam exits the steam chest and enters the regenerative blower as shown on .

Now referring to once in the regenerative blower the dry low pressure steam is compressed creating dry high pressure steam. After the dry steam is compressed the high pressure steam exits the regenerative blower and enters the steam tube of the steam chest . See illustrating the steam exiting the blower and entering the steam tube of the steam chest .

Now referring to the steam tube is in fluid connection with the inner cavity of the evaporator condenser . The steam tube provides an isolated pathway for the steam to enter the condenser side of the evaporator condenser from the blower . The high pressure steam is isolated to maintain the pressure of the steam and to ensure that the steam has no contaminants. The dry high pressure steam exits the steam tube of the steam chest and enters the inner cavity of the evaporator condenser . See showing the inner cavity of the evaporator condenser containing high pressure steam. As the high pressure steam contacts the outer surfaces tubes of the evaporator condenser the steam transfers thermal energy to the tubes . This energy is conducted through the tube walls to the source water located within the tubes . When the energy is transferred from the steam to the tube walls the steam condenses from a vapor to a fluid. This fluid is known as product water. As water droplets form on the outside of the tube walls these droplets flow down to the base of the evaporator condenser . See showing the formation of product water within the inner cavity of the evaporator condenser . When the amount of product water within the cavity is sufficient product water may flow out of the evaporator condenser as illustrated in .

Referring now to there are several factors that may affect the performance of the apparatus described. One of these factors is pressure difference across the regenerative blower. is a chart illustrating the relationship between the amount energy required to produce one liter of product water and the change in pressure across the regenerative blower. Ideally one would want to operate the blower such that the most product water is produce using the least amount electricity. From this graph operating the blower with a pressure differential between 1.5 psi and 2 psi produces a liter of product water using the least amount of energy. Operating the blower at pressures above or below this range increases the amount of energy that is needed to produce one liter of water.

Now referring to another factor that may affect the performance of the apparatus is the number of heat transfer tubes installed within the inner cavity of the evaporator condenser assembly. illustrates the relationship between the number of heat transfer tubes and the rate of production of product water for a given change in pressure across the regenerative blower. From this chart it is determined that having a greater number of heat transfer tubes increases the production of product water. In this graph the configuration producing the largest amount of product water per hour is the assembly having 85 tubes. The configuration producing the least amount of water is the assembly having only 43 tubes for pressures below 2 psi.

Referring now to this figure illustrates the amount of product water created by different heat transfer tube configurations. In this graph the configuration having 102 heat transfer tubes generated the highest amount of product water. In contrast the configuration having a shorter tube length and only 48 tubes produced the least amount of product water.

Now referring to despite having a lower number of tubes than other configurations the 48 heat transfer tube configuration produces more water per surface area. illustrates the relationship between the amount of product created and the size of the heat transfer surface area. This chart shows that the 48 heat transfer tube configuration having a tube length of 15 inches is the most efficient design. The least efficient configuration is the 102 heat transfer tube design. Thus having a large number of tubes within the evaporator condenser may produce more water but a design having a lower number of tubes may provide the most efficient use of resources.

Referring now to this figure illustrates the difference of the performance two 48 heat transfer tube designs. In this chart the difference in the designs is the tube lengths. At various pressure changes across the regenerative blower this graph contrasts the amount of energy used and rate of production of water for the two configurations. The configuration having the 20 inch long tubes produces slightly more product while consuming slightly less energy at equal pressure differences across the regenerative blower.

The pressure difference across the compressor directly determines the amount of product water that the apparatus may generate. To ensure a particular amount of product water output from the apparatus one can adjust the pressure difference across the compressor. Increasing the speed of the compressor will typically result in an increase in pressure differential across the two sides of the evaporator condenser. Increasing the pressure differential increases rate at which source water is evaporated into clean product water.

One of the limiting factors in controlling the water vapor distillation apparatus is the amount of blowdown water that is required to operate the machine. Without sufficient blowdown water particulate separated from the source water will remain in the apparatus. This build up of particulate will adversely affect the operation and efficiency of the apparatus.

To ensure that particulate is removed from the apparatus there must be a sufficient amount of blowdown water present to carry the particulate out of the apparatus. To determine how much blowdown water is required to operate the apparatus in a particular environment one must know the quality of the water entering the apparatus source water . If the source water has a high concentration of particulate then more blowdown water will be needed to absorb and remove the particulate from the apparatus. Conversely if the source water has a low concentration of particulate then less blowdown water will be required.

To control and observe the amount of product and blowdown water generated by the apparatus a couple of different control methods may be implemented. These schemes may include but are not limited to measuring the level of product and blowdown water within reservoirs located in the apparatus measuring the flow rate of the product and blowdown water created by the apparatus measuring the quality of the incoming source water and measuring the output quality of the product water.

The level sensor assembly of the exemplary embodiment may measure both the level of and the flow rate of water. The water level may be measured by the movement of the level sensor assembly. As the water fills the reservoir the water produces a change in position of the level sensor assembly.

One may determine the flow rate of water by knowing the change in position of the level sensor assembly the area of the reservoir and the time associated with the change in water level. Using a float sensor to determine flow is advantageous because there is no pressure drop resulting from the use of a float sensor. The flow rate may indicate the performance of the apparatus and whether that performance is consistent with normal operation of the apparatus. This information allows the operator to determine whether the apparatus is functionally properly. For example if the operator determines the flow rate is below normal operating conditions then the operator may check the strainer within the inlet piping for impurities or the tubes of the evaporator condenser for scaling. Similarly the operator may use the flow rate to make adjustments to the apparatus. These adjustments may include changing the amount of blowdown and product water created. Although a flow rate may indicate performance of the apparatus this measurement is not required.

The water quality of either the inlet source water or the outlet product water may be used to control the operation of the water vapor distillation apparatus. This control method determines the operation of the machine based on the quality of the water. In one embodiment the conductivity of the product water is monitored. When the conductivity exceeds a specified limit than the sensor sends a signal to shut down the apparatus. In some embodiments the sensors may be but are not limited to a conductivity sensor. In an alternate embodiment may include monitoring the conductivity of the blowdown water. When the conductivity of the blowdown water exceeds a specified limit then the sensor sends a signal to increase the amount of source water entering the apparatus. The increase in source water will reduce the conductivity of the blowdown water. In another embodiment the conductivity of the source water may be monitored. When the conductivity exceeds a specified limit than the sensor sends a signal to adjust the flow rate of the source water. The higher the source water conductivity may result in higher flow rates for the source and blowdown water.

In alternate embodiments the apparatus may include a control scheme where the apparatus has a steady state mode. During this mode the apparatus reduces the amount of power consumed. In other embodiments the heating elements may remain operating during this mode to maintain a particular temperature or temperature range of the source water in the sump. Maintaining the temperature of the source water in the sump reduces the amount of time for the machine to start generating more product water. In addition during this mode the regenerative blower is not functioning and the inlet and outlet valves are closed.

Examples of tests that may be performed on a source water sample to analyze the quality of the source water include but are not limited to bacterial testing mineral testing and chemical testing. Bacterial tests indicate the amount of bacteria that may be present within the sample. The most common type of bacterial test is total coliform.

Mineral testing results may indicate the amount of mineral impurities in the water. Large amounts of minerals and other impurities may pose a health hazard and affect the appearance and usefulness of the water.

Another type of water testing that may be accomplished is chemical testing. Many man made chemicals may contaminate a water supply and pose health hazards to potential consumers of the water. Unless a specific chemical or type of chemical is suspected to be in the water this type of test may not be routinely performed as the testing is expensive for unspecified chemical contaminants. However if a particular chemical is suspected to be present in the source water a test may be performed. Examples of some specific water quality tests are described below.

pH measures the relative acidity of the water. A pH level of 7.0 is considered neutral. Pure water has a pH of 7.0. Water with a pH level less than 7.0 is considered to be acidic. The lower the pH the more acidic the water. Water with a pH greater than 7.0 is considered to be basic or alkaline. The greater the pH the greater its alkalinity. In the US the pH of natural water is usually between 6.5 and 8.5. Fresh water sources with a pH below 5 or above 9.5 may not be able to sustain plant or animal species. pH may be determined using any known method in the art for testing.

The pH is preferably measured immediately at the source water test site as changes in temperature affect pH value. Preferably the water sample is taken at the source at a location away from the bank if using a lake stream river puddle etc and below the water surface.

Nitrate Nitrogen is an element required by all living plants and animals to build protein. In aquatic ecosystems nitrogen is present in many forms. It may combine with oxygen to form a compound called nitrate. Nitrates may come from fertilizers sewage and industrial waste. They may cause eutrophication of lakes or ponds. Eutrophication occurs when nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates are added to a body of water. These nutrients usually come from runoff from farmlands and lawns sewage detergents animal wastes and leaking septic systems. The presence of nitrate may be determined using any known method in the art for testing

Turpidity Turbidity refers to how clear or how cloudy the water is. Clear water has a low turbidity level and cloudy or muddy water has a high turbidity level. High levels of turbidity may be caused by suspended particles in the water such as soil sediments sewage and plankton. Soil may enter the water by erosion or runoff from nearby lands. Sediments may be stirred up by too much activity in the water for example by fish or humans. Sewage is a result of waste discharge and high levels of plankton may be due to excessive nutrients in the water.

Where the turbidity of the water is high there will be many suspended particles in it. These solid particles will block sunlight and prevent aquatic plants from getting the sunlight they need for photosynthesis. The plants will produce less oxygen thereby decreasing the DO levels. The plants will die more easily and be decomposed by bacteria in the water which will reduce the DO levels even further. Turbidity may be determined using any known method in the art for testing

Coliform Where coliform bacteria are present in the water supply it is an indication that the water supply may be contaminated with sewage or other decomposing waste. Usually coliform bacteria are found in greater abundance on the surface film of the water or in the sediments on the bottom.

Fecal coliform found in the lower intestines of humans and other warm blooded animals is one type of coliform bacteria. The presence of fecal coliform in a water supply is a good indication that sewage has polluted the water. Testing may be done for fecal coliform specifically or for total coliform bacteria which includes all coliform bacteria strains and may indicate fecal contamination. The presence of coliform may be determined using any known method in the art for testing.

In operation the water machine may perform conductivity testing of the source water and or the product water to determine the quality of the water entering and exiting the system. This testing may be accomplished using conductivity sensors installed within the inlet and outlet piping of the system. Water having a high conductivity indicates that the water has greater amount of impurities. Conversely water having a lower amount of conductivity indicates that water has a lower level of impurities. This type of testing is generic and provides only a general indication of the purity quality of the water being analyzed.

Other types of testing may be accomplished for analyzing specific levels of the following water impurities characteristics include but are not limited to pH hardness chlorides color turbidity sulfate chlorine nitrites nitrates and coliforms. Typically to analyze the water entering or exiting the machine the operator may first obtain a sample of the water. After obtaining the desired sample the water may then be tested using a water testing kit available from Hach Company Loveland Colo. 80539 0389. Other methods of testing the purity of water may include sending the water to laboratory for analysis.

Also disclosed herein is where the apparatus for distilling water described previously may be implemented into a distribution system as described in U.S. Publication No. US 2007 0112530 A1 published on May 17 2007 entitled Systems and Methods for Distributed Utilities the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein. Furthermore a monitoring and or communications system may also be included within the distribution system as described in U.S. Publication No. US 2007 0112530 A1 published on May 17 2007 entitled Systems and Methods for Distributed Utilities the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.

Although the exemplary embodiment of the still water vapor distillation apparatus has been described alternate embodiments of still including alternate embodiments of particular elements of the still i.e. heat exchanger evaporator condenser compressor etc are contemplated. Thus in some alternate embodiments one of more of the elements are replaced with alternate embodiment elements described herein. In some embodiments the entire still is replaced by an alternate embodiment for example the system as described in one embodiment utilizes the exemplary embodiment as the still while in other embodiments the system utilizes an alternate embodiment.

Referring to alternate embodiments of the water vapor distillation apparatus having a liquid ring pump disclosed. The ring pump may include a fully rotatable housing that provides maximum reduction in frictional loss yet maintains simplicity of design and cost effectiveness of production is shown in . As can be seen in stator is stationary relative to rotor and comprises an intake and exit . Steam is drawn in at pressure Pand passes into rotor chamber . Rotor is off set from a central axis Z upon which the rotating housing and the liquid ring pump are centered. As rotor turns about central shaft with rotor bearings the effective volume of chamber decreases. Steam is thereby compressed to pressure Pas it is carried along a rotational path into exit to be routed to an evaporator condenser of . Preferably a rotatable housing not shown rotates with the liquid ring in the liquid ring pump to reduce energy loss due to friction.

Referring to the stator has support structures in the input and output regions. The individual vanes of rotor can be seen below the support structures in the top view of stator shown in as well as the concentric placement of rotor about the central axis. This particular embodiment of a liquid ring pump is both axially fed and axially ported and may have a vertical horizontal or other orientation during operation. shows yet another view of this embodiment.

The liquid ring pump is designed to operate within a fairly narrow range of input and output pressure such that generally the apparatus operates in the range of from 5 to 15 psig. Apparatus pressure may be regulated using check valves to release steam from chamber of . Improved apparatus performance is preferably achieved by placing exit of the exhaust port at a specific angle of rotation about the rotor axis wherein the specific angle corresponds to the pressure rise desired for still operation. One embodiment of a specific port opening angle to regulate apparatus pressure is shown in . Exit is placed at approximately 90 degrees of rotation about the rotor access allowing steam from chamber to vent. Placing exit at a high angle of rotation about the stator axis would raise the apparatus pressure and lower pump throughput while placing exit at a lower angle of rotation about the stator axis would result in lower apparatus pressure and increased pump throughput. Choosing the placement of exit to optimize apparatus pressure may yield improved pump efficiency. Further the placement of exit to maintain apparatus pressure may minimize apparatus complexity by eliminating check valves at the exhaust ports to chamber thereby providing a simpler more cost effective compressor.

Referring now to during operation it may be desirable to measure the depth of the liquid ring in the compressor to optimize performance. In the embodiments herein disclosed liquid ring pump housing rotates with the liquid ring in the pump and the temperature of the fluid is typically around 110 degrees C. Methods of measuring ring depth include any one of the usual methods such as using ultra sound radar floats fluid conductivity and optical sensors. Because of the complexities of the rotating housing use of a capacitive sensor is a preferred embodiment for this measurement wherein as the depth of the fluid in the capacitor changes the capacitance of the capacitor also changes.

Still referring to a disc shaped capacitor sensor plate is mounted to the bottom of rotating housing equidistant from the bottom surface A of rotating housing and the bottom surface A of rotor . The capacitor is thus defined by housing rotor and capacitor sensor . Leads connect the capacitor from capacitor sensor through a passageway A in rotating housing shaft to the secondary of a core transformer preferably of ferrite not shown . In one embodiment the secondary is rotating at the same speed as the capacitor plate and is in inductive communication with the primary of the ferrite core transformer. The primary winding is stationary and signals to and from the level measuring capacitor are communicated through the transformer in this way enabling depth information to be transmitted from a rotating position to a stationary position. Capacitance is measure by determining the LC resonance of the capacitor C with the inductance L of the transformer secondary. In an exemplary embodiment an LC oscillator circuit is constructed and the oscillation frequency is used as a measure of the capacitance.

Referring to this figure illustrates an alternate design of the pump to prevent contaminated fluid droplets from being entrained and carried along with vapor to evaporator condenser of . In such an embodiment the liquid ring pump is within the head space of the evaporator condenser and mist is eliminated as rotating housing rotates wherein the rotation creates a cyclone effect flinging mist and water droplets off by centrifugal force to collide with the still housing and run down to the water in the sump. There may also be fins extending from the outside of rotating housing to enhance circulation and rotation of vapor in the annular space between rotating housing and fixed housing . A steam exit is provided for passage of steam to evaporator condenser .

Referring now to an alternative embodiment for a liquid ring pump may include a ring pump with an outer rotatable housing that encloses a single two channel stator body and a rotor wherein the seal surface between the rotatable housing and stationary stator body is a cylinder. Two channel stator body is kept stationary in reference to a chamber of pump as well as to rotor and rotatable housing and comprises an intake and an exit . Steam is drawn in at pressure Pand passes through an intake orifice . When the intake orifice lines up with an intake hole in rotor as the rotor spins around stationary stator the steam passes through intake hole into a rotor chamber . Rotor is offset from a central axis Z so that as rotor turns the effective volume of rotor chamber decreases. In this way steam is compressed to pressure Pas it is carried along a rotational path to an exit hole in rotor . As rotor turns exit hole lines up with an exit orifice of stationary exit and the steam at pressure Ppasses through exit orifice into exit to be routed to the evaporator condenser. In such an embodiment rotatable housing rotates with water present in chamber thereby reducing frictional energy losses due to windage. There may also be a small hole present in the housing to permit water to leave and or enter chamber thereby controlling the fluid level in the pump. In addition rotor has multiple vanes that are readily apparent when rotor is viewed from above as in . Individual rotor chamber and individual intake hole and exit hole for each rotor chamber are also easily seen in this view.

Referring to Another alternative embodiment of a liquid ring pump wherein the interface between rotatable housing and stator is conical rather than cylindrical. In this embodiment a rotor drive shaft has an end situated upon a bearing that allows rotatable rotor housing to rotate with rotor . Intake and exit with corresponding intake orifice and exit orifice are kept stationary with respect to rotor and rotor housing .

Referring now to H and I other further embodiments may include either a conical or axial seal present between stationary sections and and rotor . In the conical embodiment seen most clearly in seal thereby separates intake orifice from exit orifice of rotor to prevent leaks. The liquid ring pumps shown in and are both axially fed and radially ported in contrast with the embodiment of a liquid ring pump discussed with reference to vide supra which is axially fed and axially ported.

In alternate embodiments the water vapor distillation apparatus may include a backpressure regulator. Backpressure regulators may assist with maintaining the safe and optimal operation of processes conducted under pressure. In operation the water vapor distillation apparatus may include a backpressure regulator to purify brackish or sea water into drinking water excess apparatus pressure from start up volatile components or created from compressors running off specification may constitute a danger to operators if such pressure is not relieved in a safe manner. As well volatile components present in feed streams at start up may present contaminants that interfere with proper operation of the apparatus. Backpressure regulators may serve to relieve excess pressure and to return an operating apparatus to a desired operating pressure.

The water vapor distillation apparatus embodiments described previously generally operate above atmospheric pressure typically around 10 psig. Such an apparatus advantageously provides higher steam density at the higher pressure thereby allowing more steam to be pumped through a positive displacement pump than at lower pressure. The resulting higher throughput provides overall improved system efficiency. Further the higher throughput and higher system pressure reduces the power needed for compressor and eliminates the need for two additional pumps one for pumping condensed product and another for pumping blowdown stream. Overall construction is simplified as many shapes withstand internal pressure better than external pressure. Importantly operating at super atmospheric pressure reduces the impact of minor leaks on the overall efficiency and performance. Non condensable gases such as air inhibit the condensation process and would be magnified at sub atmospheric pressure where minor leaks would serve to suck in air something which will not occur in a system operating at super atmospheric pressure.

Referring now to these figures depict views of a backpressure regulator that may be incorporated into the water vapor distillation apparatus when operating the apparatus above atmospheric pressure. The backpressure regulator has a vessel containing an orifice . One side of the orifice is connected to a pressurized conduit of an apparatus e.g. the outlet of a compressor in a vapor compression distillation apparatus which may be exposed to the fluctuating elevated pressure. The other side of the orifice terminates in a port . The port is covered by a movable stop in the shape of a ball. The stop is retained to an arm by means of a retainer at a fixed distance from a pivot pin . The arm is attached by a hinge via the pivot pin to a point with a fixed relation to the orifice port . The arm includes a counter mass suspended from the arm that is movable along an axis such that the distance between the counter mass and the pivot pin may be varied. In the embodiment shown in the axial direction of the orifice is perpendicular to the direction of the gravitational vector . The backpressure regulator may also include a housing which prevents foreign matter from entering the regulator and interfering with the function of the internal components.

Still referring to in operation the arm maintains a horizontal position with respect to the direction of gravity when the pressure in the pressurized conduit is below a given set point this arm position in this embodiment is known as the closed position and corresponds to the stop covering the port . When the pressure in the conduit exceeds the set point a force acts on the stop which results in a torque acting around the pivot pin . The torque acts to rotate the arm around the pivot pin in a counter clockwise direction causing the arm to move away from its closed position and exposing the port which allows fluids to escape from the orifice . When the pressure in the conduit is relieved below the set point the force of gas is no longer sufficient to keep the arm away from its closed position thus the arm returns to the closed position and the stop covers the port .

Still referring to the arm acts as a lever in creating adjustable moments and serves to multiply the force applied by the counter mass through the stop to the port . This force multiplication reduces the weight needed to close the orifice as opposed to a design where the stop alone acts vertically on top of the orifice as in a pressure cooker. Thus a large port size to promote expedited venting from a pressurized conduit may be covered by a relatively lightweight large sized stop the counter mass acting to adjust the desired set point less design effort may be expended in choosing specific port sizes and stop properties. The addition of an axis for adjusting the position of the counter mass in the present embodiment allows for changes in the multiplier ratio. As the counter mass is moved to a position closer to the pivot pin the multiplier ratio is reduced creating a lower closing force. If the counter mass is moved farther from the pivot pin the multiplier ratio is increased hence increasing the closing force. Therefore the position of the counter mass effectively acts to adjust the set point of the backpressure regulator.

Adjustment of the backpressure regulator set point may be useful when the backpressure regulator is utilized in apparatus at higher altitudes. When the atmospheric pressure is lower the apparatus operating pressure is commensurately lower. As a result the temperature of the distillation apparatus is lowered which may adversely affect apparatus performance. As well such adjustment allows one to identify set points for the backpressure regulator that are desired by the end user. The use of a counter mass to apply the closing force may also lower cost of the backpressure regulator and reduce component fatigue. In a particular embodiment the adjustable counter mass is designed to allow a range of set points with a lowest set point substantially less than or equal to 10 psig and a highest set point substantially greater than or equal to 17 psig. Thus various embodiments allow for precise apparatus pressure regulation unlike devices which act simply as safety relief valves.

Referring now to these figures illustrate an alternate embodiment of the back pressure regulator having an orifice configured such that the port is oriented vertically with respect to the direction of gravity . Thus other embodiments may accommodate any orifice orientation while maintaining the use of an adjustable counter mass.

The backpressure regulator may be configured to allow a small leakage rate below the set point in order to purge the build up of volatile gases that act to insulate heat exchange and suppress boiling in a system the regulator is designed however to allow pressure to build in the pressurized conduit despite this small leakage. In one embodiment release of volatile components from a pressurized conduit below the set point of the backpressure regulator may also be achieved through a specifically designed leak vent while the arm of the backpressure regulator is in the closed position. The leak vent is configured to allow a certain leakage rate from the port or the orifice while the pressure in the conduit is below the set point. Such leak vent may be designed by a variety of means known to those skilled in the art. Non limiting examples include specific positioning of the stop and port to allow a small opening while the arm is in the closed position designing the port such that a small opening not coverable by the stop is always exposed specifying a particular rigid non compliant seal configuration between the stop and port when the arm is in the closed position and configuring the orifice leading to the port to have a small opening to allow leakage of fluids.

Referring now these figures illustrate alternate embodiments of the back pressure regulator allowing the leakage of volatiles below the set point. In one alternate embodiment the port has a notch as shown in and the close up of region C of depicted in . Thus when a stop is in contact with the port and the arm of the backpressure regulator is in the closed position a leak vent is present at the position of the notch that allows a leakage of fluid. In another alternate embodiment of the backpressure regulator orifice has a small opening as depicted in and blow up of region E of depicted in . The opening is configured such that a leak vent is created when the stop covers the port since fluids may leak through the opening .

Various features of a backpressure regulator may be altered or modified. For example stops to be used with backpressure regulators may have any shape size or mass consistent with desired operating conditions such stops need not be ball shaped as shown in some embodiments discussed herein. As well stops of different weight but similar sizes may be utilized with the retainer to alter the set point of the regulator. Similarly counter masses of different sizes shapes and masses may be utilized with various embodiments with preference that they are accommodated by the axis and arm configurations compare in with in such counter masses may be attached and oriented relative to the arm by any of a variety of techniques apparent to those skilled in the art. The pivot pin placement need not be positioned as shown in but may be positioned wherever advantageous to provide the mechanical advantage required to achieve a particular pressure set point.

Referring back to other embodiments of the backpressure regulator may optionally utilize the drain orifice feature described earlier. Also embodiments of the backpressure regulator may not utilize the counter mass force adjustment feature relying on the specific properties of a stop to provide the set point for the backpressure regulator.

Other embodiments of the water vapor distillation apparatus may not utilize a vessel but rely on orifices that are intrinsically part of the system. In such instances the backpressure regulator arm may be directly attached to a portion of the system such that the arm stop and counter mass are appropriately oriented for the operation of the regulator.

Now referring to the vessel includes a drain orifice . Since the backpressure regulator may operate within a bounded region of a large system the drain orifice acts as a pathway to release fluids that are purged from the pressurized conduit through orifice into the bounded region . The drain orifice may connect the bounded region to another area of the larger system or to the external environment . In addition the build up of gases in the bounded region may result in condensation of such gases. Also gases purged through the orifice may be entrained with droplets of fluid that may accumulate in the bounded region . Thus the drain orifice may also be used to purge any build up of condensables that accumulate in the bounded region the condensables may also be released from the bounded region using a separate orifice .

Referring now to in alternate embodiments the apparatus may maintain a constant blowdown water flow to prevent scaling and other accumulation in the apparatus as follows. Water level in head chamber is adjusted through a feedback control loop using level sensor L valve V and source pump to maintain proper water flow through the blowdown stream . The three way source pump fill valve is set to pump water into sump which causes water level in head chamber to rise. As fluid level rises in head chamber fluid overflows past a dam like bather into blowdown control chamber containing blowdown level sensor L. As required blowdown valve V is controlled to allow water flow from blowdown control chamber through heat exchanger to extract heat and cool blowdown stream and flow out valve V through volatile mixer allowing cooling of hot gases and steam from the evaporator section and then completing the blowdown stream out to waste .

Still referring to the apparatus may also maintain proper product flow as follows. Product level builds up in condenser chamber and enters into product control chamber where product level sensor L is housed. Using a feedback control loop with level sensor L and valve V product stream is controlled to flow from product control chamber through heat exchanger to extract heat and cool product stream then through valve V and on out to complete the product stream as product water outlet .

The system may preferably be configured to maintain proper liquid ring pump water level by the use of a fluid recovery system to replenish fluid loss. There are several ways that fluid from the ring pump may be depleted during system operation including leakage into lower reservoir expulsion through exhaust port and evaporation. The leakage and expulsion losses may be large depending on operational parameters such as the speed of rotation and liquid ring pump throughput. These leakage and expulsion losses could require total replacement of the fluid in the pump several times per hour. The evaporation loss is typically small.

Referring to the fluid level in the ring pump may be maintained by adding additional source water product water or preferably by re circulating liquid water lost from the liquid ring pump for improved system efficiency. In one embodiment the fluid level in the ring pump is primarily maintained by re circulation of the fluid accumulated in lower reservoir . Fluid may accumulate in lower reservoir from leakage from the liquid ring pump and from fluid expelled in exhaust captured in mist eliminator and pumped to lower reservoir . Alternatively fluid expelled in exhaust and captured in mist eliminator may be returned via the liquid ring pump exhaust port. Fluid accumulated in lower reservoir may be re circulated by one of several pumping mechanisms. One exemplary method is to use a siphon pump.

Still referring to a minimum depth of water is preferably maintained in the lower reservoir for the siphon pump to perform properly. In one embodiment liquid ring pump control chamber which houses liquid ring pump level sensor L may be used to control the liquid ring pump level and control the level of water in the lower reservoir . Liquid ring pump control chamber is fluidly connected to liquid ring pump and lower reservoir . Liquid ring pump is connected to the three way source fill valve which is set to open when the liquid ring pump requires more water and it is also connected to the liquid ring pump drain valve V which opens when it is required to drain water from liquid ring pump into blowdown stream .

Still referring to if re circulated water front lower reservoir is not primarily used to maintain the fluid level in the liquid ring pump then either cold source water or product water could to be used. In the event source water were used the introduction of cold water which could be approximately 85 degrees C. colder than system temperature to the liquid ring pump would decrease system efficiency or alternatively the use of a pre heater for such cold source water would increase the energy budget of the system. Alternatively the use of product water while not adversely affecting system temperature could decrease production level and thus also lead to system inefficiency. At startup the initial fluid level for the liquid ring pump is preferably supplied from source water.

Now referring to in one embodiment the start up time may be reduced by using an external connecting valve between source and blowdown fluid lines located adjacent to heat exchanger on the cold side. To determine the level of fluid in evaporator head during the initial fill connecting valve would be open blowdown valve BV would be closed and fluid would be pumped into the system through source line . Connecting blowdown and source lines results in equal fluid height in the blowdown level sensor housing and evaporator head thereby permitting a determination of fluid level in evaporator head and enabling the evaporator to be filled to the minimum required level at startup. Using the minimum level required shortens initial warm up time and prevents spill over from the evaporator head through the liquid ring pump to the condenser when the liquid ring pump starts illustrated on .

Still referring to the concentration of solids in blowdown stream may be monitored and controlled to prevent precipitation of materials from solution and thus clogging of the system. Also during start up circulating pump may circulate water through heat exchanger to pre heat the heat exchanger to the proper temperature for normal operation. A conductivity sensor not shown may be used to determine total dissolved solid TDS content by measuring the electrical conductivity of the fluid. In a particular embodiment the sensor is an inductive sensor whereby no electrically conductive material is in contact with the fluid stream. If the TDS content in blowdown stream rises above a prescribed level for example during distillation of sea water the fluid source feed rate is increased. Increasing the fluid source feed rate will increase the rate of blowdown stream because distilled water production changes only slightly as a function of fluid feed rate and an increased blowdown stream rate results in reduced concentration of TDS thereby maintaining overall efficiency and productivity of the system.

Alternate embodiments may also include a fluid control system using level sensors and variable flow valves in a feedback configuration. Optimal operation of the still requires total fluid flow in to closely match total fluid flow out. Maintaining fluid levels in the still at near constant levels accomplishes this requirement. In a particular embodiment the sensors are capacitive level sensors a particularly robust sensor for measuring fluid levels. Capacitive level sensors have no moving parts and are insensitive to fouling and manufacture is simple and inexpensive. Opening of a variable flow valve is controlled by the level of fluid measured by the capacitive level sensor whereby the fluid level is adjusted at the level sensor location. A rising fluid level causes the valve to open more increasing flow out of the sensor volume. Conversely a falling fluid level causes the valve to close more decreasing flow out of the sensor volume.

Flow rate through the variable flow control valves and from the input pump may be determined using an in situ calibration technique. The level sensors and associated level sensor volume may be used to determine the fill or empty rate of the sensor volume. By appropriately configuring the control valves the flow rate calibration of each valve and also of the source pump may be determined.

In one embodiment a valve block not shown may be utilized to consolidate all control valves for the system into a single part which may be integrated with the fluid flow manifold. A control system comprising a sensor for total dissolved solids and blowdown stream may also be incorporated as well as a float valve or other device for controlling the height level of fluid in the head.

Referring back to there is additionally a steam flow line from head to compressor a steam outlet for diverting steam to evaporator condenser a hot product line from evaporator condenser leading through exchanger which also allows for collection of hot purified condensed product and a line not shown for diverting hot product to compressor to allow adjustment of water level to keep it constant. There may also be a drain line not shown for when the system is shut down.

Referring now to alternate embodiments may also include a fluid distribution manifold . shows one face of the pump side of one particular embodiment of a fluid distribution manifold . Input in the form of raw source feed flows through port and blowdown stream output flows through port . Additional output in the form of product flows through port while port chamber provides the vent for volatiles output and port provides the drain output for liquid ring pump. shows the other face of the pump side of the same particular embodiment of fluid distribution manifold . Port chamber for output of volatiles is apparent as is the drain for a liquid ring pump. In this view of this particular embodiment a condenser steam mist eliminator chamber is visible as is a mist collector and drain area .

Referring specifically to this figure illustrates one face of the evaporator condenser side of the same particular embodiment of fluid distribution manifold . Raw source feed port as well as blowdown passage ports and product passage ports are readily visible in this view. In addition evaporator steam passage port and condenser steam passage port may be seen.

Referring specifically to this figure illustrates the other face of the evaporator condenser side of the same particular embodiment of fluid distribution manifold . Again blowdown passage port is visible as is liquid ring pump drain port a second condenser steam mist eliminator evaporator steam mist eliminator and mist collector and drain area . Also a sump level control chamber can be seen in this view along with a product level control chamber and a liquid ring pump supply feed .

Still referring to a fluid distribution manifold is capable of eliminating most plumbing in a fluid purification system advantageously incorporating various functionality in one unit including flow regulation mist removal and pressure regulation thereby simplifying manufacture and significantly reducing overall component parts. The core plates and manifolds may be made of for example plastic metal or ceramic plates or any other non corrosive material capable of withstanding high temperature and pressure. Methods of manufacture for the core plates and manifolds include brazing and over molding.

Referring now to these figures illustrate a fitting assembly that allows fluid interfacing throughout the system in a particular embodiment. For example there may be a floating fluid interface between the exchanger shown on and the intake exhaust ports and shown on . illustrates a connector that may be welded to the heat exchanger ports not shown wherein the connector connects to the fluid interface which is in turn in communication with the fluid distribution manifold. shows a sectional view across line A A see . The connector has the ability to float to compensate for shifts in registration possibly caused by temperature or manufacturing variations. Sealing is accomplished by the o ring . As can be seen in the view depicted in the o ring seal upon rotation of line A A 90 degree about a central axis the connector and the fluid interface lock together to make a fluid interface connection.

Referring now to these figures illustrate another embodiment of the evaporator condenser . As seen in evaporator condenser is a flat evaporator condenser and contains multiple parallel core layers and typically made of copper nickel alloy or other heat transferable material with rib sections creating channels and for directing steam and condensed fluid flow. Steam intake and product exit manifolds as well as dirty intake and volatile exit manifolds not shown may connect via a fluid interface to a liquid ring pump compressor. Bolts secure core evaporator condenser to brackets of external housing of the liquid ring pump compressor. In operation every alternating horizontal as shown in row and comprises evaporator channels and condenser channels such that the two functions never overlap on any given layer. a detail of shows more clearly how the combined evaporator condenser manifolds works. As indicated rows do not interact with rows they are closed off to each other thereby separating the functions of evaporation and condensation in the horizontal core layers.

Referring now to this figure illustrates alternate embodiment of the heat exchanger used in the water vapor distillation apparatus wherein such heat exchangers capitalize on available systemic and heat sources. In one particular embodiment heat from at least one of a plurality of sources passes through a multi line heat exchanger such as depicted in wherein a series of two channel heat exchangers such as and are plumbed to produce a multi line effect. Note that in the particular multi line heat exchanger embodiment shown in the flow of cold intake passes through all heat exchanger units and one heat source for example hot product flows through heat exchanger units and and another heat source for example hot blowdown stream flows through heat exchange units and . In this way multiple heat sources may be used to exchange with the cold intake flow .

Now referring to this figure illustrates an alternate embodiment of the heat exchanger. In this embodiment the heat exchanger may be a single multi channel heat exchanger . In this particular embodiment cold intake and heat sources such as hot product and hot blowdown stream for example flow through exchanger simultaneously but in opposite directions thereby enabling heat exchange with cold intake from both heat sources and within a single heat exchanger .

Referring now to one alternate embodiment may include measuring the evaporator and condenser pressures to assess overall system performance and or provide data to a control system. To avoid the use of expensive sensors that would be required to withstand the elevated temperatures of evaporator condenser pressure sensors Pand Pare mounted on fluid lines between the cold side of heat exchanger and corresponding control valves Vand V. To avoid measuring a pressure less than the actual pressure of the system which would occur when fluid is flowing for pressure sensors located at this position the control valve would be closed momentarily to stop flow. During the no flow period pressure will be constant from the control valve back to the evaporator or condenser enabling accurate measurement of the system pressure. No adverse effects on still performance will occur from these short no flow periods.

Referring now to this figure illustrates another embodiment of the present disclosure including a filtering mechanism within intake to increase the purity of the final product fluid. A multi unit flip filter having a pivot joint joining at least two filter units and is situated within a filter housing which directs fluid through filter units and and facilitates rotation of filter units and about central pivot joint . As shown blowdown stream passes through flip filter unit while intake fluid stream simultaneously flows from intake through flip filter unit en route to purification. After some interval a flip filter switch not shown rotates flip filter around its central axis shown by the dotted line at flip filter pivot joint such that filter unit now fouled with contaminates filtered from dirty intake fluid is backwashed by blowdown stream and filter unit becomes the filter unit which filters intake fluid stream . In such an embodiment o ring gaskets and may be utilized as seals between filter units and and the fluid flow routes of blowdown stream and intake fluid stream respectively.

Referring now to the multi unit flip filter may be a multi sected circular filter . Multi unit flip filter having a pivot point about which multiple flip filter units such as and pivot may also be situated within filter housing that directs fluid flow through individual filter units and and facilitates rotation of filter about pivot point . As shown blowdown stream passing through one flip filter unit while intake fluid stream simultaneously flows from intake through flip filter unit en route to purification. As in a flip filter switch not shown rotates flip filter around its central axis shown by the dotted line at flip filter pivot point such that filter unit now fouled with contaminates filtered from dirty intake fluid is backwashed by blowdown stream and filter unit becomes the filter unit which filters intake fluid stream . A series of seals as indicated by and are utilized between individual filter units and to partition blowdown stream flowing through one filter section from intake fluid stream flowing through another filter section.

Now referring to other embodiments may include a manual valve to change the direction of water flow. Such a valve allows use of for example blowdown stream to continuously clean one unit of each flip filter and with a single operation effectively switches which unit is being filtered and which unit is being back washed thereby back washing filter units or without the need to actually flip filter itself. In one particular embodiment when valve is in position A filter unit is filtering intake fluid and filter unit is being back washed with blowdown stream . Upon switching valve to position B filter unit is now being backwashed by blowdown stream and filter unit is now filtering input fluid .

The various embodiments of the water vapor distillation apparatus described above may in some embodiment may be powered by a Stirling cycle machine also may be referred to as a Stirling engine . In the exemplary embodiment the Stirling cycle machine is a Stirling engine described in pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 12 105 854 filed on Apr. 18 2008 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. However in other embodiments the Stirling cycle machine may be any of the Stirling cycle machines described in the following references all of which are incorporated by reference in their entirely U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 381 958 6 247 310 6 536 207 6 705 081 7 111 460 and 6 694 731.

Stirling cycle machines including engines and refrigerators have a long technological heritage described in detail in Walker Stirling Engines Oxford University Press 1980 incorporated herein by reference. The principle underlying the Stirling cycle engine is the mechanical realization of the Stirling thermodynamic cycle isovolumetric heating of a gas within a cylinder isothermal expansion of the gas during which work is performed by driving a piston isovolumetric cooling and isothermal compression. Additional background regarding aspects of Stirling cycle machines and improvements thereto is discussed in Hargreaves The Phillips Stirling Engine Elsevier Amsterdam 1991 which is herein incorporated by reference.

The principle of operation of a Stirling cycle machine is readily described with reference to wherein identical numerals are used to identify the same or similar parts. Many mechanical layouts of Stirling cycle machines are known in the art and the particular Stirling cycle machine designated generally by numeral is shown merely for illustrative purposes. In piston and a displacer move in phased reciprocating motion within the cylinders which in some embodiments of the Stirling cycle machine may be a single cylinder but in other embodiments may include greater than a single cylinder. A working fluid contained within cylinders is constrained by seals from escaping around piston and displacer . The working fluid is chosen for its thermodynamic properties as discussed in the description below and is typically helium at a pressure of several atmospheres however any gas including any inert gas may be used including but not limited to hydrogen argon neon nitrogen air and any mixtures thereof. The position of the displacer governs whether the working fluid is in contact with the hot interface or the cold interface corresponding respectively to the interfaces at which heat is supplied to and extracted from the working fluid. The supply and extraction of heat is discussed in further detail below. The volume of working fluid governed by the position of the piston is referred to as the compression space .

During the first phase of the Stirling cycle the starting condition of which is depicted in the piston compresses the fluid in the compression space . The compression occurs at a substantially constant temperature because heat is extracted from the fluid to the ambient environment. The condition of the Stirling cycle machine after compression is depicted in . During the second phase of the cycle the displacer moves in the direction of the cold interface with the working fluid displaced from the region of the cold interface to the region of the hot interface . This phase may be referred to as the transfer phase. At the end of the transfer phase the fluid is at a higher pressure since the working fluid has been heated at constant volume. The increased pressure is depicted symbolically in by the reading of the pressure gauge .

During the third phase the expansion stroke of the Stirling cycle machine the volume of the compression space increases as heat is drawn in from outside the Stirling cycle machine thereby converting heat to work. In practice heat is provided to the fluid by means of a heater head not shown which is discussed in greater detail in the description below. At the end of the expansion phase the compression space is full of cold fluid as depicted in . During the fourth phase of the Stirling cycle machine fluid is transferred from the region of the hot interface to the region of the cold interface by motion of the displacer in the opposing sense. At the end of this second transfer phase the fluid fills the compression space and cold interface as depicted in and is ready for a repetition of the compression phase. The Stirling cycle is depicted in a P V pressure volume diagram as shown in .

Additionally on passing from the region of the hot interface to the region of the cold interface . In some embodiments the fluid may pass through a regenerator shown as in . A regenerator is a matrix of material having a large ratio of surface area to volume which serves to absorb heat from the fluid when it enters from the region of the hot interface and to heat the fluid when it passes from the region of the cold interface .

Stirling cycle machines have not generally been used in practical applications due to several daunting challenges to their development. These involve practical considerations such as efficiency and lifetime. Accordingly there is a need for more Stirling cycle machines with minimal side loads on pistons increased efficiency and lifetime.

The principle of operation of a Stirling cycle machine or Stirling engine is further discussed in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6 381 958 issued May 7 2002 to Kamen et al. which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Referring now to embodiments of a Stirling cycle machine according to one embodiment are shown in cross section. The engine embodiment is designated generally by numeral . While the Stirling cycle machine will be described generally with reference to the Stirling engine embodiments shown in it is to be understood that many types of machines and engines including but not limited to refrigerators and compressors may similarly benefit from various embodiments and improvements which are described herein including but not limited to external combustion engines and internal combustion engines.

In some embodiments the rocking beam and a first portion of the coupling assembly may be located in a crankcase while the cylinders pistons and a second portion of the coupling assembly is located in a workspace.

In a crankcase most of the rocking beam drive is positioned below the cylinder housing . Crankcase is a space to permit operation of rocking beam drive having a crankshaft rocking beam linear bearings a connecting rod and coupling assemblies and . Crankcase intersects cylinders and transverse to the plane of the axes of pistons and . Pistons and reciprocate in respective cylinders and as also shown in . Cylinders and extend above crankshaft housing . Crankshaft is mounted in crankcase below cylinders and .

In the exemplary embodiment the link rods may be made from aluminum and the piston rods and connecting rod are made from D2 Tool Steel. Alternatively the link rods piston rods connecting rods and rocking beam may be made from 4340 steel. Other materials may be used for the components of the rocking beam drive including but not limited to titanium aluminum steel or cast iron. In some embodiments the fatigue strength of the material being used is above the actual load experienced by the components during operation.

Still referring to piston operates vertically in the cylinder and is connected by the coupling assembly to the end pivot of the rocking beam . The cylinder serves amongst other functions to provide guidance for longitudinal motion of piston . The piston rod of the coupling assembly is attached to the lower portion of piston and is driven axially by its link rod in a substantially linear reciprocating path along the axis of the cylinder . The distal end of the piston rod and the proximate end of the link rod in some embodiments is jointly hinged via a coupling means . The coupling means in various embodiments may include but are not limited to a flexure shown as in roller bearing element hinge journal bearing shown as in or coupling means as known in the art. The distal end of the link rod in some embodiments may be coupled to one end pivot of rocking beam which is positioned vertically and perpendicularly under the proximate end of link rod . A stationary linear bearing may be positioned along coupling assembly to further ensure linear longitudinal motion of the piston rod and thus ensuring linear longitudinal motion of the piston . In an exemplary embodiment link rod does not pass through linear bearing to ensure that piston rod retains a substantially linear and longitudinal motion.

The coupling assemblies and change the alternating longitudinal motion of respective pistons and to oscillatory motion of the rocking beam . The delivered oscillatory motion is changed to the rotational motion of the crankshaft by the connecting rod wherein one end of the connecting rod is rotatably coupled to a connecting pivot positioned between an end pivot and a rocker pivot in the rocking beam and another end of the connecting rod is rotatably coupled to crankpin . The rocker pivot may be positioned substantially at the midpoint between the end pivots and and oscillatorily support the rocking beam as a fulcrum thus guiding the respective piston rods and to make sufficient linear motion. In the exemplary embodiment the crankshaft is located above the rocking beam but in other embodiments the crankshaft may be positioned below the rocking beam as shown in or in some embodiments the crankshaft is positioned to the side of the rocking beam such that it still has a parallel axis to the rocking beam .

Still referring to the rocking beam oscillates about the rocker pivot the end pivots and follow an arc path. Since the distal ends of the link rods and are connected to the rocking beam at pivots and the distal ends of the link rods and also follow this arc path resulting in an angular deviation and from the longitudinal axis of motion of their respective pistons and . The coupling means and are configured such that any angular deviation and from the link rods and experienced by the piston rods and is minimized. Essentially the angular deviation and is absorbed by the coupling means and so that the piston rods and maintain substantially linear longitudinal motion to reduce side loads on the pistons and . A stationary linear bearing may also be placed inside the cylinder or or along coupling assemblies or to further absorb any angular deviation or thus keeping the piston push rod or and the piston or in linear motion along the longitudinal axis of the piston or .

Therefore in view of reciprocating motion of pistons and it is necessary to keep the motion of pistons and as close to linear as possible because the deviation and from longitudinal axis of reciprocating motion of pistons and causes noise reduction of efficiency increase of friction to the wall of cylinder increase of side load and low durability of the parts. The alignment of the cylinders and and the arrangement of crankshaft piston rods and link rods and and connecting rod hence may influence on amongst other things the efficiency and or the volume of the device. For the purpose of increasing the linearity of the piston motion as mentioned the pistons shown as and in are preferably as close to the side of the respective cylinders and as possible.

In another embodiment reducing angular deviation of link rods link rods and substantially linearly reciprocate along longitudinal axis of motion of respective pistons and to decrease the angular deviation and thus to decrease the side load applied to each piston and . The angular deviation defines the deviation of the link rod or from the longitudinal axis of the piston or . Numerals and designate the angular deviation of the link rods and as shown in . Therefore the position of coupling assembly influences the angular displacement of the link rod based on the length of the distance between the end pivot and the rocker pivot of the rocking beam . Thus the position of the coupling assemblies may be such that the angular displacement of the link rod is reduced. For the link rod the length of the coupling assembly also may be determined and placed to reduce the angular displacement of the link rod based on the length of the distance between the end pivot and the rocker pivot of the rocking beam . Therefore the length of the link rods and the length of coupling assemblies and and the length of the rocking beam are significant parameters that greatly influence and or determine the angular deviation of the link rods and as shown in .

The exemplary embodiment has a straight rocking beam having the end points and the rocker pivot and the connecting pivot along the same axis. However in other embodiments the rocking beam may be bent such that pistons may be placed at angles to each other as shown in .

Referring now to and in some embodiments of the coupling assembly the coupling assemblies and may include a flexible link rod that is axially stiff but flexible in the rocking beam plane of motion between link rods and and pistons and respectively. In this embodiment at least one portion the flexure shown as in of link rods and is elastic. The flexure acts as a coupling means between the piston rod and the link rod. The flexure may absorb the crank induced side loads of the pistons more effectively thus allowing its respective piston to maintain linear longitudinal movement inside the piston s cylinder. This flexure allows small rotations in the plane of the rocking beam between the link rods and and pistons or respectively. Although depicted in this embodiment as flat which increases the elasticity of the link rods and the flexure in some embodiments is not flat. The flexure also may be constructed near to the lower portion of the pistons or near to the distal end of the link rods and . The flexure in one embodiment may be made of D2 Tool Steel Hardened to 58 62 RC. In some embodiments there may be more than one flexure not shown on the link rod or to increase the elasticity of the link rods.

In alternate embodiment the axes of the pistons in each cylinder housing may extend in different directions as depicted in . In the exemplary embodiment the axes of the pistons in each cylinder housing are substantially parallel and preferably substantially vertical as depicted in and . include various embodiments of the rocking beam drive mechanism including like numbers as those shown and described with respect to . It will be understood by those skilled in that art that changing the relative position of the connecting pivot along the rocking beam will change the stroke of the pistons.

Accordingly a change in the parameters of the relative position of the connecting pivot in the rocking beam and the length of the piston rods and link rods and rocking beam and the position of rocker pivot will change the angular deviation of the link rods and the phasing of the pistons and and the size of the device in a variety of manner. Therefore in various embodiments a wide range of piston phase angles and variable sizes of the engine may be chosen based on the modification of one or more of these parameters. In practice the link rods and of the exemplary embodiment have substantially lateral movement within from 0.5 degree to 0.5 degree from the longitudinal axis of the pistons and . In various other embodiments depending on the length of the link rod the angle may vary anywhere from approaching 0 degrees to 0.75 degrees. However in other embodiments the angle may be higher including anywhere from approaching 0 to the approximately 20 degrees. As the link rod length increases however the crankcase overall engine height increases as well as the weight of the engine.

One feature of the exemplary embodiment is that each piston has its link rod extending substantially to the attached piston rod so that it is formed as a coupling assembly. In one embodiment the coupling assembly for the piston includes a piston rod a link rod and a coupling means as shown in . More specifically one proximal end of piston rod is attached to the lower portion of piston and the distal end piston rod is connected to the proximate end of the link rod by the coupling means . The distal end of the link rod extends vertically to the end pivot of the rocking beam . As described above the coupling means may be but is not limited to a joint hinge coupling or flexure or other means known in the art. In this embodiment the ratio of the piston rod and the link rod may determine the angular deviation of the link rod as mentioned above.

In one embodiment of the machine an engine such as a Stirling engine employs more than one rocking beam drive on a crankshaft. Referring now to an unwrapped four cylinder rocking beam drive mechanism is shown. In this embodiment the rocking beam drive mechanism has four pistons and coupled to two rocking beam drives and . In the exemplary embodiment rocking beam drive mechanism is used in a Stirling engine comprising at least four pistons and positioned in a quadrilateral arrangement coupled to a pair of rocking beam drives and wherein each rocking beam drive is connected to crankshaft . However in other embodiments the Stirling cycle engine includes anywhere from 1 4 pistons and in still other embodiments the Stirling cycle engine includes more than 4 pistons. In some embodiments rocking beam drives and are substantially similar to the rocking beam drives described above with respect to shown as and in . Although in this embodiment the pistons are shown outside the cylinders in practice the pistons would be inside cylinders.

Still referring to in some embodiments the rocking beam drive mechanism has a single crankshaft having a pair of longitudinally spaced radially and oppositely directed crank pins and adapted for being journalled in a housing and a pair of rocking beam drives and . Each rocking beam and is pivotally connected to rocker pivots and respectively and to crankpins and respectively. In the exemplary embodiment rocking beams and are coupled to a rocking beam shaft .

In some embodiments a motor generator may be connected to the crankshaft in a working relationship. The motor may be located in one embodiment between the rocking beam drives. In another embodiment the motor may be positioned outboard. The term motor generator is used to mean either a motor or a generator.

When motor generator is positioned between the rocking beam drives not shown shown in as and the length of motor generator is limited to the distance between the rocking beam drives. The diameter squared of motor generator is limited by the distance between the crankshaft and the rocking beam shaft . Because the capacity of motor generator is proportional to its diameter squared and length these dimension limitations result in a limited capacity pancake motor generator having relatively short length and a relatively large diameter squared. The use of a pancake motor generator may reduce the overall dimension of the engine however the dimension limitations imposed by the inboard configuration result in a motor generator having limited capacity.

Placing motor generator between the rocking beam drives exposes motor generator to heat generated by the mechanical friction of the rocking beam drives. The inboard location of motor generator makes it more difficult to cool motor generator thereby increasing the effects of heat produced by motor generator as well as heat absorbed by motor generator from the rocking beam drives. This may lead to overheating and ultimately failure of motor generator .

Referring to both the inboard positioning of motor generator may also lead to an unequilateral configuration of pistons and since pistons and are coupled to rocking beam drives and respectively and any increase in distance would also result in an increase in distance between pistons and pistons and . An unequilateral arrangement of pistons may lead to inefficiencies in burner and heater head thermodynamic operation which in turn may lead to a decrease in overall engine efficiency. Additionally an unequilateral arrangement of pistons may lead to larger heater head and combustion chamber dimensions.

The exemplary embodiment of the motor generator arrangement is shown in . As shown in the motor generator is positioned outboard from rocking beam drives and shown as and in and at an end of crankshaft . The outboard position allows for a motor generator with a larger length and diameter squared than the pancake motor generator described above shown as in . As previously stated the capacity of motor generator is proportional to its length and diameter squared and since outboard motor generator may have a larger length and diameter squared the outboard motor generator configuration shown in may allow for the use of a higher capacity motor generator in conjunction with engine.

By placing motor generator outboard of drives and as shown in the embodiment in motor generator is not exposed to heat generated by the mechanical friction of drives and . Also the outboard position of motor generator makes it easier to cool the motor generator thereby allowing for more mechanical engine cycles per a given amount of time which in turn allows for higher overall engine performance.

Also as motor generator is positioned outside and not positioned between drives and rocking beam drives and may be placed closer together thereby allowing the pistons which are coupled to drives and to be placed in an equilateral arrangement. In some embodiments depending on the burner type used particularly in the case of a single burner embodiment equilateral arrangement of pistons allows for higher efficiencies in burner and heater head thermodynamic operation which in turn allows higher overall engine performance. Equilateral arrangement of pistons also advantageously allows for smaller heater head and combustion chamber dimensions.

Referring again to crankshaft may have concentric ends and which in one embodiment are crank journals and in various other embodiments may be but are not limited to bearings. Each concentric end has a crankpin respectively that may be offset from a crankshaft center axis. At least one counterweight may be placed at either end of crankshaft shown as in to counterbalance any instability the crankshaft may experience. This crankshaft configuration in combination with the rocking beam drive described above allows the pistons shown as and in to do work with one rotation of the crankshaft . This characteristic will be further explained below. In other embodiments a flywheel not shown may be placed on crankshaft shown as in to decrease fluctuations of angular velocity for a more constant speed.

Still referring to in some embodiments a cooler not shown may be also be positioned along the crankshaft shown as in and rocking beam drives and shown as and in to cool the crankshaft and rocking beam drives and . In some embodiments the cooler may be used to cool the working gas in a cold chamber of a cylinder and may also be configured to cool the rocking beam drive. Various embodiments of the cooler are discussed in detail below.

Still referring to in one embodiment the motor generator coupling assembly is a spline assembly that includes spline shaft sleeve rotor of motor generator and crankshaft . Spline shaft couples one end of crankshaft to sleeve rotor . Sleeve rotor is attached to motor generator by mechanical means such as press fitting welding threading or the like. In one embodiment spline shaft includes a plurality of splines on both ends of the shaft. In other embodiments spline shaft includes a middle splineless portion which has a diameter smaller than the outer diameter or inner diameter of splined portions and . In still other embodiments one end portion of the spline shaft has splines that extend for a longer distance along the shaft than a second end portion that also includes splines thereon.

In some embodiments sleeve rotor includes an opening that extends along a longitudinal axis of sleeve rotor . The opening is capable of receiving spline shaft . In some embodiments opening includes a plurality of inner splines capable of engaging the splines on one end of spline shaft . The outer diameter of inner splines may be larger than the outer diameter of the splines on spline shaft such that the fit between inner splines and the splines on spline shaft is loose as shown in . A loose fit between inner splines and the splines on spline shaft contributes to maintain spline engagement between spline shaft and rotor sleeve during deflection of spline shaft which may be caused by crankcase pressurization. In other embodiments longer splined portion of spline shaft may engage inner splines of rotor .

Still referring to in some embodiments crankshaft has an opening on an end thereof which is capable of receiving one end of spline shaft . Opening preferably includes a plurality of inner splines that engage the splines on spline shaft . The outer diameter of inner splines may be larger than the outer diameter of the splines on spline shaft such that the fit between inner splines and the splines on spline shaft is loose as shown in . As previously discussed a loose fit between inner splines and the splines on spline shaft contributes to maintain spline engagement between spline shaft and crankshaft during deflection of spline shaft which may be caused by crankcase pressurization. The loose fit between the inner splines and on the crankshaft and the sleeve rotor and the splines on the spline shaft may contribute to maintain deflection of spline shaft . This may allow misalignments between crankshaft and sleeve rotor . In some embodiments shorter splined portion of spline shaft may engage opening of crankshaft thus preventing these potential misalignments.

In some embodiments opening of sleeve rotor includes a plurality of inner splines that extend the length of opening . This arrangement contributes to spline shaft being properly inserted into opening during assembly. This contributes to proper alignment between the splines on spline shaft and the inner splines on sleeve rotor being maintained.

Referring now to one embodiment of the engine is shown. Here the pistons and of engine operate between a hot chamber and a cold chamber of cylinders and respectively. Between the two chambers there may be a regenerator . The regenerator may have variable density variable area and in some embodiments is made of wire. The varying density and area of the regenerator may be adjusted such that the working gas has substantially uniform flow across the regenerator . Various embodiments of the regenerator are discussed in detail below and in U.S. Pat. No. 6 591 609 issued Jul. 17 2003 to Kamen et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 862 883 issued Mar. 8 2005 to Kamen et al. which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. When the working gas passes through the hot chamber a heater head may heat the gas causing the gas to expand and push pistons and towards the cold chamber where the gas compresses. As the gas compresses in the cold chamber pistons and may be guided back to the hot chamber to undergo the Stirling cycle again. The heater head may be a pin head a fin head a folded fin head heater tubes as shown in or any other heater head embodiment known including but not limited to those described below. Various embodiments of heater head are discussed in detail below and in U.S. Pat. No. 6 381 958 issued May 7 2002 to Kamen et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 543 215 issued Apr. 8 2003 to Langenfeld et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 966 182 issued Nov. 22 2005 to Kamen et al and U.S. Pat. No. 7 308 787 issued Dec. 18 2007 to LaRocque et al. which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.

In some embodiments a cooler may be positioned alongside cylinders and to further cool the gas passing through to the cold chamber . Various embodiments of cooler are discussed in detail in the proceeding sections and in U.S. Pat. No. 7 325 399 issued Feb. 5 2008 to Strimling et al which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In some embodiments at least one piston seal may be positioned on pistons and to seal the hot section off from the cold section . Additionally at least one piston guide ring may be positioned on pistons and to help guide the pistons motion in their respective cylinders. Various embodiments of piston seal and guide ring are described in detail below and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 175 502 filed Jun. 19 2002 published Feb. 6 2003 now abandoned which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In some embodiments at least one piston rod seal may be placed against piston rods and to prevent working gas from escaping into the crankcase or alternatively into airlock space . The piston rod seal may be an elastomer seal or a spring loaded seal. Various embodiments of the piston rod seal are discussed in detail below.

In some embodiments the airlock space may be eliminated for example in the rolling diaphragm and or bellows embodiments described in more detail below. In those cases the piston rod seals and seal the working space from the crankcase.

In some embodiments at least one rolling diaphragm bellows may be located along piston rods and to prevent airlock gas from escaping into the crankcase . Various embodiments of rolling diaphragm are discussed in more detail below.

Although shows a cross section of engine depicting only two pistons and one rocking beam drive it is to be understood that the principles of operation described herein may apply to a four cylinder double rocking beam drive engine as designated generally by numeral in .

Referring now to the operation of pistons and during one revolution of crankshaft is shown. With a revolution of crankshaft piston is at the top of its cylinder otherwise known as top dead center piston is in upward midstroke piston is at the bottom of its cylinder otherwise known as bottom dead center and piston is in downward midstroke. With a revolution of crankshaft piston is in downward midstroke piston is at top dead center piston is in upward midstroke and piston is at bottom dead center. With revolution of crankshaft piston is at bottom dead center piston is in downward midstroke piston is at top dead center and piston is in upward midstroke. Finally with a full revolution of crankshaft piston is in upward midstroke piston is at bottom dead center piston is in downward midstroke and piston is at top dead center. During each revolution there is a 90 degree phase difference between pistons and a 180 degree phase difference between pistons and and a 270 degree phase difference between pistons and . illustrates the relationship of the pistons being approximately 90 degrees out of phase with the preceding and succeeding piston. Additionally shows the exemplary embodiment machine means of transferring work. Thus work is transferred from piston to piston to piston to piston so that with a full revolution of crankshaft all pistons have exerted work by moving from the top to the bottom of their respective cylinders.

Referring now to together with illustrate the 90 degree phase difference between the pistons in the exemplary embodiment. Referring now to although the cylinders are shown in a linear path this is for illustration purposes only. In the exemplary embodiment of a four cylinder Stirling cycle machine the flow path of the working gas contained within the cylinder working space follows a figure eight pattern. Thus the working spaces of cylinders and are connected in a figure eight pattern for example from cylinder to cylinder to cylinder to cylinder the fluid flow pattern follows a figure eight. Still referring to an unwrapped view of cylinders and taken along the line B B shown in is illustrated. The 90 degree phase difference between pistons as described above allows for the working gas in the warm section of cylinder to be delivered to the cold section of cylinder . As piston and are 90 degrees out of phase the working gas in the warm section of cylinder is delivered to the cold section of cylinder . As piston and piston are also 90 degrees out of phase the working gas in the warm section of cylinder is delivered to the cold section of cylinder . And as piston and piston are also 90 degrees out of phase so the working gas in the warm section of cylinder is delivered to the cold section of cylinder . Once the working gas of a warm section of a first cylinder enters the cold section of a second cylinder the working gas begins to compress and the piston within the second cylinder in its down stroke thereafter forces the compressed working gas back through a regenerator and heater head shown in and back into the warm section of the first cylinder. Once inside the warm section of the first cylinder the gas expands and drives the piston within that cylinder downward thus causing the working gas within the cold section of that first cylinder to be driven through the preceding regenerator and heater head and into the cylinder. This cyclic transmigration characteristic of working gas between cylinders and is possible because pistons and are connected via drives and to a common crankshaft shown in in such a way that the cyclical movement of each piston is approximately 90 degrees in advance of the movement of the proceeding piston as depicted in .

In some embodiments of the Stirling cycle machine lubricating fluid is used. To prevent the lubricating fluid from escaping the crankcase a seal is used.

Referring now to some embodiments of the Stirling cycle machine include a fluid lubricated rocking beam drive that utilizes a rolling diaphragm positioned along the piston rod to prevent lubricating fluid from escaping the crankcase not shown but the components that are housed in the crankcase are represented as and entering areas of the engine that may be damaged by the lubricating fluid. It is beneficial to contain the lubricating fluid for if lubricating fluid enters the working space not shown but the components that are housed in the working space are represented as it would contaminate the working fluid come into contact with the regenerator and may clog the regenerator . The rolling diaphragm may be made of an elastomer material such as rubber or rubber reinforced with woven fabric or non woven fabric to provide rigidity. The rolling diaphragm may alternatively be made of other materials such as fluorosilicone or nitrile with woven fabric or non woven fabric. The rolling diaphragm may also be made of carbon nanotubes or chopped fabric which is non woven fabric with fibers of polyester or KEVLAR for example dispersed in an elastomer. In the some embodiments the rolling diaphragm is supported by the top seal piston and the bottom seal piston . In other embodiments the rolling diaphragm as shown in is supported via notches in the top seal piston .

In some embodiments a pressure differential is placed across the rolling diaphragm such that the pressure above the seal is different from the pressure in the crankcase . This pressure differential inflates seal and allows seal to act as a dynamic seal as the pressure differential ensures that rolling diaphragm maintains its form throughout operation. and illustrate how the pressure differential effects the rolling diaphragm. The pressure differential causes the rolling diaphragm to conform to the shape of the bottom seal piston as it moves with the piston rod and prevents separation of the seal from a surface of the piston during operation. Such separation may cause seal failure. The pressure differential causes the rolling diaphragm to maintain constant contact with the bottom seal piston as it moves with the piston rod . This occurs because one side of the seal will always have pressure exerted on it thereby inflating the seal to conform to the surface of the bottom seal piston . In some embodiments the top seal piston rolls over the corners of the rolling diaphragm that are in contact with the bottom seal piston so as to further maintain the seal in contact with the bottom seal piston . In the exemplary embodiment the pressure differential is in the range of 10 to 15 PSI. The smaller pressure in the pressure differential is preferably in crankcase so that the rolling diaphragm may be inflated into the crankcase . However in other embodiments the pressure differential may have a greater or smaller range of value.

The pressure differential may be created by various methods including but not limited to the use of the following a pressurized lubrication system a pneumatic pump sensors an electric pump by oscillating the rocking beam to create a pressure rise in the crankcase by creating an electrostatic charge on the rolling diaphragm or other similar methods. In some embodiments the pressure differential is created by pressurizing the crankcase to a pressure that is below the mean pressure of the working space . In some embodiments the crankcase is pressurized to a pressure in the range of 10 to 15 PSI below the mean pressure of the working space however in various other embodiments the pressure differential may be smaller or greater. Further detail regarding the rolling diaphragm is included below.

Referring now to however another embodiment of the Stirling machine is shown wherein airlock space is located between working space and crankcase . Airlock space maintains a constant volume and pressure necessary to create the pressure differential necessary for the function of rolling diaphragm as described above. In one embodiment airlock is not absolutely sealed off from working space so the pressure of airlock is equal to the mean pressure of working space . Thus in some embodiments the lack of an effective seal between the working space and the crankcase contributes to the need for an airlock space. Thus the airlock space in some embodiments may be eliminated by a more efficient and effective seal.

During operation the working space mean pressure may vary so as to cause airlock mean pressure to vary as well. One reason the pressure may tend to vary is that during operation the working space may get hotter which in turn may increase the pressure in the working space and consequently in the airlock as well since the airlock and working space are in fluid communication. In such a case the pressure differential between airlock and crankcase will also vary thereby causing unnecessary stresses in rolling diaphragms that may lead to seal failure. Therefore some embodiments of the machine the mean pressure within airlock is regulated so as to maintain a constant desired pressure differential between airlock and crankcase and ensuring that rolling diaphragms stay inflated and maintains their form. In some embodiments a pressure transducer is used to monitor and manage the pressure differential between the airlock and the crankcase and regulate the pressure accordingly so as to maintain a constant pressure differential between the airlock and the crankcase. Various embodiments of the pressure regulator that may be used are described in further detail below and in U.S. Pat. No. 7 310 945 issued Dec. 25 2007 to Gurski et al. which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

A constant pressure differential between the airlock and crankcase may be achieved by adding or removing working fluid from airlock via a pump or a release valve. Alternatively a constant pressure differential between airlock and crankcase may be achieved by adding or removing working fluid from crankcase via a pump or a release valve. The pump and release valve may be controlled by the pressure regulator. Working fluid may be added to airlock or crankcase from a separate source such as a working fluid container or may be transferred over from crankcase . Should working fluid be transferred from crankcase to airlock it may be desirable to filter the working fluid before passing it into airlock so as to prevent any lubricant from passing from crankcase into airlock and ultimately into working space as this may result in engine failure.

In some embodiments of the machine crankcase may be charged with a fluid having different thermal properties than the working fluid. For example where the working gas is helium or hydrogen the crankcase may be charged with argon. Thus the crankcase is pressurized. In some embodiments helium is used but in other embodiments any inert gas as described herein may be used. Thus the crankcase is a wet pressurized crankcase in the exemplary embodiment. In other embodiments where a lubricating fluid is not used the crankcase is not wet.

In the exemplary embodiments rolling diaphragms do not allow gas or liquid to pass through them which allows working space to remain dry and crankcase to be wet sumped with a lubricating fluid. Allowing a wet sump crankcase increases the efficiency and life of the engine as there is less friction in rocking beam drives . In some embodiments the use of roller bearings or ball bearings in drives may also be eliminated with the use of lubricating fluid and rolling diaphragms . This may further reduce engine noise and increase engine life and efficiency.

Although depict various embodiments of the rolling diaphragm it is to be understood that rolling diaphragms may be held in place by any other mechanical means known in the art.

Referring now to a cross section shows one embodiment of the rolling diaphragm embodiment. A metal bellows is positioned along a piston rod to seal off a crankcase shown as in from a working space or airlock shown as and in . Metal bellows may be attached to a top seal piston and a stationary mounting surface . Alternatively metal bellows may be attached to a bottom seal piston not shown and a top stationary mounting surface. In one embodiment the bottom stationary mounting surface may be a crankcase surface or an inner airlock or working space surface and the top stationary mounting surface may be an inner crankcase surface or an outer airlock or working space surface. Metal bellows may be attached by welding brazing or any mechanical means known in the art.

Additionally the metal bellows may alternatively be formed mechanically by means such as die forming hydroforming explosive hydroforming hydramolding or any other means known in the art.

The metal bellows may be made of any type of metal including but not limited to steel stainless steel stainless steel 374 AM 350 stainless steel Inconel Hastelloy Haynes titanium or any other high strength corrosion resistant material.

In one embodiment the metal bellows used are those available from Senior Aerospace Metal Bellows Division Sharon Mass. or American BOA Inc. Cumming Ga.

Various embodiments of the rolling diaphragm and or bellows which function to seal are described above. Further embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art based on the description above and the additional description below relating to the parameters of the rolling diaphragm and or bellows.

In some embodiments the pressure atop the rolling diaphragm or bellows in the airlock space or airlock area both terms are used interchangeably is the mean working gas pressure for the machine which in some embodiments is an engine while the pressure below the rolling diaphragm and or bellows in the crankcase area is ambient atmospheric pressure. In these embodiments the rolling diaphragm and or bellows is required to operate with as much as 3000 psi across it and in some embodiments up to 1500 psi or higher . In this case the rolling diaphragm and or bellows seal forms the working gas helium hydrogen or otherwise containment barrier for the machine engine in the exemplary embodiment . Also in these embodiments the need for a heavy pressure rated structural vessel to contain the bottom end of the engine is eliminated since it is now required to simply contain lubricating fluid oil is used as a lubricating fluid in the exemplary embodiment and air at ambient pressure like a conventional internal combustion IC engine.

The capability to use a rolling diaphragm and or bellows seal with such an extreme pressure across it depends on the interaction of several parameters. Referring now to an illustration of the actual load on the rolling diaphragm or bellows material is shown. As shown the load is a function of the pressure differential and the annular gap area for the installed rolling diaphragm or bellows seal.

Region represents the portions of the rolling diaphragm and or bellows that are in contact with the walls formed by the piston and cylinder. The load is essentially a tensile load in the axial direction due to the pressure differential across the rolling diaphragm and or bellows. This tensile load due to the pressure across the rolling diaphragm and or bellows can be expressed as 

Later we will show the relationship of radius of convolution R to Cylinder bore D and Piston Diameter d to be defined as 4

Still referring to Region represents the convolution. As the rolling diaphragm and or bellows material turns the corner in the convolution the hoop stress imposed on the rolling diaphragm and or bellows material may be calculated. For the section of the bellows forming the convolution the hoop component of stress can be closely approximated as 

The annular gap that the rolling diaphragm and or bellows rolls within is generally referred to as the convolution area. The rolling diaphragm and or bellows fatigue life is generally limited by the combined stress from both the tensile and hoop load due to pressure differential as well as the fatigue due to the bending as the fabric rolls through the convolution. The radius that the fabric takes on during this rolling is defined here as the radius of convolution Rc. 4

The bending stress Sb in the rolling diaphragm and or bellows material as it rolls through the radius of convolution Rc is a function of that radius as well as the thickness of the materials in bending. For a fiber reinforced material the stress in the fibers themselves during the prescribed deflection in the exemplary embodiments is reduced as the fiber diameter decreases. The lower resultant stress for the same level of bending allows for an increased fatigue life limit. As the fiber diameter is further reduced flexibility to decrease the radius of convolution Rc is achieved while keeping the bending stress in the fiber under its endurance limit. At the same time as Rc decreases the tensile load on the fabric is reduced since there is less unsupported area in the annulus between the piston and cylinder. The smaller the fiber diameter the smaller the minimum Rc the smaller the annular area which results in a higher allowable pressure differential.

In some embodiments rolling diaphragm and or bellows designs for high cycle life are based on geometry where the bending stress imposed is kept about one order of magnitude less than the pressure based loading hoop and axial stresses . Based on the equation Sb E tb 2 R it is clear that minimizing tb in direct proportion to Rc should not increase the bending stress. The minimum thickness for the exemplary embodiments of the rolling diaphragm and or bellows material or membrane is directly related to the minimum fiber diameter that is used in the reinforcement of the elastomer. The smaller the fibers used the smaller resultant Rc for a given stress level.

Another limiting component of load on the rolling diaphragm and or bellows is the hoop stress in the convolution which is theoretically the same in magnitude as the axial load while supported by the piston or cylinder . The governing equation for that load is as follows 

Thus if Rc is decreased in direct proportion to tb then there is no increase of stress on the membrane in this region. However if this ratio is reduced in a manner that decreases Rc to a greater ratio than tb then parameters must be balanced. Thus decreasing tb with respect to Rc requires the rolling diaphragm and or bellows to carry a heavier stress due to pressure but makes for a reduced stress level due to bending. The pressure based load is essentially constant so this may be favorable since the bending load is cyclic therefore it is the bending load component that ultimately limits fatigue life.

For bending stress reduction tb ideally should be at a minimum and Rc ideally should be at a maximum. E ideally is also at a minimum. For hoop stress reduction Rc ideally is small and tb ideally is large.

Thus from E tb and Sut the minimum acceptable Rc may be calculated. Next using Rc Slcf and tb the maximum Pd may be calculates. Rc may be adjusted to shift the bias of load stress components between the steady state pressure stress and the cyclic bending stress. Thus the ideal rolling diaphragm and or bellows material is extremely thin extremely strong in tension and very limber in flexion.

Thus in some embodiments the rolling diaphragm and or bellows material sometimes referred to as a membrane is made from carbon fiber nanotubes. However additional small fiber materials may also be used including but not limited to nanotube fibers that have been braided nanotube untwisted yarn fibers or any other conventional materials including but not limited to KEVLAR glass polyester synthetic fibers and any other material or fiber having a desirable diameter and or other desired parameters as described in detail above.

Referring now to an embodiment of the machine is shown wherein an engine such as a Stirling cycle engine includes at least one piston rod seal a piston seal and a piston guide ring shown as in . Various embodiments of the piston seal and the piston guide ring are further discussed below and in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2003 0024387 A1 to Langenfeld et al. Feb. 6 2003 now abandoned which as mentioned before is incorporated by reference.

Referring now to some embodiments include a piston rod seal shown as in mounted in the piston rod cylinder wall which in some embodiments may include a seal ring which provides a seal against the contact surface of the piston rod shown as in . The contact surface in some embodiments is a hardened metal preferably 58 62 RC with a surface finish of 12 RMS or smoother. The contact surface may be metal which has been case hardened such as 58260 hardened steel which may be easily case hardened and may be ground and or honed to achieve a desired finish. The piston seal may also include a backing ring which is sprung to provide a radial or hoop force against the seal ring thereby providing sufficient contact hoop stress to ensure sealing around the entire inward surface of seal ring . The seal ring and the backing ring may together be referred to as a piston rod seal composite ring.

In some embodiments the seal ring and the backing ring may be positioned on a piston rod with the backing exerting an outward pressure on the seal ring and the seal ring may come into contact with a piston rod cylinder wall . These embodiments require a larger piston rod cylinder length than the previous embodiment. This is because the contact surface on the piston rod cylinder wall will be longer than in the previous embodiment where the contact surface lies on the piston rod itself. In yet another embodiment piston rod seals may be any functional seal known in the art including but not limited to an o ring a graphite clearance seal graphite piston in a glass cylinder or any air pot or a spring energized lip seal. In some embodiments anything having a close clearance may be used in other embodiments anything having interference for example a seal is used. In the exemplary embodiment a spring energized lip seal is used. Any spring energized lip seal may be used including those made by BAL SEAL Engineering Inc. Foothill Ranch Calif. In some embodiments the seal used is a BAL SEAL Part Number X558604.

The material of the seal rings and is chosen by considering a balance between the coefficient of friction of the seal rings and against the contact surfaces and respectively and the wear on the seal rings and it engenders. In applications in which piston lubrication is not possible such as at the high operating temperatures of a Stirling cycle engine the use of engineering plastic rings is used. The embodiments of the composition include a nylon matrix loaded with a lubricating and wear resistant material.

A tapering of the width of the backing ring is shown from the position denoted by numeral to the position denoted by numeral . Also shown in is a lap joint providing for circumferential closure of the seal ring . As some seals will wear significantly over their lifetime the backing ring should provide an even pressure depicted by numeral in of a range of movement. The tapered backing ring shown in may provide this advantage.

Referring now to a representative illustration of one embodiment of the engine for the machine is shown having a rocking beam drive and lubricating fluid . In some embodiments the lubricating fluid is oil. The lubricating fluid is used to lubricate engine parts in the crankcase such as hydrodynamic pressure fed lubricated bearings. Lubricating the moving parts of the engine serves to further reduce friction between engine parts and further increase engine efficiency and engine life. In some embodiments lubricating fluid may be placed at the bottom of the engine also known as an oil sump and distributed throughout the crankcase. The lubricating fluid may be distributed to the different parts of the engine by way of a lubricating fluid pump wherein the lubricating fluid pump may collect lubricating fluid from the sump via a filtered inlet. In the exemplary embodiment the lubricating fluid is oil and thus the lubricating fluid pump is herein referred to as an oil pump. However the term oil pump is used only to describe the exemplary embodiment and other embodiments where oil is used as a lubricating fluid and the term shall not be construed to limit the lubricating fluid or the lubricating fluid pump.

Referring now to one embodiment of the engine is shown wherein lubricating fluid is distributed to different parts of the engine that are located in the crankcase by a mechanical oil pump . The oil pump may include a drive gear and an idle gear . In some embodiments the mechanical oil pump may be driven by a pump drive assembly. The pump drive assembly may include a drive shaft coupled to a drive gear wherein the drive shaft includes an intermediate gear thereon. The intermediate gear is preferably driven by a crankshaft gear wherein the crankshaft gear is coupled to the primary crankshaft of the engine as shown in . In this configuration the crankshaft indirectly drives the mechanical oil pump via the crankshaft gear which drives the intermediate gear on the drive shaft which in turn drives the drive gear of the oil pump .

The crankshaft gear may be positioned between the crankpins and of crankshaft in some embodiments as shown in . In other embodiments the crankshaft gear may be placed at an end of the crankshaft as shown in .

For ease of manufacturing the crankshaft may be composed of a plurality of pieces. In these embodiments the crankshaft gear may be to be inserted between the crankshaft pieces during assembly of the crankshaft.

The drive shaft in some embodiments may be positioned perpendicularly to the crankshaft as shown in . However in some embodiments the drive shaft may be positioned parallel to the crankshaft as shown in .

In some embodiments the crankshaft gear and the intermediate gear may be sprockets wherein the crankshaft gear and the intermediate gear are coupled by a chain as shown in . In such an embodiments the chain is used to drive a chain drive pump shown as in .

In some embodiments the gear ratio between the crankshaft and the drive shaft remains constant throughout operation. In such an embodiment it is important to have an appropriate gear ratio between the crankshaft and the drive shaft such that the gear ratio balances the pump speed and the speed of the engine. This achieves a specified flow of lubricant required by a particular engine RPM revolutions per minute operating range.

In some embodiments lubricating fluid is distributed to different parts of an engine by an electric pump. The electric pump eliminates the need for a pump drive assembly which is otherwise required by a mechanical oil pump.

Referring back to the oil pump may include an inlet to collect lubricating fluid from the sump and an outlet to deliver lubricating fluid to the various parts of the engine. In some embodiments the rotation of the drive gear and the idle gear cause the lubricating fluid from the sump to be drawn into the oil pump through the inlet and forced out of the pump through the outlet . The inlet preferably includes a filter to remove particulates that may be found in the lubricating fluid prior to its being drawn into the oil pump. In some embodiments the inlet may be connected to the sump via a tube pipe or hose. In some embodiments the inlet may be in direct fluid communication with the sump.

In some embodiments the oil pump outlet is connected to a series of passageways in the various engine parts through which the lubricating fluid is delivered to the various engine parts. The outlet may be integrated with the passageways so as to be in direct communication with the passageways or may be connected to the passageways via a hose or tube or a plurality of hoses or tubes. The series of passageways are preferably an interconnected network of passageways so that the outlet may be connected to a single passageway inlet and still be able to deliver lubricating fluid to the engine s lubricated parts.

Thus the main feed delivers lubricating fluid to the journal bearings surfaces . From the journal bearing surfaces the lubricating fluid is delivered to the crankshaft main passage. The crankshaft main passage delivers lubricating fluid to both the spline shaft passageway and the connecting rod bearing on the crank pin .

Lubricating fluid is delivered back to the sump preferably by flowing out of the aforementioned bearings and into the sump. In the sump the lubricating fluid will be collected by the oil pump and redistributed throughout the engine.

As described above various embodiments of the system methods and apparatus may advantageously provide a low cost easily maintained highly efficient portable and failsafe system that can provide a reliable source of drinking water for use in all environments regardless of initial water quality. The system is intended to produce a continuous stream of potable water for drinking or medical applications for example on a personal or limited community scale using a portable power source and moderate power budget. As an example in some embodiment the water vapor distillation apparatus may be utilized to produce at least approximately 10 gallons of water per hour on a power budget of approximately 500 watts. This may be achieved through a very efficient heat transfer process and a number of sub system design optimizations.

The various embodiments of the water vapor distillation apparatus may be powered by a battery electricity source or by a generator as described herein. The battery may be a stand alone battery or could be connected to a motor transport apparatus such as a scooter any other motor vehicle which some cases may be a hybrid motor vehicle or a battery powered vehicle.

In one embodiment the system may be used in the developing world or in a remote village or remote living quarters. The system is especially advantageous in communities with any one or more of the following for example but not by limitation unsafe water of any kind at any time little to no water technical expertise for installation unreliable access to replacement supplies limited access to maintenance and difficult operating environment.

The system acts to purify any input source and transform the input source to high quality output i.e. cleaner water. In some applications the water vapor distillation apparatus may be in a community that does not have any municipal infrastructure to provide source water. Thus in these situations an embodiment of the water vapor distillation apparatus may be capable of accepting source water having varying qualities of purity.

The system is also easy to install and operate. The water vapor distillation apparatus is designed to be an autonomous system. This apparatus may operate independently without having to be monitored by operators. This is important because in many of the locations where the water vapor distillation apparatus may be installed and or utilized mechanics may be rare or unreliable.

The system has minimal maintenance requirement. In the exemplary embodiments the system does not require any consumables and or disposables thus the system itself may be utilized for a period of time absent replacing any elements or parts. This is important because in many applications the water vapor distillation apparatus may be located in a community that lacks people having technical expertise to maintain mechanical devices such as the water vapor distillation apparatus. The system is also inexpensive making it an option for any community.

In addition the water vapor distillation apparatus may be used in any community where clean drinking water is not readily or sufficiently available. For example communities that have both a utility to provide electricity to operate the water vapor distillation device and municipal water to supply the apparatus.

Thus the water vapor distillation apparatus may be used in communities that may have a utility grid for supply electricity but no clean drinking water. Conversely the community may have municipal water that is not safe and no utility grid to supply electricity. In these applications the water vapor distillation apparatus may be powered using devices including but not limited to a Stirling engine an internal combustion engine a generator batteries or solar panels. Sources of water may include but are not limited to local streams rivers lakes ponds or wells as well as the ocean.

In communities that have no infrastructure the challenge is to locate a water source and be able to supply power to operate the water vapor distillation apparatus. As previously discussed the water vapor distillation apparatus may be power using several types of devices.

In this type of situation one likely place to install a water vapor distillation apparatus may be in the community clinic or health centers. These places typically have some form of power source and are accessible to the most members of the community.

Again as described herein sources of electricity may include a Stirling engine. This type of engine is well suited for application in the water machine because the engine provides a sufficient amount of electrical power to operate the machine without significantly affecting the size of the machine.

The water vapor distillation apparatus may supply approximately between 50 and 250 people per day with water. In the exemplary embodiment the output is 30 liters per hour. This production rate is suitable for a small village or community s needs. The energy needs include approximately 900 Watts. Thus the energy requirements are minimal to power the water vapor distillation apparatus. This low power requirement is suitable to a small remote village or community. Also in some embodiments a standard outlet is suitable as the electrical source. The weight of the water vapor distillation apparatus is approximately 90 Kg in the exemplary embodiment and the size H D W 160 cm 50 cm 50 cm.

Knowledge of operating temperatures TDS and fluid flows provides information to allow production of potable water under a wide range of ambient temperatures pressures and dissolved solid content of the source water. One particular embodiment may utilize a control method whereby such measurements T P TDS flow rates etc are used in conjunction with a simple algorithm and look up table allowing an operator or computer controller to set operating parameters for optimum performance under existing ambient conditions.

In some embodiments the apparatus may be incorporated as part of a system for distributing water. Within this system may include a monitoring system. This monitoring system may include but is not limited to having an input sensor for measuring one or more characteristics of the input to the generation device and an output sensor for measuring consumption or other characteristic of output from the generation device. The monitoring system may have a controller for concatenating measured input and consumption of output on the basis of the input and output sensors.

Where the generation device of a particular utility of a network is a water vapor distillation apparatus the input sensor may be a flow rate monitor. Moreover the output sensor may be a water quality sensor including one or more of torpidity conductivity and temperature sensors.

The monitoring system may also have a telemetry module for communicating measured input and output parameters to a remote site either directly or via an intermediary device such as a satellite and moreover the system may include a remote actuator for varying operating parameters of the generator based on remotely received instructions. The monitoring system may also have a self locating device such as a GPS receiver having an output indicative of the location of the monitoring system. In that case characteristics of the measured input and output may depend upon the location of the monitoring system.

The monitoring system described above may be included within a distributed network of utilities providing sources of purified water. The distributed network has devices for generating water using input sensors for measuring inputs to respective generators output sensor for measuring consumption of output from respective generators and a telemetry transmitter for transmitting input and output parameters of a specified generator. Finally the distributed network may have a remote processor for receiving input and output parameters from a plurality of utility generators.

Referring now to this figure depicts monitoring generation device . Generation device may be a water vapor distillation apparatus as disclosed herein. Generation device may typically be characterized by a set of parameters that describe its current operating status and conditions. Such parameters may include without limitation its temperature its input or output flux etc. and may be subject to monitoring by means of sensors as described in detail below.

Still referring to source water enters the generation device at inlet and leaves the generation device at outlet . The amount of source water entering generation device and the amount of purified water leaving generation device may be monitored through the use of one or more of a variety of sensors commonly used to determine flow rate such as sensors for determining them temperature and pressure or a rotometer located at inlet sensor module and or at outlet sensor module either on a per event or cumulative basis. Additionally the proper functioning of the generation device may be determined by measuring the turpidity conductivity and or temperature at the outlet sensor module and or the inlet sensor module . Other parameters such as system usage time or power consumption either per event or cumulatively may also be determined. A sensor may be coupled to an alarm or shut off switch that may be triggered when the sensor detects a value outside a pre programmed range.

When the location of the system is known either through direct input of the system location or by the use of a GPS location detector additional water quality tests may be run based on location including checks for known local water contaminates utilizing a variety of detectors such as antibody chip detectors or cell based detectors. The water quality sensors may detect an amount of contaminates in water. The sensors may be programmed to sound an alarm if the water quality value rises above a pre programmed water quality value. The water quality value is the measured amount of contaminates in the water. Alternatively a shut off switch may turn off the generation device if the water quality value rises about a pre programmed water quality value.

Further scale build up in the generation device if any may be determined by a variety of methods including monitoring the heat transfer properties of the system or measuring the flow impedance. A variety of other sensors may be used to monitor a variety of other system parameters.

Still referring to the sensors described above may be used to monitor and or record the various parameters described above onboard the generation device or in an alternative embodiment the generation device may be equipped with a communication system such as a cellular communication system. The communication system could be an internal system used solely for communication between the generation device and the monitoring station . Alternatively the communication system could be a cellular communication system that includes a cellular telephone for general communication through a cellular satellite system . The communication system may also employ wireless technology such as the Bluetooth open specification. The communication system may additionally include a GPS Global Positioning System locator.

Still referring to the communication system enables a variety of improvements to the generation device by enabling communication with a monitoring station . For example the monitoring station may monitor the location of the generation device to ensure that use in an intended location by an intended user. Additionally the monitoring station may monitor the amount of water and or electricity produced which may allow the calculation of usage charges. Additionally the determination of the amount of water and or electricity produced during a certain period or the cumulative hours of usage during a certain period allows for the calculation of a preventative maintenance schedule. If it is determined that a maintenance call is required either by the calculation of usage or by the output of any of the sensors used to determine water quality the monitoring station may arrange for a maintenance visit. In the case that a GPS Global Positioning System locator is in use monitoring station may determine the precise location of the generation device to better facilitate a maintenance visit. The monitoring station may also determine which water quality or other tests are most appropriate for the present location of the generation device . The communication system may also be used to turn the generation device on or off to pre heat the device prior to use or to deactivate the system in the event the system is relocated without advance warning such as in the event of theft.

Now referring to the use of the monitoring and communication system described above facilitates the use of a variety of utility distribution systems. An organization such as a Government agency non governmental agency NGO or privately funded relief organization a corporation or a combination of these could provide distributed utilities such as safe drinking water or electricity to a geographical or political area such as an entire country. The organization may then establish local distributors A B and C. These local distributors could preferably be a monitoring station See previously described. In one possible arrangement organization could provide some number of generation devices See to the local distributor etc. In another possible arrangement the organization could sell loan or make other financial arrangements for the distribution of the generation devices See . The local distributor etc. could then either give these generation devices to operators etc. or provide the generation devices See to the operators though some type of financial arrangement such as a sale or micro loan.

Still referring to the operator could then provide distributed utilities to a village center school hospital or other group at or near the point of water access. In one exemplary embodiment when the generation device See is provided to the operator by means of a micro loan the operator could charge the end users on a per unit bases such as per watt hour in the case of electricity or per liter in the case of purified water. Either the local distributor or the organization may monitor usage and other parameters using one of the communication systems described above. The distributor or the organization could then recoup some of the cost of the generation device See or effect repayment of the micro loan by charging the operator for some portion of the per unit charges such as 50 . The communication systems described additionally may be used to deactivate the generation device See if the generation device is relocated outside of a pre set area or if payments are not made in a timely manner. This type of a distribution system may allow the distribution of needed utilities across a significant area quickly while then allowing for at least the partial recoupment of funds which for example could then be used to develop a similar system in another area.

Now referring to this figure illustrates a conceptual flow diagram of one possible way to incorporate an alternate embodiment of the water vapor distillation apparatus into a system. In an embodiment of this type fluid flows through the system from an intake into an exchanger wherein exchanger receives heat from at least one of a plurality of sources including a condenser a head and exhaust not shown from a power source such as an internal or external combustion engine. Fluid continues flowing past heat exchanger into a sump and into a core in thermal contact with condenser . In the core the fluid is partially vaporized. From core the vapor path proceeds into head in communication with a compressor and from there into condenser . After the vapor has condensed fluid proceeds from condenser through heat exchanger and finally into an exhaust region and then out as final distilled product.

Referring to a power source may be used to power the overall system. Power source may be coupled to a motor not shown that is used to drive compressor particularly when compressor is a steam pump such as a liquid ring pump or a regenerative blower. The power source may also be used to provide electrical energy to the other elements of the apparatus shown in . Power source may be for example an electrical outlet a standard internal combustion IC generator or an external combustion generator. In one exemplary embodiment the power source is a Stirling cycle engine. An IC generator and an external combustion generator advantageously produce both power and thermal energy as shown in where engine produces both mechanical and thermal energy. Engine may be either an internal combustion engine or an external combustion engine. A generator such as a permanent magnet brushless motor is coupled to a crankshaft of the engine and converts the mechanical energy produced by the engine to electrical energy such as power . Engine also produces exhaust gases and heat . The thermal energy produced by the engine in the form of exhaust gas and heat may be advantageously used to provide heat to the system.

Referring to heat from a power source may be recaptured by channeling the exhaust into the insulated cavity that surrounds the apparatus which may lie between external housing and the individual apparatus components. In one embodiment exhaust may blow across a finned heat exchanger that heats source fluid prior to entering the evaporator condenser . In other embodiments the source fluid flows past a tube in tube heat exchanger as described above with reference to the exemplary embodiment.

Referring now to one embodiment of the system is shown. The system includes two basic functional components that may be combined within a single integral unit or may be capable of separate operation and coupled as described herein for the purpose of local water purification. depicts an of the system in which a power unit is coupled electrically via cable to provide electrical power to a water vapor distillation apparatus with exhaust gas from the power unit coupled to convey heat to the water distillation unit via an exhaust duct .

In the exemplary embodiment the power unit is a Stirling cycle engine. The Stirling cycle engine may be any of the embodiments described herein. Thermal cycle engines are limited by second law of thermodynamics to a fractional efficiency i.e. a Carnot efficiency of TH TC TH where TH and TC are the temperatures of the available heat source and ambient thermal background respectively. During the compression phase of a heat engine cycle heat must be exhausted from the system in a manner not entirely reversible thus there will always be a surfeit of exhaust heat. More significantly moreover not all the heat provided during the expansion phase of the heat engine cycle is coupled into the working fluid. Here too exhaust heat is generated that may be used advantageously for other purposes. The total heat thermodynamically available i.e. in gas hotter than the ambient environment in the burner exhaust is typically on the order of 10 of the total input power. For a power unit delivering on the order of a kilowatt of electrical power as much as 700 W of heat may be available in an exhaust stream of gas at temperatures in the vicinity of 200 C. In accordance with embodiments of the present apparatus system and methods the exhaust heat as well as the electrical power generated by an engine powered generator are used in the purification of water for human consumption thereby advantageously providing an integrated system to which only raw water and a fuel need be provided.

Moreover external combustion engines such as Stirling cycle engines are capable of providing high thermal efficiency and low emission of pollutants when such methods are employed as efficient pumping of oxidant typically air and referred to herein and in any appended claims without limitation as air through the burner to provide combustion and the recovery of hot exhaust leaving the heater head. In many applications air is pre heated prior to combustion nearly to the temperature of the heater head so as to achieve the stated objectives of thermal efficiency. However the high temperature of preheated air desirable for achieving high thermal efficiency complicates achieving low emission goals by making it difficult to premix the fuel and air and by requiring large amounts of excess air in order to limit the flame temperature. Technology directed toward overcoming these difficulties in order to achieve efficient and low emission operation of thermal engines is described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6 062 023 Kerwin et al. issued May 16 2000 and incorporated herein by reference.

External combustion engines are additionally conducive to the use of a wide variety of fuels including those most available under particular local circumstances however the teachings of the present description are not limited to such engines and internal combustion engines are also within the scope of the current disclosure. Internal combustion engines however impose difficulties due to the typically polluted nature of the exhausted gases and external combustion engines are preferably employed.

Still referring to an embodiment of a power unit is shown schematically in . Power unit includes an external combustion engine coupled to a generator . In an exemplary embodiment the external combustion engine is a Stirling cycle engine. The outputs of the Stirling cycle engine during operation include both mechanical energy and residual heat energy. Heat produced in the combustion of a fuel in a burner is applied as an input to the Stirling cycle engine and partially converted to mechanical energy. The unconverted heat or thermal energy accounts for approximately 65 to 85 of the energy released in the burner . The ranges given herein are approximations and the ranges may vary depending on the embodiment of water vapor distillation apparatus used in the system and the embodiment of the Stirling engine or other generator used in the system.

This heat is available to provide heating to the local environment around the power unit in two forms a smaller flow of exhaust gas from the burner and a much larger flow of heat rejected at the cooler of the Stirling engine. Power unit may also be referred to as an auxiliary power unit APU . The exhaust gases are relatively hot typically 100 to 300 C. and represent 10 to 20 of the thermal energy produced by the Stirling engine . The cooler rejects 80 to 90 of the thermal energy at 10 to 20 C. above the ambient temperature. The heat is rejected to either a flow of water or more typically to the air via a radiator . Stirling cycle engine is preferably of a size such that power unit is transportable.

As shown in Stirling engine is powered directly by a heat source such as burner . Burner combusts a fuel to produce hot exhaust gases which are used to drive the Stirling engine . A burner control unit is coupled to the burner and a fuel canister . Burner control unit delivers a fuel from the fuel canister to the burner . The burner controller also delivers a measured amount of air to the burner to advantageously ensure substantially complete combustion. The fuel combusted by burner is preferably a clean burning and commercially available fuel such as propane. A clean burning fuel is a fuel that does not contain large amounts of contaminants the most important being sulfur. Natural gas ethane propane butane ethanol methanol and liquefied petroleum gas LPG are all clean burning fuels when the contaminants are limited to a few percent. One example of a commercially available propane fuel is HD an industry grade defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers and available from Bernzomatic. In accordance with an embodiment of the system and as discussed in more detail below the Stirling engine and burner provide substantially complete combustion in order to provide high thermal efficiency as well as low emissions. The characteristics of high efficiency and low emissions may advantageously allow use of power unit indoors.

Generator is coupled to a crankshaft not shown of Stirling engine . It should be understood to one of ordinary skill in the art that the term generator encompasses the class of electric machines such as generators wherein mechanical energy is converted to electrical energy or motors wherein electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy. The generator is preferably a permanent magnet brushless motor. A rechargeable battery provides starting power for the power unit as well as direct current DC power to a DC power output . In a further embodiment APU also advantageously provides alternating current AC power to an AC power output . An inverter is coupled to the battery in order to convert the DC power produced by battery to AC power. In the embodiment shown in the battery inverter and AC power output are disposed within an enclosure .

Utilization of the exhaust gas generated in the operation of power unit is now described with reference to the schematic depiction of an embodiment of the system shown in . Burner exhaust is directed through a heat conduit into enclosure of the water vapor distillation apparatus unit designated generally by numeral . Heat conduit is preferably a hose that may be plastic or corrugated metal surrounded by insulation however all means of conveying exhaust heat from power unit to water purification unit are within the scope of the system. The exhaust gas designated by arrow blows across a heat exchanger in the exemplary embodiment a hose in hose heat exchanger is used in other embodiments a finned heat exchanger is used thereby heating the source water stream as it travels to the water vapor distillation which is also referred to herein as a still evaporator . The hot gas that fills the volume surrounded by insulated enclosure essentially removes all thermal loss from the still system since the gas temperature within the insulated cavity is hotter than surface of the still itself. Thus there is substantially no heat flow from the still to the ambient environment and losses on the order of 75 W for a still of 10 gallon hour capacity are thereby recovered. A microswitch senses the connection of hose coupling hot exhaust to purification unit so that operation of the unit may account for the influx of hot gas.

In accordance with alternate embodiments adding heat to exhaust stream is within the scope of the system whether through addition of a post burner not shown or using electrical power for ohmic heating.

During initial startup of the system power unit is activated providing both electrical power and hot exhaust. Warm up of the still is significantly accelerated since the heat exchanger is initially below the dew point of the moisture content of the exhaust since the exhaust contains water as a primary combustion product. The heat of vaporization of this water content is available to heat source water as the water condenses on the fins of the heat exchanger. The heat of vaporization supplements heating of the heat exchanger by convection of hot gas within the still cavity. For example in the fin heat exchanger embodiment heating of the fins by convection continues even after the fins reach the dew point of the exhaust.

In accordance with other embodiments of the system power unit and still may be further integrated by streaming water from the still through the power unit for cooling purposes. The use of source water for cooling presents problems due to the untreated nature of the water. Whereas using the product water requires an added complexity of the system to allow for cooling of the power unit before the still has warmed up to full operating conditions.

Referring again to other embodiments may include the use of additives in solid form wherein such additives could be embedded in a time release matrix inserted into the flow through channel of intake . In one particular embodiment replacement additive would need to be inserted periodically by the user. In yet another embodiment a powder form of an additive could be added in a batch system wherein the powder is added for example in tablet form to an external reservoir containing water to be purified wherein the additive is uniformly mixed similar to the batch system for adding liquid additives described above.

Still referring to pre treatment of the source water may occur prior to or within intake . Pre treatment operations may include but is not limited to gross filtering treatment with chemical additives such as polyphosphates polyacetates organic acids or polyaspartates and electrochemical treatment such as an oscillating magnetic field or an electrical current degassing and UV treatment. Additives may be added in liquid form to the incoming liquid stream using a continuous pumping mechanism such as a roller pump or pulsatile pump including a standard diaphragm pump or piezoelectric diaphragm pump. Alternatively the additives may be added by a semi continuous mechanism using for example a syringe pump which would require a re load cycle or a batch pumping system wherein a small volume of the additive would be pumped into a holding volume or reservoir external to the system that uniformly mixes the additive with the liquid before the liquid flows into the system. It is also envisioned that the user could simply drop a prescribed volume of the additive into for example a bucket containing the liquid to be purified. Liquid additive may be loaded as either a lifetime quantity i.e. no consumables for the life of the machine or as a disposable amount requiring re loading after consumption.

Still referring to similarly post treatment of the product water may occur preferably within an external output region not shown . Post treatment operations may include but is not limit to taste additives such as sugar based additives for sweetening acids for tartness and minerals. Other additives including nutrients vitamins stabilized proteins such as creatinine and fats and sugars may also be added. Such additives may be added either in liquid or solid form whether as a time release tablet through which the output liquid flows or a powder added to an external reservoir such as through a batch system. Alternatively the additive may be added to the output liquid via an internal coating of a separate collection reservoir or container for example by leaching or dissolution on contact. In such embodiments the ability to detect purified liquid with and without the additive may be preferred. Detection systems in accordance with various embodiments include pH analysis conductivity and hardness analysis or other standard electrical based assays. Such detection systems allow for replacement of additives as needed by triggering a signal mechanism when the additive level quantity is below a pre set level or is undetectable.

In another embodiment liquid characteristics such as for example water hardness is monitored in the output and may be coupled with an indicator mechanism which signals that it is preferable to add appropriate additives.

In yet another embodiment ozone is systemically generated using for example electric current or discharge methods and added to the output product for improved taste. Alternatively air may be pumped through a HEPA filter bubbling through the product water to improve palatability of the water.

Similarly it is envisioned that other embodiments may include means for detecting nucleic acids antigens and bio organisms such as bacteria. Examples of such detection means include nanoscale chemistry and biochemistry micro arrays known in the field and currently commercially available. Such arrays may also be used to monitor the presence and or absence of nutrients and other additives in the purified product as discussed above.

In another embodiment UV treatment may be used post purification for example in a storage barrel or other container to aid in maintenance of the purified product.

Referring again to in various embodiments the apparatus may include at least one product conductivity cell . In various embodiments the product conductivity cell may be located in the product line downstream of the liquid heat exchanger and prior to the valve manifold. As described in more detail above the conductivity of the product may be used in one or more control systems of the apparatus. The resulting readings and or signals of the product conductivity cell may in some embodiments be communicated to at least one conductivity meter not shown and the meter may determine the conductivity and display one or more indications on the outside of the apparatus i.e. such that user s of the system may monitor and or determine same. In various other embodiments the signals from the product conductivity cell are sent to the controller to be used for one or more control systems and or methods for the apparatus. In some embodiments the signals from the product conductivity cell may be sent both to the conductivity meter and to the controller. In some embodiments in addition the signals may be sent to one or more additional receiving devices including but not limited to a remote device and or remote user interface and or remote computer. In some embodiments the conductivity and or information related thereto may be both displayed on the outside of the apparatus as well as used by the controller. In some embodiments the outside display may include but is not limited to one or more of the following displays numbers e.g. values words one or more colored light indicators and or one or more symbols that may indicate one or more conditions to a user viewer wherein condition may include but are not limited to one or more of the following condition of the apparatus and or condition of the product.

In some embodiments the signals from the product conductivity cell are correlated to determine the quality of product. Depending on the determined quality of the product the product may either be diverted or will be actual product. For example where the product does not meet a minimum threshold for quality the product will be diverted and or dumped and not progress to actual product. In some embodiments the threshold may be 20 microsiemens and for example where the product exceeds 20 microsiemens per centimeter squared the product is diverted. However in various embodiments the threshold may be higher or lower than 20 microsiemens.

In some embodiments the system includes at least two processors a motor control engine processor MCE and an ARM control processor. In various embodiments the control system controls the production of product in the apparatus . The source fills the sump and the source is heated to produce steam. The steam temperature is maintained through the controls system controlling the heater and the vent valve. In some embodiments both the product and blowdown flow to holding tanks. The product level is controlled by changing the duty cycle on the product and product divert valve duty cycles. The blowdown level is maintained in some embodiments by two controllers. The blowdown controller maintains its target level through adjusting the blowdown valve. The source controller also works to maintain the blowdown level. The source controller set point target is higher in some embodiments than the blowdown controller set point target. The source controller adjusts the source valve duty cycle. Maintaining the source controller set point target higher than the blowdown set point provides continuous feeding of at least a volume of source water into the apparatus .

Referring also to an overview of the states of the water vapor distillation apparatus is shown. The main control system of the device controls each state. Although various other embodiments may be used for illustration purposes one example of an embodiment of the various states of the main control system is described below. However in various other embodiments additional states may be used and or the order of states may be different as well as the targets thresholds etc. that are given for illustration purposes. Additionally the names given for each states are for illustration purposes and other names may be used in various embodiments.

When the water system starts the apparatus is in the idle state. In the idle state all controllers are turned to off and the apparatus is not heating. When the user presses the button to start the system it goes into the fill state. The fill state opens the source valve allowing source water to fill the sump and overflow into the blow down tank and product tank if needed. Thus the fill state ensures that the sump is full before the system begins to heat. Once the desired level is reached in the blow down and product tanks the system enters the heat state. In the heat state the heater in the sump is maximized to its highest state and the controller waits until the temperature rises to an appropriate predetermined desired value which in some embodiments may be about 100 C. and in some embodiments may be 105 C. However in various other embodiments may be higher or lower than 105 C. Once the low pressure steam temperature high pressure steam temperature and sump temperatures reach the appropriate predetermined desired temperatures which in some embodiments may be 105 C. 105 C. and 103 C. respectively the system goes into the heat exchanger prime state.

The heat exchanger prime state controls the levels on the product and the blow down level sensors and waits for the temperature to rise to a higher degree. In some embodiments in the heat exchanger prime state the source valve is opened to a predetermine fixed duty cycle e.g. 5 which in various embodiments may be higher or lower than 5 . In some embodiments the blow down is controlled to e.g. 50 . Thus in various embodiments source water moving into the system machine becomes steam by opening the source valve and some water becomes blow down. In various embodiments the blow down level is maintained e.g. at 50 by controlling the duty cycle of the valve. In the heat exchanger prime state the heater is maintained on and is maximized in some embodiments to its highest state. Also in heat exchanger prime state source water moves into the system machine and the blow down and product controllers are actuated initiated activated.

The low pressure steam temperature high pressure steam temperature sump temperature and motor temperature are monitored. Once the low pressure steam temperature high pressure steam temperature sump temperature and motor temperature reach the appropriate predetermined desired temperatures which in some embodiments may be greater than or equal to 112 C. greater than or equal to 112 C. greater than or equal to 110 C. and greater than or equal to 90 C. respectively and the product level is greater than or equal to the minimum start level which serves to ensure that there is some product water being generated producing the system goes into the start pump state.

In start pump state the bearing feed pump is commanded to run at a designated predetermined speed. Also in the start pump state the blower motor is started which starts the impeller spinning. Also during the start pump state in some embodiments the vent valve is actuated at a predetermined value for example for example a predetermined value in some embodiments is anywhere between 50 100 . This acts to vent any contained gasses that have accumulated in the condenser of the evaporator condenser space. In some embodiments it is beneficial to remove these from the system. Thus during start pump state the vent valve is held anywhere between 50 100 in various embodiments for the duration of the start pump state.

Once the impeller reaches speed predetermined speed and once the blow down tank level reaches the correct level and the reported motor speed is within a MotorErrorSpeed e.g. a predetermined speed that may vary in various embodiments rpm of the commanded speed the system enters the run state. During the run state the apparatus is producing product water.

During the run state the source valve and the blow down valve controllers maintain the system machine with a threshold amount of source water entering blow down and product water exiting. This ensures that the system machine does not flood or dry out. The controllers maintain this level by actuating the source valve and the blow down valve.

Also during run state the low pressure steam temperature is monitored and held at a predetermined temperature which in some embodiments may be about 111.5 C. The low steam pressure temperature is maintained in some embodiments at the predetermined temperature by actuating the sump heater if the temperature falls below the predetermined. If the temperature is above the predetermined temperature e.g. in some embodiments 111.5 C. the vent valve may be actuated opened. A heater controller and a vent valve controller controls the vent valve duty cycle and both the heater controller and a vent valve controller monitor the low pressure steam temperature. Thus they the heater controller and a vent valve controller are controlled by the low pressure steam temperature.

In various embodiments a minimum vent valve duty cycle is maintained. In some embodiments if the temperature increases above a predetermined threshold the vent duty cycle is increased to above the minimum vent valve duty cycle. This maintains a vent of gasses out of the condenser of the evaporator condenser.

The product valve duty cycle controls the product level by receiving the product sensor readings. In various embodiments the product valve duty cycle works to maintain the product level at a predetermined level which in some embodiments may be 50 of the product level sensor. The product level is controlled by actuating the product valve i.e. by opening or closing the product valve more or less to increase or decrease the product level.

From the run state the system will go into the flow measurement state every FlowCheckTime seconds e.g. a predetermined amount of time i.e. seconds that may vary in various embodiments which may be referred to as the count to flowcheck time . During this state the control system determines both the product flow rate and the blow down rate. Once the count to flowcheck time has been met the flow measurement is taken.

With respect to the product flow rate the flow measurement state includes emptying a product collection container to a certain level and then proceed to a product fill state which closes the empty process and determines the amount of time it takes to fill the contained back to a preset value e.g. to measure the amount of product the apparatus is producing in a given amount of time . In some embodiments if the production rate flow rate drops below a preset predetermined threshold value or if the production rate flow rate exceeds a preset predetermined threshold value the system may alert the user. In some embodiments if the product flow rate is less than 350 ml min a low production system warning may register to the controller. This low production system warning may be cleared in some embodiments once the product flow rate is greater than 350 ml . In some embodiments a warning does not necessarily stop the system but in other embodiments a warning may stop the system. After the flow measurement is taken the system reverts to the run state.

With respect to the blow down flow rate the flow measurement state includes emptying a blow down collection container to a certain level and then proceed to a blow down fill state which closes the empty process and determines the amount of time it takes to fill the contained back to a preset value e.g. to measure the amount of product the apparatus is producing in a given amount of time . In some embodiments if the production rate flow rate drops below a preset predetermined threshold value or if the production rate flow rate exceeds a preset predetermined threshold value the system may alert the user. In some embodiments if the blow down flow rate is less than 35 the system will transition to blow down full state and if using external tanks container holding tanks transition to idle state. If the blow down flow rate is greater than 50 the system will calculate blow down flow and calculate the average flow and if using external tanks container holding tanks transition to idle state. After the flow measurement is taken the system reverts to the run state. The blowdown flow rate may be adjusted

The system will stay in the run state until the user button is pressed . The system will then go into the standby state. In the standby state the motor is turned off but the heater maintains predetermined low pressure steam temperature of in some embodiments about 112.5 C. however in other embodiments the heater may maintain a low pressure steam temperature of less than 112.5 C. or greater than 112.5 C. In the standby state the system maintains the system in a warm state and controls the source water flow but the blower is not running. In some embodiments the system in the standby state actuates the source valve at a low duty cycle and maintains the blow down flow. Maintaining the temperature at about 112.5 C. or the predetermined temperature which may be greater or less than 112.5 C. maintains the system in a boiling then condensing cycle. Where the apparatus is attached to a product water holding tank which in some embodiments may include a product level sensor when the level sensor signals indicate to the processor that the tank is full the controller puts the system into standby state.

From the standby state a short e.g. less than 3 second button press will revert the system to idle state. A button press longer than e.g. 3 seconds will revert the system to the heat exchanger prime state. Pressing the user button for less than e.g. 3 seconds in any state but standby will take the system back to the idle state. Any system fault detected will take the system to the idle state. Recoverable system faults will attempt to restart the process once the fault state is cleared. However as stated above the order of steps the times given the button presses etc. may vary in various embodiments are given here as examples.

The control system includes various tasks running on the processor. The various tasks communicate one to another through a shared memory block i.e. registers that get written and read by the various tasks.

In various embodiments one or more events or conditions of the apparatus system may cause action by the control system.

SPILL event. Once the system machine is activated but before the system machine begins to run the controller first determines whether there is sufficient water in the system to enter the heat state. Thus in the full state this is a confirmation to ensure there is sufficient water to start the heater. In some embodiments for example if the blow down tank level is greater than the fill set point and the product level is greater than 30 then the SPILL event is handled. The default fill set point is 90 in some embodiments. The spill event is only checked in some embodiments in the Fill state

In some embodiments the slipped coupling event is only checked for in the Run state.

In various embodiments one or more controllers of the apparatus system are used by the control system to control the system. The following are various controllers one or more may be included in various embodiments of the control system.

Blow down level control. In some embodiments the blow down level controller in various embodiments controls the blow down valve duty cycle. This controller uses the blow down tank level for feedback. During Heat Exchanger Prime state it is run as a PI controller. During the Start Pump and Run states it is run as a P only controller. In some embodiments the blow down level controller may be disabled in all other states. This controller uses a different P value for Heat Exchanger Prime state than Start Pump and Run states.

Heater control. The heater control controller controls the heater duty cycle. It defaults to using the low pressure temperature for feedback. If the HeaterUseSumpTemp register is set this controller may use the sump temperature for feedback. During the Heat Heat Exchanger Prime Start Pump and Run states it is run as a PI controller. In some embodiments this controller may be disabled during other states.

Product level control. This controller controls the product level based on product level sensor and adjusts the product valve duty cycle and product diver duty cycle. During the Heat Exchanger Prime Start Pump and Run states this controller runs as a PI controller. During other states in some embodiments this controller is disabled.

Source flow controller. This controller controls the source flow based on the blow down level sensor by activating or varying the source valve duty cycle. In various embodiments this controller is run as a PID controller during the Fill Heat Start Pump and Run . This controller may start when entering the Heat Exchanger Prime state. In some embodiments during the Heat Exchanger Prime state this controller may be disabled if the blow down level is too high. In some embodiments during the Heat Exchanger Prime state this controller may and enabled if the blow down level is too low.

Thus the source flow controller and the blow down controller receive information from the blow down level sensor and regulate the source valve and the blow down valve respectively based on the blow down level sensor information e.g. level. The gains and the controls for the source flow controller and the blow down controller ensure that the system machine takes in a greater volume of source water compared with the volume of water boiling off as product water such that excessive water is input into the system machine that comes out as blow down water wherein the system machine does not run dry i.e. this method prevents the system from running dry. Also this method ensures that the system machine does not over utilize source water and create excess blow down. Thus the system machine maintains a balance between the amount of source water that enters the system machine the amount of blow down and the amount of product water produced by the system machine. This balance is maintained by a single sensor the blow down level sensor together with two controllers the source flow controller and the blow down controller.

In some embodiments for example the blow down controller may be preprogrammed to maintain the blow down level at a lower level than the source flow controller. For example in some embodiments the blow down controller may be preprogrammed to maintain the blow down level at 50 and the source flow controller may be preprogrammed to maintain the blow down level at 60 . Thus the two controllers counteract one another. However because in various embodiments the source flow controller is a PID controller while the blow down controller is a PI controller overtime the PID source flow controller ultimately may maintain the 60 while the blow down controller will continue to attempt to maintain 50 but will not reach the 50 . Thus the source flow controller will open the source valve until the blow down level sensor indicates the preprogrammed level e.g. 60 . This control system may be beneficial for many reasons including but not limited to that the blow down controller will maintain a level lower than the source controller which in many embodiments prevents flooding.

Vent control In some embodiments the vent control controls the low pressure temperature based on the low pressure temperature sensor and the vent valve duty cycle. The vent controller may be broken up into four segments. The first segment may be for temperatures below ventLowTempQ which in some embodiments may be 100 C. The vent valve may behave according to state which in some embodiments may be heat run at 100 0 respectively. The second segment may be for between ventLowTempQ which in some embodiments may be 100 C. and ventMidTempQ 112 C. In some embodiments in this segment the vent valve command is generated by the equation LPSteamTemp ventLowTempQ ventLowGainQ. In the next segment ventMidTempQ to ventHighTempQ the command is generated by command LPSteamTemp ventMidTempQ ventHighGainQ. In some embodiments if the temperature is above ventHighTempQ which in some embodiments may be 118 C. the command is set to highTempVentValvePct which in some embodiments may be 100 . During the Run state the vent valve in the exemplary embodiments is not fully closed thus allowing gas venting in the system.

Motor Control Engine. In some embodiments the system includes a motor control engine controller MCE and a MCE processor. The MCE is a dedicated processor for controlling the motors. The MCE controls both the motors and the heater. MCE includes a message task which takes the information from the MCE processor and puts it into shared memory and then the safety task reads it out of shared memory and acts on it appropriately.

In various embodiments the apparatus includes a USB port or other for communication with external machines e.g. computers smart phones and other devices having an ability to receive and or send messages to the apparatus and or software or other applications collectively referred to herein as external applications . The system in some embodiments also may include a cell modem for communication. In various embodiments data from the control system and processors is logged and may be transferred to external applications. This may allow for external monitoring of the apparatus system. In some embodiments the apparatus may be preprogrammed to upload logging data at a predetermined time intervals e.g. every 12 hours. Below is an exemplary embodiments however in various embodiments the task may vary. The terminology and names given to commands may vary in various embodiments.

In the exemplary embodiments a data logging task handles the communications with the external applications. In various embodiments the task first checks whether the USB port is initialized. If it is not the task initializes the port. If the port is initialized the task checks for and reads the message from the serial port. On a peek command the task parses the location to peek and returns the value. On a poke command the task parses the location to poke and the value to poke. The task then sets the poked value to be used in shared memory and returns the status of the poke command. On an unpoke command the task first checks to see if this is an unpoke all or unpoke one value command. Where the command is an unpoke all the task restores all the original values to the shared memory used values. For unpoke one value the task parses the unpoke location and restores the original value to the shared memory used value and returns the OK status. On a display poked command the system buffers the location and value of all the poked values and returns the buffer. On a data command the system buffers and sends all the constant data buffers and sends all the computed values and then sends the done string. On a flash command the system saves the constants to the flash memory and returns an OK flag.

In various embodiments the system includes an SD card and the data is logged onto the SD card. The SD card also may handles communication with the cell modem. An exemplary embodiments of the SD task is described below.

The SD task in some embodiments handles the reading and writing of data on the SD card and the interface to the cell modem. All SD card access must be done through the SD logging task. On startup it initializes the file system creates directories if needed reads the last state and motor time files and logs an entry into the data log file. Data will be logged to the log file every SDLogTime seconds default is 300 seconds . The log file name has the date and device ID embedded. The disk has a current directory where log data is written. There are also monthly backup directories to save old data. When the file is sent to the modem it is then moved into that months backup directory. Before writing to the log file the system checks the free space on the disk. If there is less than 1 MB of space left it will start purging old data by deleting the files in the oldest months directory. It will continue to delete files until there is more than 1 MB of free space.

In various embodiments the system software uses a shared memory class to exchange data between the tasks. In some embodiments there are two sections of shared memory the constants section and the computed section. In the exemplary embodiment all data in the shared memory is stored and retrieved as 32 bit integers. Any data filtering or scaling is done in the putValue function based on the index of the value being saved.

The constants section contains gains and other machine constants. These values are stored in flash memory flash . When the system starts up the constant values are read from flash. If the cyclical redundancy check CRC on the flash copy is correct the flash values are loaded into the random access memory RAM image. If the CRC is not correct the hard coded default values are loaded in to the RAM. When the value of a constant is needed by the software it is read using the shared memory getGain method. It is passed in the index of the constant and the constant value is returned. In some embodiments the only method for the software to write a constant value is to use the poke functionality. The shared memory method copyGainToPoked would need to be used which received or is passed the index of the constant to change and the value to change it to. The gainFlag constant may be a predetermined preprogrammed constant set by the user. Thus in some embodiments the user is responsible for setting the gainFlag for that constant to indicate that the value in the table is a poked value. To restore the poked value to its original value the shared memory copyPokedToGain method is called. In some embodiments calling this method will restore all poked constants to their original values.

In some embodiments the computed section contains values that are read from the input output IO or calculated during normal operation. These values are periodically overwritten as new values are read or calculated. When other software tasks need to read a computed value they use the shared memory method getValue . This method is passed the index of the value to read and returns the value at that index. In some embodiments the software writes values into the computed section using the putValue method of the shared memory class. The method is passed the index of the location to write and the value to be written. Initially the written values are stored in a holding array. In some embodiments at least once in each control loop of the water task the function is called to copy all data from the holding array into the used array. If the poked flag for that value is set the data for that value is not copied. The values for the computed section can be poked in some embodiments only through the External App interface. The handlePoke method of the DataLog class will change the value in the computed table at the specified index and set the poked flag to keep this data from being overwritten by the update loop. In some embodiments the value may be unpoked by calling the clearPokedComputed method of the shared memory class. This will unpoke all poked computed values. The poked flag will be cleared and the next data update loop will overwrite with the latest computed value.

The system includes various input and output points IO where the controls receive an input and or sends an output. In various embodiments one or more of the following may be included as IO Points. In other embodiments additional IO Points may be included and in some embodiments all of the following may be included.

In some embodiments the system may attempt to restart following an error if the error did not occur in the Idle state. In some embodiments for over temperature faults the system may wait until the temperatures drop within acceptable ranges before restarting. In some embodiments the software may retry starting the system at least three times. In some embodiments after the third restart attempt the system may stay in the Idle state. In some embodiments if the system stays in the Run state for a predetermined amount of time e.g. 20 minutes or is manually turned off by the operator user the retry counter may be reset to zero. In some embodiments all of the sensor faults must persist for a predetermined amount of time e.g. 2 seconds before the system may consider it a true fault. In some embodiments the system integrity tasks run in the same thread as the water and the hardware tasks. Below is Table 1 including a list of error types that may be determined using the control system. An example of the condition which triggers the error is also given as well as whether recovery is permitted. The conditions given are for illustration purposes and although in some embodiments these may be used in other embodiments the values etc. may differ.

The system in the exemplary embodiment uses the ARM processor watchdog timer. The timeout may be set for 10 seconds. Each time a task goes through its main processing loop it calls the watchdog update method passing in its task id bit. When the water hardware and system integrity bits are all set the software tickles the watchdog and clears the watchdog bits. This may be beneficial in some embodiments as it assures that all critical tasks are running

The MCE message task handles the communications between the ARM control processor and the MCE processor. In some embodiments there are 2 discrete digital signals between the ARM and the MCE processors the MCEEnable line and the MCEAwake line. The MCEEnable line is an output from the ARM processor and an input to the MCE processor. This line is set to to enable the MCE. While MCEEnable is a the MCE processor is held in the reset state.

The MCEAwake line is an output from the MCE processor and an input to the ARM processor. In some embodiments the MCE msg task will only process messages if the MCEAWAKE line is active. If the MCEAwake line is not active the MCEEnable line is reset to the enable state. If after a predetermined amount of time e.g. 60 seconds of asserting the MCEEnable line the MCEAwake line does not become active an MCE Fault may be issued.

The MceMsg process function creates the processing signals as events occur. It will then distribute them to a heater command state machine. If the heater command state machine does not handle the signal it is then passed to the motor command state machine. If the MCE state machine does not handle the event e.g. if the event is a response that was not expected an error message is sent to the MCE. However if the MCE state machine does handle the event a status request is sent to the MCE. If a response to the command is not received within a predetermined time e.g. 10 seconds the command is reissued. If no response is received after a predetermined number of attempts e.g. 5 retries the MCE Communications Fault is signaled. MCE status is returned in the command response packets.

Therefore the control system described above may be used to determine the integrity of the apparatus system and also with information relating to the rate of water product production the control system may signal when the system should undergo maintenance including but not limited to cleaning de scaling.

Steam may pass through the opening and also through the edge openings and cut openings as well as around the outside circumferential edge of the bottom section middle section and the top section . The shape of the top section forces the steam to change direction. Water vapor that travels through the opening will hit the underside of the top section and drip down and eventually to the sump. Thus to the extent water passes through from the evaporator condenser with the steam when the steam which changes direction when it reaches the top section changes direction the water is incapable of following the same path because the water cannot change direction as it has a higher mass. This results in the water being separated from the steam. The water may reach the underside of the top section and then as there is no opening in the top section falls to the middle section and may travel through the edge openings and cut openings and back to the sump.

Steam may pass through the opening and also through the edge openings and edge openings as well as around the outside circumferential edge of the bottom section and the top section . The shape of the top section forces the steam to change direction. Water vapor that travels through the opening will hit the underside of the top section and drip down and eventually to the sump. Thus to the extent water passes through from the evaporator condenser with the steam when the steam which changes direction when it reaches the top section changes direction the water is incapable of following the same path because the water cannot change direction as it has a higher mass. This results in the water being separated from the steam. The water may reach the underside of the top section and then as there is no opening in the top section falls to the bottom section and may travel through the edge openings and opening and back to the sump.

In various embodiments the top section and bottom section are generally cone shaped and therefore to the extent water reaches a surface of one of the sections the water will tend to drip downwards towards the sump.

Steam may pass through the plurality of openings and also through the a lower sections of the plurality of mist eliminator caps which are open to the upper section of the plurality of mist eliminator caps as well as around the outside circumferential edge of the bottom section . The shape of the upper section forces the steam to change direction. Water vapor that travels through the plurality of openings will hit the underside of the upper section and drip down and eventually to the sump. Thus to the extent water passes through from the evaporator condenser with the steam when the steam which changes direction when it reaches the upper section changes direction the water is incapable of following the same path because the water cannot change direction as it has a higher mass. This results in the water being separated from the steam. The water may reach the underside of the upper section and then as there is no opening in the upper section falls to the bottom section and may travel through the edge openings and plurality of openings and back to the sump.

In various embodiments the upper sections and in some embodiments the bottom section are generally cone shaped and therefore to the extent water reaches a surface of the upper sections or the bottom section the water will tend to drip downwards towards the sump.

Referring now also to another embodiment of a mist eliminator assembly is shown. In this embodiment a mist eliminator assembly is a cap that attaches to each of the plurality of rods not shown shown in as within the tubes in the evaporator condenser assembly.

Referring now also to in various embodiments a first conductivity sensor may be used to determine quantify the quality of the product water before the product water leaves the system. In various embodiments the product water enters the conductivity cell where the conductivity probe or sensor is housed various embodiments of which have been described herein and if the first conductivity sensor returns a value to the controller that is outside a pre determined threshold value or a range of value then a divert valve is opened and the product water is disposed of and not released through the product water path rather the water flows to the divert output . However if the first conductivity sensor returns a value to the controller that is within a pre determined threshold value or a range of value then a first product valve is opened and the product water is released from the system through the product water output port .

In some embodiments a second conductivity sensor and a second conductivity cell may be included in the system. In these embodiments once the first product valve is opened the product water flows through a second product valve and then into the second conductivity sensor . If the second conductivity sensor returns a value to the controller that is outside a pre determined threshold value or a range of value then the second product valve is closed and the system is placed into a fault condition. However if the second conductivity sensor returns a value to the controller that is within a pre determined threshold value or a range of value then the system may continue to product water.

In some embodiments the second conductivity sensor and second product valve may be located within the water vapor distillation apparatus as shown in for example. However in some embodiments the second conductivity sensor and second product valve may be located outside the water vapor distillation apparatus as a modular system that may be connected to the product output for example as shown in .

In various embodiments the first conductivity sensor and the second conductivity sensor may be any conductivity sensor which may include one from made by OMEGA Engineering Inc. of Stamford Conn. U.S.A. However in various embodiments the first conductivity sensor and the second conductivity sensor may be one as shown in . Referring now also to in some embodiments another embodiment of a conductivity sensor may be used. In this embodiment the conductivity sensor includes three probes that are connected by cable. The impedance between the three probes is measured. If any one of the resistances is below a threshold this indicates that the conductivity is too high and registers a fault condition. As described above in various embodiments the fault condition in the first conductivity sensor would open the divert valve . The fault condition in the second conductivity sensor would register as a system fault condition in some embodiments and shut down the production of product water in the system.

In various embodiments of this embodiment of the conductivity sensor the resistance between the probes is fixed at 500 k Ohms. Thus in various embodiments the conductivity sensor includes three Stainless Steel conductivity probes which in various other embodiments may be made from another material at least one probe thermistor and in some embodiments a probe thermistor for each probe and 500 k Ohm resistors between each probe external to the water . The resistance between the probes is measured by an impedance measurement circuit which in some embodiments may be an Analog Devices AD5934 however in other embodiments another impedance measurement circuit may be used. Analog switches are used to multiplex between pairs of probes . The at least one thermistor is embedded in at least one probe to measure the temperature of the water. In some embodiments each probe includes an embedded thermistor.

Conductivity in uS cm normalized to 25 deg Celsius temperature cell calibration constant eg 400000 uS cm per Ohm resistance in Ohms 1 0.02 temperature in deg C 25 where temperature is measured by the at least one thermistor the cell calibration constant is related to the probe geometry and spacing and 0.02 is the percent change i.e. 2 per degree Celsius in conductivity where 2 per degree Celsius is an approximation that varies depending on the specific dissolved solids within the water.

Thus in various embodiments under regular operations of the system if the product water is acceptable or if there s air in the product line 500 k Ohms resistance will be measured between the probes . However if a cable lead brakes or fails the measured impendance jumps drastically to a mega impedance and the cable failure will be detected by the system immediately. Thus there is a clear and certain delineation between a broken probe and any other condition. If the conductivity sensor encounters air the impedance is infinite between the probes . With the 500 k Ohms resistance between the probes the conductivity sensor distinguishes between air and a broken probe.

The 500 k Ohm resistors in various embodiments are used to provide an upper bound on the observed resistance. Without these resistors the measured resistance may be

In various embodiments of this embodiments of the conductivity sensor the probes may include temperature sensors thermistors. In various embodiments during disinfection using steam discussed below the temperature sensors may feed temperature information to the controller to confirm that the temperature in the product output fluid lines reached the appropriate temperature to successfully disinfect. In various embodiments because these are redundant temperature sensors in each of the probes if one fails for any reasons it is likely one of the other two will provide temperature readings. Additionally using these redundant temperature sensors in various embodiments the controls may perform an integrity check on the temperature sensors by comparing the readings and determining if any one appears to be outside a threshold range from the other temperature sensor s readings.

In some embodiments a dedicated processor may be included in the system that communicates with both conductivity sensors . In some embodiments the various valves may be configured to fail safe e.g. if the valve brakes or malfunctions the valve closes. In various embodiments when the system registers a fault condition the system shuts down.

The conductivity control system described herein may be used to detect various conditions of the system and also serves to be a redundant system. Therefore if a valve malfunctions for example if the first product water valve malfunctions and is left open then the second product valve serves to maintain the product water in the system.

In various embodiments of the system a flow meter may be installed in the product water line between the first product valve and the second product valve . The flow meter would communicate with the controller and indicate whether there is flow between the two valves . If there is flow and the control system indicates that both the valves are closed this would indicate a fault condition of one or both of the valves.

In some embodiments the control system may run periodic tests at pre programmed times or at regular intervals or on demand that compares the readings of the first conductivity sensor with the second conductivity sensor . In some embodiments if the readings differ greater than a pre determined threshold amount then the system indicates a fault condition.

In some embodiments during the course of the system running and producing product water when the conductivity determined by the first the first conductivity sensor and the second conductivity sensor differ greater than a pre determined threshold amount then the system indicates a fault condition.

Referring now also to in various embodiments a method and system for determining conductivity of water includes using a first conductivity sensor and the system receiving a first conductivity sensor reading . Next the system determines whether the reading from the first conductivity sensor is within an acceptable range . If it is then the first product valve is opened and the second product valve is opened and then using a second conductivity sensor the system receives a second conductivity sensor reading . Next the system determines whether the reading from the second conductivity sensor is within an acceptable range . If it is then the system may in some embodiments determine whether the first conductivity sensor reading differs more than a threshold amount from the second conductivity reading . However in some embodiments step may not be included each time the method is used but in some embodiments may be included every other time and or at an interval and or on demand and or at pre determined and or pre programmed times. If the system determines that the first conductivity sensor reading differs more than a threshold amount from the second conductivity reading then a fault condition is indicated . If not then the product water goes to the output and no fault is indicated.

If it is determined that either the first conductivity sensor reading or the second conductivity sensor reading is not within the acceptable range or threshold range for acceptability then a fault condition is indicated .

In various embodiments when the divert valve is open the second conductivity sensor may be shut down or the control system does not expect to receive a reading. Thus if the control system receives a reading from the second conductivity sensor then the system indicates a fault condition as this indicates a leak or a valve malfunction.

In various embodiments the system may include an override button . This override button may be used by a user technician to clear a fault condition. In various embodiments the override button may be behind a mechanical guard or within a locked area or door and therefore the system may only be overridden by a user technician with a key. In various embodiments to override a fault condition the system may require the button be held down for a pre determined time. In some embodiments overriding includes the system water vapor distillation apparatus purges product water from the system.

In some embodiments if the conductivity readings for either the first conductivity sensor or the second conductivity sensor or both are not within a pre determined pre programmed acceptable range then in some embodiments the system may continue running and making product water but the second product valve and or the first product valve are closed. The system may then determine an occlusion condition and then the system will automatically go to a fault condition.

In some embodiments the threshold amount may be different for the first conductivity sensor and the second conductivity sensor . In some embodiments for example the threshold for the first conductivity sensor may be about 10 microsiemens per centimeter at 25 degrees Celsius. In some embodiments for example the threshold for the second conductivity sensor may be about 40 microsiemens per centimeter at 25 degrees Celsius. Thus in some embodiments the first conductivity sensor may be more robust and divert product water that may have met the threshold of the second conductivity sensor . This configuration may be beneficial for many reasons including but not limited to ensuring that the criteria for allowing product water to proceed to the output is more robust where diverting the product water is still an option. Once the product water passes the first product valve divert is not available.

In various embodiments the user interface LEDs may indicate different colors and or flashing or steady depending on the state the system water vapor distillation apparatus is in. In some embodiments the LEDs may indicate using color or lighting one or another LED whether the product water is being run which may mean dispensed or past the first product valve or diverted. In some embodiments the 7 segment display may indicate the state. IN some embodiments either the LEDs or the 7 segment display or both may indicate the state including but not limited to if the system is in a fault condition.

In some embodiments the system may use the following method to determine whether the system water vapor distillation apparatus has water flowing through using the product Level Sensor Assembly as described above the first product valve and the second product valve . The system closes both the first product valve and the second product valve and then the system watches the readings from the product Level Sensor Assembly. If the level in the product Level Sensor Assembly changes then this indicates that at least one of the first product valve or the second product valve is working. This may be beneficial for many reasons including but not limited to ensuring that at least one of the first product valve or the second product valve is functioning to prevent unintentional output of product water.

In some embodiments the system includes a method for disinfection. In some embodiments the water vapor distillation apparatus using the evaporator condenser assembly introduces steam in excess of 100 degrees Celsius through the product water and divert fluid lines. In various embodiments this method disinfects the various components and fluid lines in the system. In various embodiments this method may begin by a user technician connecting a particular hose to the outputs which may be diverted to a bucket of water to quench the steam. In some embodiments the system may be placed into the disinfect state by toggling using either the button and or using another component of the user interface and or being connected to a computer and the computer instructing the system to enter into the disinfect state. Once in the disinfect state in various embodiments the sump heater is turned on and the system runs to bring the water to a higher temperature than during regular distillation for a pre programmed or pre determined period of time. In some embodiments the disinfect may be a pre set program in the system and using the user interface the user technician may toggle through various programs until placing the system into the disinfect state.

In various embodiments the disinfection method may include closing the first and or the second product valves . Heat transfer may raise the temperature in the fluid lines and valves beyond the first product valve to an appropriate temperature to successfully disinfect without actually applying the steam to those areas. In this way steam would be prevented from leaving the product outlet which may be beneficial for many reasons including but not limited to preventing the possibility of steam emerging from the system which may be hazardous. In this embodiment any user may run the disinfection state rather than limiting the running of the disinfection state to a technician. This embodiment also would not require a hose be applied to the product outlet for the disinfection or water to quench the steam.

In various embodiments the product water fluid lines and specific components keep the product water at a higher pressure than the blowdown water specific components for the blowdown water. In this way blowdown water is less likely and or unlikely to flow to and comingle with the product water.

In various embodiments the system may include multiple printed circuit boards PCB . In some embodiments the system may include a first PCB a machine control processor which includes the controls for producing water and controlling the system for producing water a second PCB a host control processor which communicates with the machine control processor and includes the user interface controls and controls for the remote agent subsystem described in more detail below including the logging system amongst other controls. A third PCB the power PCB may also be included which includes all of the controls for the power for the system. The power PCB also communicates with the machine control board. A forth PCB a personal computer PCB includes the controls for the personal computer and also communicates with the machine control board and the host control board. This electronics configuration may be beneficial desirable for many reasons including but not limited to where changes in the memory are desired because of e.g. software for the user interface only the host control board is affected and therefore only one board the host control board need be modified and or replaced. Additionally this configuration creates a modularized electronics system where systems may be custom fitted to particular locations. For example various locations may require a more robust user interface and or various modes of connectivity and various locations may require a very simple user interface. For example some locations may require Wi Fi while others do not. Thus the components for Wi Fi may be customized onto some host controls boards and not others to lower the expense where the function is not desired. Various versions of the host control board may be used depending on the systems ultimate location and therefore the other three PCBs would be identical and only the host control board would differ. Switching out one PCB to customize a system provides versatility and modularity to the system. Additionally the microprocessor on the machine control board may be smaller than the one used on the host control board. Thus by separating the two boards the expense for the machine control board may be less than the host control board because the machine control board may not require a large microprocessor. Additionally all of the heat dissipating devices may be placed on the power PCB. Thus this makes the system more efficient for managing heat in the PCBs. In some embodiments the power PCB may be mounted to a heat sink which in some embodiments may be an aluminum plate or other heat dissipating metal pressed onto the back of the electronics assembly which in some embodiments together with the electronics assembly sandwich the copper tube that feeds source water to the electronics control assembly to provide cooling to the electronics. This cooling fluid line also provides cooling to the power PCB. In some embodiments a heat sink temperature controller may be included in the system.

In various embodiments the system includes a heat sink valve . Thus as source water comes into the system the source water flows by the heat sink and in some instances when the mixing can valve is open and the heat sink valve is closed will flow to the mixing can . This provides a cooling loop for the system even when product water is not being made i.e. the water vapor distillation apparatus is not heating or running . However when the water vapor distillation apparatus is heating or running the source water comes into the system the source water flows by the heat sink and in some instances when the mixing can valve is closed and the heat sink valve is open will flow to the sump . Thus whether or not the system is in run or heat mode the electronics control module and the heat sink will be cooled by incoming source water.

In some embodiments the user interface may be a smart phone for example a QUALCOM based phone. In some embodiments the user interface may be a SAMSUNG Galaxy S4 however in various embodiments the smart phone may be any smart phone. The smart phone may be customizably programmed and attached to the system.

In various embodiments the system may include a tilt sensor which in some embodiments may be a 3 axis accelerometer. In some embodiments the tilt sensor may be positioned on the machine control processor. In some embodiments the system controls may not allow the water vapor distillation apparatus to run if the system does not meet a threshold level which the controls system receives from the tilt sensor.

Some embodiments of the system may include a GPS which in some embodiments may be located on the host control processor. This may be desirable for many reasons including but not limited to remotely tracking the location of the system and therefore in some embodiments changing thresholds and other controls based on the location of the system thereby responding to potentially different needs in response to different water and or climate conditions.

Referring now also to in various embodiments the can motor may be controlled based on the motor temperature. In various embodiments a controller receives the motor temperature and the output is the desired motor speed and then this runs through a controller limiter saturation max and min speed which yields the commanded motor speed . This is fed into the motor controller which drives the motor and then heat comes off the motor which is plugged onto the motor temperature . In various embodiments the controller may target 160 degrees Celsius as the motor temperature.

In some embodiments the temperature may remain constant but over time the motor speed may decrease due to decreased efficiency which may be present from time to time due to various conditions for example scaling. This controls method is beneficial desirable for many reasons including but not limited to if the motor speed were constant than the temperature would rise. This could create negative conditions for the system. Thus by maintaining a constant temperature the temperature does not reach a negative level but the motor speed decreases.

Referring now also to in various embodiments the system includes controls for the low pressure LP water temperature which refers to the water under low pressure i.e. the source water which is in the evaporator side of the evaporator condenser . The LP desired temperature is fed into the heater controller . Also an enable signal if fed into the heater controller . The output of the heater controller is heater duty cycle heater drive signal to and then this is limited heater limit which then controls the actual heater electronics . The LP temperature is reduced and it this is fed into the vent controller . The vent controller is enabled and a desired temperature is output as a vent valve command . The command is fed to the vent electronics which is fed back to the LP temperature desired temperature . The control of the heater and the vent is mutually exclusive. When the system is heating the vent is open to control the pressure within the system.

Referring now also to in various embodiments the system includes a product controller. The desired product water level is fed into the product level controller . The output is the product valve duty cycle . The product valve duty cycle is then fed into the valve electronics . The fluid flows to the desired level determined using the product level sensor assembly 

Referring now also to in various embodiments the system and in some embodiments there may be multiple systems devices included in a network this disclosure is not limited to single or multiple devices rather this method system network may be used with at least one system device communicates by way of a cell phone network Wi Fi Ethernet Modem 4G Iridium Satellite Modem or other satellite model and or any other mechanism to connect to the internet for example with at least one external manager through a cloud . However in some embodiments a single system device may communicate for example using a USB based communications link connection with one external manager . The at least one external managers may connect to the cloud using any communication mechanism including but not limited to web pages web based API and or SQL. In various embodiments the at least one external manager may include server pages analytic devices and or WaterView. In various embodiments the cloud may include at least one database and at least one cloud server.

As the data in the system device whether a single system or multiple systems devices on a network changes the data is written to a persistent file or log. In embodiments where the device systems are communicating through the internet at a pre determined time for example at 11 59 p.m. or at pre determined pre programmed intervals the communications connect to the internet and the system connects to the cloud . The data is uploaded moved to the cloud. The one or more external managers may download the data to a server and or a computer device and the data is therefore backed up both by the cloud and the one or more external managers .

Each time the data is updated the most up to date data and or state is uploaded into the live most recent state and the old state is moved to a history. At the end of an interval for example 24 hours of device system run the at least one external manager may review the data and determine if changes are needed etc. In various embodiments only changes in state data are logged. However in some embodiments for sensors valves etc. that may be constantly changing the system may log the data at a pre determined pre programmed interval e.g. every 5 minutes. Logging only the changes or logging data in intervals may be beneficial for many reasons including but not limited to transferring and or logging less data overall which is more efficient.

In various embodiments the at least one external manager either or may set the state for the systems devices.

In various embodiments for example the embodiment shown in the at least one systems devices may connect communicate with the cloud at pre programmed intervals e.g. every 2 hours. This is beneficial for many reasons including but not limited to the systems devices at all times which may decrease the opportunity for hacking into the systems devices and or compromising the systems devices . If one or more of the at least one external managers desires to connect to one or more systems device at a given time that is outside when the at least one systems device are connected to the cloud the at least one external manager may shoulder tap the cloud and communicate to the cloud that the at least one external manager wants to communicate with one or more systems devices . The cloud may send a text message to the at least one or more systems device that tells the at least one or more systems devices to connect to the cloud . This configuration may be beneficial for many reasons including but not limited to conserving bandwidth as the at least one external managers do not have of stay connected to the cloud or the at least one systems devices all the time rather only when it is necessary.

This network communications configuration may be used for remotely controlling and or remotely monitoring the one or more systems devices . Additionally This network communications configuration may be used for downloading remotely software updates and or reconfiguring one or more systems devices .
