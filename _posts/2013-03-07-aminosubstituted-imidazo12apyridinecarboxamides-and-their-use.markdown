The present application relates to novel substituted imidazo 1 2 a pyridine 3 carboxamides to processes for their preparation to their use alone or in combinations for the treatment and or prophylaxis of diseases and to their use for preparing medicaments for the treatment and or prophylaxis of diseases in particular for the treatment and or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders.

One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate cGMP . Together with nitric oxide NO which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals it forms the NO cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyse the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate GTP . The representatives of this family disclosed to date can be divided both according to structural features and according to the type of ligands into two groups the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one haem per heterodimer which is part of the regulatory site. The latter is of central importance for the mechanism of activation. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of haem and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Haem free preparations cannot by contrast be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide CO is also able to attach to the central iron atom of haem but the stimulation by CO is distinctly less than that by NO.

Through the production of cGMP and the regulation resulting therefrom of phosphodiesterases ion channels and protein kinases guanylate cyclase plays a crucial part in various physiological processes in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in platelet aggregation and adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission and in disorders caused by an impairment of the aforementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions the NO cGMP system may be suppressed which may lead for example to high blood pressure platelet activation increased cellular proliferation endothelial dysfunction atherosclerosis angina pectoris heart failure myocardial infarction thromboses stroke and sexual dysfunction.

A possible way of treating such disorders which is independent of NO and aims at influencing the cGMP signaling pathway in organisms is a promising approach because of the high efficiency and few side effects which are to be expected.

Compounds such as organic nitrates whose effect is based on NO have to date been exclusively used for the therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase. NO is produced by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attaching to the central iron atom of haem. Besides the side effects the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment.

Over the last years a number of substances which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly. i.e. without prior release of NO have been described for example 3 5 hydroxymethyl 2 furyl 1 benzylindazole YC 1 Wu et al. 84 1994 4226 M lsch et al. 120 1997 681 fatty acids Goldberg et al. 252 1977 1279 diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate Pettibone et al. 116 1985 307 isoliquiritigenin Yu et al. 114 1995 1587 and also various substituted pyrazole derivatives WO 98 16223 .

The contraction force is recorded with Statham UC2 cells amplified and digitized via an A D converter DAS 1802 HC Keithley Instruments Munich and recorded in parallel on a continuous line recorder. To produce contraction phenylephrine is added to the bath cumulatively in increasing concentration. After several control cycles the test substance is added in increasing dosage in each subsequent pass and the level of contraction is compared with the level of contraction reached in the immediately preceding pass. This is used for calculating the concentration that is required to reduce the level of the control value by 50 ICvalue . The standard application volume is 5 l and the proportion of DMSO in the bath solution corresponds to 0.1 .

Male Wistar rats having a body weight of 300 350 g are anaesthetized with thiopental 100 mg kg i.p. . After tracheotomy a catheter for measuring the blood pressure is introduced into the femoral artery. The substances to be tested are administered as solutions either orally by gavage or intravenously via the femoral vein Stasch et al. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002 135 344 355 .

The blood pressure measurement on awake rats described below uses a commercially available telemetry system from the company DATA SCIENCES INTERNATIONAL DSI USA.

The telemetry system provides continuous acquisition of blood pressure heart rate and body movement on awake animals in their usual living space.

The investigations are carried out on adult female spontaneously hypertensive rats SHR Okamoto with a body weight of 200 g. SHR NCrl from Okamoto Kyoto School of Medicine 1963 were crossed from male Wistar Kyoto rats with greatly increased blood pressure and females with slightly raised blood pressure and were delivered in F13 to the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

After transmitter implantation the experimental animals are kept individually in Makrolon cages type 3. They have free access to standard feed and water.

The day night rhythm in the testing laboratory is alternated by the room lighting at 06 00 hours in the morning and at 19 00 hours in the evening.

The TA11 PA C40 telemetry transmitters used are implanted surgically in the experimental animals under aseptic conditions at least 14 days before the first test. The animals provided with this instrumentation can be used again after the wound has healed and the implant has become incorporated.

For implantation the fasting animals are anaesthetized with pentobarbital Nembutal Sanofi 50 mg kg i.p. and are shaved and disinfected on a wide area of the abdomen. After opening the abdominal cavity along the linea alba the liquid filled measuring catheter of the system is inserted above the bifurcation in the cranial direction into the aorta descendens and secured with tissue adhesive VetBonD 3M . The transmitter housing is fixed intraperitoneally on the abdominal wall musculature and the wound is closed layer by layer.

Postoperatively an antibiotic is administered to prevent infection Tardomyocel COMP Bayer 1 ml kg s.c. 

Unless described otherwise the test substances are in each case administered orally by stomach tube to a group of animals n 6 . Corresponding to an application volume of 5 ml kg body weight the test substances are dissolved in suitable solvent mixtures or suspended in 0.5 Tylose.

The present telemetry measuring device is configured for 24 animals. Each test is recorded under a test number Vtest year month day .

The instrumented rats living in the unit are each assigned their own receiving antenna 1010 Receiver DSI .

The implanted transmitters can be activated from outside by an in built magnetic switch. They are switched to transmission at the start of the tests. The signals emitted can be recorded online by a data acquisition system Dataquest A.R.T. for WINDOWS DSI and processed appropriately. The data are saved in each case to a folder opened for this which bears the test number.

Recording of the measured values is repeated at 5 minute intervals under computer control. The source data recorded as absolute value are corrected in the diagram with the currently measured barometric pressure Ambient Pressure Reference Monitor APR 1 and saved in individual data. Further technical details can be found in the extensive documentation of the manufacturer DSI .

Unless described otherwise the test substances are administered on the test day at 09.00 hours. Following application the parameters described above are measured for 24 hours.

After the end of the test the individual data recorded are sorted with the analysis software DATAQUEST A.R.T. ANALYSIS . The 2 hours before application are taken as the blank value here so that the selected data set comprises the period from 07 00 hours on the test day to 09 00 hours on the next day.

The data are smoothed for a pre settable time by mean value determination 15 minute average and transferred as text file to a storage medium. The pre sorted and compressed measured values are transferred to Excel templates and presented as tables. The data recorded are saved per test day in a specific folder which bears the test number. Results and test protocols are filed in folders sorted in paper form by numbers.
