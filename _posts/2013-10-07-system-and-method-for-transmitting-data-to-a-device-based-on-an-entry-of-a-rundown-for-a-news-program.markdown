The present disclosure claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 885 944 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING DATA TO A DEVICE BASED ON AN ENTRY OF A RUNDOWN FOR A NEWS PROGRAM which was filed on Oct. 2 2013 and which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.

The present disclosure also relates to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 047 805 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING A PACKET STREAM TO A DEVICE which is assigned to the assignee of the present disclosure which is being filed simultaneously with the present disclosure and which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.

Throughout this application with respect to all reasonable derivatives of such terms and unless otherwise specified and or unless the particular context clearly dictates otherwise each usage of a or an means at least one and each usage of the means the at least one.

Unless otherwise indicated herein the materials described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this disclosure and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.

A news production system NPS may facilitate the production of a news program in the form of a media stream. In one example an NPS may include multiple media sources and a production switcher where outputs of the media sources are connected to inputs of the production switcher. This may allow the production switcher to switch between and or combine multiple media streams output by the media sources thereby outputting the news program in the form of another media stream.

There are various types of media including for example audio video or a combination thereof. As such in one example an NPS may output a news program in the form of an audio stream. In this instance the NPS may transmit the audio stream to a radio broadcasting system for broadcast. As another example a media stream may take the form of a video stream or a combined audio and video stream. In such instances the NPS may transmit the video stream or the combined audio and video stream to a television broadcasting system for broadcast.

A media source may take a variety of forms. For example a media source may take the form of a media server. A media server is a device configured for retrieving a media file converting the retrieved media file into a media stream and outputting the converted media stream.

As another example a media source may take the form of a media effect engine. A media effect engine is a device configured for retrieving a media effect sometimes referred to as a page and running the media effect thereby outputting a corresponding media stream. A media effect may be stored as a file that includes instructions and other data e.g. media related to the media effect. By running the media effect the media effect engine may generate and output a media stream based on those instructions. Media effects are commonly used as a means to generate animations graphics or other visual effects in the form of a media stream that can be overlaid on another media stream. For instance in the context of a news program a lower third media effect may be used to overlay a graphic over a lower third portion of a media stream.

As such in one example NPS a media server may output a first media stream while a media effect engine outputs a second media stream and a production switcher may combine the two media streams e.g. by overlaying the second media stream over the first media stream to output the news program in the form of a third media stream. The production switcher may then transmit the third media stream to a broadcasting system e.g. a television broadcasting system for broadcast.

A media effect engine may be controlled in a variety of ways such that it may perform the steps of retrieving a media effect and running the media effect. For instance a user may control a media effect engine by providing it a suitable instruction via a user interface. However for a variety of reasons this manner of controlling the media effect engine may be undesirable. Among other things this process may be time consuming for the user. In addition it may be difficult for the user to ensure that the media effect engine performs such steps at appropriate times during production of the news program.

As another example a controller device may control a media effect engine by providing it a suitable instruction in accordance with one or more application programming interfaces API that may be made publically available by the provider of the media effect engine or another entity. However again for a variety of reasons this manner of controlling the media effect engine may be undesirable. Among other things it may be time consuming for a user to configure the controller device to provide such a suitable instruction.

This approach may be particularly time consuming given that different instructions may need to adhere to different APIs. For instance an instruction requesting the running of one type of media effect may need to adhere to a different API than another instruction requesting the running of another type of media effect. In addition it may be difficult for the user to configure the controller device such that it causes the media effect engine to retrieve and run a particular media effect at an appropriate time during production of the news program.

In one aspect an example method involves i a first device recording data transmitted from a second device to a third device ii assigning an identifier to the recorded data iii selecting an entry from a rundown including entries indicative of a sequence of events related to a news program iv making a determination that the selected entry is associated with the assigned identifier and v responsive to making the determination causing the recorded data to be transmitted to the third device.

In another aspect an example method involves i selecting an entry from a rundown including entries indicative of a sequence of events related to a news program ii making a determination that the selected entry is associated with an identifier assigned to a recording of data transmitted from a first device to a second device and iii responsive to making the determination causing a third device to send the recorded data to the second device.

In another aspect a method involves i a first device recording data transmitted from a second device to a third device ii using the recorded data to generate data that is a modified version of the recorded data iii assigning an identifier to the generated data iv selecting an entry from a rundown comprising entries indicative of a sequence of events related to a news program v making a determination that the selected entry is associated with the assigned identifier and vi responsive to making the determination causing the generated data to be transmitted to the third device.

In another aspect an example method involves i selecting an entry from a rundown including entries indicative of a sequence of events related to a news program ii making a determination that the selected entry is associated with an identifier assigned to data generated based on a recording of data transmitted from a first device to a second device and iii responsive to making the determination causing a third device to send the generated data to the second device.

These as well as other aspects advantages and alternatives will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reading the following detailed description with reference where appropriate to the accompanying drawings.

As noted above a media effect engine may be configured for retrieving a media effect and running the media effect thereby outputting a media stream. However before the media effect engine may retrieve a media effect the media effect must first be designed and stored. A media effect designer may be used for this purpose.

A media effect designer is a device configured for designing and storing a media effect. Like a media effect engine a media effect designer may be controlled in a variety of ways. For instance a user may control a media effect designer by providing it a suitable instruction via a user interface. As such in an instance where a media effect takes the form of a file including instructions and other data the media effect designer may create or edit that file based on instructions received from a user.

In some instances a media effect designer may cause the media effect designer to retrieve and run a media effect on a preview channel of the media effect engine. This may involve the media effect designer transmitting to the media effect engine a suitable instruction that causes the media effect engine to retrieve and run the media effect on the preview channel. Typically such an instruction does not adhere to the APIs discussed above. But instead the instruction typically adheres to a particular protocol that is understood by both the media effect designer and the media effect engine but that is not made publically available by the provider of the media effect engine or another entity.

In an example of the disclosed system and method the instruction transmitted from the media effect designer to the media effect engine may be leveraged to allow a spoofing device to control the media effect engine at a later time. This may involve the spoofing device recording data transmitted from the media effect designer to the media effect engine assigning an identifier to the recorded data later recalling the recorded data based on an indication of the assigned identifier and transmitting the recorded data to the media effect engine. With this technique a device other than the media effect designer may cause the media effect engine to retrieve and run the media effect all without the device transmitting to the media effect engine an instruction that adheres to one of the APIs as discussed above.

In addition a scheduling system may be configured to cause the spoofing device to perform such functions based on an entry in a rundown. Generally a rundown is a schedule of events and related information that make up a news program. Based on a rundown entry being associated with the assigned identifier the scheduling system may cause the media effect engine to retrieve and run the media effect. This may involve the scheduling system selecting an entry from the rundown the scheduling system making a determination that the selected entry corresponds to the assigned identifier and responsive to the scheduling system making the determination the scheduling system causing the spoofing device to transmit the recorded data to the media effect engine.

The scheduling system may also be configured to select and process rundown entries in order. As such a user may control the timing as to when the media effect engine retrieves and runs a particular media effect by ensuring that the corresponding assigned identifier is associated with a particular rundown entry.

The NPS may include one or more devices including for example a media source a media effect designer a media effect engine a data storage a spoofing device a production switcher and a scheduling system .

These devices may be connected with each other and or with external devices via one or more communication paths. For example the media source and the production switcher may be connected via a path the media effect designer and the data storage may be connected via a path and the media effect engine and the data storage may be connected via a path .

In addition the media effect designer and the media effect engine may be connected via a path the media effect engine and the production switcher may be connected via the path and the spoofing device and the path may be connected via a path . Still further the spoofing device and the scheduling system may be connected via a path the scheduling system and the production system may be connected via a path and the production system and an external device e.g. a router of a broadcasting system may be connected via a path .

Though these communication paths a device may transmit various types of data to one or more other devices. For example one device may transmit instructions to a second device to control the second device. As another example one device may transit a media stream to another device. Notably such devices may exchange data according to one or more standards or protocols. For example one device may send data to another device in the form of a packet stream.

Generally the media source is a device configured for outputting a media stream and may take a variety of forms. For example the media source may take the form of a media server which is a device configured for retrieving a media file converting the retrieved media file into a media stream and outputting the converted media stream. An example of a media server is the K2 server provided by Grass Valley of San Francisco Calif. As additional examples the media source may take the form of a satellite receiver or a video camera. As the media source outputs a media stream the media source may transmit the media stream to the production switcher via the path .

Generally the media effect designer is a device configured for designing and storing a media effect. The media effect designer may design a media effect based on input received from a user via a user interface. Then the media effect designer may store the media effect in the data storage such as in the form of a file. An example of a media effect designer is the Viz Artist provided by Vizrt of Bergen Norway.

Generally the media effect engine is a type of media source and is a device configured for retrieving a media effect and running the retrieved media effect thereby outputting a corresponding media stream. The media effect engine may retrieve a media effect from the data storage . And as the media effect engine outputs a media stream the media effect engine may transmit the media stream to the production switcher via the path . An example of a media effect engine is the Viz Video Engine provided by Vizrt of Bergen Norway.

As noted above the media effect designer may be configured for transmitting to the media effect engine instructions that cause the media effect engine to retrieve and run a media effect on a preview channel of the media effect engine . This allows a user to preview the media effect as the user is designing it.

Generally the spoofing device is configured for recording data and transmitting the recorded data or a modified version thereof to another device. For instance the spoofing device may be configured for recording data transmitted from the media effect designer to the media effect engine such as via path the spoofing device may access this data via the path . In one example the path may be a path of a packet based network and the path may provide the spoofing device with access to that network such that the spoofing device may monitor packet transmission over the network. Further the spoofing device may be configured for transmitting the recorded data or a modified version thereof to the media effect engine such as via the paths and . In one example the spoofing device may provide such functionality by running a network protocol analyzer and or a packet generator application such as Sniffer Portable Professional Analyzer provided by NetScout of Westford Mass.

Generally the production switcher is a device configured for performing functions related to input to output mapping. For instance the production switcher may be configured for switching between and or combining multiple media streams output by the media sources and and transmitted to the production switcher via paths and respectively so the production switcher may output a news program in the form of a media stream. The production switcher may transmit this media stream to an external device such as a router of a broadcasting system via the path . Note that this media stream may be subjected to additional processing before being broadcast. For example the media stream may be modified with a digital video effect DVE before being broadcast. An example of a production switcher is the Vision switcher provided by Ross Video of Iroquois Ontario in Canada.

Generally the scheduling system is a device configured for performing functions related to scheduling and managing the production of a news program and for controlling one or more other devices in the NPS . For example the scheduling system may be configured for creating or editing a rundown based on input from a user via a user interface. Further the scheduling system may be configured for traversing and processing entries in a rundown. Yet further the scheduling system may be configured for controlling the spoofing device via path and the production switcher via path .

The device may include various components including for example a user interface a communication interface a processor and a data storage all of which may be electronically connected to each other via a system bus or other connection mechanism . Note that the device need not include all of these components and it may include additional components.

The user interface may function to allow the device to interact with a user such as to receive input from a user and to provide output to the user. Thus the user interface may include input components such as a computer mouse a keyboard or a touch sensitive panel. The user interface may also include output components such as a display screen which for example may be combined with a touch sensitive panel or a speaker.

The communication interface may function to allow the device to communicate with one or more other devices e.g. over one or more paths as described above . The communication interface may be configured to transmit and or receive various types of data including for example control data or media stream data. In one example the communication interface may take the form of a wired interface such as an Ethernet port USB port or HD SDI port. As another example the communication interface may take the form of a wireless interface such as a WiFi interface. In either case the communication interface may include communication input and or communication output interfaces.

The processor may include one or more general purpose processors e.g. microprocessors and or one or more special purpose processors e.g. digital signal processors DSPs .

The data storage may include one or more volatile and or non volatile storage components such as magnetic optical flash or organic storage and may be integrated in whole or in part with the processor . The data storage may include removable and or non removable components. In some examples the data storage may include multiple storage drives that store data in a redundant and or stripped configuration.

Generally the processor may be configured to execute program instructions e.g. compiled or non compiled program logic and or machine code stored in the data storage to perform one or more of the steps described herein and or shown in the accompanying drawings. As such the data storage may take the form of a non transitory computer readable storage medium having stored thereon program instructions that upon execution by the processor cause the device to perform one or more of the steps described herein and or shown in the accompanying drawings.

Note that throughout this disclosure numerical modifiers e.g. first or second are used to establish unique terms for ease of reference as opposed to indicating a particular characteristic e.g. position or order of the modified term.

The data being recorded may take various forms. For example the data may take the form of a packet stream. Also the data may represent various types of information. For example the data may represent an instruction related to a media effect that the media effect designer is previewing. For instance the data may represent an instruction that causes the media effect engine to retrieve and run the media effect thereby outputting a corresponding media stream. Notably in some instances the data may represent additional instructions such as instructions that cause the media effect engine to load or mount the media effect. Such instructions may differ depending on the configuration of the media effect designer and or the media effect engine .

At block the method may involve assigning an identifier to the recorded data. For instance the method may involve the spoofing device assigning an effect identifier to the recorded data. Notably the steps at blocks and may be repeated for multiple different media effects being previewed by the media effect designer .

As shown in in one example each portion or set of recorded data and the corresponding assigned effect identifier may be stored as a separate record in a table . For example the table may include a first record having a first set of recorded data and a corresponding identifier E i.e. indicating that the effect identifier Ewas assigned to the first set of recorded data . Likewise the table may include a second record having a second set of recorded data and a corresponding identifier E and the table may include a third record having a third set of recorded data and a corresponding identifier E. Notably such data may be stored in alternative manners as well.

Once an effect identifier is assigned to recorded data as shown in the effect identifier may be associated with an entry in a rundown. For example though an interface of the scheduling system a user may edit a script e.g. PHP script of a rundown entry to refer to the assigned effect identifier.

Note that the attributes described above may be represented in a variety of different manners. It should also be noted that the rundown has been greatly simplified for the purposes of providing examples of the disclosed system and method. In practice a rundown is likely although not required to include significantly more data. For example rundown entries may include additional attributes including for example an index or page number not to be confused with the same term commonly used to refer to a media effect an estimated duration an actual duration and or an author. However as noted above for the sake of simplicity the simplified rundown is provided herein.

Returning to at block the method may involve selecting an entry from a rundown including entries indicative of a sequence of events related to a news program. For instance the method may involve the scheduling system selecting the entry from the rundown . Recall that a scheduling system may be configured to select and process rundown entries in order. As such the scheduling system may select the entry as part of the scheduling system s traversal of the entries in the rundown .

At block the method may involve making a determination that the selected entry is associated with the assigned identifier. For instance the method may involve the scheduling system making a determination that the selected entry is associated with the identifier E. The scheduling system may make this determination by determining that a script of the selected rundown entry includes a reference to the assigned effect identifier.

At block the method may involve responsive to making the determination causing the recorded data to be transmitted to the third device. For instance the method may involve responsive to the scheduling system making the determination the scheduling system causing the spoofing device to transmit the first set of recorded data in the table to the media effect engine thereby causing the media effect engine to retrieve and run the corresponding media effect.

In one example the step at block may involve the scheduling system executing a script of the selected rundown entry thereby causing the spoofing device to transmit the recorded data to the media effect engine . The scheduling system may cause the spoofing device to perform this step by sending the spoofing device a suitable instruction e.g. via the path .

As illustrated by the tables in a user may control the timing as to when the media effect engine retrieves and runs a particular media effect by ensuring that the corresponding assigned effect identifier is associated with a particular rundown entry. Note that in response to selecting a particular rundown entry the scheduling system may cause one or more other steps to be performed at or about the same time the corresponding media effect is run. For instance upon selecting each rundown entry the scheduling system may cause the media source to output a respective clip in the form of a media stream and may further set the input to output mappings of the production switcher such that the production switcher may combine a first media stream output by the media source and a second media stream output by the media effect to thereby output the news program in the form of a third media stream.

As described above with this technique a device e.g. the spoofing device other than the media effect designer may cause the media effect engine to retrieve and run a media effect all without the device transmitting to the media effect engine an instruction that adheres to one of the APIs as discussed above. Indeed since the spoofing device records data being sent to the media effect engine and then later sends that same data or a modified version thereof to the media effect engine there is no need to control the media effect engine using those APIs.

At block the method may involve making a determination that the selected entry corresponds to an identifier assigned to a recording of data transmitted from a first device to a second device. For instance the method may involve the scheduling system making a determination that the selected entry corresponds to an identifier assigned to a recording of data transmitted from the media effect designer to the media effect engine .

At block the method may involve responsive to making the determination causing a third device to transmit the recorded data to the second device. For instance the method may involve responsive to the scheduling system making the determination the scheduling system causing the spoofing device to transmit the recorded data to the media effect engine .

Also it should be noted that in either of the example methods described above the recorded data may be modified before being sent to the media effect engine . For instance the recorded data may be modified to refer to a different media effect or to modify a parameter used in connection with the media effect. For example this may involve modifying a text portion of the recorded data that is used in connection with the media effect. In one example the method may involve using the recorded data to generate new data i.e. data that is a modified version of the recorded data such that the generated data may be sent to the media effect engine.

At block the method may involve using the recorded data to generate data that is a modified version of the recorded data. For instance the method may involve the spoofing device using the recorded data to generate data that is a modified version of the recorded data e.g. based on user input .

At block the method may involve assigning an identifier to the generated data. For instance the method may involve the spoofing device assigning an effect identifier to the generated data.

At block the method may involve selecting an entry from a rundown including entries indicative of a sequence of events related to a news program. For instance the method may involve the scheduling system selecting an entry from a rundown.

At block the method may involve making a determination that the selected entry is associated with the assigned identifier. For instance the method may involve the scheduling system making a determination that the selected entry is associated with the assigned effect identifier.

At block the method may involve responsive to making the determination causing the generated data to be transmitted to the third device. For instance the method may involve responsive to the scheduling system making the determination the scheduling system causing the generated data to be transmitted to the media effect engine .

In some instances since the generated data is a modified version of the recorded data the media effect engine may have issues with processing the generated data. The cross referenced disclosure addresses this issue in greater detail and further provides a technique for addressing this issue.

At block the method may involve making a determination that the selected entry corresponds to an identifier assigned to data generated based on a recording of data transmitted from a first device to a second device. For instance the method may involve the scheduling system making a determination that the selected entry corresponds to an effect identifier assigned to data generated based on a recording of data transmitted from the media effect designer to the media effect engine .

At block the method may involve responsive to making the determination causing a third device to transmit the generated data to the second device. For instance the method may involve responsive to the scheduling system making the determination the scheduling system causing the spoofing device to transmit the generated data to the media effect engine .

While one or more steps have been described as being performed by certain devices or entities e.g. the spoofing device or the scheduling system the steps may be performed by any device or entity such as those included in the NPS described above. As just one example the step at block may involve the spoofing device making a determination that the selected entry corresponds to an identifier assigned to a recording of data transmitted from a first device to a second device and the step at block may involve responsive to the spoofing device making the determination the spoofing device transmitting the recorded data to the media effect engine .

Also the steps need not be performed in the disclosed order although in some examples an order may be preferred. And not all steps need to be performed to achieve the desired advantages of the disclosed system and method and therefore not all steps are required.

It should also be noted that the variations described in connection with select examples of the disclosed system and method may be applied to all other examples of the disclosed system or method.

Further while select examples of the disclosed system and method have been described alterations and permutations of these examples will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. Other changes substitutions and alterations are also possible without departing from the disclosed system and method in its broader aspects as set forth in the following claims.
