title: Overlaying photographs with text on a social networking system
abstract: When a social networking system receives an image and associated text for presentation to one or more users, the social networking system determines how to present the text and the image. For example, the social networking system determines if to overlay the text onto an area of the image. A readability score indicating the readability of the text if overlaid onto an area of the image is determined based on attributes of the image and of the text. Using the readability score, the social networking system overlays the text onto an area of the image when presented to other users or presents the text adjacent to the image when presented to other users.

This invention relates generally to social networking systems and in particular to overlaying text onto photographs presented on a social networking system.

A social networking system allows users to connect to and communicate with other social networking system users. Users create profiles on the social networking system that include information about the users such as interests and demographic information. The users may be individuals or entities such as corporations or charities. The increasing popularity of social networking systems and the significant amount of user specific information maintained by social networking systems make a social networking system an ideal forum for users share content such as photographs or text content with other users. This sharing of content allows users to share their interests and experiences with other users.

Conventionally social networking systems allow users to post content about themselves and other users for presentation by the social networking system. Content posted to a social networking system may include text and or images associated with a user providing the content. For example a user provides content to the social networking system indicating that it was at a specific location by checking in at the location and uploading a photograph taken at the location. The content provided by the user is presented to other social networking system users.

If content provided by the user includes an image as well as text the text may be presented adjacent to the image or overlaid onto the image. While overlaying text on an image may conserve space or enhance the aesthetic display of the content text that is overlaid onto an image may be difficult to read because of the image content. In some cases details in the image such as areas of highly contrasting colors may obscure the text. For example it may be difficult to read text overlaid onto a photograph of a zebra due to the highly contrasting colors of a zebra s stripes. Additionally text overlaid onto an image may obstruct details in the image such as faces other text included in the image photograph or other important content in the photograph. Hence while overlaying text onto a photograph may be desirable in general in many cases it should be avoided.

Social networking systems allow users to upload images such as photographs and associated text for presentation to other social networking system users. For example images and text received from a user may be included in stories presented to other social networking system users. The stories may be presented individually or in a feed e.g. a newsfeed or a timeline associated with a user to other users. For example a user provides a photograph taken with friends at a theme park along with a text description of the photograph in a status update provided to the social networking system. A story including the photograph and text is presented by the social networking system to other social networking system users connected to the user. To allow users to more easily read the content presented by the story the social networking system determines whether to overlay text included in a story with an image included in the story.

When presenting stories including text and images to users the social networking system evaluates factors associated with the images and text to determine whether to overlay the text onto the images. The social networking system calculates a score readability score associated with each image and accompanying text in a story. If a readability score for an image and its associated text satisfies a condition such as having at least a threshold value the text is overlaid on the associated image when presented in the story. However if the readability score for an image and its associated text does not satisfy the condition e.g. is less than the threshold value the story presents the text adjacent to the associated image.

Various attributes of an image may be used when determining a readability score for an image and associated text. For example text overlaid onto original photographs is generally more visible for reading than text overlaid onto images that have been digitally altered i.e. synthetic images . Hence a readability score accounts for whether or not an image is a synthetic image. Various factors may determine whether an image is a synthetic image for example homogeneity of areas of the image location tags in the image and detection of pre existing text in the image metadata associated with the image indicating the image has been digitally altered or other suitable factors may determine whether an image is a synthetic image. Other factors for determining a readability score include the likelihood that faces in the image will be obscured by overlaying text onto the image the length of the text associated with the image the resolution of the image and the dimensions of the image.

In one embodiment determination of whether to overlay text on an image is manually performed by an administrator of the social networking system. Multiple images e.g. an album may be scored together to determine whether to overlay text across one or more images within the album. Additionally an image may be cropped and or text may be truncated and the cropped image and or truncated text may be considered when determining readability scores.

The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.

A social networking system allows its users to create posts including both images and text for presentation to other social networking system users. For example a story describing a post is presented to various social networking system users. When presenting a story describing a post including text and an image the social networking system determines whether to present the text adjacent to the image or overlaying the image. If the social networking system determines that the text is readable when overlaid onto the image the text and image the text is overlaid on the image to form a composite image that is displayed. However if the social networking system determines that the text is not readable when overlaid onto the image the social networking system presents the text and image as separate items for example the text is displayed adjacent to the image.

To determine whether text is readable when overlaid onto an image the social networking system computes a readability score for a combination of text and an image. The readability score describes the ease with which text may be read by a user when overlaid onto different areas of the image. In one embodiment a higher readability score indicates that the text is more likely to be readable by the user if overlaid onto an area of the image and vice versa. If the readability score for a combination of text and an image satisfies a condition e.g. has at least a threshold value the text is overlaid onto an area of the image when the text and image are presented to a user. If the readability score does not satisfy the condition e.g. it is below the threshold value the text and the image are separately presented. For example the text is presented adjacent to the image. The readability score may also be used determine an area of the image over which the text is overlaid e.g. top bottom side etc . Various factors may be used to determine the readability score for a combination of an image and text. Examples of factors include the likelihood that faces in the image will be obscured by overlaying the image with text metadata associated with the image indicating that the image has been digitally altered homogeneity of areas of the image existence of location tags in the image detection of text in the image the length of the text the resolution of the image and the dimensions of the image.

In one embodiment multiple images such as images included in an album are scored together. Additionally images may be cropped when the readability score is being determined so factors associated with the cropped images are used to determine the readability score. Further text may be may be truncated during the scoring process so the factors used to determine the readability score are based on the truncated text and the image. In some embodiments the determination of whether to overlay text over an image is performed manually.

The client devices comprise one or more computing devices capable of receiving input as well as transmitting and or receiving data via the network . In one embodiment a client device is a conventional computer system such as a desktop or laptop computer. In another embodiment a client device may be a device having computer functionality such as a personal digital assistant PDA a tablet computer a mobile telephone a smart phone or similar device. A client device is configured to communicate via the network . In one embodiment a client device executes an application allowing a user of the client device to interact with the social networking system . For example a client device executes a browser application to enable interaction between the client device and the social networking system via the network . In another embodiment a client device interacts with the social networking system through an application programming interface API that runs on the native operating system of the client device such as IOS or ANDROID .

The client devices are configured to communicate information via the network which may comprise any combination of local area and or wide area networks using both wired and wireless communication systems. In one embodiment the network uses standard communications technologies and or protocols. Thus the network may include communication channels using technologies such as Ethernet 802.11 worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX 3G 4G code division multiple access CDMA digital subscriber line DSL or other suitable communication technologies. The network may use any suitable networking protocol or combination of networking protocols such as multiprotocol label switching MPLS transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP User Datagram Protocol UDP hypertext transport protocol HTTP simple mail transfer protocol SMTP and file transfer protocol FTP . Data exchanged over the network may be represented using technologies and or formats including hypertext markup language HTML or extensible markup language XML or any other suitable format. In addition all or some of the communication channels may be encrypted using conventional encryption technologies such as secure sockets layer SSL transport layer security TLS and Internet Protocol security IPsec . The third party website may be coupled to the network for communicating with the social networking system which is further described below in conjunction with .

Each user of the social networking system is associated with a user account and each user account is typically associated with a single user profile stored in the user profile store . A user profile includes declarative information about the user that was explicitly shared by the user and may also include profile information inferred by the social networking system . A user profile may include multiple data fields each data field describing one or more attributes of the corresponding user of the social networking system . Hence information stored in the user profile store describes characteristics of the users of the social networking system including biographic demographic and other types of descriptive information such as work experience educational history gender hobbies or preferences location and any other suitable information. User profile information may also include data describing one or more relationships between a user and other users. Additionally the user profile store may also store other information provided by the user for example images videos or other objects objects associated with a user and stored in a user profile may be organized into collections which are further described herein. A user profile in the user profile store may also maintain references to actions performed by the corresponding user that are stored in the action store .

While user profiles are frequently associated with individuals user profiles may also be stored for entities such as businesses or organizations. This allows an entity to establish a presence on the social networking system for connecting to other social networking system users and for exchanging content with other social networking system users. While an administrator or individual associated with the entity creates the user profile for the entity the entity is identified as the account holder associated with the user profile. The entity may post information about itself about its products including catalogs of products or provide other information to users of the social networking system using a brand page associated with the entity s user profile. Other users of the social networking system may connect to the brand page to receive information posted to the brand page or to receive information associated with the brand page. A user profile associated with the brand page may include information about the entity itself providing users with background data or other information about the entity.

The action logger receives communications describing user actions internal to and or external to the social networking system and populates the action store with information describing the user actions. Such actions may include for example adding a connection to another user sending a message to another user uploading an image reading a message from another user viewing content associated with another user attending an event posted by another user among others. In addition a number of actions described in connection with other objects are directed at particular users so these actions are associated with those users as well. These actions are stored in the action log . Some actions may be performed by users while not connected to the social networking system and these actions are logged and communicated to the social networking system when a connection is established.

The action store maintains information describing actions by social networking system users internal to the social networking system as well as actions performed via third party websites that communicate information to the social networking system . Users may interact with various objects maintained by the social networking system and these interactions are stored in the action store . Examples of actions stored by the action store include commenting on posts sharing links and checking in to physical locations via a mobile device or other client device . Additional examples of interactions with objects on the social networking system included in the action store include commenting on a photo album communications between users becoming a fan of a musician adding an event to a calendar joining groups becoming a fan of a brand page creating an event authorizing an application using an application interacting with an advertisement collecting a product and engaging in a transaction.

The interface generator generates one more interfaces allowing users to interact with the social networking system . For example the interface generator generates one or more web pages including content from the social networking system such as images video profile information or other data. The interface generator also generates one or more interfaces for receiving information from social networking system users via a client device and the network . For example the interface generator generates a form for a user to provide the social networking system with biographic information for creating a user profile. When another user requests a profile page including information describing a user the interface generator retrieves data from the user profile store and generates a representation of the information in the user profile for presentation by a client device .

The interface generator also generates a post interface allowing users to provide content to the social networking system for presentation to other social networking system users. For example the post interface allows a user to create a post of content including text and or image data when checking in at a location or when updating his status. The post interface may display options allowing a user to provide text to the social networking system or to upload an image a video audio data or other information to the social networking system for inclusion in a post of content presented to other social networking system users. When content is received from a user the interface generator generates a story describing the content and identifying the user providing the content and the generated story may be presented to other social networking system users. For example the story is included in newsfeeds including multiple stories that are presented to various users connected to the user providing the content the story is included in a timeline describing content received from the user providing the content or the story is presented to social networking system users through any suitable channel. A story may be presented with interface elements allowing users presented with the story to interact with the story by interacting with the interface elements e.g. share the story comment on the story express a preference for the story etc. Presentation of content via a story is further described below in conjunction with .

The edge store includes information describing connections between users and other objects on the social networking system as edges. Some edges may be defined by users allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example users may generate edges with other users that parallel the users real life relationships such as friends co workers partners and so forth. Establishing a connection to a user in a social networking system may allow more access to additional information about the user to which the connection was established. For example connected to each other may receive informational updates about each other such as stories describing actions performed by one of the users on the social networking system Other edges are generated when users interact with objects in the social networking system such as expressing interest in a page on the social networking system sharing a link with other users of the social networking system and commenting on posts made by other users of the social networking system .

The edge store stores information describing edges such as affinity scores for objects interests and other users. Affinity scores may be computed by the social networking system over time to approximate a user s affinity for an object interest and other users in the social networking system based on the actions performed by the user. A user s affinity may be computed by the social networking system over time to approximate a user s affinity for an object interest and other users in the social networking system based on the actions performed by the user. Computation of affinity is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 978 265 filed on Dec. 23 2010 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Multiple interactions between a user and a specific object may be stored in one edge object in the edge store in one embodiment. In some embodiments connections between users may be stored in the user profile store or the user profile store may access the edge store to determine connections between users.

The object store stores information about content maintained by the social networking system . Different content items which represent individual pieces of content provided by the social networking system to users are stored as objects in the object store . Examples of objects include a page post a status update a photo a video a link a shared content item a gaming application achievement a check in event at a local business a brand page or any other type of content. Objects may be created by users of the social networking system such as status updates photos tagged by users to be associated with other objects in the social networking system events groups or applications. In some embodiments objects are received from third party applications or third party applications separate from the social networking system . An object in the object store may represent an entity existing within the social networking system e.g. an application available on the social networking system a virtual entity outside of the domain of the social networking system e.g. a website or a physical entity e.g. a sports team or a retail store .

The object store includes information for presenting a content item to a user. For example the object store includes a media item or data for executing an application. Alternatively the object store includes a pointer or a reference to a destination associated with an object such as the uniform resource locator URL of an external media item. Additionally the object store may also store metadata associated with an object such as a name describing the object e.g. Charles Williams for a page for a person Birthday Reminder for an application or Penguin Fanciers for a group an image representing the object e.g. a user profile picture or one or more tags assigned to the object by users e.g. text strings game crime and strategy for a strategy game application . Different types of metadata may be associated with different types of objects and a metadata associated with an object identifies the type of the object. For example user identifiers are associated with a group object a media type identifier e.g. video is associated with a media item object and a user identifier is associated with a user object.

The readability scoring module determines a measure of whether text associated with an image is likely to be readable by social networking system users when overlaid onto an area of the image and presented to social networking system users. In one embodiment the readability scoring module computes a readability score for a combination of text and an image for overlaying the text onto an area of the image. The readability score indicates the readability of the text when overlaid onto the image. In one embodiment a higher readability score indicates that the text is more likely to be readable by social networking systems when overlaid on the image. Based on the readability score of the combination of text and the image the interface generator presents the text overlaid onto the image or presents the text separate from the image in a story. If the readability scoring module determines that text may be overlaid onto more than one area of an image and be readable the readability scoring module may compare the readability scores for overlaying the text on the different areas of the image to select an area of the image over which to overlay the text. In the example shown by the readability scoring module includes an image detecting module a text detecting module a readability score calculator and a machine learning module .

The image detecting module identifies features of an image affecting the readability of text overlaid on the image these features are used when determining the readability scores for text overlaid on one or more areas of the image. Examples of features of an image include whether the image includes any faces or areas of homogeneity locations of faces or areas of homogeneity within the image whether the image is associated with metadata indicating that the image has been digitally altered whether the image is associated with one or more location tags dimensions of the image and the resolution of the image. To determine whether the image includes any areas of homogeneity the image detecting module determines the size of areas of an image having a threshold likelihood of being homogeneous color distribution over the areas and the magnitude of color contrast over the areas.

If text associated with an image is to be presented in a specific color the image detecting module determines the magnitude of color contrast between areas of the image and the associated text when determining whether the image includes areas of homogeneity. In some embodiments the image may be cropped manually or automatically. For example the top or the bottom of an image may be cropped or the image may be cropped to center faces or other portions of the image. If the image is cropped the image detecting module uses features of the cropped image to determine readability of text overlaid on the cropped image.

The text detecting module identifies features of text associated with an image to determine a readability score for the combination of text and the image. For example the text detecting module determines the length of the text. In some embodiments the readability scoring module truncates the text e.g. if a certain character count is exceeded or enlarges or shrinks the size of the text to improve the likelihood of the text being readable by a user e.g. increases the font size of the text is increased if it is smaller than a threshold font size or decreases the font size of the text if the length of the text exceeds a threshold . If the text is modified the text detecting module accounts for the modifications. For example if text has been truncated the text detecting module determines the length of text to be overlaid onto an image is shorter than the original text. In one embodiment the overlaid text also includes an interface element to allow a user to view the complete text e.g. an interface element for presenting the full text so the text detecting module accounts for presentation of the interface element along with the truncated text. The text detecting module may also determine whether the image includes text. For example the text detecting module identifies a sign reading RMS Titanic in a photograph of a replica of the Titanic. Text and its location in an image may be detected using optical character recognition OCR or by any other suitable method.

The readability score calculator evaluates factors associated with an image and text to generate a readability score or readability scores for the combination of the image and the text. Examples of factors include the likelihood of obscuring faces in the image by overlaying the image with the text metadata associated with the image indicating that the image has been digitally altered homogeneity of areas of the image length of the text text within the image location tags associated with the image resolution of the image and dimensions of the image. Determination of a readability score from the factors is further described below in conjunction with . Alternatively the readability score calculator identifies the combination of text and the image for a manual determination of whether and where to overlay the text onto the image.

The machine learning module applies one or more machine learning methods to detect and to assign scores to factors for generating the readability score based on manual classification and or user feedback. For example the machine learning module is trained to identify characteristics of text and images corresponding to a high or low likelihood of a user reading text overlaid onto an image. For example implicit or explicit user feedback received by the social networking system may indicate that text similar to the text for which feedback was received should be displayed adjacent to rather than overlaying images similar to those for which the feedback was received. Implicit user feedback may be received for example when a high proportion or a low proportion of users that viewed an image overlaid with text accessed the image. Explicit user feedback indicating that text should not be overlaid onto an image may be received when users indicate they are unable to read text overlaid onto the image. Different machine learning methods may be used to calculate the readability score based on various types of available information associated with images and or text.

The web server links the social networking system via the network to the one or more client devices as well as to the one or more third party websites . The web server serves web pages as well as other web related content such as JAVA FLASH XML and so forth. The web server may receive and route messages between the social networking system and the client device for example instant messages queued messages e.g. email text and short message service SMS messages or messages sent using any other suitable messaging technique. A user may send a request to the web server to store a content item in the object store or to retrieve a content item from the object store . Additionally the web server may provide API functionality to send data directly to native client device operating systems such as IOS ANDROID WEBOS or RIM .

In one embodiment the readability scoring module determines whether the readability score satisfies a condition e.g. determines whether the readability score has at least a threshold value . For example the readability scoring module determines whether the readability score equals or exceeds the threshold value . The threshold value specifies a minimum likelihood of a user being able to read text overlaid onto an image. If the readability score does not satisfy the threshold value e.g. the readability score is less than the threshold values the interface generator generates a story that separately presents the image and the text for example the story includes the image and the text in a format where they are presented adjacent to each other. If the readability score satisfies the condition e.g. the readability score is equal to or greater than the threshold value the interface generator generates a story that presents the image and the text in a format where the text is overlaid onto an area of the image.

In one embodiment the social networking system specifies the threshold value based on one or more machine learning methods manual scoring and or user feedback. The threshold value may be modified over time by the readability scoring module based on received data and or other factors. For example if a threshold amount of received user feedback indicates that text overlaid onto an image was difficult to read the threshold value may increased depending on the score originally received by the image and text the types of factors evaluated to determine the score the amount of user feedback the reliability of the user feedback the type of user feedback i.e. explicit or implicit etc.

In another embodiment the readability scoring module compares the readability score to different ranges each associated with different actions. If the readability score is within a lowest range the image and the text are displayed separately in a story e.g. the image and the text are displayed adjacent to each other . If the readability score is within a highest range a composite of the text overlaid on the image is generated and displayed in a story. If the readability score falls within an intermediate range the composite of the text overlaid on the image may be manually reviewed with the results of the manual review determining whether the text is overlaid on the image or separately presented when the story is presented.

The readability score may also be used determine an area of an image onto which to overlay text e.g. top bottom side etc . For example the readability score calculator may evaluate the factors associated with the received image and text for multiple areas of the image onto which the text may be overlaid and generate a readability score for each of the areas. Readability scores for the various areas are compared to the threshold value to identify candidate areas of the image for overlaying text. If multiple areas of the image have readability scores equaling or exceeding the threshold value the readability scoring module may identify the area of the image having the highest readability score that equals or exceeds the threshold so text is overlaid on the identified area of the image. For example the readability score calculator calculates three readability scores for the top bottom and right side of an image onto which text may be overlaid. If the highest readability score corresponds to overlaying the text onto the top of the image and is at least equal to the threshold value the text is overlaid onto the top of the image.

Various attributes of the text and an associated image are evaluated by the readability score calculator to calculate a readability score for the combination of the text and the image. In various embodiments the readability score calculator evaluates attributes of the image attributes of the text associated with the image and attributes of the combination of the text and the image. Alternatively the readability score calculate may evaluate a subset of attributes of the image of the text and or of the combination of the image and the text.

If an image includes one or more faces of individuals the readability score calculator may evaluate the likelihood that a faces included in the image will be obscured by overlaying text onto the image. In one embodiment the readability score is inversely related to the likelihood of overlaid text obscuring a face in the image so a higher likelihood of obscuring a face results in a lower readability score. Hence images including with many faces or images in which faces occupy a large portion of the image may correspond to a lower readability score because overlaid text is more likely to obstruct a user s view of the faces which are likely to be focal points of the images. Images with no faces or images in which faces occupy only a small area of the image may correspond to higher readability scores.

If an image is associated with metadata indicating the image has been digitally altered the readability score calculator reduce the readability score corresponding to the image relative to an image that is not associated with metadata indicating the image has been digitally altered. For example if metadata associated with an image includes file extension associated with an image editing application the readability score calculator determines the image is likely to have been modified and reduces a readability score associated with the image accordingly. However if metadata associated with an image includes information about the type of camera capturing the image the readability score calculator determines the image is less likely to have been altered and more likely to be an original image resulting in a higher readability score associated with the image.

The readability score calculator may assign a higher readability score to images including one or more homogeneous areas i.e. areas having one or more common characteristics or attributes . Thus a higher readability score is associated with an image including multiple homogenous areas having a large portion of the image that is a homogeneous area having a low degree of color distribution over one or more areas i.e. the color gradient changes very little having a low magnitude of color contrast over one or more areas and having at least a threshold magnitude of color contrast between one or more areas and the text that may be overlaid. In one embodiment a small color distribution over a large area may indicate that the image has been digitally altered which lowers a readability score associated with the image.

In some embodiments the readability score calculator also accounts for the length of received text when determining a readability score associated with the text. As longer text takes up more space of an image longer text is more likely to obstruct a viewer s ability to view details in the image. Therefore received text having longer lengths is associated with lower readability scores. In one embodiment text may be truncated and the length of the truncated text is used to determine the readability score associated with the text.

If the social networking system receives images including text the readability score calculator may associate lower readability score with those images relative to images that do not include text. Overlaying text onto an image with existing text may increase the difficulty of users identifying the text included in the image the overlaid text and or the image itself. If the text detecting module identifies text included in an image the readability score calculator may reduce a readability score corresponding to the image based on the amount and size of text in the image. In one embodiment a larger amount or larger size of text in the image corresponds to a lower readability score. For example the readability score calculator associates a lower readability score to an image including a paragraph of text in size 12 font than to an image including two words of text in size 8 font because text overlaid onto the first image is more likely to be overlaid onto text included in the first image itself than onto text included in the second image.

Additionally location tags associated with an image may indicate that an image is an original photograph rather than a modified image so the readability score calculator may assign a higher readability score to images associated with location tags than to images that are not associated with location tags. Images associated with location tags are more likely to be unaltered photographs while images without location tags are more likely to have been altered or modified. For example an image tagged with the location Santa Cruz Calif. is more likely to be an original photograph taken by the user than an image without any tagged location so the image associated with the tagged location may be associated with a higher readability score than an image not associated with a tagged location.

In some embodiments the readability score calculator associates a higher readability score to images with a high resolution than to images with a low resolution. For example the readability score calculator increases a readability score associated with the image if the image has at least a threshold resolution. Images with high resolution e.g. a high number of pixels per inch have more detail than lower resolution images. Because details in images with high resolution are less likely to be obscured by overlaid text than details in images with low resolution readability scores for high resolution images are higher than readability scores for low resolution images.

The readability score calculator may also account for the dimensions of an image when calculating a readability score. Text overlaid onto an image that is very long in one dimension but shorter in another dimension is more likely to be difficult to read than text overlaid onto an image that has dimensions in various directions that are closer to each other even when the overall areas of the images are similar. For example text overlaid onto a rectangular image that is eight inches tall and one inch wide height to width ratio of 8 1 will likely have to wrap around several times and take up several lines as compared to text overlaid onto a rectangular image that is four inches tall and two inches wide height to width ratio of 2 1 . Therefore the readability score may be lower for an image with a height to width ratio exceeding a threshold ratio relative to the readability score of an image with a height to width ratio less than or equal to the threshold ratio. In one embodiment images may be cropped and the dimensions of cropped images used to calculate the readability score.

In one embodiment the readability scoring module determines whether to overlay text onto some or all of a collection of images such as images included in an album. shows one embodiment of a method for determining whether text is readable if overlaid onto multiple images. As shown in the social networking system receives multiple images and text from a user and the readability score calculator then computes a readability score for overlaying the text onto an area of the images. In one embodiment some or all of the images may be rearranged and the readability score is recomputed . The images may be rearranged multiple times with a readability score recomputed for each of the rearrangements. For example a readability score is recomputed for a threshold number of rearrangements or a readability score is recomputed for each rearrangement of the images. The readability scoring module identifies the highest readability score associated with a rearrangement of the images and determines if the highest readability score equals or exceeds a threshold value. If the highest readability score is less than the threshold value the interface generator generates a story presenting the images and the text in a format where the images and text are separately presented. However if the highest readability score equals or exceeds the threshold value the interface generator generates a story presenting the images and the text in a format where the text is overlaid onto one or more of the images.

The described operations and their associated modules may be embodied in software firmware hardware or any combinations thereof.

Any of the steps operations or processes described herein may be performed or implemented with one or more hardware or software modules alone or in combination with other devices. In one embodiment a software module is implemented with a computer program product comprising a computer readable medium containing computer program code which can be executed by a computer processor for performing any or all of the steps operations or processes described. Embodiments of the invention may also relate to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes and or it may comprise a general purpose computing device selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a non transitory tangible computer readable storage medium or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions which may be coupled to a computer system bus. Furthermore any computing systems referred to in the specification may include a single processor or may be architectures employing multiple processor designs for increased computing capability.

Embodiments of the invention may also relate to a product that is produced by a computing process described herein. Such a product may comprise information resulting from a computing process where the information is stored on a non transitory tangible computer readable storage medium and may include any embodiment of a computer program product or other data combination described herein.

Finally the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes and it may not have been selected to delineate or circumscribe the inventive subject matter. It is therefore intended that the scope of the invention be limited not by this detailed description but rather by any claims that issue on an application based hereon.
