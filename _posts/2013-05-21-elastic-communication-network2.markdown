The majority of end users of electronic equipment with telecommunication capabilities typically are connected to a communication network that can permit the exchange of digital content with other equipment. Such an exchange has become an integral part of the professional and or personal activities of the end users that consume such content. Thus connectivity to networked sources of information such as the Internet has become a nearly ubiquitous necessity in the daily endeavors of most end users. In response to such reliance on networked information communication carriers have strived to expand telecommunication infrastructures and develop telecommunication protocols directed to maintaining fast and reliable access to digital content via communication networks. As a result public Wi Fi networks have been deployed in several public spaces. Yet Wi Fi networks typically have a footprint predominantly distributed around commercial spaces with public access such as airports restaurants coffee shops and the like or historically public spaces such as libraries city parks and recreation centers and the like. In view of such a deployment footprint most end users of network digital content tend to seek access to free of charge Wi Fi network s with the ensuing nearly constant search for a commercial facility e.g. a Starbucks coffee shop or a McDonald s restaurant or other type of confined space with Wi Fi service coverage. Behaviors associated with free of charge access to connectivity to a communication network with wide area access can be disruptive operationally and or commercially to the end user that seeks such access and or to an administrator e.g. an owner or lessee of a confined space in which the communication network is deployed.

The present disclosure recognizes and addresses in at least certain aspects the lack of readily accessible nearly ubiquitous connectivity to network service s and or network resources. In certain embodiments the disclosure provides a communication network in which a communication service can be provided by a mobile computing device to one or more other mobile computing devices. The communication network can be a mobile communication network and the communication service can provide wireless communication e.g. wireless transmission and or wireless reception of information to and or from a mobile computing device. In the present disclosure a mobile computing device that can provide the communication service can be referred to as a host device and a mobile computing device that utilizes or otherwise consumes the communication service can be referred to as a peer device. A host device and a peer device may be referred to generically as a service provider and a consumer respectively. In addition the communication service for a peer device can be maintained e.g. handed off across various host devices. Accordingly in one aspect the communication network can be referred to as an elastic mobile network and the communication service which provides wireless connectivity to a mobile computing device can be referred to as a cellular sharing connectivity service. 

As described in greater detail below the disclosure provides various embodiments of the elastic mobile network. Such embodiments include systems computing devices apparatuses techniques and or computer program products that can provide a communication service that can permit access to networked information such as Internet access over a mobile communication network in accordance with a transactional model that can regulate access to the communication service via a host device. The transactional model can include a payment structure associated with predetermined payments directed to access the communication service a service subsidy structure or rule s for waiver of payment for service and or one or more conditions for open service e.g. free of charge access . Such payments can be monetary payments or non monetary payments e.g. service points or units reward units of a loyalty program or the like in exchange for access to the communication service. As an illustration the payment structure can establish pricing for access to the communication service where the pricing can include for example a price point per unit of time a price point for a period of service a price point for the volume of information provided during the service a combination thereof or the like. Information e.g. data metadata and or signaling directed to and or originated at a peer device can be accessed via the host device through a secure e.g. tamper resistant communication pathway within the host device. In addition information directed to and or originated at the host device can be routed or otherwise communicated via another secure communication pathway within the host device. The communication service can operate globally and can permit global sharing of network resources in most any communication network such as 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3GPP mobile telecommunication networks which also may be referred to as 3G mobile networks .

In certain embodiments the communication service described herein can be provided via a group of host components integrated into the host device and or one or more remote network components distributed in a network and functionally coupled e.g. communicatively coupled to the host device. In one example implementation the group of host components can include at least one software component and at least one firmware component. The firmware component s can provide at least two secure communication pathways that permit routing or otherwise directing information to and from the peer device and or to or from the host device. In addition the one or more network components can manage various aspects of the communication service such as administration of host devices peer devices and or third party agents. At least one of the one or more network components also can manage interaction or integration of the communication service with third party agents such as advertisers or an advertiser platform merchants or a merchant platform nodes of a social network and the like .

Embodiments of the disclosure can provide various advantages over conventional wireless access points or hot spots. As an example advantage certain embodiments can mitigate exposure of a host device to security threats by communicatively insulating via specific secure firmware communication pathways certain functional elements of the host device from information directed to a peer device. In addition a peer device can be assured to have a secure and or private connection to one or more network resources without the host device being operable to sniff a communication via such a connection and or perform man in the middle attacks by using an altered malicious version of host functional element s such as a malicious operating system OS . As another example advantage one or more embodiments can permit nearly ubiquitous access to networked information substantially without geographical constraints.

Accordingly such mobile devices may not have access to information supplied via the network s . In one aspect the mobile device can permit access to such information for at least one e.g. one two more than two or each of the mobile devices . To at least such an end in one aspect the mobile device can establish communication with the at least one mobile device e.g. mobile device and can provide a communication service to the at least one mobile device. The communication service can permit wireless transmission of information to the at least one of the mobile devices . In addition or in the alternative the communication service can permit wireless reception of information from the at least one of the mobile devices . Accordingly as described herein such a communication service can be referred to as a cellular sharing connectivity service. As described herein the communication service can be furnished to the at least one of the mobile devices in accordance with a transactional model that may be specific or otherwise customized to the mobile device or the mobile device that is furnished the communication service. Within the cellular sharing connectivity service the mobile device can transmit at least a portion of the information that is received from the at least one of the mobile devices to a network element e.g. an application server or a network node of at least one of the network s and or to a destination computing device not shown in .

As described herein a mobile computing device that provides the cellular sharing connectivity service described herein can be referred to as a host device or more generically as a service provider whereas a mobile computing device that is provided with the cellular sharing connectivity service can be referred to as a peer device or more generically as a consumer. It should be appreciated that a peer device need not be directly provisioned or activated by one or more of the network s because the cellular sharing connectivity service is provided by the host device that is directly provisioned and activated by at least one of the network s . In addition the peer device need not be germane to or otherwise associated with a geographical region such as a country in which the network s are deployed and operate in order to access information or a network resource associated with the network s . The peer device can communicate directly with the host device via a radio protocol e.g. Wi Fi that permits ad hoc access to the host device. Accordingly in one aspect the cellular sharing connectivity service can be provided worldwide and the peer device can access network resources without roaming while operating outside the device s day to day operational environment. For instance an end user associated with a peer device can access the Internet and or other networks while traveling to a foreign country.

In certain embodiments an instance of the service configuration can be retained in one of the profile s for a finite period.

In response to being configured as a service provider the host device can transmit e.g. broadcast multicast or unicast service information indicative of the cellular sharing connectivity service provided by the host device . To at least such an end the cellular sharing service unit can utilize or otherwise leverage a radio unit also referred to as radio to communicate the service information. In one embodiment the radio unit can include one or more antennas and a communication processing unit comprising component for processing wireless signals. At least a portion of such components and at least some of the antenna s can be grouped into a first set of one or more components also referred to as depicted as protocol I component s that can permit wireless communication according to a first radio protocol and a second set of one or more components also referred to as depicted as protocol II component s that can permit wireless communication according to a second radio protocol.

A mobile device can be functionally coupled e.g. communicatively coupled to the host device via link s . In one aspect the link s can include a DL and or an UL and can be embodied in wired link s wireless link s including terrestrial air interfaces and or deep space link s or a combination thereof. The mobile device also may be referred to and illustrated as peer device . The mobile device can receive at least the portion of the pilot information and in response can transmit a connection request to the host device . The connection request can be embodied in or can comprise an information object e.g. a data structure formatted according to the first radio protocol. The connection request can permit petitioning for access to the cellular sharing connectivity service provided by the host device . In one aspect the connection request can include information associated with the transactional model that regulates access to the cellular sharing connectivity service. For example the connection request can include device identification ID information indicative of a device identifier that can be unique. The device identifier can include an international mobile subscriber identity IMSI a temporary IMSI TIMSI an international mobile equipment identifier IMET a mobile directory number MDN a mobile identification number MIN a Telecommunications Industry Association TIA electronic serial number ESN a multi bit identification number like the mobile equipment identifier MEID a mobile subscriber ISDN Integrated Services Digital Network number MSISDN an IP internet protocol multimedia private identity IMPI an IP multimedia public identity IMPU a MAC address a combination of the foregoing or the like. For another example the connection request can include payment information indicative of a payment in exchange for access to the cellular sharing connectivity service. For yet another example the connection request can comprise a combination of the device ID information and the payment information.

The host device can receive e.g. tune to decode demultiplex demodulate or a combination thereof the connection request from the mobile device . In one aspect the host device can receive information indicative of a payment in exchange for access to the cellular sharing connectivity service from the mobile device . In the illustrated embodiment the radio unit via at least one of the radio protocol I components can receive the connection request and can communicate it to the mobile service unit . A provisioning component can analyze or otherwise process the connection request and within the analysis or processing can determine if the connection request is valid. In one implementation the provisioning component can analyze or otherwise process the connection request based on the transactional model that regulates service access. As described herein the transactional model can include one or more access rules that the provisioning component can apply to the connection request in order to ascertain the validity or invalidity of the connection request . In other implementations the provisioning component can convey the communication request to a remote computing device that can regulate access to the cellular sharing connectivity service provided by the host device . The remote computing device can embody or can constitute at least one of the service management units . In certain embodiments the transaction model or information indicative thereof can be retained or otherwise recorded on a memory device integrated into or functionally coupled to the remote computing device.

In a scenario in which the mobile service unit ascertains that the connection request is valid e.g. the mobile device is a device authorized to access the cellular sharing connectivity service and or has provided adequate payment in exchange of service the mobile service unit can provision the cellular sharing connectivity service to the mobile device . In addition or in the alternative to the provisioning the cellular sharing connectivity service can be activated for the mobile device . In one aspect the provisioning component can transmit provisioning information indicative or otherwise representative of the mobile device and initiation of service to a remote computing device can activate the cellular sharing connectivity service. In another aspect the provisioning component can transmit to the remote computing device provisioning information indicative of an identity of the mobile device and or a payment mode that is applicable to mobile device in order in order for such device to access the cellular sharing connectivity service. As described herein the payment mode can comprise one or more of direct payment mode or third party payment mode. In one aspect within the direct payment mode the mobile device can convey a payment in exchange for the cellular sharing connectivity service whereas in third party payment a third party agent such as an advertiser can provide a payment in exchange for the cellular sharing connectivity service. The remote computing device can embody or constitute one of the service management unit s .

In one implementation the provisioning information described herein can be transmitted via the radio unit to a network of the network s which can route such information to the proper unit of the service management unit s . In one embodiment one or more components associated with a second radio protocol referred to as radio protocol II can transmit the provisioning information. The second radio protocol can be different from the first radio protocol. In one example scenario the radio protocol II can be 3GPP LTE protocol. As illustrated the one or more components can be referred to as protocol II component s . Upon or after service activation the mobile device can be identified logically within the service management architecture and or the host device as a peer device .

In response to the provisioning e.g. upon or after the provisioning of the cellular sharing connectivity service to the mobile device information can be received wirelessly from the mobile device and or information can be transmitted wirelessly to the mobile device . In addition the mobile device can be referred to as peer device and at least a portion of such information can be referred to as peer information. In one scenario in order to receive information wirelessly from the peer device and or transmit peer information wirelessly to the peer device a communication session can be initiated between the peer device and a remote network element e.g. a computing device not shown in within a network of the network s . Such a communication session can permit the host device to route peer information data metadata and or signaling from the peer device to the remote computing device e.g. a computing device of the network s and or to route peer information from the remote network element to the peer device . In the illustrated embodiment the configuration component can initiate such a communication session. In one example implementation within initiation of the communication session the configuration component can establish a packet switching PS protocol tunnel between the peer device and the remote network element. As an example the PS protocol tunnel can be embodied in or can comprise an IP tunnel such as a general packet radio service GPRS tunnel in accordance with GPRS tunneling protocol GTP . In one aspect of administration of the cellular sharing connectivity service the configuration component can transmit session information indicative of the communication session to one of the service management unit s or a computing device thereof or functionally coupled thereto. At least a portion of such session information can permit service accounting generation of advertisement content or the like.

Wireless communication of peer information between the host device and the peer device and the host device and a network element of the network s can be implemented securely via a security control unit also referred to and illustrated as security controller . The security controller can avoid substantially or strictly propagation of peer information to functional elements such as component s and or platform s of the host device that permit operation thereof. To at least such an end the security controller can be embodied in or can comprise firmware and can transport information via secure firmware communication pathways specific to the information that is transported. In certain embodiments the security controller can comprise one or more processing units having processing circuitry or hardware and one or more memory devices which can comprise storage hardware having logic circuitry. At least a portion of the logic circuitry can be accessed by at least one of the processing units. According in one aspect the logic circuitry can be referred to as processor accessible storage device. For example in one embodiment the security controller can be embodied in or can comprise a tamper resistant processor having one or more hardware security components. The security controller can determine an intended recipient of certain information e.g. data metadata and or signaling and based on the intended recipient the security controller can route the information via a particular secure firmware communication pathway. In one aspect information intended for the host device which can be referred to as host information. can be transported via a secure firmware communication pathway that is different from the secure firmware communication pathway that transports peer information. Such a distinction between secure firmware communication pathways can permit mitigation of exposure of the host device to information directed to a peer device and to security threats that may be associated with such information. It should be readily appreciated that the security controller can mitigate or avoid proliferation of malware into the host device . It should be appreciated that in certain embodiments the security controller and the radio can be integrated into a single functional element such as a single unit.

In certain scenarios the information can include information intended to the peer device or originated from the peer device . presents an example diagram of secure firmware communication pathways for transporting or otherwise communicating peer information in accordance with one or more aspects of the disclosure. The secure communication pathways are represented with labeled open head arrows in the subject drawing. As described herein the portion of information that is incoming can be received at the radio via one or more protocol I components . In addition such a portion of the information can be referred to as information and can be conveyed to the security controller . The security controller can determine that at least a portion of the information is intended for the peer device . As illustrated at least the portion of the information can be referred to as peer information and the security controller can convey e.g. route or otherwise transmit the information to at least one of the protocol II component s . The radio via the at least one of the protocol II component s can transmit wirelessly the peer information within information . Similarly peer information within the peer information can be originated by the peer device and directed to or intended for communication to a remote network element e.g. a remote computing device mobile or otherwise an application server a CDN node an IMS node or the like . As illustrated the radio can convey the peer information to the security controller and the security controller can convey the peer information to the radio which can utilize or otherwise leverage one or more of the protocol I components for wireless transmission of the peer information within the information .

It is readily appreciated that the flow of information between the peer device or consumer and the host device or hotspot can be routed exclusively through the security controller and thus in one aspect such information may not be detectable to one or more of the host functional elements . In one aspect such a routing of information can insulate information directed to or originated from the peer device from information directed to or originated from the host device . Accordingly in one aspect privacy of the host device may be preserved in scenarios in which cellular sharing connectivity service is provided.

Electronic components and associated circuitry such as mux demux unit codec and modem can permit or otherwise facilitate processing and manipulation e.g. coding decoding deciphering and or modulation demodulation of wireless signal s received by the host device and wireless signal s to be transmitted by the same.

In addition the processor s can permit or otherwise facilitate the host device to process data e.g. symbols bits or chips for multiplexing demultiplexing modulation demodulation such as implementing direct and inverse fast Fourier transforms selection of modulation rates selection of data packet formats inter packet times and the like.

The codec can operate on information e.g. data metadata and or signaling in accordance with one or more coding decoding schemes suitable for communication at least in part through the one or more transceivers formed from respective transmitter s receiver s . In one aspect such coding decoding schemes or related procedure s can be retained as a group of one or more computer accessible instructions computer readable instructions computer executable instructions or a combination thereof in memory . In a scenario in which wireless communication among the host device and another device e.g. peer device utilizes or otherwise leverages multiple input multiple output MIMO multiple input single output MISO single input multiple output SIMO or single input single output SISO operation the codec can implement at least one of space time block coding STBC and associated decoding or space frequency block coding SFBC and associated decoding.

The codec can utilize or otherwise leverage the mux demux unit and or the modem to operate in accordance with aspects described herein.

Multimode circuitry can permit the radio to operate in multiple communication modes through various radio network technologies e.g. second generation 2G third generation 3G fourth generation 4G or deep space satellite based communication in accordance with disparate technical specifications or standard protocols for the radio network technologies or such a satellite communication. The various radio network technologies can be part of the set of radio technologies described herein. In one aspect the multimode circuitry e.g. one or more chipsets can permit the radio unit to operate in accordance with standard protocols specific to a telecommunication mode of operation e.g. LTE based communication or Wi Fi based communication.
