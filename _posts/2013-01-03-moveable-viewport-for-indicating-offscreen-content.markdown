The present disclosure relates to digital map systems and more specifically to a device and method configured to provide an indication of off screen content on a digital map during a geographic search via the temporary movement of a viewport.

Digital maps are displayed and are used in a wide variety of devices including car navigation systems hand held GPS units mobile phones and many websites. Moreover digital maps may contain a wealth of map information such as satellite images roads street photographs taken from the ground level specific information for a business etc. However the physical size and display resolution limitations of many device display screens restrict the amount of map information that may be displayed to a user at one time. Moreover a desired viewing resolution or viewing magnification of a displayed digital map may limit a user to viewing only a small portion of the map at one time. As a result some map features and information may not be contained in the current viewing window or viewport of the map at a user selected level of detail or magnification or with a particular resolution or a size of a display screen.

To cope with map information that is not contained within the viewport or with content that is off screen existing map systems have placed overlays or indicators that indicate a direction pointing toward the off screen content. These existing map systems have generally placed overlays at the edge of the viewport or next to a search box to suggest a general direction in which the off screen content is located with respect to the displayed map content. Other current map systems have implemented radar like or sonar like pings that generate a series of ever expanding circles that originate from the location of the off screen content and subsequently appear on the displayed portion of the map to a user. In these map systems a user can deduce from the size and the arc of the expanding circle or ping the direction of and approximate distance to the location of the off screen content. However these overlay indicators of existing map systems generally occlude or obstruct the displayed portion of the map and conceal map information that is positioned directly underneath a placed overlay indicator. Moreover the overlay indicators may further clutter an already information dense displayed portion of the map and may confuse the user in providing additional information.

A computer implemented method for providing an indication of off screen content during a geographic search includes providing a digital map via a user interface in a map client device displaying a portion of the digital map corresponding to a selected geographic area within a viewport located in a first position and receiving a geographic search term via the user interface as the geographic search term is being input and determining that the geographic search term identifies an off screen entity located outside the selected geographic area. The method then provides an off screen content indicator that indicates the direction toward the identified off screen entity and temporarily moves the viewport in a general direction of the identified off screen entity from the first position to a second position the off screen content indicator being visible only when the viewport is moved to the second position.

A computer readable storage medium includes a set of instructions executable by a processor that provides an indication of off screen content during a geographic search for a map client device having a user interface. The instructions include providing a digital map via the user interface displaying a portion of the digital map corresponding to a selected geographic area within a viewport located in a first position and receiving a geographic search term via the user interface as the geographic search term is being input. The instructions also include determining that the geographic search term identifies an off screen entity located outside the selected geographic area providing an off screen content indicator that indicates the direction toward the location of the identified off screen entity and temporarily moving the viewport in a general direction of the location of the identified off screen entity from the first position to a second position wherein the off screen content indicator is visible only when the viewport is moved to the second position.

An off screen content indication system for providing an indication of an off screen content during a geographic search includes a map display routine that is stored on one or more computer memories and that executes on one or more computer processors to provide a digital map via a user interface and to display a portion of the digital map corresponding to a selected geographical area within a viewport located in a first position. Moreover the system includes a geographic search term input routine that is stored on one or more computer memories and that executes on one or more computer processors to receive a geographic search term via the user interface as the geographic search term is input. The system also includes an off screen content indication routine that is stored on one or more computer memories and that executes on one or more computer processors to determine that the geographic search term identifies an off screen entity located outside the selected geographic area to provide an off screen content indicator that indicates the direction toward the location of the identified off screen entity and to temporarily move the viewport in a general direction of the location of the identified off screen entity from the first position to a second position wherein the off screen content indicator is visible only when the viewport is moved to the second position.

Generally speaking an off screen content indication system provides an indication of a direction toward a location of an off screen entity without occluding any currently displayed map features to a user. In particular a mapping module receives an identification of a suggested geographic term from the user and the mapping module determines whether the location of the entity is off screen such that it is outside a map that includes both a currently displayed user visible portion of the map and a non visible buffer zone surrounding the displayed portion of the map. If the mapping module determines the location of the off screen entity to be outside the map the mapping module generates an off screen content indicator that indicates the location of the off screen entity associated with the identified geographic term and places the off screen content indicator outside a viewport that currently displays a portion of a map to a user. The mapping module then temporarily moves or shifts the viewport toward the general direction of the location of the off screen entity to reveal the generated off screen content indicator and may shift back. In response to receiving an identification of an additional suggested geographic term from the user the mapping module may repeat this process of temporarily moving or shifting the viewport to reveal another newly generated off screen content indicator associated with the received identification of the additional suggested geographic term.

Referring now to an off screen content indication system includes a map database stored in or at or associated with a server or multiple servers located at for example a central site or at various different spaced apart sites and also includes multiple map client devices each of which stores and implements a mapping module discussed below or a mapping engine. The server additionally includes a processor and a map request handler stored in a memory that manages and fulfills incoming map data requests from the map client devices . Moreover the memory includes a search engine that may retrieve information associated with a geographical term or may suggest geographic terms based on user input. Of course the search engine may also be disposed in one or more of the map client devices . The map client devices may be connected to the server via any hardwired or wireless digital communication network including for example a hardwired or wireless local area network LAN metropolitan area network MAN or wide area network WAN the Internet or any combination thereof. The map client devices may be for example mobile devices e.g. phones smartphones personal digital assistants PDA etc. computers such as a laptop tablet desktop or other suitable types of computers or components of other imaging systems such components of automobile navigation systems etc. Moreover it is understood that the components shown in the map client device are included in each of the other map client devices as well as any other map client device described above and the components of the map client device are not to be limited to only the map client device . Each of the map client devices may be communicatively connected to the server via any suitable communication system such as any publically available and or privately owned communication network including those that use hardwired based communication structure such as telephone and cable hardware and or wireless communication structure such as wireless communication networks including for example wireless LANs and WANs satellite and cellular phone communication systems etc.

The map database may contain any type of map data location information data e.g. information about or stored for businesses or commercial entities such as menus hours of operations website URLs etc. and application generated data as well as any other desired types of data. Generally map data can be used to generate a digital map that may include roads buildings parks or any other features appearing on a map. Physical roads may be represented in the map data by a list of nodes that represent geographical coordinate points e.g. latitude and longitude and road segments that connect those nodes. Other features such as buildings and parks similarly correspond to a specific geographical location in the physical world and the data representation of each feature also includes a set of geographical coordinate points. Map data may be in the form of satellite image data pictures traditional road map data etc. Map data may be generally updated by map developers or other computer systems. However in many cases map data as well as location information data building model data application data etc. may be updated by individuals or particular users in any desired manner. The map data stored in the map database can be obtained from several different sources such as the New York City Open Accessible Space Information System OASIS and the U.S. Census Bureau Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing system TIGER for example.

In any event the map client device or any of the other map client devices may include a display device a communication unit a user interface or user input device a Global Positioning System GPS unit e.g. for use in the mobile device or any other suitable mobile map client device a processor CPU a graphics processing unit GPU and a program memory . The program memory includes a data storage an operating system and a mapping module that stores a indicator generator module that may be implemented to determine and to generate an off screen content indicator. The operating system for example may include one of a plurality of mobile platforms for a mobile device such as the iOS Android Palm webOS Windows Mobile Phone BlackBerry OS or Symbian OS mobile technology platforms developed by Apple Inc. Google Inc. Palm Inc. now Hewlett Packard Company Microsoft Corporation Research in Motion RIM and Nokia respectively or alternatively may include a desktop operating system such as Windows Mac OS etc. for the computer devices . The data storage may include data such as user profiles map data for the mapping module or the indicator generator module and other data necessary to interact with the map database or the server through the digital network . The memory may also include or otherwise be communicatively connected to other data storage mechanisms e.g. one or more hard disk drives optical storage drives solid state storage devices etc. that reside within the map client devices .

The GPS unit may use Assisted GPS A GPS satellite GPS or any other suitable global positioning protocol or system that locates the position of the mobile device or any other map client device . For example A GPS utilizes terrestrial cell phone towers or wifi hotspots e.g. wireless router points to more accurately and more quickly determine location of the mobile device while satellite GPS generally are more useful in more remote regions that lack cell towers or wifi hotspots. The communication unit may communicate with the server via any suitable wireless communication protocol network such as a wireless telephony network e.g. GSM CDMA LTE etc. a wi fi network 802.11 standards a WiMAX network a Bluetooth network etc. The user interface or user input device may include a soft keyboard that is displayed on the display device of the map client device an external hardware keyboard communicating via a wired or a wireless connection e.g. a Bluetooth keyboard an external mouse or any other suitable user input device. It should be appreciated that although depicts only one processor the map client device may include multiple processors. Similarly the memory of the map client device may include multiple program memories. The map client device may implement the program memories as semiconductor memories magnetically readable memories and or optically readable memories for example.

In any event the one or more processors may be adapted and configured to execute the mapping module residing in the program memory in addition to other software modules. The mapping module may be implemented as a series of machine readable instructions for performing the various tasks associated with receiving information at and displaying information on one of the map client devices or alternatively the mapping module may be stored and executed in the memory of the server to perform the various tasks associated with transmitting information to one of the map client devices .

Generally speaking the off screen content indication system operates such that a user at one of the map client devices executes the mapping module that operates to communicate with and obtain map information or map related data from the map database via the server and that then displays or renders a map image based on the received map data. Additionally the user may launch or instantiate any other suitable user interface application e.g. a mobile application a web browser or any other software application to access the server to implement the off screen content indication system . For example the mapping module may be implemented within or closely coordinated with a mobile application. In this example in response to executing the mobile application with embedded mapping module the user may interact with the mobile application to use the features and methods of the mapping module . Alternatively the mapping module may also cooperate or coordinate with a web browser including for example a mobile web browser a desktop web browser etc. that may be implemented as a series of machine readable instructions for receiving interpreting and displaying web page map information from the server while also receiving inputs from the user and information from the mapping module .

In any event the mapping module may retrieve map data associated with the a user specified geographic area that is stored in the map database and store the retrieved map data in the data storage of the memory of the map client device or one of the map client devices . The mapping module may render and display this stored map data on the display device to allow the user to zoom in or out on the geographic area to rotate spin or change the two dimensional or three dimensional viewing angle of the map being displayed etc. More particularly when rendering a map image on a display device or a display screen each of the client devices may download map data in the form of vector data raster data or any other suitable type of map data from the map database and processes that map data to render a digital map image on the associated display device .

With reference to an exemplary digital map produced by the mapping module is displayed to the user on the display device of one of the map client device or one of the map client devices . The digital map may include a primary map portion that is displayed within a viewport and is visible to the user. The mapping module may render and display on the display device the primary map portion from map data that is stored in the data storage of the map client device . Moreover a peripheral map portion or a buffer zone may reside outside the viewport and is not visible to the user despite being a portion of the map . In response to a request to move the viewport described below the mapping module may render and display map data associated with the buffer zone from the data storage of the map client device . An outer boundary of the map may confine the movement of the viewport to the area of the map described in more detail below . A search box may allow the user to input a geographic search term via the user interface . Preferably the search box may appear affixed to the map and may not move relative to the map when the viewport is repositioned relative to the map .

In any event referring now to the user may begin to enter a geographic search term into the search box via the user interface . For example the user may begin typing or tapping letters corresponding to a portion of the geographic search term via the soft keyboard that is displayed on the display device of the map client device . In response to receiving the geographic search term as it is being input from the user the mapping module may display within a dropdown field one or more suggested geographic terms that correspond to the entered portion of the geographic search term . As illustrated in the user has entered the letters Da that correspond to the beginning portion of the geographic search term . In response to receiving the input Da in the search box as shown in this example the mapping module displays within the dropdown field four suggested geographic terms that correspond to the input Da. Moreover the mapping module allows for the user to specify one of the suggested geographic terms by highlighting or otherwise emphasizing one of the suggested geographic terms without selecting the suggested geographic term .

For example as illustrated in the user may identify one of the suggested geographic terms that correspond to the user entered input Da by hovering a cursor not shown over one of the suggested geographic terms by selecting and holding one of the suggested geographic terms via a touch screen not shown or by any other suitable manner of identifying one of the suggested geographic terms without submitting the suggested geographic term as a selection. In this example the user has identified the highlighted suggested geographic term Darwin Australia via one of the previously described identification methods above. Upon receiving this identified suggested geographic term from the user the mapping module in this example determines a location of an entity not shown associated with the identified geographic term and determines if the location of the entity is situated within the viewport . If the location of the entity is determined to be situated within the viewport the mapping module may directly display the location of the entity. However if the location of the entity is determined to be located outside viewport i.e. off screen the mapping module may determine the precise location of the off screen entity e.g. geographic coordinates etc. and also may determine a general direction from the viewport toward the geographic location of the off screen entity.

Thereafter the mapping module may generate and may place an off screen content indicator for example outside the displayed user visible primary map portion i.e. the initial position of the viewport of and inside the outer boundary of the map i.e. in the buffer zone . As shown in the off screen content indicator may include the name or an abbreviated name of the identified geographic term and an arrow that indicates the direction toward the location of the off screen content. Of course the off screen content indicator may instead include a user selectable link or symbol that redirects the user to the location of the off screen content such as the location of Darwin a distance to the location of the off screen location a direction compass that points toward the location of the off screen content page place data that includes information associated with the off screen content etc. In response to generating the off screen content indicator the mapping module may temporarily shift or glide the viewport from its initial position to a new position that reveals the generated off screen content indicator and then shift or glide the viewport back to its initial position. In shifting the viewport the mapping module displays a different map portion that preferably and substantially overlaps the initially displayed primary map portion of . Preferably both the map and the search box move relative to the viewport when the viewport shifts to the different map portion . This technique allows for the visual effect of the search box appearing affixed the map from the point of view of the user during a viewport shift and furthermore the search box does not occlude any newly revealed map features in the buffer zone . As a result when the mapping module shifts the viewport to reveal the off screen content indicator the off screen content indicator advantageously does not occlude or obstruct any features appearing on the initially displayed user visible primary map portion as shown in .

In particular at a block the mapping module retrieves map data associated with a user specified initial geographic area i.e. the primary map portion displayed within the viewport from the map database via the network or alternatively the server may transmit map data to the map client device so that the mapping module may use the map data to load or generate a map . The mapping module may utilize any suitable method in determining an initial geographical area for which the mapping application may retrieve map data corresponding to the initial geographical area from the map database and display the retrieved map data to the user via the viewport . In determining the initial geographic area the off screen content indication system may include entering and submitting a geographical search term from the user receiving an input such as a mouse input touch screen input etc. that repositions or changes the magnification of the map from the user utilizing a current geographic position of the map client device via the GPS unit or A GPS or any other suitable steps or actions in determining the initial geographic area. In using this user specified initial geographic area the mapping module may request map data associated with the initial geographic area from the map database and in turn may store that map data into the data storage of the map client device . In addition to retrieving map data that corresponds to the initial geographical area the mapping module may also retrieve map data that corresponds to a peripheral region or the buffer zone around the geographical area from the map database . Thus the retrieved map data may include map data that will be displayed to the user with the viewport and map data associated with the buffer zone surrounding the viewport but within the outer boundary . It is understood that the mapping module may process the retrieved map data to determine the map data that is displayed within the viewport and map data that includes the buffer zone .

Using the map data in the data storage the mapping module may display a primary map portion within the viewport that corresponds to the user selected geographic area at a block . At a block the mapping module may receive input values relating to a geographic search term from the user or from any other input such as from another computer device from a software routine etc. For example the geographic search term may include a city as shown in a state a county a country a landmark a monument a specific place of business a transit or rail station a type of business e.g. movie theaters restaurants dentists etc. or any other category or type of entity that is associated with a geographic location. Using the input values relating to the geographic search term the mapping module at a block may retrieve suggested geographic terms from the map database the server the data storage of the map client device or any other suitable location that store geographic terms . Moreover at the block the mapping module may display these retrieved suggested geographic terms that correspond to the received input values in a dropdown field or any other suitable manner for presenting suggested geographic terms .

At a block the mapping module may receive an identification of a geographic term from the displayed suggested geographic terms in any number of ways while not selecting the geographic term for submission. For instance the user may identify the geographic term by causing a hovering event near the location of the displayed geographic term using a mouse by highlighting the suggested geographic term via receiving a pressing or holding input from a touch screen or by detecting any suitable activation of a corresponding control. Likewise the use may identify the geographic term from the list of suggested geographic terms via a holding or a pressing gesture on a touch screen that signifies the identification of geographic term without selecting the geographic term for submission. As a result at a block the mapping module determines whether the geographic term has been selected for submission or for searching as described above. If the mapping module determines that the geographic term has been submitted for searching the mapping module transfers control to the block to reload a new map associated with the new geographic area associated with the selected geographic term for submission. Alternatively if the mapping module at the block determines that the identified geographic term has not been selected for search submission then the mapping module may transfer control to a block .

At the block the mapping module determines whether the identified geographic term identifies an entity not shown that is located outside the viewport . The mapping module may implement any techniques known to one skilled in the art to determine whether the location of the entity associated with the identified geographic term is outside the viewport . If the mapping module determines the location of the entity is within the viewport the mapping module may transfer control back to the block to recenter the viewport on the location of the entity. However if the mapping module determines the location of the entity is situated outside the viewport the mapping module may additionally determine whether the location of the entity is situated in the buffer zone . If the location of the entity is in the buffer zone the mapping module may transfer control back to the block to recenter the viewport on the location of the entity. Alternatively the mapping module may not recenter the viewport but rather may transfer control to a block in order to generate a location indicator not shown that denotes the precise location of the entity within the buffer zone .

At the block the mapping module determines a general direction from the currently displayed primary map portion to the determined location of the off screen entity associated with the identified geographic term . Generally the mapping module may use the geographic coordinates of the currently displayed primary map portion and of the location of the off screen entity and trigonometric functions to determine a direction from one location to the other location. Additionally the mapping module may implement any technique known by one skilled in the art to determine a direction from one location to another location on a map such as invoking a web service or a web application programming interface API that communicates the geographic coordinates of the two locations with the server and map database and receives in response direction information associated with the two locations using basic trigonometric functions to determine direction information etc. After determining the general direction from the displayed primary map portion toward the location of the off screen entity the mapping module may generate an off screen content indicator that may indicate the direction toward the location of the off screen entity. This off screen content indicator may include the name of the off screen entity such as the city of Darwin as shown in and or an indication of a direction e.g. an arrow etc. that may point toward the location of the off screen entity a user selectable link or symbol that redirects the user to the location of the off screen content such as the location of Darwin a distance to the location of the off screen location a direction compass that points to the location of the off screen content page place data that includes information associated with the off screen content etc. As illustrated in the off screen content indicator may be placed directly in between the currently displayed primary map portion and the location of the off screen entity or in other words the off screen content indicator may be placed on an imaginary straight line that runs between the two locations. Another implementation of placing the off screen content indicator may include the mapping module first determining or the mapping module receiving from another routine a driving walking bicycling etc. route from the currently displayed primary map portion to the location of the off screen entity. This route may include roads or paths are not direct or straight lines between the two locations but rather routes that include roads or highways. Thus in this example the mapping module may place the generated off screen content indicator along or pointing to a road a path etc. that is situated outside the viewport and may also not be located on or near the straight line that run between the two locations. Alternatively as described above the mapping module may generate a location indicator not shown that denotes the precise location of the entity if the mapping module determines the entity to be situated in the buffer zone . Of course any other manner of placing the off screen content indicator may be implemented.

In any event at a block the mapping module may temporarily move shift glide etc. the viewport relative to the map toward the location of the off screen entity or to the location of the off screen content indicator so that the generated off screen content indicator is revealed to the user. Because the off screen content indicator is preferably placed just outside the initially positioned viewport the newly displayed different map portion as shown in substantially may overlap the initially displayed primary map portion as shown in . Preferably the search box does not move relative to the map but does move relative to the viewport . This effect gives the appearance to the user that the search box is affixed to the map . In moving the viewport to reveal the off screen content indicator the off screen content indicator advantageously does not occlude any map features displayed on the initially displayed primary map portion . The viewport may be temporarily shifted or moved for any duration of time however any time period between 0.5 seconds to 3 seconds is preferable. The time period may be predetermined and fixed or be dynamic depending on the application or selectable by a user. After this time period elapses the mapping module may shift the viewport back to its initial position. The mapping module may transfer control to a block .

At a block the mapping module may determine if another identification of one of the other suggested geographic terms is received. If the mapping module receives another identification of one of the other suggested geographic terms the mapping module transfers control to the block for further processing. For example in response to receiving an identification of an additional suggested geographic term from the user the mapping module may again determine whether the identified geographic term identifies an off screen entity located outside the viewport and if so may generate another off screen content indicator not shown and temporarily move or shift the viewport to reveal the newly generated off screen content indicator associated with the received identification of the additional suggested geographic term. Alternatively the mapping module may generate a different off screen content indicator in the buffer zone for each suggested geographic term received in response to the user entered geographic search term in the search box . As a result the mapping module generates and places multiple off screen content indicators within the buffer zone so that the off screen content indicators exist simultaneously. Of course the mapping module may continue to place the generated off screen content indicator and any other subsequently generated off screen content indicators in the buffer zone for any period of time. Preferably the mapping module may continue to place all generated off screen content indicators in the buffer zone until the mapping module receives a newly entered geographic search term in the search box . Beneficially the mapping module may continue to place any or all generated off screen content indicators so that the mapping module may move the viewport to reveal off screen content indicators more quickly because the mapping module does not need to process steps as described above. Moreover the mapping module may move viewport in succession from one generated off screen content indicator to another generated off screen content indicator without moving the viewport back to its initial position i.e. the primary map portion depending on the actions of the user.

In any event if a new identification is not received the mapping module transfers control to a block . At the block the mapping module determines whether any new input values related to a geographic search term have been received or if the current input values related to the geographic search term have been modified. If a new or modified input value related to the geographic search term is received the mapping module may transfer control to the block for further processing.

Several examples above discussed generating off screen content indicators after the user enters a portion of a search term but before the user submits the completed search term. However it will be understood that the off screen content indication techniques of the present disclosure are not limited to these scenarios. More generally the system may utilize these techniques whenever it is desirable to indicate content while keeping the viewport in its current position regardless of whether the user submitted a partial or complete search term. For example the user may position the viewport over the map portion and enter a search term such as movie theater. The system may determine that some of the relevant movie theaters are located within the geographic area represented by the map portion while other movie theaters are located outside the geographic area represented by the map portion . Accordingly the system may generate off screen content indicators for the other movie theaters place these indicators slightly outside the viewport and temporarily move the viewport to reveal the indicators.

The following additional considerations apply to the foregoing discussion. Throughout this specification plural instances may implement components operations or structures described as a single instance. Although individual operations of one or more methods are illustrated and described as separate operations one or more of the individual operations may be performed concurrently and nothing requires that the operations be performed in the order illustrated. Structures and functionality presented as separate components in example configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components. These and other variations modifications additions and improvements fall within the scope of the subject matter of the present disclosure.

Additionally certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components modules or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules e.g. code stored on a machine readable medium or hardware modules. A hardware module is tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments one or more computer systems e.g. a standalone client or server computer system or one or more hardware modules of a computer system e.g. a processor or a group of processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.

In various embodiments a hardware module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured e.g. as a special purpose processor such as a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC to perform certain operations. A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry e.g. as encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by cost and time considerations.

Accordingly the term hardware should be understood to encompass a tangible entity be that an entity that is physically constructed permanently configured e.g. hardwired or temporarily configured e.g. programmed to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured e.g. programmed each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example where the hardware modules comprise a general purpose processor configured using software the general purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor for example to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.

Hardware and software modules can provide information to and receive information from other hardware and or software modules. Accordingly the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware or software modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses that connect the hardware or software modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules or software are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such hardware or software modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware or software modules have access. For example one hardware or software module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware or software module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware and software modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .

The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed at least partially by one or more processors that are temporarily configured e.g. by software or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured such processors may constitute processor implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may in some example embodiments comprise processor implemented modules.

Similarly the methods or routines described herein may be at least partially processor implemented. For example at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or processors or processor implemented hardware modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments the processor or processors may be located in a single location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or as a server farm while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.

The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a cloud computing environment or as an SaaS. For example at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers as examples of machines including processors these operations being accessible via a network e.g. the Internet and via one or more appropriate interfaces e.g. application program interfaces APIs . 

Some portions of this specification are presented in terms of algorithms or symbolic representations of operations on data stored as bits or binary digital signals within a machine memory e.g. a computer memory . These algorithms or symbolic representations are examples of techniques used by those of ordinary skill in the data processing arts to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. As used herein an algorithm or a routine is a self consistent sequence of operations or similar processing leading to a desired result. In this context algorithms routines and operations involve physical manipulation of physical quantities. Typically but not necessarily such quantities may take the form of electrical magnetic or optical signals capable of being stored accessed transferred combined compared or otherwise manipulated by a machine. It is convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to such signals using words such as data content bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers numerals or the like. These words however are merely convenient labels and are to be associated with appropriate physical quantities.

Unless specifically stated otherwise discussions herein using words such as processing computing calculating determining presenting displaying or the like may refer to actions or processes of a machine e.g. a computer that manipulates or transforms data represented as physical e.g. electronic magnetic or optical quantities within one or more memories e.g. volatile memory non volatile memory or a combination thereof registers or other machine components that receive store transmit or display information.
