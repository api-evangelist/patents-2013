The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 768 330 filed Feb. 22 2013 the entire specification of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a node e.g. a transmission station and a wireless device e.g. a mobile device . Some wireless devices communicate using orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA in a downlink DL transmission and single carrier frequency division multiple access SC FDMA in an uplink UL transmission. Standards and protocols that use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM for signal transmission include the third generation partnership project 3GPP long term evolution LTE the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.16 standard e.g. 802.16e 802.16m which is commonly known to industry groups as WiMAX Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access and the IEEE 802.11 standard which is commonly known to industry groups as WiFi.

In 3GPP radio access network RAN LTE systems the node can be a combination of Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network E UTRAN Node Bs also commonly denoted as evolved Node Bs enhanced Node Bs eNodeBs or eNBs and Radio Network Controllers RNCs which communicates with the wireless device known as a user equipment UE . The downlink DL transmission can be a communication from the node e.g. eNodeB to the wireless device e.g. UE and the uplink UL transmission can be a communication from the wireless device to the node.

A core network CN or network core can be a central part of a telecommunication network that provides various services to users who are connected by the radio access network RAN . One of the functions of core network can be to route a packet from the RAN to the Internet.

The core network can provide high capacity communication facilities that connect primary nodes. Core network or backbone network can provide paths for the exchange of information between different sub networks. For enterprise private networks serving one organization the high capacity communication facilities can be referred to as the backbone while for service providers the high capacity communication facilities can be referred to as the core network.

Telecommunications network can include three parts or planes the control plane the user plane data plane or bearer plane and the management plane. The three parts can be referred to as planes because each part can be separate overlay networks. The control plane can carry control information also known as signaling . The user plane can carry the network s users traffic. The management plane can carry the operations and administration traffic used for network management.

In the 3GPP LTE wireless communication standard a system architecture evolution SAE can use a core network architecture. The SAE can have a flat all Internet protocol all IP architecture with separation of control plane and user plane traffic. A main component of the SAE architecture can be the evolved packet core EPC or SAE core.

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.

Before the present invention is disclosed and described it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures process steps or materials disclosed herein but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element. Numbers provided in flow charts and processes are provided for clarity in illustrating steps and operations and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence.

An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

The user plane protocol stack between the access point or node eNB and UE can include the packet data convergence protocol PDCP radio link control RLC medium access control MAC sub layers. On the user plane packets in the core network e.g. EPC can be encapsulated in a specific EPC protocol and tunneled between a packet data network PDN gateway PGW or P GW and the node e.g. eNB . Different tunneling protocols can be used depending on the interface. General packet radio service GPRS tunneling protocol GTP can be used on an S1 interface between the eNB and serving gateway SGW or S GW and on an S5 and or S8 interface between the SGW and PGW. Packets received by a layer can be called service data unit SDU while a packet output of a layer can be referred to by protocol data unit PDU and Internet protocol IP packets at user plane flow from top to bottom layers.

The control plane can include the addition of the radio resource control layer RRC which can be responsible for configuring the lower layers e.g. physical layer . The control plane can handle radio specific or connection specific functionality which can depend on the state of the UE which can include two states idle or connected.

In recent years mobile operators have seen significant increases in user traffic data. Although the data capacity of networks has increased the observed increase in user traffic data continues to outpace the growth of network data capacity. In general radio access network RAN user plane congestion UPCON may occur when the demand for RAN resources i.e. for the transfer of user data exceeds the capacity of the RAN resources. As a result users may receive the data with a reduced quality of service QoS . Thus the increase of network congestion may degrade the user service experience. In general user plane congestion i.e. data plane congestion or UPCON may be triggered under two scenarios 1 User plane congestion due to full use of cell capacity e.g. radio interface or air interface and 2 User plane congestion due to limitations of the 3GPP RAN to an evolved packet core EPC interface e.g. network interface . Quality of service QoS can refer to several related aspects of telephony and computer networks that allow the transport of traffic with special requirements.

Mechanisms can be used for the packet data network gateway PDN GW to avoid and handle cell overload situations. For example the PDN GW may reject packet data network PDN connection setup requests from the UEs that arrive at the PDN gateway P GW via the mobility management entity MME . The UEs may then be notified that a new PDN connection cannot be established with the network. However the PDN connection setup requests may still be sent to a presumably overloaded P GW. Furthermore a higher latency for the UEs to be notified that the PDN connections cannot be established via the P GW may exist because the PDN connection setup requests travel from an evolved node B eNB through the MME to the P GW and then back through the MME and the eNB before reaching the UEs. In addition an overload situation in the serving gateway S GW may also impact UE throughput thereby resulting in a negative user experience.

Thus in order to mitigate the effect of UPCON the core network CN may provision UPCON detection rules to the access network e.g. the RAN . The UPCON detection inks may include UPCON event triggers. As a result the access network may detect UPCON conditions based on the UPCON event triggers that are provisioned by the CN. The access network may report congestion conditions to the CN. The CN may notify an application server AS to perform one or more actions that reduce the congestion on the user plane i.e. data plane .

The core network CN may communicate policy and control charging PCC information related to user plane congestion i.e. UPCON related PCC information to the RAN. The CN may provision the UPCON related PCC information to the RAN in order to deal with UPCON situations more effectively. In other words the CN may deliver or provide the UPCON related PCC information to the RAN. In particular the UPCON related PCC information may be delivered to a RAN node an evolved node B eNB a radio network controller RNC or a base station system BSS .

The UPCON related PCC information may include an UPCON event such as an indication of RAN user plane congestion. In addition the UPCON event may include an indication that a RAN user plane congestion reporting feature has been enabled or started for a portion or all of the evolved packet system EPS bearers of the UE. The UPCON related PCC information may include one or more UPCON event triggers. The UPCON event trigger may indicate that the location of the UPCON occurs at one of a radio uplink a radio downlink a network uplink a network downlink or a RAN node processing capability.

The technology e.g. core network device nodes application server AS methods computer circuitry systems structures and mechanism as described herein can provide RAN user plane congestion UPCON awareness to notify a CN once the RAN user plane is congested and notify the CN when change and or cancellation of congestion situation once the RAN user plane congestion situation is changed or ceases i.e. disappears .

In case that the RAN e.g. 3GPP RAN user plane is uncongested after a period of congestion the RAN can notify the CN of the change and or cancellation of congestion situation in order that related core network elements e.g. a policy and charging rules function PCRF a mobility management entity MME SGW PGW an access network discovery and selection function ANDSF server an operation and maintenance O M server or an UPCON server may return to normal functionality or behave properly.

The serving gateway S GW or SCANT can route and forward user data packets while acting as a mobility anchor for a user plane during inter eNodeB handovers and as an anchor for mobility between LTE and other 3GPP technologies terminating S4 interface and relaying the traffic between 2G 3G systems and the PGW . For idle state UEs the S GW can terminate the downlink data path and triggers paging when downlink data arrives for the UE. The S GW can manage and store UE contexts parameters of the IP bearer service and network internal routing information. The S GW can perform replication of the user traffic in case of lawful interception.

The SGW protocol stack can include a S11 control plane stack to support S11 interface with the MME a S5 S8 control and data plane stacks to support S5 S8 interface with the PGW a S1 data plane stack to support S1 user plane interface with eNodeB and a S4 data plane stack to support S4 user plane interface between a radio network controller RNC of universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS and SGW of eNodeB. The SGW can support a S11 interface with the S5 S8 and S5 S8 interface with PGW. The integrated control plane stack for these SGW interfaces can include the IP an user datagram protocol UDP or an enhanced GPRS tunneling protocol control eGTP C . The SGW can support the S1 user S1 U interface with the eNodeB and S5 S8 data plane interface with the PGW. The integrated data plane stack for these SGW interfaces can include the IP the UDP or an enhanced GPRS tunneling protocol user eGTP U .

An interface can be used when a radio access bearer is established between the wireless device e.g. UE and an edge of the 3GPP core network e.g. gateway general packet radio service GPRS support node GGSN or packet data network PDN gateway P GW . The gateway GPRS support node GGSN can be a network node that acts as a gateway between a GPRS wireless data network and other networks. The GGSN can store subscriber data received from a home location register HLR and or a serving GPRS support node SGSN as well as an address of the SGSN where each wireless device is registered. The PDN gateway P GW or PGW can provide connectivity from the wireless device to external packet data networks by being the point of exit and entry of traffic for the wireless device. A wireless device can have simultaneous connectivity with more than one P GW for accessing multiple PDNs. The P GW can perform policy enforcement packet filtering for each user charging support lawful interception and packet screening. The P GW can act as the anchor for mobility between 3GPP and non 3GPP technologies such as WiMAX and 3GPP2.

The PGW protocol stack can include the S5 S8 control and data plane stacks to support S5 S8 interface with SGW . The PGW can support the S5 S8 interface with the SGW. The integrated control plane stack for the S5 S8 interfaces can include IP UDP or eGTP C. The integrated data plane stack for the S5 S8 interface can include IP UDP or eGTP U.

The MME can be used to handle the mobility related signaling functionality. In LTE the MME can be a control node to the RAN. The MME can provide for mobile device idle mode tracking and paging data retransmissions to the mobile device mobile device authenticating inter core network handover tracking of the mobile device or combinations of these functions. The MME can be involved in a bearer activation deactivation process and in choosing the S GW for the mobile device at the initial attachment and during core network CN node relocation. The MIME can generate and allocate temporary identities to the mobile devices. The MME can enforce mobile device roaming restrictions. The MME can handle the security key management and lawful interception signaling.

The MME protocol stack can include a S1 MME stack to support S1 MME interface with the eNodeB and a S11 stack to support S11 interface with the S GW. The MME can support the S1 interface with eNodeB. The intergrated S1 MME interface stack can include an Internet protocol IP a stream control transmission protocol SCTP or an S1 application part S1AP .

The policy and charging rules function PCRF can control the charging and the establishment of resources in the RAN and a packet switched PS core network . The PCRF and a policy and charging enforcement function PCEF can be closely related functional entities which can include policy control decision making and flow based charging control functionalities. The PCRF can be designed to provide network control relating to the service data flow detection quality of service QoS and flow based charging controlling to the PCEF. Whereas PCEF can provide user traffic handling and QoS at the gateway. The PCRF can also be responsible the providing service data flow detection counting along with online and offline charging interactions. The PCRF can be a dedicated policy functional entity that is standardized in 3GPP and provides policy functions for bandwidth and charging on multimedia networks. The PCRF function can act as a part of a policy charging control PCC architecture which also include the PCEF and a proxy call session control function P CSCF . The PCRF can aggregate information inside the hosting network. Therefore. PCRF can be considered as a part of an entire network architecture. The PCRF can make intelligent policy decisions for each subscriber active in the network automatically. Operational support systems OSS along with other sources e.g. portals in real time support the creation of rules which can help policy making. With the PCRF the network can offer multiple services charging rules and quality of service QoS levels. The PCRF can operate according to the received session and media related information through an application fraction AF . Then this session and media related information can be transferred to the AF of traffic planning events. The PCRF can be the entity which applies PCC rules to the PCEF using the gateway interface. Most of the subscriber information databases and other specialized functions can be accessible to PCRF. Information related to charging systems can also be accessible to PCRF in a more scalable and centralized manner. The PCRF can provide real time policy and charging rules operation.

A policy and charging enforcement function PCEF can be a functional entity which includes policy enforcement along with follow based charging functionalities as illustrated in . The PCEF functional element can be located at the gateway e.g. PGW . The PCEF can be responsible for providing controller functions in traffic handling and QoS at the gateway over the user plane and providing service data flow detection counting with including online and offline different charging interactions. The PCEF may select an appropriate PCC rule for the evaluation process of each received packet against the service data flow filters of PCC rules. The selection of the appropriate PCC title can be performed by considering the order of precedence for each PCC title. Once a packet is matched with a service data flow filter the PCC rule of a service data flow filter can be considered as the packet matching process of that particular packet. Therefore the PCC rule for that filter can be applied. The PCEF can play a role when considering a certain service data flow which can be controlled by the policy control. The service data flow can be allowed to pass through the gateway by the PCEF when a corresponding gate is accessible.

Both the PCEF and the PCRF can be functional entities involved in different levels of charging policing implementation. Both the PCEF and the PCRF can use PCC rules. The PCRF can include policy control decision and flow based charging control functions whereas the PCEF can focus on policy enforcement and follow based charging functions. When considering predefined PCC rules the PCC rules can be preconfigured by the PCEF but the activation or the deactivation of these predefined PCC rules may be performed by PCRF. The PCEF can support online and offline charging interactions whereas PCRF may not.

The access network discovery and selection function ANDSF can assist the user equipment UE to discover non 3GPP access networks such as Wi Fi or WIMAX that can be used for data communications in addition to 3GPP access networks such as high speed packet access HSPA or LTE and to provide the UE with rules policing the connection to these networks as illustrated by . The ANDSF can provide information to the UE about connectivity to 3GPP and non 3GPP access networks. The ANDSF can assist the UE to discover the access networks in their vicinity and to provide rules i.e. policies to prioritize and manage connections to these networks.

The operation and maintenance O M subsystem or server can support the management of centralized remote applications with planning measurements and optimization processes using computer aided tools. The self organizing networks SON paradigm can automate the O M functions with localized distributed centralized and hybrid architectures. These automated O M functions can be designed for a self organizing behavior reacting dynamically with the variation of network parameters and performance indicators and optimizing the overall performance and quality.

The UPCON server can be a server dedicated to managing UPCON. The UPCON server may also provide other core network functionality. An application server AS can be a software framework that provides a generalized approach to creating an application server implementation without regard to what the application functions are or AS can include a server portion of a specific implementation instance. In either case the server s function can be dedicated to the efficient execution of procedures e.g. programs routines scripts for supporting its applied applications.

Referring back to the RAN e.g. via an eNB can notify the CN e.g. EPC of the change and or cancellation of congestion situation then the related core network elements e.g. PCRF MME SGW PGW ANDSF server O M server or UPCON server can take the proper actions e.g. apply UPCON PCC rules or cancel PCC rules applicable to UPCON . The RAN can notify the CN of an user plane congestion UPCON event or situation by generating an UPCON event report and sending or transmitting the UPCON event report to the CN e.g. MME and the CN can acknowledge or report acknowledgement ACK proper receipt of the UPCON event report. Each CN device can transmit or forward the UPCON event report or to another CN device and receive a report ACK or from the other CN device.

For instance the MME can receive the UPCON event report from the eNB and report ACK to the eNB via the S1 MME interface and forward the UPCON event report to the SGW via the S11 interface. The SGW can report ACK to the MME via the S11 interface and forward the UPCON event report to the PGW PCEF via the S5 S8 interface. The PGW PCEF can report ACK to the SGW via the S5 S8 interface and forward the UPCON event report to the PCRF via the Gx interface and the PCRF can report ACK to the PGW PCEF via the Gx interface. In an example the PCRF can forward the UPCON event report to the application server AS and receive the report ACK from the AS via the Rx interface.

An UPCON event report can include a UPCON container. The UPCON container can be used to address a change or cancellation of a RAN user plane congestion situation. The UPCON container can include a congested interface indicator a severity level indicator a congestion situation indicator or an identifier ID or a name corresponding to a UPCON location. The congested interface indicator can indicate a congestion interface such as a radio interface e.g. LTE Uu Uu or a network interface e.g. Gb Iu PS S1 U . A severity level indicator can provide a predefined number indicating the severity level. For example the severity level can be a range of values e.g. 0 to 7 where the smaller number represents a severer or worse UPCON condition while a larger number represent less UPCON. In another example a larger number represents a severer or worse UPCON condition while a smaller number represent less UPCON. Different PCC rules can be applied based on the congestion severity level. In an example the congestion severity level can be represented by a multiple bits e.g. 4 bits .

A congestion situation indicator can indicate whether congestion exists e.g. a 0 bit can mean congestion disappears and a 1 bit mean congestion appears or alternatively a 1 bit can indicate that UPCON exists and a 0 bit can indicate that UPCON ceases or terminates . In an example the congestion situation indicator can be represented by a single bit. The congestion situation indicator can provide a binary or discrete value for a UPCON situation or event.

In another example when the congestion severity level is used the congestion situation indicator may not be needed. The RAN devices e.g. eNB or the CN devices may determine the congestion situation indicator based on a threshold of the congestion severity level.

For a cell based UPCON situation notification a cell identifier CID can be included in the UPCON container. For a LTE based UPCON situation notification the identifier ID can include identify a UE which can be included in the UPCON container. For an access point name APN based UPCON situation notification the APN can be included in the UPCON container. For packet data protocol PDP context and or evolved packet system EPS bearer based UPCON situation notification a relative ID can be included in the UPCON container.

Various processes and procedures can be used for the RAN to report the UPCON events to the CN. The AS of can include the ANDSF server the O M server or the UPCON server which can collect the RAN user plane congestion situation. illustrates UPCON event reporting directly to the PCRF or the AS from the eNB PCEF . The eNB PCEF can forward the UPCON event report to the PCRF and receive the report ACK from the PCRF. In an example the PCRF can forward the UPCON event report to the AS and receive the report ACK from the AS.

Various actions can be taken by the CN or CN device when the UPCON event report or congestion notification is received. For instance when the PCRF receives the UPCON event report or congestion notification the PCRF may initiate an Internet protocol IP connectivity access network IP CAN session modification procedure to accommodate PCC rules for the UPCON situation. When the server e.g. ANDSF O M and or UPCON server receives the UPCON event report or congestion notification the server may trigger the UE or the AS to enable a related provisioned rule or initiate a relative rule provision or modification procedure to the UE or the AS. When the MME receives the UPCON event report or congestion notification the MME may trigger the IP CAN session modification procedure to accommodate the changed UPCON condition. When the SGSN receives the UPCON event report or congestion notification the SGSN may trigger the PDP context and or IP CAN session modification procedure to accommodate the changed UPCON condition. When the P GW receives the UPCON event report or congestion notification the P GW may trigger the P CAN session modification procedure to accommodate the changed UPCON condition. When the GGSN receives the UPCON event report or congestion notification the GGSN may trigger the PDP context modification procedure to accommodate the changed UPCON condition.

If the UPCON event report or congestion notification indicates S1 U congestion the S GW may modify the QoS mapping on S1 U and handle the UPCON event internally. In another example the S GW may also trigger IP CAN session modification procedure to accommodate the changed UPCON condition.

Another example provides a method for notifying a core network CN of user plane congestion UPCON as shown in the flow chart in . The method may be executed as instructions on a machine or computer circuitry where the instructions are included on at least one computer readable medium or one non transitory machine readable storage medium. The method includes the operation of receiving an UPCON container in an UPCON event report wherein the UPCON container includes a congestion situation indicator to indicate a UPCON situation as in block . The next operation of the method can be modifying an UPCON process based on the congestion situation indicator as in block .

In an example. The UPCON container can include a congestion severity level indicator in a range of values to indicate a congestion severity level. The operation of modifying the UPCON process can further include modifying the UPCON process based on the congestion severity level indicator. In another example the UPCON container can include a congested interface indicator to indicate a congested radio interface or a congested network interface. The operation of modifying the UPCON process can further include modifying the UPCON process based on the congested interface indicator.

In another configuration the UPCON container can include a cell identifier CID for a cell based UPCON situation a UE identity ID for a UE based UPCON situation an access point name APN for a APN based UPCON situation a relative ID for a packet data protocol PDP context based UPCON situation or an enhanced presence service EPS bearer based UPCON situation. The operation of modifying the UPCON process can further include modifying the UPCON process based on an ID e.g. CID UE ID or relative ID or a name e.g. APN . The core network can include a mobility management entity MME a serving gateway S GW a packet data network PDN gateway P GW a policy and charging enforcement function PCEF a policy and charging rules function PCRF a serving general packet radio service GPRS support node SGSN a gateway GPRS support node GGSN an access network discovery and selection function ANDSF an operation and maintenance O M subsystem an UPCON server a proxy or a standalone function entity.

In another example the operation of modifying the UPCON process can further include initiating an Internet protocol IP connectivity access network UP CAN session modification procedure to implement new policy and charging control PCC rules when the CN includes a policy and charging rules function PCRF triggering a user equipment UE or an application server AS to enable a related provisioned rule or initiating the related rule provision or modification procedure to the UE or the AS when the CN includes an access network discovery and selection function ANDSF an operation and maintenance O M subsystem or an UPCON server triggering the IP CAN session modification procedure to accommodate a changed UPCON condition when the CN includes a mobility management entity MME triggering a packet data protocol PDP context or the IP CAN session modification procedure to accommodate the changed UPCON condition when the CN includes a serving general packet radio service GPRS support node SGSN triggering the PDP context modification procedure to accommodate the changed UPCON condition when the CN includes a gateway GPRS support node GGSN triggering the IP CAN session modification procedure to accommodate the changed UPCON condition when the CN includes a packet data network PDN gateway P GW or modifying a quality of service QoS mapping on a S1 U interface or triggering the IP CAN session modification procedure to accommodate the changed UPCON condition when the CN includes a serving gateway S GW .

In another configuration the operation of modifying the UPCON process can further include canceling the UPCON process when the congestion situation indicator indicates the UPCON situation ceases. In another example the method can further include acknowledging ACK the UPCON event report upon successful receipt of the UPCON event report or forwarding the UPCON event report to an application server AS or another device in the CN.

In another example the change of the UPCON process cancels the UPCON process when the congestion situation indicator indicates the UPCON situation is terminated.

Various techniques or certain aspects or portions thereof may take the form of program code i.e. instructions embodied in tangible media such as floppy diskettes compact disc read only memory CD ROMs hard drives non transitory computer readable storage medium or any other machine readable storage medium wherein when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine such as a computer the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the various techniques. Circuitry can include hardware firmware program code executable code computer instructions and or software. A non transitory computer readable storage medium can be a computer readable storage medium that does not include signal. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers the computing device may include a processor a storage medium readable by the processor including volatile and non volatile memory and or storage elements at least one input device and at least one output device. The volatile and non volatile memory and or storage elements may be a random access memory RAM erasable programmable read only memory EPROM flash drive optical drive magnetic hard drive solid state drive or other medium for storing electronic data. The node and wireless device may also include a transceiver module i.e. transceiver a counter module i.e. counter a processing module i.e. processor and or a clock module i.e. clock or timer module i.e. timer . One or more programs that may implement or utilize the various techniques described herein may use an application programming interface API reusable controls and the like. Such programs may be implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However the program s may be implemented in assembly or machine language if desired. In any case the language may be a compiled or interpreted language and combined with hardware implementations.

It should be understood that many of the functional units described in this specification have been labeled as modules in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. For example a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom very large scale integration VLSI circuits or gate arrays off the shelf semiconductors such as logic chips transistors or other discrete components. A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays programmable array logic programmable logic devices or the like.

Modules may also be implemented in software for execution by various types of processors. An identified module of executable code may for instance comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions which may for instance be organized as an object procedure or function. Nevertheless the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which when joined logically together comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module.

Indeed a module of executable code may be a single instruction or many instructions and may even be distributed over several different code segments among different programs and across several memory devices. Similarly operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set or may be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices and may exist at least partially merely as electronic signals on a system or network. The modules may be passive or active including agents operable to perform desired functions.
