This application claims the benefit of the filing of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 795 399 entitled Electronic Tablet Storage and Management Apparatus and System filed on 16 Oct. 2012 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates generally to systems for storing and managing access to and use of electronic devices. More particularly the disclosed invention relates to a system and apparatus for managed storage and use of one or more portable digital tablet computing devices.

Portable hand held computers often called tablets are rapidly increasing in popularity and use in a wide variety of contexts and settings. Digital tablets are flat portable computer devices adapted and sized for use while held in a user s hand. A tablet for purposes of this disclosure thus includes a mobile computer typically integrated with a flat touch screen and primarily but not necessarily exclusively operated by touching the screen rather than using a physical keyboard. Tablets often use an onscreen virtual keyboard. Some older or specialized tablets receive input from a stylus created specifically for the device and electrical sensors in the face of the tablet detect the pen and allow the user to input information.

Much more commonly and more important currently are the aforementioned touch pad tablets in which pressure sensitive icons are operated by the tips of the user s fingers. Such tablet computer devices most frequently use capacitive touch screens with multi touch capabilities unlike the earlier stylus driven resistive touchscreen devices. Some tablets allow a user to execute word processing and spreadsheets while certain and selected others permit not only these activities but also media consumption and generation such as web browsing email and social media GPS satellite navigation photo stills and video camera functions photo and video viewing and editing downloadable apps portable media player functions and or e reading capabilities. Widely popular tablets include the nine inch diagonal screen iPad devices available from Apple Inc. and the Samsung Galaxy Tab device from Samsung Electronics Co. Other tablet manufacturers include HTC Motorola Sony and Microsoft. There is a widely held perception that mobile tablet computers will render obsolete the standard desk top computers in many contexts including educational settings.

Besides their increasing popularity in the consumer market generally tablet computers are used increasingly in institutional contexts particularly schools and universities. The availability of computers especially including portable tablet type devices will increasingly become an integral and essential qualification for a student s daily tasks. However with the advantages of a portable tablet computer come the attendant disadvantages of storing the tablets and controlling their accessibility and use especially in instructional settings involving many students simultaneously. Improperly stored and or managed tablets are vulnerable not only to adverse environmental conditions but also to tampering and theft. Further it is desirable to provide means by which a supervisor such as a teacher or proctor can monitor the condition and use of many tablet devices in for example a classroom setting and assure their replacement and proper storage when not in use.

There is disclosed hereafter a computer tablet storage system featuring a main dock and a tablet holder. A system according to the invention may have one or many main docks and one or many tablet holders although the number of main docks ordinarily will equal the number of tablet holders. A computer tablet is retained within each tablet holder and the tablet holder is insertable into and removable from an associated main dock. While inside the main dock the tablet is secure and may be protected against damage and unauthorized use. The main dock includes a front panel assembly defining a bay door aperture a dock housing substantially enclosing a hollow interior a tablet tray assembly movable toward and away from the bay door aperture and within the interior of the dock housing and means such as a controllable motor cooperative with gears pinions for moving the tablet tray assembly within the dock housing. The tablet holder is releasably engageable with the tray assembly and is adapted to receive and retain a computer tablet. In the system the tablet tray assembly is movable between a tray forward position in which any tablet holder engaged with the tray assembly is at least partially extended through the bay door aperture by the movement of the tray assembly and a tray back position in which any tablet engaged with the tray assembly is retracted completely within the dock housing interior.

Certain component label numerals provided in the text hereinafter provide the figure number followed by the component number in that view e.g. label numeral refers to component labeled number in drawing figure number . The various drawing figures are not necessarily to scale either between figures or within a single FIGURE.

There is disclosed hereby a system and apparatus for providing regulated storage and use of one or more mobile digital tablet devices. The system according to this disclosure may be referred to generally herein by an acronym TDD system. There is in a TDD system at least one tablet delivery device TDD apparatus. The TDD apparatus in its very simplest embodiment features a docking station featuring a main dock and a tablet holder. The tablet holder houses and protects an individual associated tablet. The tablet holder with a tablet situated therein also interacts with the main dock of the docking station. It is contemplated but not required that an undocked tablet is used in the general vicinity of its associated dock.

The docking station is adapted for installation upon for example a desk table workstation or other substantial foundation where the tablet computer is to be stored for use there being one docking station provided for each tablet. The foundation such as the desk cart or heavy duty table preferably is located proximately to or is in communication with a suitable power source so that the TDD system may be supplied with electrical power during use and the tablet s batteries can be charged during tablet storage.

The main dock of a docking station preferably is very securely mounted and installed in or on the foundation such that a tablet computer is secured against unauthorized access and theft. This may be accomplished for example through the usage of tamper resistant screws e.g. machine threaded rather than self tapping perhaps in relatively hidden or inaccessible locations. An object of the invention is that the tablet is difficult to remove from its tablet holder the tablet holder is difficult to remove from its associated dock and the dock is difficult to detach from its foundation without proper authorization and tools keys. The preferred means for mounting a main dock to its foundation promotes serviceability longevity that is the dock can be repeatedly be removed and re installed while minimizing damage to the fastener holes typically screw holes in the foundation. For example key hole type fastener holes in the dock housing permit the dock to be shifted slightly and then detached from its foundation by loosening but not completely removing fastener screws extending through the key holes.

One or more docking stations also could be mounted for example on or in a bookcase or cabinet a plurality of tablets may be retrievably stored in a central location. Further a plurality of docking stations may be mounted and installed for use upon a movable foundation such as a wheeled cart or dolly so that many tablets can be stored and charged thereon and yet authorized personnel can for example roll the cart or dolly in and out of a lockable classroom closet. In such a context multiple docks are stacked and physically mounted or integrated with the cart users thus may restore a plurality of tablets to a secure central storage charging location from disparate and potentially widely dispersed usage locations.

The present system further provides for controlled and monitored usage of a plurality of tablets from a central location such as a classroom lectern. The preferred embodiment of the TDD system features communication preferably wireless between a master control and one or more main docking stations integrated in the system whereby a supervising user of the system may operate the master control to activate deactivate a smart button at all or selected ones the docking stations. Such an arrangement provides that the docking station s cannot be operated by individual users unless access is granted by a supervisor at the master control. The communication between the master control and the docking station s optionally may be two way to permit for example 1 error reporting signal to master control display from any docking station suffering a mechanical jam or other operational error and or 2 successful docking notification i.e. signal to master control display reporting when a tablet holder is successfully docked allowing the supervising user to know when tablet s are returned and docked . However a preferred embodiment may have a simple one way communication whereby the main dock is locked or unlocked by means of an enabling disabling signal communication from the master control to the main dock.

There are disclosed hereafter options for how the TDD system is powered and how data may flow in the system for monitoring and controlling usage of one or more tablets. In one optional embodiment of a TDD system each docking station is supplied by power over Ethernet PoE whereby each docking station is supplied with electrical power via CAT 5 or CAT 6 cable. The docking stations may be hard wired in parallel to a common source of electrical energy. For example a transformer s bank may receive for example conventional 110 VAC 0.5 amp current and step the current down to about 5.2 VDC about 2.4 amp for distribution to a grouped plurality of main docks.

Thus a system according to the present disclosure includes at least one main dock in cooperative utility with a tablet holder which tablet holder retains a portable tablet computer for use in the system. A main dock is depicted generally in B and A C herein while additional possible details of the dock such as the dock are provided with reference to . A tablet holder is shown generally in while illustrative details of such a holder are shown in .

A master control is in signal communication with the dock in any of several ways described further herein. In one basic version of the TDD system the docking and undocking sequences are controlled via the master control such as the control seen in . The master control may be a remote control having buttons for manual operation by the supervisor e.g. parent or classroom instructor. Referring to the remote master control may have an indicator light indicating the charged battery or powered status of the control. There also is provided an appropriately labeled or colored lock button which when depressed causes the control to transmit a lock signal to the dock s . An unlock button causes transmission of an unlock signal to the dock s of the system. The lock and unlock signals open and close a smart button circuit in each dock disabling or enabling the dock s smart button .

The disclosed TDD system may find particular utility in classroom settings. Reference is invited to showing that in one possible application of the invention a plurality of individual TDD docking stations thirty depicted in each individually labeled as TDD are deployed in a classroom layout. Each docking station TDD is as seen in the figure adjacent to and associated with a student workstation individual student chairs are seen in plan view in . Each docking station is mounted upon a foundation in the illustrated embodiment a long table . shows thirty docking stations TDD five stations on each of six foundation tables . In this embodiment of the inventive system each docking station is in wireless communication with a master control at a central location such as a lectern. The master control includes indicator light s and button s for communicating electronically preferably wirelessly with the various docking stations. A supervisory user such as a teacher may control the docking stations TDD from the master control .

In preferred embodiments using a plurality of docking stations in communication with a central master control a linking system is provided. Such a linking system may exploit any suitable known or yet to be developed wired or wireless communications components and techniques for permitting the master control to transmit command and control signals to the docking stations TDD. Possible linking systems also permit communication signals to be transmitted from individual docking stations to the master control.

In this embodiment there is two way communication between the master control i.e. at the lectern and the various system hubs. This two way communication is by means of a transceiver e.g. 900 MHz or 2.4 GHz at the master control and a transceiver in each system hub . Two way communication between each docking station TDD and its system hub is by the CAT 5e hardwire. Alternatively a Wi Fi communication may be established between a system hub and its respective docking stations whereby an individual docking station TDD does not report to the master control rather a docking station reports to its associated system hub and that system hub then reports to the master control. Similarly communication from the master control to a given docking station is via the intermediate corresponding system hub .

A possible hybrid linking system is depicted diagrammatically in . This hybrid system shares some features with the transceiver linking system of . However this hybrid system utilizes a regime of paired transmitter and receiver at each system hub as well as a transmitter and receiver at the master control . Thus more radio communicators transmitters and separate receivers are required than in an embodiment deploying transceivers at each hub and in the master control. The master control transmitter sends commands to a receiver at a system hub and the system hub transmits a report signal back to the master control receiver thereby providing two way communication between hub and the master control. A docking station TDD does not transmit to the master control receiver rather a docking station communicates e.g. via cable with its associated system hub and the hub communicates with the master control. The hub sends command signals via for example CAT 5e cable to regulate operation of a docking station. The various antennae should be carefully located to minimize cross talk problem between hubs for example.

Still another alternative embodiment of a possible TDD system with a plurality of docking stations and a central control is depicted in . The system of is similar in some general respects to that of with the exception that communication is one way between the master control and the system hubs . The master control i.e. at the lectern operates a transmitter e.g. 433 MHz and each system hub is equipped with a compatible receiver. The supervising user may operate the master control to transmit wirelessly commands to a system hub but the hub cannot respond back to the master control. Thus an individual docking station TDD cannot report to the master control and a system hub cannot transmit to the master control. A docking station can however transmit signals to its associated system hub via Wi Fi or the Ethernet CAT 5 connection. A hub receiving command s from the lectern s master control allows regulation and control of each of its docking stations by means of signals transmitted via that hub. An advantage of one way communication from master control to docking station as described is the elimination of the possibility of cross talk between system hubs or miscommunication from the master control to the wrong system hub. Accordingly the advantage could be realized in an alternative embodiment in which the one way communication is from the docking station to the master control in the same general transmitter receiver set up. The embodiment of is similar to and may be adaptable from a system currently commercially available from Nova Solutions Inc. of Effingham Ill. USA under its NOVALINKED system for regulating access to multi station computer monitors. The NOVALINKED system is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2013 0018510 published on 17 Jan. 2013 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. This embodiment also may be adapted to be compatible and used with commercially available multi station control systems such as CRESTON systems AMX systems and EXTRON systems.

Yet another alternative embodiment may have each docking station communicate directly with the master control through Wi Fi transmission or the like. It may be desired in domestic residential setting for example for a parent to have direct control over a few perhaps even a single portable computer tablet used by a the parent s child. The parent may desire to regulate frequency and duration of use of a tablet by the child ren in which case the tablet can be secured inside a main dock such as that seen in . show a single main dock in isolation from any particular foundation not seen in . It should be understood that the main dock when in use is installed securely to a foundation such as a table desk inside a wall mounted cabinet or the like. When only one or a small few e.g. 2 4 tablets are under such regulation by the parent a single portable master control is provided which is in wireless communication with each main dock by for example infrared RF BLUETOOTH or any other suitably adapted communication protocol. Thus the parent or other supervisor s master control effectively is a remote control for the main dock . The supervisor who has strictly limited access to the master control e.g. of controls access to the tablet inside the main dock .

The docking station features a main dock in which the tablet is stored when not in use. The main dock includes a main dock housing body which houses or mounts the other assemblies and elements of a docking station. A typical dock housing body has a bottom two lateral sides and a back end which may be molded as an integral unit. The substantially hollow interior of the dock housing body preferably is provided with reinforcement ribs to lend the body structural strength and also features lugs for receiving screws or other attachment means whereby other elements may be fastened within or to the body. When fully assembled the dock is covered by a dock top cover which is attached to the dock body by any suitable means to provide a secure enclosure for the main dock. The main dock includes a front panel assembly for enclosing the front of the main dock. The front panel assembly to be described more fully herein includes a bay door and defines a bay door aperture by which means a tablet holder and tablet can be inserted into and retrieved from the interior of the main dock.

As mentioned the dock includes a main dock body fabricated from a suitable durable and substantially rigid material such as high pressure injection molded plastic e.g. ABS or PCABS . A bay door aperture is defined in the front panel assembly of the main dock through into and out of which the tablet passes when being extended ejected and inserted retracted.

Attention is invited to providing isolated views of a preferred embodiment of a TDD main dock . is a perspective view of the front and top of an assembled dock . The main dock is depicted with a master remote control which is in the simplest embedment of the system is in wireless communication with at least one dock . Seen in is the box like main dock body which has a bottom with two sidewalls perpendicular to the bottom. Visible at the front of the main dock is the front panel assembly including a main or bay door assembly to be described further herein. The dock top cover is visible fastened to the top of the main dock body. is a perspective view of the back and bottom of an assembled dock . suggests that the bottom of the dock body preferably is molded integrally with the two side walls and the back wall. Visible in the back wall are various jacks and ports e.g. for receiving RJ 45 connectors and sockets by which cables and cords may be plugged into the main dock .

A docking station also includes a tablet holder which holds the tablet and promotes its proper operational engagement with the main dock. shows a main dock similar to that seen in . depicts a possible tablet holder according to the present disclosure containing its associated tablet. In the tablet holder is seen located close to the front panel assembly including the bay door of the main dock . The tablet holder is in position for insertion into the main dock the tablet holder is proximate to and aligned with the bay door aperture of the dock. During operation of the docking station the bay door opens and the tablet holder containing the tablet is manually inserted into the main dock . The tablet holder engages with a movable tray assembly not visible in inside the main dock body. illustrates the position of the tablet holder after the tablet holder has been engaged into the tray assembly just prior to the rearward movement of the tray assembly. The docking station then operates to retract the tablet holder completely within the main dock the bay door closes and the tablet holder is secured within the dock body. The docking station with the tablet holder within the dock appears as seen in . When a user desires access to the tablet the bay door opens the tray assembly moves forward within the main dock and the tablet holder is presented to the user in the position of . The user grasps the tablet holder and withdraws it from the main dock e.g. and the tray assembly moves backward in the dock and the bay door shuts as the docking station resumes its appearance of .

The main dock houses motor and gearing components by which a tablet tray is controllably driven to move back and forth within the hollow interior of the dock body. The motor and gearing components hereinafter describe serve as means for moving the tablet tray assembly including the tray itself forward and backward within the dock housing. Functions of the dock are electrically powered preferably by a relatively low voltage direct current. The dock preferably is hard wired to a DC power source nevertheless in a preferred embodiment the dock is provided e.g. at the rear of the dock with a conventional DC port to permit alternative DC powering option in the event a dock is used in for example an individual personalized or non classroom environment. Operation regulation and signal generation and processing is provided by means including digital computing printed circuit board s within the dock . The tray assembly which receives and releasably engages the tablet holder which in turn holds a tablet computer has powered movement forward in the dock and backward in the dock respectively to retract the tray into a home position for storing the tablet inside the dock and to shift the tray forward to present a portion of the tablet holder outside the dock for retrieval by the user. The motor drive preferably is provided with over torque and or high current sensors to prevent damage to the system in the event of jams motion obstructions or similar malfunctions. A spring assist optionally may be provided in the dock to allow non motorized partial ejection of the tablet for use. A swinging or rotating bay door preferably is provided on the front panel of the dock body to cover or close the bay door aperture when the tablet tray is not in use thereby to improve stored tablet security and to prevent foreign matter from entering the interior of the dock . The movement opening closing of the bay door preferably is controllably motor driven. Like the drive for the tray assembly the motor drive for the bay door preferably is provided with over torque and or high current sensors to prevent damage to the system or harm to the user s hand in the event of jams or obstructions.

There may be supplied in the dock an auxiliary charging port such as a USB port for other device charging via the dock.

There further is provided a mechanical means whereby movement of the tray assembly in the dock housing effectuates an unlocking locking interaction between the tablet holder and the dock whereby the tablet holder is secured within the dock when the tablet is docked and the tablet tray assembly is in a home or tray back position within the dock housing. For instance a fixed ramp feature within the dock may co act with a moveable element on the tablet tray assembly such that the linear movement of the tray assembly relative to the ramp engages disengages with the element to lock unlock the tablet holder in the tray. In alternative embodiments a sensor e.g. infrared transmitter detector may be provided in the vicinity of the dock s bay door aperture to detect and signal the insertion of a foreign object into the aperture during the time the bay door is open but no tablet is present.

The dock body preferably features on its exterior as seen e.g. in preferably on the front panel a smart button . The smart button on the main dock is a button means by which a user actuates motor gearing and switching means for moving the tablet tray assembly within the dock housing thereby to execute the function of the docking station including the dock opening undock sequence operation. The smart button may be a capacitive sensing device similar to those used on tablet computers which exploits capacitive coupling for operation. Or the smart button may be a small resistive touch screen type of button or even employ simpler mechanical switching to initiate action sequences of the docking station. The smart button on the dock preferably is the sole control button at a docking station.

The bay door on the dock opens at the beginning of a docking or undocking sequence either of which may be initiated by the user s manual operation of the smart button at his docking station. Alternatively in possible embodiments a docking or undocking sequence may be started by the operation of the master control by a supervising user. Preferably however there is provided means for early docking whereby an individual user may operate his smart button to initiate the opening of the bay door and the commencement of the docking sequence at his docking station independently of the master control. Alternatively and as explained further herein a docking sequence may be commenced by the tablet user by simply bringing the tablet holder in a proper proximate position near the bay door of the main dock .

One or more indicators such as one or more lights such as for example only red and or green LEDs optionally capable of variable or intermittent brilliance are provided on the front panel or other outer surface of the dock to indicate the docking station status e.g. tablet ready dock locked etc. . The indicator light on the dock preferably provides visual indication of the charged status of a docked tablet s battery for those tablet models able to output battery charge status though their charge port . A preferred embodiment of the dock also includes a built in sensor such as a reed switch not shown in or A C which is triggered i.e. by a magnet in the tablet holder to detect when the tablet holder is removed to signal the automatic closure of the dock s bay door and or is brought near the dock s aperture in which case the dock bay door automatically opens . In embodiments including the automatic opening of the dock bay door by the detection of tablet holder proximity by the built in reed switch or Hall Effect sensor the tablet docking sequence may also be automatically initiated in which case the bay door opens immediately which may necessitate separately operable drive motors for the tablet tray and the bay door. The bay door may be spring loaded when closing to minimize pinching but preferably is motorized to open and close with electrical or mechanical overload protection. The dock s bay door may operate in communication with suitable limit switches to detect door position so that the dock is not left inadvertently open. 

There may be provided in certain embodiments in combination with the dock a metal holder customized e.g. from sheet metal not depicted in drawing figures to receive and hold securely the dock which holder is devised to be mounted upon the foundation table desk etc. . In such embodiments the dock housing has features defined thereon whereby the metal holder releasably holds the dock in place but the dock can be removed from the holder for servicing or replacement. It is preferred in all embodiments however that the dock is configured and assembled such that in a preferred installation of upon a foundation e.g. table or cart the only screws accessible are those used to mount the dock to the foundation. Alternatively the dock housing may be devised and configured according to security concepts known in the art whereby a specialized key or tool is required to open the dock housing to obtain access to interiorly disposed screws or other fasteners for mounting the dock to the foundation.

Attention is invited to illustrating details of a possible embodiment of a main dock corresponding generally to the main dock depicted in and . As mentioned the main dock housing is a flat box e.g. molded ABS for containing the other functional components of the main dock. Most of the contained components of the main dock e.g. dock are fabricated from suitable molded plastic or of stamped metals. Securely attached to the front of the main dock housing by means including a front panel bracket on the dock housing is the front panel assembly including the bay door which shall be described further. Also seen in is the tablet tray assembly which moves forward and backward within the main dock housing. The powered motion of the tray assembly is provided by a motor and gear assembly which in this embodiment is located centrally upon the tablet tray assembly. Thus the motor and gear assembly for driving the tray assembly in this embodiment is located upon and moves with the tray assembly itself. The motor and gear assembly includes a motor bracket upon the rear of the tray assembly approximately halfway between the lateral sides of the tray assembly for mounting the tray motor A to the rear of the tray assembly . The tray motor A may be for example a SOLAROBOTICS brand motor Model GM20. A tray motor gear B is functionally connected to the drive shaft of the tray motor A and is situated below the tray assembly so to be engageable with a notched rack defined or affixed upon the inside bottom of the dock housing . The tray motor gear B is rotatably mounted in relation to the tray assembly and its powered rotation drives the movement of the tablet tray assembly.

Defined or provided on the central inside bottom of the housing is a rack running along a portion of the housing bottom e.g. equi spaced from and parallel to the housing sidewalls as seen in . A series of notches in the rack are engageable with the teeth of the tray motor gear B. The rotary motion of the tray gear B thus is imparted to the tray assembly and converted to linear translation by a rack and pinion type arrangement generally according to known principles. The rotation of the tray motor gear B engages serially its teeth into successive notches of the rack . Because the tray assembly is moveable but the rack is not the rotating tray gear moves the tray assembly forward and backward within the dock depending upon the direction of the tray motor gear s rotation.

Positioning and movement of the tray assembly within the main dock are guided by a right tray rail and a left tray rail . The tray rails are disposed mutually parallel within the dock housing and are spaced apart a distance corresponding generally to the outside width dimension of the tray assembly . The rails may be removably fastened to the inside bottom of the dock housing by means of bosses or lugs four seen along left inside portion of housing in corresponding to apertured fastener lugs on the outsides of the rails four seen on each tray rail . Portions e.g. side flanges below the rails of the tray assembly are in smooth lubricated only if needed sliding contact with the tray rails . The rails particularly limit vertical shifting e.g. hold down of the tray assembly thereby maintaining the proper position and alignment of the tray assembly throughout its range of movement. There also preferably is provided a pair of lower guide rails only left side lower guide rail seen in the right side lower guide rail is located and oriented equivalently on the right side floor of the dock on the floor of the dock housing . Each lower guide rail is adjacent to a corresponding side of the movable tablet tray assembly and may be in smooth sliding contact therewith to prevent significant lateral shifting either to the right or to the left of the tray assembly during its movements forw3ard and backward within the main dock.

Movement of the tray assembly may be regulated electronically by the function of a pair of limit switches one situated near the inside front of the dock housing and a second located near the back of the inside of the dock housing. The tray back limit switch is seen in mounted near the rear region of the dock. Tray back limit switch may be for example an E SWITCH brand switch Model SS0750301F020PIA. The tray forward limit switch which likewise may also be a suitably configured E SWITCH Model SS0750301F020PIA is located inside the dock housing near the front panel assembly . Actuation of the limit switches and serve to activate deactivate operation of the tray motor A to stop the movement of the tray assembly at the maximum extents of its movement.

The limit switches are in signal communication with a motherboard processing unit . The motherboard is a processing unit running firmware for the simple signal transception and processing involved in the operation of the TDD system. The firmware runs routines within the ordinary skill of the computer programming arts. The motherboard may be mounted inside the dock housing and above the tablet tray assembly by means of tall mounting bosses three visible in . Accordingly the tablet tray assembly is slidably situated between the motherboard and the bottom of the dock housing and moves forward and back between the limit switches . A flex cable connected to the motherboard and to the tray assembly provides power and signal transmission between them.

It is seen therefore that regulated operation of the tray motor A by the drive train provided by the tray motor gear B and the rack permits the controlled movement of the tray assembly forward and rearward within the dock housing . The limit switches in cooperation with the motherboard prevent over extension of the tray assembly s movements by deactivating the tray motor A at appropriate junctures.

Continued reference is made to . There are defined or provided on the bottom of the dock housing at least one preferably at least two four seen in tapered ramps . The ramps are immovable on the floor of the dock s interior. The ramps preferably are mutually parallel and typically are parallel to the sidewalls and are aligned with one another with respect to their positions front to back within the dock. The ramps are tapered upwardly progressing from the front portion of each ramp to the back portion. Thus the front most portion of each ramp essentially rises from the floor of the dock s interior and has a front surface or edge that inclines upward to the rear portion. The rear portion of each ramp has a top edge that obtains the ramp s maximum height above the dock floor which top edge runs parallel to the floor for a short distance. These ramps are slidably contactable with a tablet holder lock plate when the tray assembly is moving rearward in the dock e.g. dock of in a manner to be described further herein releasably to lock the tablet holder e.g. holder in as engaged in the tray assembly within the dock when the tablet holder is retracted to the home position within the dock.

Also seen in is the dock top cover which is fastened to the top of the dock housing to complete the enclosure of the dock. The dock top cover may be fastened in place by screws or rivets for example there being eight fasteners seen in .

Reference is made to for details of a possible alternative embodiment of the main dock again corresponding to dock seen in B and . The main dock housing is generally the same as that described for the embodiment of . The front panel assembly including the bay door is secured to the front of the dock housing . Also seen in is the tablet tray assembly which moves forward and backward within the main dock housing generally as previously described. The powered motion of the tray assembly is provided by a motor and gear assembly which in this embodiment is located to one side of the dock s interior i.e. against the right side wall in . The motor and gear assembly includes a motor bracket A for mounting the tray motor B to the interior of the main dock housing . The tray motor B may be for example a POLOLU brand motor Model 1163. If a POLOLU Model 1163 is utilized a motor step gear C is functionally located intermediately between the tray motor B and the tray gear E whereby a driving gear train is provided between the drive shaft of the tray motor and the tray gear. The tray gear E is rotatably mounted in the dock and its powered rotation drives the movement of the tablet tray assembly . An alternative tray motor D in lieu of motor B is a SOLORBOTICS Model GM20. A SOLORBOTICS tray motor D offers the possibility of a direct drive from the tray motor shaft to the tray gear E advantageously avoiding the need for an intermediate step gear.

Defined in or provided on the side of the tray assembly adjacent to the tray gear E is a rack running along the side of the tray assembly and engageable with the teeth of the tray gear. The rotary motion of the tray gear thus is imparted to the tray assembly and converted to linear translation by a rack and pinion type arrangement generally according to known principles. The rotation of the tray gear E engages teeth of that gear serially into consecutive notches of the tray assembly s side rack because the tray assembly is moveable but the tray gear is not except in rotation the rotating tray gear moves the tray assembly forward and backward within the dock housing depending upon the direction of the tray gear s rotation.

Positioning and movement of the tray assembly within the main dock are guided by a right tray rail and a left tray rail and lower guide rails only left side lower guide rail seen in generally in accordance with the description of the corresponding tray rail components of the embodiment of . The sides of the tray assembly are in smooth lubricated only if needed sliding contact with the tray rails to maintain the proper position and alignment of the tray assembly throughout its range of movement.

Generally similarly to the function of the embodiment the movement of the tray assembly may be regulated electronically by the function of the pair of limit switches. The tray back limit switch is seen in mounted near the rear region of the dock. Tray back limit switch may be for example an E SWITCH Model SS0750301F020PIA. The tray forward limit switch which likewise may also be a suitably configured E SWITCH Model SS0750301F020PIA is located in the dock housing near the front panel assembly . Actuation of the limit switches and serve to activate deactivate operation of the tray motor B or C to stop the movement of the tray assembly at the maximum reach of its movement.

The limit switches are in signal communication with a motherboard processing unit . The motherboard is mounted inside the dock housing and above the tablet tray assembly in accordance with the description of the embodiment of . Accordingly the tablet tray assembly is slidably situated between the motherboard and the bottom of the dock housing and moves forward and back between the limit switches . A flex cable connected to the motherboard and the tray assembly provides power and signal transmission between them.

The embodiment of has the ramps disposed upon the floor of the dock housing in the same way and configuration as previously described. The ramps perform the same function in both the embodiments of .

In a preferred embodiment the bay door is generally cylindrical with a length the cylinder height approximately equal to the lateral width of the bay door aperture in the module . Extending from the right end of the bay door is an axle pin as seen in . The axle pin extends through the axle aperture in the module s right side terminal flange and is rotatably disposed in that axle journal. The left end in of the bay door is operably engaged with the bay door motor and is suitably supported for rotation in cooperation with the motor s drive shaft. The bay door is thereby rotatably mounted on and behind the dock face module . In one embodiment the bay door defines diametrically there though a tablet holder slot. The tablet slot has a height corresponding generally to the height of the bay door aperture in the module which in turn is slightly greater than the thickness of the tablet holder . The width of the tablet slot runs nearly the axial length of the bay door and approximates in its width the lateral extent of the bay door aperture in the dock face module . In the bay door is in a closed position so the tablet holder slot is oriented vertically a solid exterior panel portion of the bay door thus faces forward so that if the bay door were disposed in the module without changing their relative positions the solid panel portion would cover and close the bay door aperture in the module. It is understood from that rotating the bay door ninety degrees may move the door from an open condition i.e. with the tablet holder slot aligned in orthogonal registration with the bay door aperture to a closed condition i.e. with the tablet holder slot oriented parallel to the front panel of the module in which the solid exterior panel portion of the bay door covers and closes the bay door aperture.

The rotary movement of the bay door about its longitudinal axis preferably is controllably powered. A bay door motor is attached to the bay door mounting bracket and has its drive shaft operably connected with the adjacent end of the bay door . Controlled actuation of the bay door motor accordingly imparts rotary motion to the bay door . A suitable bay door motor is the POLOLU brand motor Model 10951. By regulating the rotation of the bay door for example through a rotation of about ninety degrees and counter rotation back again the bay door may be controllably moved back and forth between the open condition and the closed condition. There preferably is provided in the vicinity of the driven end of the bay door proximate to the bay door mounting bracket a pair of limit switches for sensing and controlling the position of the bay door. A door open limit switch senses when the bay door or a designated portion or thereof or feature thereon has rotated under the power of the bay door motor into the open condition with the tablet holder slot fully aligned with the bay door aperture. A door closed limit switch on or near the bay door mounting bracket similarly senses when the bay door has rotated into the closed condition with the tablet holder slot parallel to the bay door aperture and a solid portion of the bay door covers that aperture. The limit switches which may be E SWITCH brand Model SS0750301F020PIA are in signal communication with the bay door motor via a smart button printed circuit board PCB and or the mother board e.g. .

The dock face module also has disposed on and behind it a smart button assembly. A smart button protrudes into a smart button aperture on the front of the module where it is exposed for push operation by a user. The smart button is mounted to the module by means including a smart button printed circuit board PCB housing that is attached to the dock face module. A smart button spring compressibly disposed between the smart button and the smart button PCB housing gently biases the smart button forward into the smart button aperture in the face of the module . The smart button in this embodiment thus is capable of slight forward movement by the action of the spring and controlled backward movement by the action of a user s finger. The smart button is in operable communication with the smart button PCB so that a user s pressing of the smart button actuates the smart button PCB to operate the docking station.

In a possible simple embodiment there is provided any suitable type of switch for controllably interrupting the smart button electrical circuit for example there may be an electronic switch in the smart button PCB . This smart button switch in the smart button or its directly associated circuitry is in signal communication e.g. wireless such as the BLUTOOTH wireless technology standard with a master control whereby an operator of the master control can activate the switch thereby to enable disable the smart button to unlock lock the dock. With the smart button circuit switch open as regulated by transmission from a master control an unauthorized user is unable to open the bay door by means of the smart button .

A reed switch printed circuit board PCB is disposed on the module such as on its back and near the bay door aperture. A suitable reed switch PCB is for example a COTO brand Model CT10 1030 G4. The reed switch PCB is in signal communication with the other PCBs of the docking station for example via the motherboard in the dock. The reed switch PCB is capable of detecting a nearby magnetic field as from a magnet upon a tablet holder e.g. holder and signaling that proximity condition to the TDD system to signal for example the actuation of the bay door motor to move the bay door to an open condition.

A pair of bendable resilient clip retainers are on the inside walls of the insert one retainer on each wall on its rearward portion. The clip retainers are composed of for example a shaped stamped resilient metal. Each clip retainer has a projection portion that extends laterally inward toward the central axis of the insert . Each retainer is attached within the insert such that its small projecting portions prong may flexibly move slightly under an applied force toward the insert sidewall upon which the retainer it is mounted and then elastically rebound upon the release of the applied force out from the sidewall to its rest position. Thus each retainer manifests a light spring bias away from its adjacent sidewall. These clip retainers interact with the tablet holder such as tablet holder of . The tablet holder has defined in each of its lateral sides a small detent positioned on the holder to engage with the projecting prong portion of a corresponding retainer in the tray insert . While a tablet holder is being inserted by a user into the tray assembly the sides of the tablet holder contact the respective clip retainers and begin to depress the retainers against their spring bias the compression of the retainers offers a mild resistance to further insertion of the tablet holder and provides a tactile feedback to the user that the tablet holder is being properly inserted. When the tablet holder has been fully inserted to its proper position within the tray assembly the small projecting prong portions on the retainers come into registration with the detent notches in the sides of the tablet holder. The retainer prongs are resiliently biased into the tablet holder detent notches and the resulting snapping action provides a tactile feedback to the user that the tablet holder is fully and properly inserted. The engagement of the clip retainer prongs into the detents of the tablet holder helps retainer the holder in proper place within the tray. However the holder s detent notches or cavities are so shaped and the compressive bias force of the clip retainers is sufficiently low that a user grasping and gently pulling the tablet holder can readily disengage the prongs from the detents to withdraw the holder from the tray insert .

Also attached upon the tray insert is a flex printed circuit board PCB bracket . The flex PCB bracket holds in place the flex cable in . As mentioned the flex cable provides continuous wired signal communication between the motherboard or and the tray assembly throughout the tray assembly s forward and backward motions. The motherboard receives a portion of the electrical power delivered to the main dock from an external source e.g. DC current rectified and stepped down from a conventional 110VAC . A dock connector printed circuit board PCB is attached directly to the tray insert or alternatively to the bracket . The dock connector PCB is engageable with a power board PCB e.g. component of the tablet holder in to provide power and signal communication between the tray assembly and the tablet via the tablet holder. A tablet holder properly fully inserted into the tray assembly thus has an electronic coupling with the tray assembly by means of the dock connector PCB . The tablet s battery thus may charge electrically while the tablet within the holder is docked in a docking station.

The main tray has an oblong lock plate aperture defined there through running laterally across the main tray near its back as seen in . Movably disposed above the lock plate aperture substantially vertically aligned with it is the tablet holder lock plate . The tablet holder lock plate interacts with the ramps i.e. components and in and with the tablet holder in a manner to be described further.

The tablet holder lock plate along with its functionally associated pair of tablet lock brackets and corresponding pair of tablet lock bracket springs is situated between the main tray and the tray insert . The holder lock plate may nestle in but with short vertical movement allowed the complementarily shaped lock plate aperture in the top of the main tray . The lateral ends of the lock plate are movably supported in lock bracket seats visible in in which tablet lock brackets are situated to prevent the lock plate from falling completely through the lock plate aperture . The tablet lock bracket springs are compressibly disposed between the bottoms of corresponding ones of the tablet lock brackets and upper surfaces of the respective lateral ends of the holder lock plate . The tablet lock brackets preferably are fastened to the top of the main tray to hold the springs in proper place. It is seen therefore that the tablet lock bracket springs bias downward the holder lock plate the holder lock plate tends under the action of the springs to move down into its complementary recess in the top of the main tray . However an upwardly directed force against the bottom of the holder lock plate will shift the holder lock plate slightly vertically against the compression of the tablet lock bracket springs up toward and through an insert aperture in or the substantially open floor of the tray insert . The tablet holder lock plate accordingly can move a modest vertical distance up or down in a space above the main tray .

The lock plate has at least one knob features projecting from its bottom surface two visible in the embodiment of . The knobs extend down through the lock plate aperture and to a point below the bottom of the main tray when the lock plate is biased down to its rest position by the force of the lock bracket springs . These knob features when extending through the lock plate aperture are contactable with the ramps i.e. when the tray assembly is moving in the rear portion of the dock.

The tablet tray insert is fastened atop the main tray substantially to complete the assembly of the tray assembly.

A docking station in the TTD system includes a tablet holder. The tablet holder such as holder seen generally in is devised to hold and protect the computer tablet and to permit functional engagement between the tablet and a dock. The tablet holder preferably is fabricated primarily from a suitably durable and substantially rigid yet resilient material such as high pressure injection molded PC ABS plastic. A tablet holder is configured to enclose and snugly hold an available tablet model for example and not by way of limitation a model of an Apple iPad tablet. A tablet holder is designed to provide a contained tablet except its screen with limited added drop impact protection and shielding from adverse abusive conditions. A preferred embodiment of the tablet holder provides a frame around the edges of a contained tablet and has a bottom that covers the back of the tablet but optionally may leave the tablet s screen exposed for use. The exterior of the tablet holder optionally may feature a protruding and or loop design handle grab and or a finger grip recess for easing manipulation especially removal of a tablet in relation to its dock.

The tablet holder when fully engaged in the home position within the main dock is in electrical communication with the dock. Signal communication occurs between the holder and the dock. There preferably is a universal power connector for the interconnection between dock and holder. The location of such connector may need to differ as differing from tablet to tablet depending upon size and may require position changes to the dock and the tablet holder for different tablets. 

In a preferred embodiment a tablet holder is shaped or sized according to concepts generally known to permit the holder to be inserted in a single proper orientation into a complimentarily configured dock aperture that is backwards or upside down insertion is prevented. The lateral sides of the tablet holder may define therein detent recesses releasably engageable with spring clip retainers in the dock s tray assembly to provide tactile feedback to the user regarding proper insertion and for reliable retention of the tablet holder into the tray prior to complete retraction and electrical coupling with the dock. Moreover the system may be designed such that the bay door of the main dock opens when a tablet holder having a magnet therein is brought only into a single proper insertion position in front of the main dock such that the magnet of selected strength and position activates the reed switch to activate the bay door opening. Thus a magnet preferably is disposed within the tablet holder to electromagnetically interact with a sensor for example a reed switch in the dock for detecting and signaling the proximity and proper positioning of the tablet holder to the dock particularly the dock s bay or aperture.

A tablet holder preferably includes a universal connector for charging tablet batteries and data transmission. In some alternative embodiments the tablet holder offers the option of charging the tablet in use using the tablet manufacturer s power connection while the tablet is outside its dock. This in use charging feature may require a somewhat more complex wiring harness for the holder and possibly a special switching connector. In selected alternative embodiments the back i.e. the bottom panel when the holder is in a horizontal position of the tablet holder may be provided with a controllably extendible collapsible stand for propping the holder in a portrait or landscape tablet use position upon a supporting surface. A status light possibly redundant to a status light on the associated dock optionally may be provided on the tablet holder and which illuminates to notify the user when a docking sequence is initiated by a supervisor at a central or master control location.

The tablet holder may incorporate an audio speaker port near the tablet s audio speaker in one preferred embodiment the tablet holder is provided with its own dedicated audio board PCB in signal communication with an audio output jack on the tablet for un muffled communication of audible information from the tablet to the user. If desired the tablet s audio jack may remain accessible via a jumper wire through a port in a corner of the tablet holder. Although the tablet s speaker may be disabled on most tablets if when this jack is engaged. 

Preferably the back bottom of the tablet holder defines an aperture therein of appropriate size and location to permit use of the tablet s digital camera in tablets so equipped while the camera remains within the holder. An O ring seal may be provided between the tablet holder s top and the front of the tablet or between the tablet holder top and a screen protector to resist ingress of fluids to the tablet from accidental spills etc.

Preferred embodiments of tablet holders include anti theft features. The tablet holder is designed with tamper resistant fasteners e.g. fasteners known in the art and operable only with special tools and construction to prevent unauthorized removal of the tablet from the tablet holder. But the tablet holder may be opened by authorized personnel to for example service the tablet or to change out a tablet screen protector. Also for example the interior of a tablet holder may define a space for holding an RFID or other sensor tag SENSOR MATIC for triggering remotely an alarm when the contained tablet is removed from an authorized area or precise location. And there may be provided within the tablet holder a mechanical switch that opens or closes in the event main parts of the holder housing are opened or separated as to remove the tablet without authorization the switch could for example send a signal to alert the supervising user at the master control or activate some other anti theft countermeasure. A GPS location sensor optionally may be secured within the tablet holder.

The interiors of different holders may be adapted or customized to receive and hold tablets from different tablet manufacturers according to respective tablet shapes and sizes. On the other hand the exteriors of various tablet holders according to this TDD system may have a standard exterior 3 D contour shape and size complementary with a single standardized dock. Accordingly it is possible to devise a TDD system that can use a wide variety of tablets in a single standard model of system dock. Of course there optionally may be more than one model embodiment of dock according to the present system. In practice a user has a tablet holder that can be received and accommodated into and operate with at least one dock model or embodiment and care is taken to associate any given tablet holder with a compatible dock to comprise a functional docking station. Nevertheless tablet holders according to the present disclosure may be custom fabricated for use with a single selected make or model of tablet such as the popular iPad product. It is within the scope of the invention to provide a tablet holder uniquely configured to a single model of tablet so as for example to maximize identification potential for each tablet there may be a single holder adapted to the a particular tablet model from APPLE MICROSOFT GOOGLE ASUS and the like.

Any tablet may thus be retained within an appropriately corresponding tablet holder e.g. holder permitting the tablet to be functionally engageable with the dock e.g. in a docking station of the TDD system. A wide variety of differing tablets thus be accommodated into a standard dock or a modest number of different docks in a TDD system. It is anticipated though that a single inflexible configuration for the tablet holder is generally impractical given the diversity of current and future tablet shapes and sizes. Rather the tablet holder can be devised to be versatile and at least somewhat future proof manufacturing molds for tablet holders according to the invention may be provided with swappable internal mold core designs or removably insertable inserts to accommodate yet to be developed tablet models in the absence of major changes to tablet size shape .

The tablet holder preferably is provided with universal type power connectors contacts for coupling electrically the tablet holder with its associated enclosed tablet. The location of such points of coupling may differ amongst various tablet models the tablet holder preferably employs flexible power and or signal transmission tethers to promote versatility of utility amongst tablet models.

Attention is invited to A B and illustrating details of a possible embodiment of the overall tablet holder according to the present disclosure. When fully assembled for use the tablet holder holding and containing a portable computer tablet appears as seen in . Fundamentally the tablet holder serves to hold and contain the tablet and to provide the means by which the contained tablet interfaces and engages with the tray assembly and dock. The tablet holder may be fabricated primarily from a suitably durable material such as plastic although it also includes certain simple electronic elements. As suggested by the tablet holder bottom assembly assembly of the holder is provided with a plurality of lugs or holes for receiving fasteners and correspondingly aligned holes or lugs in the tablet holder top whereby the holder bottom and top are secured together in a tamper proof manner.

The tablet holder includes as principle components a bottom tablet assembly aligned and fastened together with a tablet holder top . The tablet to be held and contained and utilized at the docking station is securely sandwiched between the tablet holder top and the bottom tablet assembly as suggested by . The O ring is situated outside the periphery of the tablet and is compressed between the outside frame portions of the tablet holder top and the bottom tablet assembly to sealably protect against the ingress or leakage of fluids. The O ring also may provide some padded cushioning between the tablet holder top and the bottom tablet assembly . A power tether provides electrical communication between a conventional port or socket in the tablet and a power board printed circuit board i.e. component in in the tablet holder. The tablet holder s power printed circuit board features a connection port engageable with the dock connector of the tray assembly whereby a tablet holder may be electrically connected to the tray assembly. The audio tether supplies means for audio signal communication between an audio jack or other audio signal output on the tablet and an associated audio output assembly in the tablet holder. is a perspective view of the bottom underside of the tablet holder bottom assembly . There is defined in or through the bottom tablet assembly a lock slot or channel . The lock channel is shaped generally complementarily to but is sized slightly larger than the tablet holder lock plate i.e. in such that the tablet holder lock plate can be engaged into and withdrawn out of the tablet holder s lock channel .

Thus the tablet holder top and the bottom tablet assembly are shaped and sized so as to surround and snuggly contain a given model of computer tablet. The tablet holder top and the bottom tablet assembly are placed into registration and brought together and fastened as suggested by preferably the junction between them is sealed by means of a the suitably resilient O ring type gasket. Not clearly seen in but nevertheless defined in each lateral side of the tablet bottom assembly is a detent notch or cavity so located on the tablet assembly so as to engageably receive the dimple or prong portion of a corresponding clip retainer in in the tray insert when the tablet holder is fully inserted in the trays assembly as described previously herein.

Attention also is invited to showing added features of the tablet holder on the bottom tablet assembly corresponding to the bottom tablet assembly of . There may be provided within the bottom tablet assembly at least one but more typically a plurality of bumper pads disposable between the side walls of the bottom tablet assembly and the sides of the computer tablet for padding and or securing the tablet within the holder. The interior bottom of the bottom tablet assembly preferably is molded with suitable reinforcing ribs and may also have defined therein pockets and recesses for receiving and holding various subcomponents according to this disclosure. For example there may be defined a recess in bottom tablet assembly a defined recess or pocket for receiving and holding securely an optional sensor ID theft tag e.g. an RFID tag . There also may be disposed in the bottom tablet assembly at least one detection magnet such as a HAMLIN brand permanent magnet Model 625 which permits the reed switch in on the main dock s dock face module i.e. in to sense the proximity of the tablet holder.

The tablet holder may have in the inside of the bottom tablet assembly an audio board printed circuit board PCB in cooperation with an audio jack for example a SWITCHCRAFT jack Model 35RAPC4BHN2 . The audio board PCB is in signal communication with the computer tablet via the suitable audio tether in . The audio tether engages into an audio microphone port of the tablet. The audio board PCB thus permits audio to be broadcast to the user from the contained tablet in without interference from the tablet holder from a small speaker at the audio board PCB. A power printed circuit board also is provided in a suitable recess or other seat within the bottom tablet assembly . The power PCB has a port portion or connection that is accessible at the exterior of the bottom tablet assembly so that the tablet holder when assembled can be coupled into electrical connection with a power source in the docking station. Power PCB is in operational connection with a power port of the tablet via the suitable power tether in . Accordingly power can be delivered to the tablet via the tablet holder and power tether . A lock channel corresponding to channel in is visible in . The tablet holder lock plate in can move into the lock channel to lock the tablet holder within the tray assembly of .

Combined reference to and discloses how the motor driven movement of the tray assembly backward to tray back or home docked position and forward to tray forward or out position within the main dock i.e. dock automatically mechanically locks and unlocks respectively the tablet holder assembly within the main dock. While the tray assembly bearing therein a tablet holder is translating rearward under the controlled power of the tray motor the tablet holder lock plate is held in its rest fully down position by the tablet lock bracket springs . When the lock plate is in the rest position the knob features on its bottom extend a short distance down through the lock plate aperture allowing the knobs to come into contact with the ramps .

Continued rearward movement of the tray assembly brings the bottom surface more specifically the plate s underside knob features on the lock plate into contact with the tapered inclined ramp s . The tray assembly continues moving rearward and the lock plate s knob features slidably ride progressively up the front inclined edges of the ramps . As the effective height of the inclined ramps increases relative to the moving tray assembly the ramps push up against the bottom of the lock plate against the urging of the tablet lock bracket springs . As the tray assembly translates toward the home position the lock bracket springs are compressed between the ends of the holder lock plate and the lock brackets as the springs are overcome the lock plate is shifted vertically upward. The lock plate ultimately moves up enough to project up through an opening in the tray insert . When the tray assembly has moved nearly to its home position in the dock the lock plate knobs have reached and are in sliding contact with the tallest portions of the ramps and the lock plate is pushed to its maximum height displacement.

As the lock plate is shifting up to its maximum height in relation to the floor of the dock it concurrently moves up into engagement into a corresponding lock slot or channel in the exterior bottom of the bottom tablet assembly . By the time the tray assembly obtains the home position in the dock the tablet holder lock plate is fully engaged with the tablet holder s lock channel thereby securely interlocking the tablet holder and the tray assembly. So long as the tray assembly is at the rearward most home position within the dock the uppermost edges of the ramps hold the holder lock plate in locked position extending through the bottom of the tray insert and into the lock channel in the tablet holder assembly bottom .

The unlocking of the tablet holder from the tray assembly is accomplished by reversing the foregoing process. The tray motor is actuated into reverse to drive the tray assembly forward out of the home position and toward the front of the dock . While the tray assembly bearing the tablet holder is translating forward under the controlled power of the tray motor the tablet holder lock plate is held in its maximal up position engaged in the tablet holder s lock channel by the topmost surfaces of the ramps . The knobs on the underside of the lock plate are in sliding contact with the top most surfaces of the ramps .

Continued forward movement of the tray assembly brings the underside knob features on the lock plate into contact with the tapered inclined front edges of the ramp s . The tray assembly continues moving forward and the lock plate s knob features slidably ride progressively down the front inclined edges of the ramps . As the effective height of the inclined ramps decreases relative to the moving tray assembly the lock plate moves down by the action of the tablet lock bracket springs . As the tray assembly translates toward the tray forward position the lock bracket springs are decompressed between the ends of the holder lock plate and the lock brackets as the springs release and the knobs on the underside of the lock plate slide smoothly down the inclined front edges of the ramps and the holder lock plate shifts vertically downward. Due to the forward movement of the tray assembly the lock plate ultimately moves down enough as biased by the tablet lock bracket springs to descend through the open bottom of the tray insert . By the time the tray assembly has moved mostly to its forward most position in the dock the lock plate knobs are no longer in sliding contact the ramps and the lock plate is pushed by the springs to its rest position in the main tray .

As the lock plate thereby is shifting down through the opening in the bottom of the tray insert and to its rest position in relation to the floor of the dock it concurrently disengages from the lock channel in the exterior bottom of the bottom tablet assembly . By the time the tray assembly reaches the tray forward position in the dock the tablet holder lock plate is fully disengaged from the tablet holder s lock channel thereby releasing the tablet holder and freeing it for manual removal from the tray assembly. So long as the tray assembly is at the tray forward position within the dock the lock bracket springs hold the holder lock plate in the unlocked rest position in the main tray so that it does not extend through the bottom of the tray insert and up toward the tablet holder. With the lock plate in its rest position the tablet holder is freely insertable into and removable from the tray assembly.

System operation includes methods for a preferred docking sequence and an undocking sequence permitting a supervisor to regulate the storage and use of one or more tablets.

In a basic version of the system one or more main docks are controlled from a master control which may be the control seen in . The master control is in signal communication preferably but not necessarily wireless with its operatively associated dock s . Description of one dock serves to describe all in a collected system. In this embodiment the dock s indicator light displays in four modes solid green flashing green amber or red. The light receives signals as herein descript to indicate whether the tablet holder with tablet is docked within the dock or not whether the tablet is charging and whether the docking station is locked so that only qualified persons can activate the dock to eject the tablet holder. When the tablet holder is fully docked the station is unlocked and the tablet s batteries are charged the indicator light on the station dock displays a steady continuous green. If the tablet holder is not in the dock the indicator light displays a continuous amber color immediately notifying a supervisor that the associated tablet is not docked . When the tablet holder is fully docked within the dock and the station is unlocked but the tablet batteries are charging via the docking station the indicator light blinks green e.g. by an sine pulse type at about one second . When the station is locked e.g. to prevent actuation by the smart button the indicator light displays a continuous red color.

If a tablet is present within the dock and the dock is locked the indicator will initially display red and will continue to do so until the master control is activated to unlock the dock . When the dock is locked the smart button is deactivated e.g. by the interruption of the circuit connecting it to the smart button PCB and pressing it will not actuate the dock to eject the tablet and tablet holder rather the tablet remains secured within the dock .

A typical undocking sequence in this basic embodiment of the system may commence with a dock in a locked condition and the tablet holder retained therein. The indicator light is red in color. The supervisor presses the unlock button on the remote master control which sends a signal to an antenna in the smart button circuit of the dock closing the circuit and enabling the smart button . The indicator light changes color to green or blinking green depending upon the tablet s charging status indicating to the user that a tablet is available and the smart button may be manually operated. The user then manually presses the smart button which activates the control circuitry and bay door and tablet tray assemblies previously described to open the bay door and move forward the tablet tray assembly . The tablet holder thus is presented e.g. and the user grasps it and removes it from the dock for use. The indicator light changes color to amber notifying of an empty dock. The supervisor may either leave the dock in an unlocked condition or may lock it by depressing the lock button on the master control . If the supervisor elects to depress the lock button while the tablet holder is outside the dock the smart button circuit is opened and the smart button is disabled. The indicator light remains amber until the tablet holder is re inserted and restored to the fully docked condition when the indicator light changes to red.

At the selected or indicated time the user may initiate a docking sequence in order to restore the tablet holder with tablet to the dock . Whether or not the dock has been locked while the tablet is outside the dock the indicator light displays amber. To initiate a docking sequence the user preferably brings the tablet holder into correct orientation in front of and aligned properly with the bay door aperture thereby triggering the reed switch PCB which opens the bay door and presents the tablet tray assembly . The user inserts the tablet holder into the tablet tray assembly which assembly withdraws into the dock housing followed by the closing of the bay door and the securing of the tablet in the dock . The indicator light then changes from amber to green if the station is unlocked or from amber to red if the supervisor previously locked the dock while the tablet holder was outside the dock . If the station was in the unlocked condition at the time of tablet holder insertion i.e. the supervisor had not pressed the lock button while the tablet was outside the dock the supervisor may then press the lock button which signals the disabling of the smart button followed by the changing of the indicator light from green steady or blinking to red. The tablet holder is thereby locked within the dock . With the smart button disabled the sole way for a user to re initiate an unlock sequence and thus obtain access to a tablet is to await the depression of the unlock button in the hands of an authorized supervisor.

In one version of this basic embodiment the only way for a user to open the dock s bay door without accessing the master control when the tablet holder is outside the dock is to actuate the reed switch PCB by bringing the tablet holder into the predetermined proper insertion position outside the bay door. Alternatively the system may be designed such that a user also can open the bay door with the tablet holder outside the dock by depressing the smart button provided that the station has not previously been locked by means of the master control . It may be preferable especially in institutional settings to prevent a user from being able to open the bay door by means of the smart button when his or her associated tablet is outside the dock i.e. in use or held by the user . In all embodiments the only way a user can open the bay door to obtain access to a tablet secured within a dock is by awaiting the enablement of the smart button by means of a signal from the master control by actuation of the unlock button . If a tablet holder is within the dock and the dock has been locked the indicator light is red and an unauthorized user cannot eject the tablet by means of pushing the smart button .

It is possible if desired to provide a dipswitch or other switching device in a secured location within the dock whereby the docking station can be converted to a stand alone version. In such a stand alone version there is no master control required or used. The toggling of the switch alters the dock circuitry such that the opening and closing of the bay door and the movement forward and back of the tablet tray assembly in the dock is initiated solely by the operation of the smart button and or the activation of the reed switch PCB . A stand alone version of the TDD system offers charging and environmental protection for the tablet but nearly no security against unauthorized use or theft.

Reference is made to thorough C diagramming a possible undocking sequence in a linked networked system e.g. as seen in .

In a linked embodiment the system includes at least one typically a plurality of docking stations situated in for example a classroom or lecture hall. Each docking station has a dock capable of receiving a corresponding tablet holder and each tablet holder is devised to hold an associated tablet. The master control is at a supervisory location for example at a classroom lectern. The docking stations are in intercommunication with the master control. Motherboard PCBs integrated in the TDD system are programmed generally in according to knowledge within the programming arts to provide logic for command and control function in the system. Description hereafter of the operation of the TDD system with respect to one docking station in the system serves to describe how the system may operate with respect to any other docking station in a system incorporating a plurality of stations.

At the outset a TDD system not in use is in a stand by mode. When the system is on stand by each docking station is in stand by and locked that is physically secured closed so as to prevent access to the tablet holder contained therein. One or more status light s e.g. an indicator light at each docking station maintains an unvarying relatively dim intensity e.g. 5 20 brightness to indicate that the station is potentially operable but in stand by mode with the system. The status light may be for example a green or multicolor LED that when illuminated is seen through a clear plastic cover or light pipe such as on the dock of the docking station.

Operation of a multi station system is initiated by a supervisor operating a first master control button or unlock button to turn the system on and into an unlocked initiation mode. Operation of the first lectern button sends an unlock signal to the docking stations to allow their individual use. A station s receipt of the unlock signal from the master control activates electronically the smart button on the docking station. The smart button optionally is a momentary default open tactile switch. A smart button so activated may be operated during the unlocked initiation mode by a user at the station to unlock physically the dock to access the tablet. Conversely a smart button that has not received an unlock signal is not activated and cannot be operated during unlocked initiation mode to physically unlock the dock.

Upon the docking station s receipt of the unlock signal the status light increases in brightness and begins flashing or blinking to alert a user that the system is in the unlocked initiation mode and that the smart button is operable for an available alert time. The status light at the station flashes or blinks slowly e.g. at 100 intensity for a predetermined time e.g. about 5 10 seconds during which time the user at the station if the user intends to use the tablet therein should operate the station s smart button. Optionally but preferably the unlocked initiation mode is followed immediately by an unlocked ready mode lasting for example about 20 seconds during which the status light is illuminated at a full steady brightness to indicate that the station smart button remains activated but also warning that time is lapsing for operation of the smart button. In the basic preferred embodiment the available alert time for operating the smart button thus may be about 5 10 seconds corresponding generally to the time period of the unlocked initiation mode. In the optional alternative embodiment the available alert time for operating the smart button may be up to about 30 seconds corresponding generally to the combined durations of the unlocked initiation mode and the unlocked ready mode.

If there is no user at the particular docking station or if the user elects not to use the tablet the TDD system detects that the smart button has not been pushed during the available alert time. This timed inactivity of the docking station i.e. the smart button has not been pushed during the available alert time is detected by the TDD system. The TDD system then signals to the inactive docking station to go into an idle or unlocked stand by mode. When the docking station is switched to unlocked stand by mode the main connection between the tablet holder and dock is closed and the tray home position limit sensor tray back limit switch in the dock at that station also remains closed. The bay door on the dock accordingly does not open while the status light ceases blinking and dims to a constant reduced brightness for example 5 20 brightness and the docking station remains physically locked against use. For so long is the overall TDD system is on the status light on a docking station in such idle mode remains dimmed and unvarying.

If a user at a station desires access to the tablet the user operates the smart button within the available alert time e.g. by pressing the smart button. A smart button switch momentary normally open N O in communication with the smart button is closed momentarily and signals the actuation of the dock s bay door. There may follow a brief timed for example a few seconds pause and the dock s bay door opens. The opening of the bay door is sensed by a bay door closed sensor N O i.e. bay door closed limit switch in the dock which bay door closed sensor changes from closed to open sensed condition. Contemporaneously with this shifting condition of the bay door closed sensor a bay door open sensor bay door open limit switch in the dock changes from open to closed sensed condition. The bay door may require a second or two to open mechanically.

Pushing the smart button actuates the opening mechanisms bay door opening tablet tray motion of the dock itself. The opening of the dock bay door marks the commencement of the system s ejecting mode. During the ejecting mode the tablet tray assembly advances from its storage or home position in the main dock body to a ready forward or out position at which position the tablet is presented for use. The movement of the tray assembly from the dock body preferably is driven by the gear motor and rack and pinion with a clutch and or over current protection. During ejecting mode the status light blinks at full brightness while the tablet tray assembly moves forward in the main dock body. The ejecting mode typically has a relatively short duration of for example 1 4 seconds. At the completion of the ejecting mode the tablet tray assembly is maximally forward in the dock to allow the user to grasp and remove the tablet holder therein. There is provided in the preferred embodiment however a means for detecting an obstruction in the operation of the docking station during ejection mode.

Preferably within the dock there are means for detecting if when the operation of the bay door and or the movement of the tablet tray assembly is arrested by an obstructing item at or near the bay door aperture. The means for detecting an obstruction may be one or a combination of several techniques known generally in the art and adaptable for use in the TDD system. For example the tablet tray assembly motor circuit and or the bay door motor circuit may be provided with an over current detector which senses the elevated current resulting from an over worked motor. Alternatively there may be provided a mechanical clutch with sensor or electromechanical clutch means for sensing a predetermined unacceptable slippage in the motor drive assembly for the tablet tray or the bay door. In a more sophisticated embodiment obstruction detection means may be a logic based system for evaluating e.g. optically the movement of the tablet tray assembly versus elapsed time in the event the tray assembly stops moving or its movement is retarded for a predetermined unacceptable period of time the system assumes that an obstruction of the tray assembly has occurred.

In the event an obstruction is detected the system changes to a jam error mode. At the beginning of the jam error mode the system generates a signal to trigger a flashing red obstruction status light at the docking station or to switch the status light to a flashing red condition to alert the user to the obstructed condition of the docking station. A timer optionally may be initiated to measure the jam time during which the docking station is in jam error mode. In the event the obstruction is not removed in a timely manner e.g. 5 10 seconds and the measured jam time exceeds a predetermined time limit the system transmits a signal to the master control e.g. at the lectern to permit intervention and attempted remediation by the supervisor.

The obstruction status light flashes until such time as the obstruction is cleared and normal functioning of the docking station has resumed. Substantially concurrently with the actuation of the flashing red obstruction status light the operation of the drive motor s for the tablet tray assembly and preferably the bay door drive motor automatically is reversed slightly to aid the user in removing the detected obstruction. After a short reversal of a drive motor in a preferred embodiment the power current to the drive motor then may be paused stopping the motor pending removal of the obstruction and the restarting of the station operation. If the obstructed condition of the docking station is not corrected be the expiration of the jam time limit the affected docking station may need to be deactivated to await further servicing by a qualified technician.

Most typically the user proceeds to clear the obstruction and ordinarily will do so successfully prior to the expiration of the jam time limit. After the user clears the obstruction she again operates the smart button at the docking station. Operation of the smart button subsequent to obstruction detection and expiration of the jam time limit resets the docking station and returns the undocking sequence to the process point when the obstruction was originally detected ordinarily either to either restart the bay door motor to open the bay door or to restart the tablet tray assembly drive motor to recommence the movement of the tray assembly from within the dock.

During the ejecting mode of the station s function the tablet tray moves forward from its home position. The first movement from the home position is detected by a tray home position sensor the tray back limit switch which then changes from a closed to an open sensed condition.

Also in communication with the tray assembly is a tray forward position sensor or limit switch which is in an open sensed condition when the tray assembly is in home position and which remains in such condition until the conclusion of the ejecting mode.

As the tray assembly moves from its home position toward its forward position during the ejecting mode the tablet lock tablet holder lock plate and dock ramp assemblies automatically disengages as the internal lock ramp tapers away.

The motor driven rack and pinion moves the tray through its predetermined range of motion until it reaches the out or forward position. When the tray assembly obtains this forward position such position is detected by the tray forward limit switch which changes from an open sensed condition to a closed sensed condition. A signal is sent to the tray assembly drive motor to stop its driving action e.g. by powering it off . Optionally but preferably the station may then enter a tablet ready mode during which the tray assembly is forward in the dock and the tablet is available for use. During the tablet ready mode the status light is signaled to increase in steady brightness e.g. from about 5 to 20 brightness to about 80 to 100 brightness. The tray assembly remains forward at least until the tablet holder is removed from the tray by the user.

At the conclusion of the ejection mode after any detected obstruction is removed and the docking station reset by the user if necessary the tray assembly is at its forward position allowing access to the tablet by the user. The user is able to grasp the tablet holder containing the tablet and remove the tablet holder from the tablet tray. The user s removal of the tablet holder commences the idle while tablet out mode of the station. Removal of the tablet holder disengages the tablet holder from the tray assembly and terminates the electrical connection between the tablet holder and the tray the tray assembly being of course a subassembly of the dock . The tablet holder to dock electrical connection accordingly is opened. In those alternative embodiments featuring a tablet ready mode the disengagement of the tablet holder from the dock triggers a change in the steady brightness of the status light dimming it to 5 20 brightness. In basic embodiments lacking an indicated tablet ready mode the constant dimmed brightness of the status light is unchanged from the unlocked stand by mode to the idle while tablet out mode.

The physical removal of the distal end of the tablet holder from the dock triggers the reed switch in the front panel assembly of the dock. Alternatively such removal actuates a Hall Effect sensor in the front panel assembly of the dock. Regardless of the removal detection means employed this detection means changes from an open to a closed and then an open sensed condition which transmits a signal to the system to time a predetermined delay e.g. several seconds before signaling the actuation of the bay door drive motor to close the bay door. When the bay door has closed the bay door closed sensor changes from an open sensed condition to a closed sensed condition while the bay door open sensor conversely but substantially simultaneously changes from closed to open. In the event the bay door is prevented from closing by an obstruction its associated obstruction detection means is activated and the obstruction detection removal routine and protocol is commenced to prevent damage to the bay door motor drive assembly. Upon the successful closure of the bay door the station enters the idle while tablet out mode which lasts indefinitely until the docking sequence is commenced to permit the tablet holder with tablet to be re inserted into the docking station.

An embodiment of a TDD system including one or more linked networked docking stations also executes a docking sequence for restoring at least one or more typically all the tablets to storage within corresponding docks. provide a flowchart disclosing a preferred docking sequence method. The docking sequence involves certain steps and modes similar to those of the undocking sequence but is not merely a reversal of the undocking sequence. When it is desired to begin the docking sequence the supervisor at the master control operates a button on the master control. The operation of the button sends a system signal to begin the re dock initiation mode. The signal unlocks the dock operation at each docking station activating the smart button at each station to an active mode. During the re dock initiation mode the status light or re docking sequence light at each docking station increases in brightness to about 100 brightness and begins blinking to alert the user at a station that the smart button thereon is active and that the docking station is operable to re dock the tablet holder. The re dock initiation mode lasts for example at least 5 to 10 seconds during which the user at the station with his tablet holder outside the dock is expected to place his tablet holder into the tray and to operate his dock to open the bay door to begin the retraction of the tablet tray into the dock.

In one embodiment of the system there are provided means for detecting whether the tablet holder is already in place within the tray assembly at the beginning of the re dock initiation mode. For example if the main electrical connection between the tablet holder and the tray assembly is closed this signals that the tablet holder is in place in the tray if the tray back limit switch likewise is closed the tablet holder is already in place and the tray assembly is in its home position. A tablet holder and tray assembly would already be in storage or home position most typically in the event there was no user at the particular docking station during the earlier undocking sequence in which case the tablet holder never left the dock.

If at the beginning of the re dock initiation mode the tablet holder and tray assembly are in the home back position the system signals the station to go to idle mode and the station dock locks electronically against physical access to the tablet holder therein.

The TDD system preferably permits a user at a given docking station to re dock his tablet holder prior to the supervisor triggering from the master control the re dock initiation mode. Such a circumstance may be for example a student user needed to depart a classroom before the conclusion of the normal class period. If an individual user at a station needs to re dock his tablet holder before the supervisor is to operate the button to start the system wide re dock initiation he may do so by either operating the smart button at his docking station or by activating a proximity automatic open option described herein below.

If at the beginning of the re dock initiation mode the tablet holder for a station is not in place in the tray i.e. the tablet is in active use the user of one preferred embodiment may elect between either of two ways to start the active docking mode at his docking station. In alternative embodiments of the TDD system one or the other of these ways to start active docking mode is available for execution. A first alternative is for the user to elect to start active docking by operating the smart button at his station. Operation of the smart button closes momentarily the smart button switch in communication with the button signaling to begin opening the bay door on the dock. The status light at the docking station changes to begin blinking or flashing at a relatively faster rate. The docking mode begins and after a brief pause the bay door opens on the dock. In a second alternative way to start active docking the user moves his tablet holder closely proximate to the bay door to trigger a proximity sensor in the bay door aperture e.g. the closing of a reed switch or to trigger a proximity sensor near the bay door aperture e.g. actuation of a Hall Effect sensor the triggering of the proximity sensor generates in the system a signal to actuate the bay door motor to begin opening the bay door. As with the first alternative immediately above the status light at the station changes to begin blinking or flashing at a relatively faster pulse rate. The docking mode begins and after a very brief pause the bay door opens on the dock.

Continued reference is made to A and B. The user then places the tablet holder into the forward tray. The docking station is devised and configured such that when the tray is in the forward position the proper insertion of the tablet holder into the tray involves the insertion of a distal end of the tablet holder into the bay door aperture the bay door being open . Further the proper placement of the tablet holder in the tray also re connects electrically the tablet holder with the tray assembly as their respective main electrical connections couple to close the main holder to dock electrical communication circuit. Ordinarily if the user fails to properly insert the tablet holder in the tray the desired electrical coupling between the tablet holder and the tray assembly will not occur and the holder to dock circuit remains open. After the distal portion of the tablet holder remains for a time within the bay door aperture the proximity switch Hall Effect sensor or reed switch opens and the system is no longer detecting the tablet s presence. If the proximity sensor detects that the tablet has passed through the bay door aperture the system times a predetermined engagement period for example about 5 seconds to detect full and complete engagement i.e. electrical connection of the tablet holder with the tray. In a preferred embodiment if the complete engagement is not detected the tray to holder circuit is still open within the timed engagement period the user is so notified by the status light changing color e.g. from blinking green to constant red . This not inserted enough mode continues until the holder is properly inserted and coupled with the tray so long as the electrical connection between the tablet holder and tray is open tray assembly driving motor does not operate to retract the tray.

The user may then adjust the tablet holder position and or remove it from and re insert it into the tray to assure fully proper insertion of the holder in the tray. When the tablet holder is properly inserted into the tray the status light will resume its ready color e.g. green blinking slowly indicating that active docking may proceed. In a preferred embodiment the detection of a properly completed insertion of the holder in the tray marks the beginning of a successful dock mode during which the status light indicates a steady ready color at about 100 brightness lasting about 2 5 seconds.

After the tablet holder has been fully and properly inserted and engaged into the tray the system pauses briefly and the active docking mode commences. During the active docking mode the tray bearing the tablet holder is retracted mechanically from its forward position and rearward in the dock to the tray home position within the dock. When the tray begins its retracting motion the tray out position sensor tray forward limit switch changes from closed to open when the tray completes the reacting motion and arriving at the tray home limit position the tray home position sensor tray back limit switch changes from open to closed. When the tray is detected to be at home position the signal is generated to close the bay door and the bay door closing assembly with bay door motor is actuated closing the door. The closing of the bay door results in a change in the bay door closed limit switch changing from an open sensed condition to closed while the bay door open limit switch changes from an closed sensed condition to open. The closing of the bay door closed limit switch signals the system to power down to an idle and the dock is locked closed to prevent access to the tablet holder.

Importantly the same error detection means preferably are active during a docking sequence as were active during the undock sequence as described previously. To prevent damage to a docking station due to an obstruction or jam once the docking mode is commenced with a signal to open the bay door during the docking sequence the over current detector s and or the clutch es or the logic based optical position time detector s in communication with the bay door drive motor and the tray assembly drive motor act to pause motor power in the event the bay door and or tray is obstructed or jammed during operative movement.

System operation methodology includes alternative docking and undocking sequences to permit a supervisor to regulate the storage and use of one or more tablets. To initiate an alternative undock sequence procedure the supervisor pushes a button on the master control to unlock the plurality of docking stations releasing them for usage. The electronics system is thus actuated and the pushing of the supervisor s undock button activates the smart button on each docking station so that each docking station can be used. The operation of the TDD system with respect to one docking station in the system serves to describe how the system may operate with respect to any other docking station in a system incorporating a plurality of stations.

The undock signal is sent to each docking station which unlocks operation of each dock. Upon the unlocking of a station dock a status light visible to a user at the docking station is illuminated at the station. In a preferred embodiment the undock sequence light is a green light which flashes for a time to alert the user at the station that the dock is unlocked for use. The status light may be a green LED or a multicolor LED which when illuminated is seen through a clear plastic cover or light pipe on the docking station. The status light preferably is integrated with the station smart button on the dock or optionally may be separate from but nearby the smart button. The smart button optionally is a momentary default open tactile switch. In an alternative embodiment of the system each docking station may be provided with means such as a card reader e.g. for reading an RF signal or magnetic encoded strip or keypad whereby the user at that station can identify himself to the system thus limiting access to selected person s and or permitting an electronic record of the individual who accessed the tablet at that station. The status light flashes or blinks for a predetermined available alert time e.g. several seconds during which time the user at the station if the user intends to use the tablet therein pushes the station smart button. If there is no user at the particular station or if the user elects not to use the tablet the TDD system detects that the smart button has not been pushed during the available alert time. This inactivity of a particular docking station i.e. the smart button has not been pushed during the available alert time is detected by the TDD system. The TDD system then signals to the inactive docking station to a lock the docking station against use and b switch the station s status light from a flashing to a continually on illumination mode.

Upon viewing the illumination of the blinking status light a user at the station desiring to access the tablet pushes the smart button. Pushing the smart button actuates the opening mechanisms of the dock itself. The docking station pauses for a ready pause period of time and the tablet tray assembly then starts advancing in the main dock body. The status light blinks or flashes while the tablet tray assembly advances forward in the main dock body. The movement of the tray assembly in the dock body preferably is driven by the gear motor and rack and pinion inside the dock with a clutch and or over current protection. Once the tray assembly begins moving forward the home position switch sensor in the dock is released the electrical connection between the dock body and the tablet holder also is terminated. During the tray assembly s approximately first inch of travel the dock s bay door is signaled to open e.g. by rotating thus allowing the tray assembly to move forward to project the tablet holder through the bay aperture a distance from the main dock body to present the tablet to the user.

If the bay door and ejecting tray assembly are clear of obstructions the tray assembly continues to move forward in the main dock body. As the tray assembly moves forward the internal lock ramp tapers away disengaging the tablet holder lock plate to release the tablet holder. Optionally if the user pulls the tablet from the tray assembly before the tray has moved fully forward in the dock body a warning light e.g. status light on the dock body may flash or change color but the tray still moves forward to avoid damage tablet removal is detected when an electrical connection is made for example by the reed switch or by means of some other suitable sensor such as a Hall effect sensor . When the tray has move fully forward to the out position a limit switch is triggered the tray driving motor stops the tray s motion ceases and the status light turns off. Detection of the tray out position preferably is by a tray forward limit switch in the dock with an over current second layer of protection. The TDD system thus detects the tray forward condition and turns on a tablet ready light e.g. the status light LED showing solid green . The system pauses for a predetermined tablet ready period of time while the tablet ready light indicates to the user that the tablet properly is ready to be retrieved. The user may then grasp the tablet in the tablet holder and completely remove it from the dock body.

The alternative undock sequence includes means for protecting the apparatus from overheating or mechanical failure due to obstructions to the operation of the tray assembly or bay door. The obstruction protection means serves to detect when proper movement of the tray and or the bay door is arrested for example by the presence of a foreign object. The protection means may include known detection and rectification elements for example one or more of an electronic over current detector or a mechanical slip clutch at the drive gearing of the tray or a slip clutch at the driving gear for the bay door and or logic based electronics for monitoring e.g. optically or electrically the positions of the tray and or bay door versus time. In the event an obstruction is detected while the tray is moving or while the bay door is moving the TDD system signals the activation of an obstruction warning light e.g. status light which alerts the user for example by brightly blinking red in color that the docking station operation is obstructed. Optionally but preferably when an obstruction has been detected the TDD system signals the operation of the motor s tray assembly drive motor bay door drive motor to pause and or reverse direction slightly to facilitate the removal of the interfering obstruction. The user locates identifies and removes the obstruction.

Upon clearing the obstruction the user again pushes the smart button to re commence the movement of the bay door and tray assembly to eject the tablet holder and the undock sequence resumes from about the point at which it was interrupted. The obstruction warning light blinks during a predetermined obstruction removal time programmed in the system in the event that the interfering obstruction is not removed during the timed obstruction removal period the TDD system can transmit a signal to the master control to activate a visual and or audio alert the supervisor of the ongoing difficulty at the particular docking station. The supervisor can then attempt further remediation of the obstruction interference according to judgment.

The user s removal of the tablet holder from the dock triggers a detector sensor such as the reed switch or Hall Effect sensor or infrared sensor or the like near the bay door aperture in the main dock. In this alternative undock sequence the removal of the tablet holder from the dock triggers the TDD system to commence a closing of the main dock. The tray assembly may remain in place after the bay doors close ready in the tray forward position to receive the tablet holder when the bay doors open to begin a docking sequence. Alternatively after a brief pause the tray begins inward motion to return to home position within the dock while the tray is in motion the status light may blink rapidly pending the completion of tray retraction. After the tray back limit switch sensor detects that the tray nearly has or has been restored to home position the tray drive motor is deactivated while approximately concurrently the drive motor of the bay door is actuated long enough to close the bay door. When the tray assembly has obtained the home position and the bay door is closed the status light may indicate a successful closure of the dock by changing to a constant unblinking bright green which may then turn off completely after a predetermined time out period. In either sequence an option is for the TDD system to then signal each and every docking station to lock up against unauthorized further operation until such time as the supervisor determines an appropriate time for the tablet holders to be returned to the docks e.g. at the conclusion on a class instruction period .

There optionally may be provided at or near the bay door aperture a sensor e.g. an infrared sensor for detecting if any sizeable foreign object has been surreptitiously inserted into the bay door aperture after the tablet was removed but before the withdrawal of the tray assembly and closure of the bay door. If an inserted foreign object is detected the system signals an interruption of the operation of the tray drive motor and or bay door to prevent damage.

Related to the immediately described alternative undocking sequence is an alternative docking sequence. To initiate the alternative docking sequence the supervisor pushes a button on the master control to unlock the plurality of docking stations releasing them for usage. The electronics system is thus actuated and the pushing of the supervisor s undock button activates the smart button on each docking station so that each docking station can be used. With the smart button at each docking station thus activated the status light re dock sequence light at the station flashes green and user at each station can opt to operate his associated station to obtain access to the tablet holder.

If at the commencement of this alternative docking sequence the tablet holder already is in place within the tray of a particular docking station i.e. the electrical connection between the tablet holder and tray is closed the system then tests e.g. by the home position tray back limit switch sensor being closed whether the tray assembly is in the full home position. If the tray is sensed to be in the home position the status light at the station illuminates for a predetermined period of time e.g. a few seconds and then turns off. There is no further tray docking sequence for the docking station.

The user at a docking station desiring to return the tablet holder to the dock operates the smart button at her station to commence the docking sequence. If in an alternative embodiment the tray assembly was stored in the home position the docking sequence includes the function of the tray assembly driving motor moving the tray forward in the dock. In an alternative embodiment rather than operating the smart button the user may simply move the tablet holder more specifically for example a distal end of the holder near the bay door aperture of the dock. The Hall Effects or IR or reed switch sensor at or near the bay door aperture in the dock senses the proximity of the tablet holder and upon such sensing the system signals the actuation of the tray assembly driving motor.

The docking station pauses for a ready pause period of time and the tablet tray assembly advances forward in the main dock body. The status light blinks or flashes while the tablet tray assembly moves in the main dock body toward the out position. Once the tray assembly begins moving forward the home position switch sensor in the dock is opened. During the tray assembly s approximately first inch of travel the dock s bay door is signaled to open e.g. by rotating thus allowing the tray assembly to become available via the bay aperture to receive the tablet holder from the user.

If the tray and bay door operate without obstruction the user then places the tablet holder into the tray which is in full forward position. Obstructions to the movement of the tray and the bay door are detected during this alternative docking sequence in the same manner as in the alternative undock sequence described above.

The user inserts the tablet holder into the tray which is in the forward position. In one embodiment spring retainer clips disposed on the tray are configured first to offer mild resistance to the user s insertion of the tablet holder then a tactile detent action to inform the user that the tablet is properly in place within the tray.

A sensor for example a Hall Effect reed sensor or IR sensor may be provided at or near the bay door aperture to sense whether the tablet holder has been properly inserted through the bay door aperture and into the tray. If the proximity sensor at the bay door aperture detects that the tablet holder has passed through the bay door aperture it signals the system to time a period of a few seconds to detect by the home position limit switch full retraction into the dock otherwise the status light is signaled to flash red to warn of the malfunction. If the tablet is properly positioned in the tray and coupled therewith the system signals the change of the status light from blinking green to constant solid green to indicate that the tablet holder and tray are in condition to be retracted into the dock. The TDD system pauses the station a few seconds then signals the status light to begin blinking green and the driving motor s to begin operating to retract the tray into the dock. If the tray s movement into the dock is free of obstruction the docking sequence continues until the tray back limit switch signals that the tray has reached the home position and the bay door is closed.

As the tray assembly moves rearward during this docking sequence the internal lock ramp tapers up contacting the holder lock plate to lock the tablet holder in the tray. After the tray assembly has moved fully rearward to the home or tray back position the tray back limit switch is triggered the tray driving motor stops the tray s motion ceases and the status light ceases flashing. Detection of the tray home position preferably is by the tray back limit switch in the dock with an over current second layer of protection. The TDD system thus detects the tray home condition and turns on a tablet home light e.g. the status light LED showing solid green .

If the progressive operation of either the moving tray or the rotating bay door is obstructed during the docking sequence the over current or optical logical detector senses the interruption and signals the status light at the station to flash red. The affected drive motor s are signaled to pause and or reverse slightly to aid in obstruction removal. If the obstruction is not cleared in a timely manner an alert optionally is signaled to the supervisor at the master control. Upon clearing the obstruction the user at the affected station again operates the smart button and the docking sequence resumes. Once the bay door is detected to be closed by the bay door closed limit switch and the home position is detected by the tray back limit switch the indicator light illuminates for a period the TDD system signals the deactivation of the smart button and all the lights at the docking station can be turned off.

Attention is invited to illustrating by way of example one mode in which a TDD system according to the present disclosure may be deployed. In this example multiple docking stations are mounted upon a cart . Thus in this example the cart serves as the foundation upon which the individual docks are secured. Other examples of a foundation include tables desks and cabinets or the like upon which one or more main docks are mounted. A cart offers advantages of portability for use with a plurality of main docks. The cart has a cabinet or frame equipped with wheels or casters generally according to convention. Casters permit the cart to be mobile for example to be rolled from a lockable closet to a classroom for tablets use and then returned to the closet after use. A plurality of main docks are securely mounted upon the frame in any suitable arrangement which permits ready access to the bay door of each dock. Two rows of twelve docks are visible on one side of the cart frame in twenty four more docks may be similarly arranged on the opposite side of the cart but not seen in . The cart may include an appropriate power cord adapted to be electrically connected with a source of electrical power for example by being plugged into a conventional 110VAC building wall electrical outlet . Requisite transformers and associated circuitry and components for converting high voltage alternating current to low voltage direct current for charging computer tablets may be provided on cart but are not shown in . One or more tablet holders one seen in are disposable within correlated ones of the main docks on the cart ordinarily there is provided a plurality of tablet holders corresponding in number to the plurality of docks on the cart each holder and its contained tablet being associated with a particular station dock.

It is understood from that in one mode of practicing the invention the foundation cart when not in active use may be stored in a secure location with one or more tablet holders docked within corresponding ones of a plurality of main docks thereon. In the secure location the cart is electrically connected to a power source by means of the power cord whereby the docking stations are powered to permit tablet batteries to be charged during cart storage. When desired a supervisory person accesses the foundation cart at the secure location and disconnects the cord from the power source outlet and for example stows the cord on in the cart frame . The cart is wheeled to for example a classroom and optionally the cord is again plugged into a power source outlet in the classroom. The supervisor by means of a master control is able to lock and unlock in a controlled manner the plurality of main docks on the cart . Individual student users may then retrieve selected tablet holders each holding a charged tablet from associated main docks . The individual tablet holders may then timely be restored to a dock on the cart when no longer in use as suggested by the directional line at holder in . At the end of a session the supervisor can readily check the status of each dock by viewing the indicator lights on the docks to determine whether all the tablet holders have been replaced into the docks on the cart. An amber colored indicator light on a particular dock alerts to the absence of a tablet holder therein. When the supervisor is satisfied that all the tablet holders have been restored to the docks on the cart the cart can by unplugged if necessary and rolled back to the storage location.

There is provided therefore a computer tablet storage system comprising a main dock and a tablet holder. The main dock includes a front panel assembly defining a bay door aperture a dock housing around a substantially hollow interior a tablet tray assembly movable toward and away from the bay door aperture and within the interior of the dock housing and means such as a controllable motor cooperative with gears pinions for moving the tablet tray assembly within the dock housing. The tablet holder is releasably engageable with the tray assembly and is adapted to receive and retain a computer tablet. In the system the tablet tray assembly is movable between a tray forward position in which any tablet holder engaged with the tray assembly is at least partially extended through the bay door aperture by the movement of the tray assembly and a tray back position in which any tablet engaged with the tray assembly is retracted completely within the dock housing interior.

The at least one main dock may comprise a plurality of main docks and the at least one tablet holder thus may comprise a plurality of tablet holders corresponding in number to the plurality of main docks.

The main dock further preferably comprises a button i.e. the smart button in signal communication with the means for moving the tablet tray assembly within the dock housing for actuating the means for moving the tablet tray assembly to move the tray assembly toward the tray forward position to cause at least partial ejection of the tablet holder from the main dock via the bay door aperture. The means for moving the tablet tray assembly may include a motor which drives the tray assembly by rotating a gear or gear train in functional cooperation with a notched rack.

The preferred system includes a master control preferably a wireless remote control in signal communication with the main dock such that command signals from the master control enable or disable the smart button on the main dock to regulate whether the tablet holder can be ejected from the main dock by operation of the smart switch. The front panel assembly preferably includes a bay door movable to close the bay door aperture when the tray assembly is in the tray back position and movable to open the bay door aperture when the tray assembly is moving toward the tray forward position. The main dock includes means such as a motor and gears for moving the bay door to open the bay door and sensor means such as a reed sensor and switch on the main dock for detecting when the tablet holder is proximate to the bay door aperture. Because the sensor means is in signal communication with the means for moving the bay door when the tablet holder is proximate to the bay door aperture the sensor means signals an actuation of the means for moving the bay door thereby to open the bay door.

The preferred system also includes mechanical means for securing the tablet holder within the main dock when the tray assembly is in the tray back position wherein movement of the tray assembly in the dock housing effectuates unlocking and locking interactions between the tablet holder and the dock. The means for securing may include tapered ramps on the floor of the main dock s interior and such ramps cooperative with a movable tablet holder lock plate releasably to lock the tablet holder within the tray assembly of the dock when the tablet holder is retracted to the home or tray back position within the dock.
