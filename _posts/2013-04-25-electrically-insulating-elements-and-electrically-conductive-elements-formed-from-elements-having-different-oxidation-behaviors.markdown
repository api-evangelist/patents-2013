Research underlying this invention was sponsored by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory under Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF 12 2 0019.

Embodiments of the present invention are generally directed to electrical device fabrication and more particularly to the formation of electrically insulating elements and electrically conductive elements from elements having different oxidation behaviors which are subjected to an oxidation process.

Plated metal processes are heavily used in micro electrical mechanical system MEMS power and radio frequency RF components due to their low resistances and correspondingly low power losses. For large free standing devices mechanical supports are often necessary to improve robustness and to prevent deflection and shorting with neighboring structures. Since electroplated metals are conductive creating resistive or dielectric supports has traditionally been done by the deposition and patterning of additional dielectric materials such as polymers or plastics. An alternative means of creating a resistive or dielectric support is to convert an electrically conductive element to a more resistive material by an oxidation process. The oxidation of silicon to silicon oxide to create dielectric mechanical supports has been previously demonstrated in microstructure fabrication. For some applications a trench may be filled with silicon oxide through thermal oxidation and used to form the mechanical anchor of a micromechanical structure. Alternatively silicon beams and mechanical supports can be directly converted to silicon oxide to form dielectric mechanical supports. Other prior work has also demonstrated the use of oxidation of silicon to create silicon oxide mechanical structures such as membranes. Although many metals also form thick oxides this has typically been viewed as a major problem especially in MEMS packaging where exposure to temperatures of several hundred degrees Celsius may be required and has not been previously relied upon to create mechanical structures.

Embodiments of the present invention are directed to electrical devices and methods for fabricating electrical devices using an oxidation process.

According to one embodiment a method of forming an electrical device using an oxidation process includes forming a metallic element which is to become an electrically insulating or resistive element in an electrical device forming an electrically conductive element connected to the metallic element wherein the metallic element and the electrically conductive element have different oxidation behavior when subjected to the oxidation process and subjecting the elements forming the electrically insulating or resistive element and the electrically conductive element to the oxidation process.

The method may further include in some embodiments subjecting one or both of the metallic elements forming the electrically insulating or resistive element and the electrically conductive element to a release step whereby the elements become free standing suspended or released from a substrate or at least one other element of the electrical device. The release step may include removing a supporting mold the etching of a sacrificial layer or the detachment from the underlying substrate or the at least one other element of the electrical device. This step may be performed before during and or after the oxidation process. In a case in which the metallic element forming the electrically insulating or resistive element is released it may form a pillar post beam column or flexure structure in the electrical device. Alternatively or additionally one or both of the metallic elements forming the electrically insulating or resistive element and the electrically conductive element can be fabricated as a free standing or suspended structure without the need for a separate release step. This may occur where the elements is free standing or suspended by simply stacking up piles of material for example.

In some embodiments the metallic element forming the electrically insulating or resistive element is a metal which readily oxidizes during the oxidation process and the metallic element forming the electrically conductive element is a metal or other material which does not readily oxidize during the oxidation process. For example the metal which readily oxidizes during the oxidation process may be copper nickel titanium zirconium hafnium tantalum and niobium and the metal which does not readily oxidize during the oxidation process may be gold nickel aluminum or platinum. The non readily oxidizing conductive element may also be a non metallic material such as polysilicon in some applications. Since metals oxidize differently in different temperature ranges a metal such as nickel can be a non readily oxidizing metal when combined with a metal such as copper that forms thick oxides at lower temperatures. Nickel when combined with a metal such as gold or platinum that oxidize less easily can also be used as a readily oxidizing metal when baked to higher temperatures.

In other embodiments the metallic elements forming electrically insulating or resistive element and the electrically conductive element are each formed from a metal which readily oxidizes during the oxidation process but these elements perform in a different manner. The oxidizing metal may be copper for example but these metallic elements have different dimensions and or sizes which provide different oxidation behaviors when they are subjected to the oxidation process. For example the metallic element forming the electrically conductive element may have a greater thickness or diameter than the metallic element forming the electrically insulating or resistive element. As such the metallic element forming the electrically insulating or resistive element is substantially converted to a metal oxide whereas the metallic element forming the electrically conductive element may only be partially converted to a metal oxide so as to remain conductive. During the oxidation process only a surface layer of the metal from which the conductive element is formed may be substantially converted to a metal oxide. The metallic element forming the electrically insulating or highly resistive element the electrically conductive element or both may be deposited by electroplating. The oxidation process may include a bake at an elevated temperature exposure to oxygen plasma or exposure to ozone.

Another embodiment consists of forming both the conductive and electrically insulating or resistive elements from readily oxidizing metals but the conducting element undergoes a surface treatment or coating to limit oxidation. For instance the metallic element forming the electrically insulating or resistive element and the electrically conductive element may be differentiated by coating the surface of the conductive element. Regions could be coated with a layer of another material to prevent the oxidizing metal from being exposed to oxygen during the oxidation process. The surface coating may include octadecanethiol or a non oxidizing metal.

According to other embodiments an electrical device formed by the oxidation process may include for instance at least one electrically insulating or resistive element and at least one electrically conductive element connected to the electrically insulating element. The insulating or resistive element is formed of a metallic element and the conductive element consists of a different material which has a different oxidation behavior when subjected to an oxidation process. One embodiment of the conducting element that oxidizes differently would be another metal that does not readily oxidize during the oxidation process. During oxidation the elements forming the insulating elements and the conductive elements behave differently. The electrical devices may be configured as an inductor gyroscope accelerometer chemical sensor pressure sensor or variable capacitor.

Embodiments of the present invention are directed to electrical devices and methods for fabricating electrical devices using an oxidation process. According to various embodiments the method of forming an electrical device using an oxidation process includes forming at least one metallic element which is to become an electrically insulating or resistive element in an electrical device and forming at least one electrically conductive element connected to the metallic element. The metallic elements and the electrically conductive elements have different oxidation behaviors when they are subjected to the oxidation process. Exploiting these different oxidation behaviors of the precursor elements both i electrically insulating or resistive elements and ii electrically conductive elements for electrical devices can be created in a single patterned layer. Advantageously this methodology may be used to form various structures for electrical devices having both types of elements in a more simplified manner than previous performed.

Applications of the present invention may be configured for various small electrical structures that would benefit from having both low electrical resistance conductive pathways and insulating elements. This may benefit multiple types of electrodes in electrical devices including driving and sensing electrodes in the same structure including but not limited to inductors gyroscopes accelerometers chemical sensors pressure sensors and MEMS variable capacitors.

As will be appreciated by those in the art an oxidizing process converts a material such as a metal into an oxide of the material. Copper Cu is one metal with may be readily oxidized converting copper to copper oxide. As mentioned above the ability of copper to form thick layers of oxides has typically been viewed as a major problem and thus avoided in prior method. However the inventors have advantageously found this property can be leveraged in order to partially or completely oxidize structures larger than would be possible for other materials.

While various embodiments utilizing copper as an oxidizing metal are described herein it should be appreciated that other oxidizing metals may also be used in accordance with the disclosed embodiments. Thus any reference to copper as an oxidizing metal should not be construed as limiting. For instance numerous other metals including nickel titanium zirconium hafnium tantalum and niobium have also been shown to form thick oxide layers in different temperature ranges and may be used in other embodiments as an oxidizing metal.

For the purposes of this invention an element or material may be considered electrically insulating or resistive if it substantially blocks and or does not readily conduct electrical current during its ordinary operation s in an electrical device. Conversely for purposes of this invention an element or material may be considered electrically conductive if it readily conducts electrical current during its ordinary operation s in an electrical device. Such elements and materials may be characterized as having relatively low electrical insulating or resistive properties. The distinction between electrically insulating or resistive and electrically conductive is well known and should be readily appreciated by those in the electrical arts.

In fact many metal oxides typically have electrically insulating or resistive properties. As an example if the resistivity of the metal oxide is at least two orders of magnitude i.e. a factor of 100 greater than the resistivity of the original metal then it should provide sufficient electrically insulating or resistive properties for purposes of this invention. More particularly bulk copper has a resistivity of 16.73 n cm while the two majors forms of copper oxide cupric oxide CuO and cuprous oxide CuO have resistivity at least eight orders of magnitude higher depending on growth conditions and thus could be considered resistive in this invention. The element may be a dielectric material in some instances but this may not be necessary for many applications and or electrical devices. Copper when subjected to an oxidation process forms a porous oxide allowing the formation of oxide layers up to tens of microns thick or more to be created at modest processing temperatures. This controlled oxidation of copper or other oxidizing metal can be employed to create electrically insulating or resistive structural elements posts and beams according to embodiments. This capability can eliminate the additional dielectric insulator or resistive material deposition and patterning steps that are often needed during the construction of sensors waveguides and other micro fabricated devices thus simplifying the manufacturing process. The copper or other electrically insulating or resistive material may be applied by an electroplating process in some implementations.

Copper oxidation rates for thermal and plasma assisted growth methods have been characterized by the inventors. Time control of the oxide growth enables larger copper structures to remain conductive while smaller copper posts are fully oxidized. This concept has been demonstrated using the controlled oxidation of a copper layer between two nickel layers to fabricate nickel inductors having both copper electrical vias and copper oxide support pillars. Here nickel was utilized in this demonstration for its resistance against low temperature oxidation and interdiffusion with copper.

As one of the most conductive metals copper is commonly used as a metallization layer for integrated circuits and MEMS. However copper also oxidizes easily in the presence of oxygen. At temperatures up to about 275 C. copper forms a relatively dense oxide largely CuO that helps to limit further oxidation beyond thicknesses on the order of tens to a few hundred nanometers. At higher temperatures a more porous oxide consisting of a surface layer of CuO on a thicker layer of CuO is formed with layer thicknesses of tens to hundreds of micrometers possible when baked for a few hours in the presence of oxygen. This oxidation can result in sizeable increases in the resistance of copper traces. These two major forms of copper oxide CuO and cupric oxide CuO are both p type semiconductors with resistivity at least eight orders of magnitude higher than copper metal. A number of methods have been developed to minimize oxidation including alloying the copper surface with another metal and forming a surface passivation layer.

The method can further by used to create electrically insulating or resistive released structures by including a release step whereby the elements become free standing suspended or released from a substrate or at least one other element of the electrical device. The released elements may include free standing suspended or released elements devices or other mechanical supports for instance. A free standing or suspended device is a structure that is able to support itself based on mechanical connections or springs to mechanical anchors. In MEMS devices suspended metal micromechanical structures are typically held in place using molds sacrificial layers or other attachment to the underlying substrates during much of the fabrication process. The step by which the device becomes suspended such as an etch removal of the surrounding mold or detachment from the substrate is known as the release step and the final structure is then considered a released or suspended element. The release step may include removing a supporting mold the etching of a sacrificial layer or the detachment from the underlying substrate. This step may be performed before during and or after the oxidation process. In a case in which the metallic element forming the electrically insulating or resistive element is released it may form a pillar post beam column or flexure structure in the electrical device. Mechanical supports can be similarly formed in this manner. Alternatively or additionally elements of the electrical device can be fabricated as a free standing or suspended structure without the need for a separate release step. This may occur where the element is free standing or suspended by simply stacking up piles of material for example using a three dimension 3D printer.

In some embodiments metallic copper may be used to form both the elements which are to become electrically insulating or resistive elements and the electrically conductive elements in an electrical device. By controlling the dimensions of precursor elements for the electrical device copper structures can be partially and completely oxidized allowing both conductive and highly resistive elements to be created in a single patterned layer. Advantageously this methodology may be used to form suspended metal micromechanical structures having both insulating and conducive elements. Of course in other embodiments the electrically conductive element may be a metal or other material which does not readily oxidize during the oxidation process. For example some metals which do not readily oxidize during the oxidation process may be gold nickel aluminum or platinum. The non readily oxidizing conductive element may also be a non metallic material such as polysilicon in some applications.

The material of the various elements non oxidizing metal copper copper oxide and glass is identified according to the accompanying legend. In some embodiments the glass may be a low thermal expansion borosilicate glass such as sold under the brand Pyrex .

The suspended inductor coil may be formed of two coils separated by copper metal . The copper metal here has been initially patterned to include many smaller regions for columns and a much larger or wider region for pillars . This is shown in more detail in .

The coils may be formed of conductive material such as gold in a spiral structure and spaced at a predetermined height in a parallel manner by columns above the substrate . One possible embodiment would be layer thicknesses of roughly 10 micrometers. The completely oxidizing pillars could have diameter of 4 micrometers while the partially oxidizing pillar could have diameter of 200 m. The suspended coil could have line widths of 20 micrometers with 10 micrometers spacing between neighboring lines.

The copper metal of the columns will later be converted via an oxidation process to copper oxide an electrically insulating or resistive material to keep the coil electrically isolated from one another and avoid shorting. The coils connect to second and fourth pillars and while the first and third pillar are may be free standing structures. The pillars may be electrically conductive both before and after then oxidation process due to their construction.

It will be appreciated the number size shape and or arrangement of the coils columns and conductive pillars is exemplary only and may be different from what is shown in other embodiments. For example the coils may be circular instead of rectilinear as shown and have fewer or additional turns. And while four pillars are shown one pillar connected to the coil may be all that is needed in some embodiments. Other variations are also contemplated.

The pillars are initially formed of the same materials as the suspensions columns . However while these elements may be formed of the same oxidizing metal they have different dimensions sizes which provide different oxidation behaviors of these elements when subjected to an oxidation process. As shown the width or diameter of the pillars is much greater than that of the suspension columns .

By performing an oxidation process for instance by exposing to a long oxygen plasma ash or by baking to high temperatures in the presence of oxygen the narrower regions can selectively be converted entirely to copper oxide an electrically insulating or resistive non conductive material while the larger or wider region continues to have a conductive copper core to connect the layers. After the oxidation process the smaller copper regions with be converted into insulating pillars and the wider copper region will be a conductive electrical via in the electrical device. The gold layers are substantially unaffected by the oxidation process. Thus electrical current can flow though the coil generating an inductance therein.

On the other hand the pillars which central regions were also initially formed of copper behave differently than the suspension columns . More particularly given the greater width or diameter of the pillars than the suspension columns copper of the pillars does not fully oxidize through its width. Rather only small surface layer of copper oxide may be formed on the outer surface of the pillars enabling the pillars to be electrically conductive. The pillars therefore can still substantially conduct electricity and enable low resistance electrical routing.

Creating mechanical supports in this manner using oxidation simplifies fabrication and obviates the need for the deposition and patterning of additional dielectric material which introduces further processing. In comparison to polymer or plastic support structures the use of copper oxides can yield greater thermal stability especially when a device is hermetically packaged. Polymers can also outgas and affect the device performance in the final package. In addition both cupric and cuprous oxides have unusual properties that could allow new devices to be incorporated on chip with MEMS structures. For example cuprous oxide CuO was an early semiconductor used in devices such as diodes before silicon became dominant and continues to be used in certain specialized applications such as solar cells. Cupric oxide CuO has been demonstrated for chemical sensing and as a promising extremely high k dielectric and ferroelectric material.

Metallic copper may be thermally oxidized during an oxidizing process. The oxidation processing may include for instance a bake at an elevated temperature exposure to oxygen plasma or exposure to ozone. The oxidation of copper follows several distinct stages as the thickness of the oxide layer increases. The formation of the initial monolayers of oxide is linear with time followed by a logarithmic behavior for thicknesses up to approximately one micrometer. For the elevated temperatures necessary for thick oxide growth above 275 C. both of these stages occur in the first few minutes of oxidation. Although porous oxides can occur for a broad range of temperatures extending from 275 C. to over 1 000 C. an important region for MEMS structural supports is the low end of this range to minimize both mechanical stress and interdiffusion between the copper and the other metals used in the structural stack. Thick oxides grow in the temperature range from 275 C. to 400 C. according to a parabolic rate law 1 where Y is the mass gain per unit area t is the oxidation time kis a parabolic rate constant and C is a constant.

For diffusion based oxidation the parabolic rate constant is guided by the Arrhenius relation 2 where Kis a constant Eis the activation energy R is the ideal gas constant and T is the temperature.

The mass gain is proportional to the oxide thickness after correcting for the volume expansion leading to the expression 3 where and are the densities of the copper oxide and copper respectively is a constant scaling factor to correct for the volume expansion and dis the oxide thickness. The conversion from copper to cuprous oxide the primary oxide grown in this temperature range results in a volume increase of 65 .

To characterize the oxidation behavior the inventors electroplated a 32 to 35 m thick copper layer onto a copper seed layer in a copper sulfate electrolyte at a current density of 130 A mfor 120 minutes. Titanium was used as an adhesion layer between the copper seed and the substrate. The wafer was then sectioned and each piece was baked in an air environment using a convection oven with temperature accuracy to within 10 C. The thickness was measured by masking a portion of the oxide with photoresist and removing the exposed oxide using diluted hydrochloric acid the resulting step was then measured using a Tencor P 15 profilometer. An unoxidized copper piece was also etched using hydrochloric acid to verify that the diluted acid does not appreciably attack the copper.

In some embodiments an excited plasma state enhances the reactivity of a gas allows oxygen plasma to be used to rapidly oxidize metals. Oxidizing in oxygen plasma was investigated by the inventors in particular as an alternate method to the thermal oxidation previously discussed to create thick layers of oxide at lower temperatures to minimize film stress and diffusion. There have been a number of studies of the thin film oxidation of copper using oxygen plasma largely for the creation of thin copper oxide films for solar cells but to the inventors knowledge there has been no previous investigation of thick oxide growth using this method. Copper samples were oxidized using oxygen O plasma in an Anatech SCE 1000 barrel asher at 600 W and a flow rate of 680 standard cubic centimeters per minute sccm O.

To make pillars posts beams columns flexure structures or other released or suspended mechanical structures in the electrical device with copper oxides a multi layer thick film electroplating method was developed.

Next in step b a non oxidizing material is electroplated over the photoresist mold. The non oxidizing material may be a metal such as nickel for example. Other metals might also be used including gold aluminum or platinum although non metallic electrically conducive materials which do not readily oxidize might also be used such as polysilicon. In step c this process is then repeated to create a multilayer layer stack . The multilayer stack may include alternative layers of the non oxidizing material and an oxidizing metal of copper. Here the multilayer stack is a three layer stack consisting of nickel for the bottom layer and the top layer and copper for the middle layer of the stack . The nickel layers may be plated from a nickel sulfamate bath and the copper layer may be formed from a sulfuric acid copper sulfate bath.

The multilayer stack is provided with electrical contacts . Two such contacts are shown. For instance a gold layer several hundred nanometers thick may be either electroplated or deposited using electron beam evaporation on the surface of the top layer to form the electrical contacts .

In step d the structure is released. Different methods of release may be used for instance. For instance structures with narrow gaps such as inductors may be released by soaking in Baker PRS 3000 photoresist stripper for 35 minutes with ultrasonic agitation followed by etching the titanium adhesion layer with hydrochloric acid. Since PRS 3000 is a mild copper etchant the copper seed layers were etched along with the photoresist. On the other hand for structures where dimension control may be more critical an acetone release in ultrasonics was used along with liftoff of the bottommost seed layer. The released structure is shown comprised of alternating layers of the non oxidizing metal and the oxidizing metal.

Between steps d and e an oxidation process is preformed on the release structure . The oxidation process may include a bake at an elevated temperature exposure to oxygen plasma or exposure to ozone. For example the structure may be baked in a convection oven to oxidize the oxidizing metal i.e. copper . Wider copper structures are only partially oxidized allowing conductive vias to be created whereas narrower copper structures are fully oxidizing. The bottom two layers the copper and nickel were measured to have thicknesses of approximately 10 m and the top nickel gold layer was measured to have a thickness of approximately 7 m.

Nickel was used to minimize both interdiffusion with the copper and oxidation for the non copper layers. Although nickel is capable of thick film oxidation at temperatures above 500 C. it forms a very thin self limiting oxide NiO for instance tens of nanometers thick at lower temperatures. Nickel is commonly used as a diffusion barrier for copper since the two metals are not easily miscible.

The height profile was also measured using white light interferometry both before and after oxidation. Several traces were found to have a maximum out of plane deflection of approximately 2 to 3 m. Since the vertical deflection of these traces was present before oxidation the pillars in these regions were likely damaged during the photoresist release process rather than during oxidation. The Baker PRS 3000 used during the release has been demonstrated to attack isolated micron scale copper features. A comparable inductor on the same chip without pillars measured before baking was found to curl over 10 m upward due to residual stresses.

In one or more embodiments a selective copper oxidation technique may be employed within a multi layer electroplated metal process. This allows the introduction of a dielectric with minimal additional processing steps and reduces process complexities associated with the deposition and patterning of dielectrics. The oxidation behavior of electroplated copper was characterized and micron scale layers of copper oxides were obtained with oxidation as low as 300 C. A thick film nickel copper nickel electroplating process was developed and complete oxidation of copper posts and beams were obtained after baking for several hours at 400 C. The resistivity of the obtained copper oxide structures was found to be 129 cm.

A nickel inductor suspended on high resistance posts was fabricated by the inventors by controlled baking in a nickel copper nickel thick film electroplated process. The inductor was fabricated characterized and found to have an inductance of approximately 60 nH. In the current process nickel was used as a minimally oxidizing metal that does not interdiffuse with copper however nickel is also a higher resistivity magnetic material resulting in higher DC resistance and moderate high frequency performance.

Similar devices might also be created using gold routing layers on copper oxide posts with electroplated nickel diffusion barriers between the copper and gold. Alternatively the coating or alloying methods disclosed for instance in Li J Mayer J and Colgan E Oxidation and protection in copper and copper alloy thin films 70 1991 2820 2827 and Hutt D and Liu C Oxidation protection of copper surfaces using self assembled monolayers of octadecanethiol 252 2005 400 411 could be used to selectively protect copper areas allowing copper traces on copper oxide pillars to be successfully created. One possible method would be to encase the copper layers that are not intended to oxidize with an unoxidizing barrier metal using a process similar to the techniques used in damascene copper interconnects.

More particularly both the conductive and electrically insulating or resistive elements may be formed from readily oxidizing metals but the conducting element undergoes a surface treatment or coating to limit oxidation. For instance the metallic element forming the electrically insulating or resistive element and the electrically conductive element may be differentiated by coating one or both of their surfaces. Regions could be coated with a layer of another material such as another metal to prevent the oxidizing metal from being exposed to oxygen during the oxidation process. The surface coating may include octadecanethiol or a non oxidizing metal as an example.

Thick film multi layer metal electroplating processes may be used for creating low resistance structures for applications such as power inductors as demonstrated in Meyer C. D. et al. High inductance density air core power inductors and transformers designed for operation at 100 500 MHz 46 2005 2236 2239. However this process has several important disadvantages. In any metal electroplated released structure the entire structure is electrically connected this eliminates the possibility of a single structure containing for instance both actuation and sensing electrodes limiting the possible types of devices that can be created. The use of completely oxidized metal to isolate different regions of the device opens up a large number of different possible applications for the process.

The fabrication process may also rely on photoresist pillars to hold released portions apart this though may cause several important problems. Adding photoresist pillars generally requires an additional photolithography masking step adding cost that would be unnecessary with the oxidation method. Photoresist is easily etched by many processing steps which are necessary to define the current multi layer process. This limits the possible methods for release of the structure and as a polymer does not have very desirable mechanical or electrical properties. Photoresist can also not be taken to high temperatures e.g. above 150 C. without being destroyed limiting both process steps and uses for the final device. Embodiments of the present invention are believed to overcome these drawbacks.
