An operation of the system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention will now be described. The operation will be described with respect to the client computer but it should be appreciated that similar operations may be provided by other client computers such as the client computers and . In operation the client computer may execute a web browser and send a request or data to the firewall over one of the one or more networks . The firewall may be configured to verify that the client computer is a trusted computer and that the request or data is of a permissible type to send to the web server . In an event that the firewall determines that requests or data are of an impermissible type the firewall may block the requests or data from being forwarded to the web server . On the other hand in an event that the firewall determines that the requests or data are of a permissible type the firewall may forward the requests or data to the web server over the network .

When the web server receives requests or data from the client computer the web server may access a database in the first SQL server A to obtain data from the database or to store data into the database. In such a case the web server may be configured to form a SQL query to obtain data from the database or to form one or more commands to insert or update data in the database at the first SQL server A. The web server may send the queries or commands to first SQL server A through the firewall and over the network and the network A. The firewall may be configured to verify that proper access is being made to the first SQL server A before sending the queries or commands over the network A.

In a case where the first SQL server A receives one or more commands to insert update modify delete or the like data or tables in a database the first SQL server A may be configured to carry out the commands. When there are two or more SQL servers A B the two or more SQL servers A B may be synchronized in real time to allow for redundancy in the system . For example each time a database is changed in the first SQL server A the change to the database may be backed up on the second SQL server B by sending information regarding the change over the network . In some embodiments the synchronization between the first SQL server A and the second SQL server B may allow for sending changes to the second SQL server B within seconds of the changes being made in the first SQL server A. Thus in case of a failure of the first SQL server A a back up copy of the database is stored for use in the second SQL server B.

In a case where the first SQL server A receives a SQL query from the web server the first SQL server A may be configured to access the relevant database and to provide data to the web server in response to the SQL query. The data sent from the first SQL server A to the web server passes over the network A through the firewall and over the network . The firewall may again provide security to verify that the data to be transmitted to the web server is of a permissible type and originated from a trusted source.

Once the web server receives the data in response to the SQL query the web server may be configured to form a new web page to send to the client computer or to issue a command with data to update an existing web page at the client computer . Such information is transmitted from the web server to the client computer by transmitting the information over the network through the firewall and over the one or more networks . The client computer may then display on a display screen the new or updated web page. It should be appreciated that the web server is able to service each of the one or more client computers in a similar fashion.

Thus in various embodiments all communications with the web server must go through the firewall which helps to protect the web server from unauthorized use or malicious attacks. Also in various embodiments only the web server is able to access the one or more SQL servers A B and such access is through the firewall which helps to protect the data in the databases at the one or more SQL servers A B from unauthorized access or malicious attacks. Moreover in various embodiments all accesses to the first SQL server A must originate from the web server which may lead to an advantage in that if the first SQL server A goes down and is unable to provide service a change must only be made at the web server to redirect queries commands and data to the second SQL server B. In such an instance the web server would be able to communicate with the second SQL server B over the network through the firewall and over the network B to keep the system functional even when the first SQL server A goes down.

Each of the one or more client computers may be located at any suitable corresponding location where there is a network connection available for connecting to the web server . In various embodiments some of the one or more client computers are located in security offices management offices customer stores or the like. In various embodiments the web server and the one or more SQL servers A B may each be located at one or more corresponding data centers run by web hosting service companies such that the web server is a hosted web server and such that the one or more SQL servers A B are hosted SQL servers.

In some embodiments rather than having a client server model with the one or more client computers and the web server a single stand alone computer not shown may be employed for incident tracking to allow users to work off line. In such a case the single stand alone computer may be configured to directly receive user input store data into and retrieve data from a local database and display information to a user. In various other embodiments other types of network configurations such as peer to peer or the like may be employed to allow for transmitting data.

The following description of embodiments of incident tracking systems and methods will be described with reference to the elements of system but it should be understood that the other types of configurations noted above could be used instead of system .

The web server may be configured to execute a computer program upon receipt of the user name password and company code to verify that the user name is a valid user name for a company specified by the company code and to verify that the password is a valid password for the user name associated with the company code. In a case that the password is not a valid password the web server may send a web page to prompt a user for another password. In a case that the password is a valid password then the web server may allow access to the user. Thus the web server provides for password protection against unauthorized use by individuals.

The company code allows for specifying a company with which the user is associated. Many companies may each have an account for tracking incidents at facilities related to the company. In addition different organizations within a company may be supplied unique company codes for accessing the web server . The web pages subsequently provided by the web server after log in may be customized based on the company code associated with the user so that the types of incidents reports information and the like available to users may be customized for each company or organization. Thus companies and organizations may capture and analyze particular information specially suited for their purposes.

Moreover different users within each company or organization may have different access privileges to input or access particular information within the system . The web server may be programmed for example to set the access privileges based on the user name specified in the log in page by referencing a table of privileges for users indexed by user name. Thus there may be some secure areas and information that are protected or even hidden from users based on their access privileges. For example in some embodiments investigation information related to investigations for incidents may be hidden from some users that do not have appropriate access privileges.

Also once a user has logged in the web server may maintain a session timer that begins counting each time a user is idle and has not submitted information to or requested information from the web server after logging in. In such a case if the session timer indicates that the user has been idle for more than a specified time period such as ten minutes then the web server may automatically terminate the session and log off the user. The user would then be forced to log in again before accessing information. Such a session timer may provide for improved security in a case where a user forgets to log off before leaving the client computer because the session will automatically be terminated after a specified idle time period has elapsed.

The incident details section includes an incident map button a details button a people involved button an items involved button a vehicles involved button an actions taken button a narrative button a police report button a pictures button an attachments button a general liability button a submit button and a submission information section .

In such embodiments upon the user logging in the web server may automatically provide additional information concerning the incident that is identified by the link to the device of the user.

With reference again to in various embodiments the method then ends in S. Thus various embodiments allow for system notifications where users are able to subscribe to receive notifications for types of incidents for which they desire to be notified. For example a user may desire to be notified of all incidents at a facility that involve vehicle injuries and may subscribe to receive notifications of such incidents. Then when such incidents occur at a facility the user may be automatically and instantly notified of the incident on a device associated with the user. In various embodiments the notification may include a link that when activated provides the user with direct access to more information concerning the incident. Also in various embodiments the notification may include a summary of the incident.

In some embodiments if an incident date associated with an incident is over a certain number of days old when entered then the notification of the users subscribed to a main category associated with the incident may be skipped. For example in various embodiments if an incident date for an entered incident is more than 3 days prior to a current date when the incident information for the incident is entered then a notification of users may be skipped so that users need not be instantly notified of older incidents. In some embodiments if an incident date of an incident indicates that the incident is already more than a certain number of days old when entered then a confirmation box may be presented to a user entering the incident information to confirm that the incident date of the incident is correct. For example if an incident date for an entered incident is more than 7 days prior to a current date when the incident information for the incident is entered then a confirmation box may be presented to have a user confirm that the incident date is correct. In some embodiments another level of verification may be required for really old incidents that are currently being entered. For example if an incident date for an entered incident is more than 100 days prior to a current date when the incident information for the incident is entered then a message may be displayed to inform a user of the situation before allowing further information related to the incident to be input.

In S a separate notification is provided to a device associated with a second contact individual in a case where it is determined that the response was not received from the first contact individual within the time period. In various embodiments the web server is programmed to provide the separate notification to the device associated with the second contact individual when the response is not received from the first contact individual within the specified amount of time. In some embodiments the first contact individual and the second contact individual may be selected based on for example a facility at which the incident occurred a main category associated with the incident or the like. In some embodiments the method is repeated such as by waiting for a response from the second contact individual and then notifying a third contact individual if no response is received from the second contact individual within a given time period and so on until a response is received from at least one contact individual within a chain of command. Thus for example in various embodiments a general manager of a facility may be notified of an incident at the facility and it may be determined whether the general manager responds to the notification within a time period and if no response is received from the general manager within the time period a head of security may be notified of the incident and so on until a response is received from a contact individual within a chain of command. The method may then end in S.

In S an insurance company is automatically notified of the incident in a case where it is determined that the incident is a potential high liability incident. In various embodiments the web server is programmed to send a notification to a device of the insurance company such as a computer of the insurance company in a case where it is determined that the incident is a potential high liability incident. In various embodiments the web server may be further programmed to receive a response from the computer of the insurance company that specifies insurance information related to the incident such as an insurance ID related to the incident names of one or more insurance case workers assigned to the incident an amount of money awarded as payment from insurance for the incident or the like. Also in various embodiments the web server may be programmed to cause the first SQL server A to store the insurance information related to the incident received from the computer of the insurance company into a database in correspondence with information related to the incident. The method may then end in S.

The XML document is formed to include various elements that each have a structure of content where the two instance of name are a start tag and an end tag respectively and the content is text that may include further elements. In various embodiments the structure of the elements in the XML document are forced to conform with syntax rules established in the DTD file. Also in various embodiments the DTD file specifies start tags and end tags for elements based on information that can be stored for incidents in a database. For example a new incident may be specified by the start tag and the end tag and content between the start tag and the end tag may include further elements related to the incident such as i an incident ID element content that indicates the incident ID for the incident ii a main category element content that indicates the main category of the incident iii a sub category element content that indicates a sub category within the main category associated with the incident iv a secondary main category element content that indicates a secondary main category of the incident v a location name element content that indicates a name of a facility where the incident occurred vi a level zone element content that indicates a level or zone within the facility where the incident occurred vii an injuries element content that indicates whether there were any injuries due to the incident viii an incident details element content that may have sub elements to indicate details related to the incident and ix any other elements that may be specified to indicate information related to the incident such as persons involved vehicles involved items involved police reports incident images or the like.

With reference to in various embodiments the web server is programmed to send one or more queries to the first SQL server A to obtain information to fill into an XML document such as the XML document or the like. The XML document illustrates an example for an incident with an incident ID number of 228518 where the incident ID number has been inserted into a content portion of the XML document between a start tag named and an end tag named . In the example XML document the main category of the incident is Vandalism and the sub category of the incident is With Major Damage which have been inserted as content between the tags of the corresponding elements in the XML document .

In various embodiments the web server is programmed to insert one or more identifiers in an XML document such as the XML document to indicate that particular data is needed or desired for an incident. For example in the XML document an identifier of Need to Add has been inserted in a content section between a start tag named and an end tag named to indicate that data for a database field concerning a name of a reporting party is needed for the incident specified in the XML document . It should be appreciated that the identifier Need to Add is merely provided as an example of one type of identifier and that various other types of identifiers or character strings may be used as an identifier. In the XML document the identifier Need to Add has also been inserted in content sections between start tags and end tags of elements corresponding to database fields of a condition and a condition to indicate that data is needed concerning weather conditions prevailing during the incident. Thus in various embodiments an XML document may provide a convenient format to indicate data that is known and stored in a database concerning an incident and to also indicate data that is needed or desired concerning the incident. With reference again to in various embodiments the method then continues to S.

In S the XML document is transmitted to a system that is able to provide appropriate data for a database field that has been identified in the XML document as a field for which data is needed. In various embodiments the XML document is automatically generated and automatically pushed to the system that is able to provide the appropriate data. In various embodiments the system to which the XML document is transmitted may comprise for example an insurance system run by an insurance company a risk management system a customer system run by a customer a security system run by a security company a loss prevention system run by a loss prevention service an engineering system run by an engineering company a maintenance system run by a maintenance company or the like. Also in various embodiments the system to which the XML document is transmitted may comprise a computer or the like. In some embodiments the XML document may include a list of attachments such as photos videos or the like related to an incident with links to the attachments.

With reference to in various embodiments the web server is programmed to transmit the XML document to the system not shown that is able to provide the appropriate data. The use of XML allows for a transfer of information to be Operating System OS independent because it is based on text. Also XML allows for data concerning an incident and a description of a meaning of the data to be combined together in a single file with a defined structure. In various embodiments the system not shown to which the XML document is transmitted is configured to store data from the XML document into a database by for example storing content from each element in the XML document into a database field that corresponds to the start tag and the end tag of the element. Also in various embodiments the system not shown to which the XML document is transmitted searches for specific identifiers such as Need to Add or the like in the XML document and replaces each identifier with appropriate data by for example retrieving data from a database field that corresponds to a start tag and an end tag of the identifier and replacing the identifier with the retrieved data to generate a reply XML document. In various embodiments the method then continues to S.

In S the reply XML document is received from the system not shown where the reply XML document includes the at least one start tag the at least one end tag and the appropriate data between the at least one start tag and the at least one end tag for the database field for which data is needed or desired. illustrates an example of a reply XML document that may be received in reply to the XML document of . As illustrated in changes between the XML document and the reply XML document the identifier Need to Add in the XML document for the element with the start tag has been replaced in the XML document with the name Abraham Israel to specify that the incident in the example was reported by a person named Abraham Israel . Also the identifier Need to Add in the XML document for the element with the start tag has been replaced in the XML document with the weather condition of Dark to specify a first weather condition for the corresponding incident. Similarly the identifier Need to Add in the XML document for the element with the start tag has been replaced in the XML document with the weather condition of Heavy Winds to specify a second weather condition for the corresponding incident. With reference again to in various embodiments the web server is programmed to receive the reply XML document. Also in various embodiments the method then continues to S.

In S the appropriate data from the reply XML document is stored into the database for the corresponding field. In various embodiments the web server is programmed to extract the appropriate data from the reply XML document from the content portions of the elements where the identifiers were located in the XML document and the web server is programmed to cause the first SQL server A to store the extracted appropriate data into a database in relation with the incident corresponding to the reply XML document. In various embodiments the method then ends in S. Thus various embodiments allow for an XML document to be formed to include data that is known about an incident and also to include identifiers to request data for the incident. Also various embodiments allow for transmitting the XML document so as to inform one or more other systems about the data known about the incident and also allow for receiving a reply XML document with identifiers of the XML document replaced by the data requested for the incident. In some embodiments the reply XML document may remove some elements from the XML document when forming the reply XML document.

As an example the web server may generate an XML document with some known data related to an incident and also include identifiers in the XML document to request data related to security information for the incident and then transmit the XML document to a security system not shown run by a security company that is able to supply the requested security information. In the example the web server may then receive a reply XML document from the security system with the identifiers in the XML document replaced by the requested data so that the requested data could then be stored in the related database fields for the incident. Such security information may include for example a security ID for the incident information about whether the incident was captured on closed circuit television a reporting party of the incident a reporting date and time of the incident a name of a security officer that arrived to the scene of the incident a date and time of arrival of the security officer to the scene of the incident weather conditions of the incident inspection conditions of a location of the incident a nearest tenant to the incident people involved in the incident vehicles involved in the incident items involved in the incident a police report for the incident or the like. As another example the XML document may be transmitted to an system run by an insurance company and a reply XML document may be returned with insurance information from the insurance company. Such insurance information may include for example an insurance ID for the incident an insurance case worker assigned to the incident an amount of money awarded from the insurance company for the incident or the like.

In some embodiments a reply XML document may be returned by a system with one or more identifiers that have not been replaced in a case where the appropriate data for the corresponding one or more fields are not currently known by the system. Also in various embodiments an XML document with identifiers requesting data may be transmitted to more than one system simultaneously to request data from more than one system at a time. In some embodiments the web server is programmed to receive pushed XML documents which are XML documents that are pushed to the web server from external systems not shown without the web server sending a request for the pushed XML documents. In such embodiments that allow for the web server to receive pushed XML documents the web server may be further programmed to extract needed data from each pushed XML document and to cause the first SQL server A to store the extracted data in relation with an incident corresponding to the pushed XML document. For example an insurance company could push an insurance ID for an incident to the web server in a pushed XML document and the web server could cause the first SQL server A to store the insurance ID in relation with information for the incident.

As an example the reply XML document of includes the start tags and in an added portion of the reply XML document which were not included in the XML document of . In the example the web server may receive the reply XML document determine that it includes additional tags that were not in the XML document extract data from content portions of elements that correspond to the additional tags and then cause the first SQL server A to store the extracted data in a database in correspondence with the incident specified in the reply XML document . Thus in the example the web server may extract the security ID of SID 2007 37 and the insurance ID of 2460 from the reply XML document and cause the first SQL server A to store the extracted security ID and insurance ID into a database in relation with information for the incident with the incident ID of 228518 .

In various embodiments the reply XML document must be transmitted along with a password such as a code that is generated from the incident ID of the incident specified in the reply XML document or the like. In various embodiments the web server and each system from which the web server receives reply XML documents or pushed XML documents have a same password logic to generate a same password number from an incident ID. Thus in various embodiments the web server may calculate a code from an incident ID of an incident and compare the code with a code received along with a reply XML document or pushed XML document so as to verify that the reply XML document or pushed XML document has been supplied from an authorized system. In some embodiments the web server only extracts data from the reply XML document or pushed XML document if the codes are determined to be the same. In some embodiments specific users may only be able to access information for incidents for which they have supplied information such as a user from an insurance company being restricted to only accessing information concerning incidents for which the insurance company has provided an insurance ID to the web server . In some embodiments updates for incidents are transmitted from the web server to a device of an end user and a device of an insurance company simultaneously.

In some embodiments the web server may transmit information concerning available tags that each correspond to a respective field in a database and that can each be selectively inserted into a reply XML document or a pushed XML document to demarcate respective data for the respective field. Such information about available tags may be considered as a type of Application Programming Interface API that specifies elements for XML documents that are recognized by the web server . In various embodiments external systems not shown may use the information concerning the available tags to send particular information to the web server to have the web server associate the particular information with a corresponding incident. In various embodiments the web server provides a file such as an XML Schema language file or the like that defines a valid schema for XML documents to be provided to the web server . In some embodiments a Software Development Kit SDK may be provided with development tools to allow for software engineers to develop programs to interact with a program running on the web server to transmit data to the web server concerning incidents or to receive data from the web server concerning incidents. Such an SDK may define a standard interface to allow programs to automatically interface with the web server to provide and obtain information about incidents. In various embodiments the web server may transmit programs such as Java applets or the like that are to be run by external systems not shown to interface with the web server to transmit and receive information about incidents.
