This disclosure relates to generating graphical representations of data and more particularly generating graphical representations of on demand data.

As a visual representation of data charts are an important component of analytics and many modern applications have the need to not only display a chart but also allows the users to create and edit the chart. Additionally as more users are becoming mobile e.g. employing mobile devices to conduct business considerations of creating and editing the chart in view of a mobile platform should be considered.

The present disclosure relates to computer implemented methods software and systems for generating a data based graphical representation. In some implementations a graphical user interface GUI is provided to a user. The GUI includes selectable attribute names. Each attribute name includes a metric that is associated with a portion of data. A user selection is received of a first attribute name of the selectable attribute names. In response to receiving the user selection of the first attribute name a call to a back end server is invoked. The back end server includes a database that stores sets of attribute values. Each set of attribute values is associated with one of the selectable attribute names. A response to the invoked call is received from the back end server. The response includes a particular set of attribute values that is associated with the user selected first attribute name. The graphical representation is generated of a relationship between the received attribute values associated with the user selected first attribute name and a key figure of the attribute values. The key figure includes a statistical value associated with each of the received attribute values. The graphical representation is prepared for display on the graphical user interface.

Other general implementations include corresponding computer systems apparatus and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices each configured to perform the actions of the methods. A system of one or more computers can be configured to perform operations to perform the actions. One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that when executed by data processing apparatus cause the apparatus to perform the actions.

A second aspect combinable with any of the previous aspects includes displaying to the user the graphical user interface that further includes selectable data sources the selectable data sources include an attribute data source receiving a user selection of the attribute data source and in response to receiving the user selection of the attribute data source providing to the user the graphical user interface that includes the selectable attribute names.

A third aspect combinable with any of the previous aspects includes the graphical representation including a bar chart with an x axis of the bar chart associated with the received attribute values and the y axis of the bar chart associated with the key figure.

A fourth aspect combinable with any of the previous aspects includes receiving a user selection of one or more of the received attribute values filtering the received attribute values to provide a subset of attribute values the subset of attribute values includes the selected attribute values and generating the graphical representation of the relationship between the subset of attribute values and the key figure of the subset of attribute values.

A fifth aspect combinable with any of the previous aspects includes in response to receiving the user selection of the first attribute name grouping the key figures of the attribute values based on the user selected first attribute name.

A sixth aspect combinable with any of the previous aspects includes receiving a user selection of a second attribute name of the selectable attribute names in response to receiving the user selection of the second attribute name invoking an additional call to the back end server receiving from the back end server an additional response to the additional invoked call the additional response including only a particular set of attribute values that is associated with the user selected second attribute name receiving a user selection of a received attribute value that is associated with the user selected second attribute name filtering the received attribute values that are associated with the user selected first attribute name to provide a subset of attribute values that are associated with the user selected first attribute name and generating the graphical representation of the relationship between the subset of the attribute values that are associated with the user selected first attribute name and the key figure of the subset of the attribute values that are associated with the user selected first attribute name.

A seventh aspect combinable with any of the previous aspects includes wherein the graphical representation is a bar chart with an x axis of the bar chart associated with the subset of the attribute values that are associated with the user selected first attribute and the y axis of the bar chart associated with the key figure.

Specifically depicts a graphical user interface GUI that is provided to a user. For example the user can be associated with the client computing system and the client computing system can include the GUI similar to that of GUI . The GUI includes a selection portion a display portion and a summary portion .

The selection portion includes selectable e.g. user interactive interface elements. For example the user can provide input to the interface elements of the selection portion to facilitate generation of the graphical representation described further below. In some examples the selection portion includes a selectable data source interface element . The selectable data source interface element includes categorized data that is associated with a graphical representation. For example the selectable data sources of the selectable data source interface element include a scenarios data source an attribute data source a time data source and a key figures data source .

In response to a user selection of the key figures data source of the selectable data sources interface element the selection portion is updated to include a selectable key figures interface element . In some examples the selectable data source interface element is updated to depict selection of the key figures data source . For example the key figures data source e.g. the graphical representation of the key figures data source can be highlighted bolded or otherwise graphically distinct from the remaining data sources of the data source interface element .

In some examples a key figure e.g. of the key figures data source includes a statistical value associated with an attribute value. In other words a key figure includes a measure of a particular property of an entity e.g. the attribute value. For example the key figures data source includes a capacity limit key and a target revenue key figure. In some examples the key figures interface element is updated to depict selection of the capacity limit key . For example the capacity limit key e.g. the graphical representation of the capacity limit key can be highlighted bolded or otherwise graphically distinct from the remaining key figures of the key figures data source .

The display portion illustrates a relationship between data elements e.g. a chart described further below. The display portion includes a graph type selection . For example a list of one or more types of charts can be provided and selected by the user. The summary portion includes a summary of data that is selected by the user within the selection portion and or displayed by the display portion . For example the summary portion includes a groupings portion a selected key figures portion a selected scenarios portion and a setting portion . For example the key figures portion is based on a summary of the key figures selected by the user within the key figures interface element e.g. the capacity limit key .

In response to receiving the user selection of the attributes data source e.g. received by the client computing system the selection portion is updated to include a selectable attribute names interface element . The attribute names interface element includes attribute names that are associated with the attributes data source . In some examples each attribute name of the attribute names interface element comprises a metric that is associated with a portion of data. For example the attribute names interface element includes eight selectable attribute names including a customer ID attribute name a customer region attribute name a location ID attribute name a location region attribute name and a product BU attribute name. The remaining attribute names are obtainable for display by providing a scrolling user input to the attribute names interface element .

In some implementations the GUI includes only the selectable attribute names of the attribute names interface element . That is in response to receiving the user selection of the attribute data source the client computing system only receives the attribute names that are associated with the attributes data source from a back end server e.g. the enterprise server computing system . Furthermore the client computing system does not receive any further data e.g. attribute values that are associated with the attribute names of the attribute names interface element in response to receiving the user selection of the attribute data source .

In response to receiving the user selection of the customer ID attribute name e.g. received by the client computing system a call is invoked to a back end server e.g. the enterprise server computing system that comprises a database e.g. the memory and or the repository . For example the call can include a request for attribute values associated with the customer ID attribute name . The client computing system can transmit the call to the enterprise computing system over the network . In some examples metadata of the call can be updated to be associated with the customer ID attribute name or otherwise associated e.g. tagged. In some implementations the call includes only a request for attribute values associated with the customer ID attribute name . That is the call does not include a request for attribute values associated with unselected attribute names or other data associated with the unselected attribute names.

To that end the database stores or provides access to sets of attribute values. Particularly for example the database stores a table that includes associations between the attribute names e.g. of the selectable attribute names interface element and attribute values for each of the attribute names. In some examples each set of attribute values is associated with one of the selectable attribute names of the selectable attribute names interface element . In some examples each set of attribute values is associated with only one of the selectable attribute names of the selectable attribute names interface element .

A response from the back end server e.g. the enterprise server computing system to the invoked call is received e.g. by the client computing system . For example the enterprise server computing system communicates the response to the client computing system over the network . The response includes a particular set of attribute values that is associated with the user selected attribute name e.g. the customer ID attribute name . For example the response includes the customer ID attribute values that are associated with the customer ID attribute name . The customer ID attribute values can include customer IDs e.g. . . . n.

In some implementations the response includes only the particular set of attribute values that is associated with the user selected attribute name e.g. the customer ID attribute name . That is the response does not include attribute values associated with unselected attribute names or other data associated with the unselected attribute names.

In some examples the invoked call and the response to the invoked call are performed by the client computing system and the enterprise server computing system only in response to user input. That is calls that are not in response to a user input are not performed. By doing so resources e.g. computational resources associated with performing such calls and responses are minimized e.g. round trips of data communication is minimized. For example resource bandwidth is reduced or minimized by 1 only performing a call in response to an appropriate user input e.g. the user selection of the customer ID attribute name and 2 by returning only attribute values that are associated with the user selection of the customer ID attribute name e.g. the attribute values. Thus unnecessary calls associated with unselected attribute names are avoided thus minimizing resource expense and further only attribute values associated with a user selected attribute name are provided in a response to the call. For example the call associated with user selection of the customer ID attribute name is only invoked after user selection of the same and further only attribute values associated with the customer ID attribute name are provided in a response to the call. In some examples resource expenses can include processing resources of the client computing system the server computing system or both and bandwidth associated with the network . In some examples the attribute values are provided to the client computing system on demand. 

Additionally in response to receiving the response from the back end server the selection portion is updated to include a customer ID interface element . The customer ID interface element includes customer ID attribute values that are associated with the customer ID attribute name . For example the customer ID interface element includes one hundred selectable attribute values e.g. customer IDs e.g. . . . n. The remaining un displayed attribute values are obtainable for display by providing a scrolling user input to customer ID interface element .

Additionally the GUI is further updated such that the display portion includes a graphical representation e.g. a chart. In some implementations the graphical representation illustrates a relationship between the attribute values associated with the selected attribute name e.g. the customer ID attribute name and a key figure of the attribute values e.g. the selected target revenue key . For example the target revenue key is a statistical value e.g. a target revenue that is associated with the attribute values e.g. customer IDs that are associated with the customer ID attribute name .

In some implementations in response to selecting the attribute values the received attribute values associated with the customer ID attribute name are filtered to provide a subset of attribute values. That is the attribute values e.g. the customer IDs . . . n are filtered such that the subset of attribute values includes only the selected attribute values 

To that end the graphical representation can be generated to illustrate the relationship between the subset of the attribute values associated with the selected attribute name e.g. the attribute values and the key figure associated with the subset of the attribute values e.g. the attribute values . For example the graphical representation includes a vertical bar chart depicting the target revenue key for the attribute values 

In some implementations the graphical representation is a vertical or a horizontal bar chart. In some examples the bar chart includes a x axis and a y axis with the x axis of the bar chart associated with the received attribute values e.g. the attribute values associated with the customer ID attribute name and the y axis of the bar chart associated with the selected key figure. For example the x axis of the graphical representation is associated with the attribute values and the y axis of the graphical representation is associated with the target revenue key .

In some implementations the user can further provide additional user input regarding grouping of the key figures. Specifically the user can select one of the attribute names of the attribute names interface element . In some examples the attribute names interface element further includes selection boxes adjacent each of the attribute names. For example the customer ID attribute name is associated with a selection box . When the selection box is selected e.g. the user selects the selection box by checking the box the key figures of the attribute values associated with the customer ID attribute name are grouped by the customer ID attribute name .

In response to the user selection of the selection box the values of the key figure of the attribute values e.g. the selected target revenue key are grouped by the customer ID attribute name . That is for the graphical representation including the vertical bar chart the x axis is associated with the customer ID attribute name . For example the x axis includes the attribute values of 101 and 103 that are associated with the customer ID attribute name .

The graphical representation is prepared e.g. by the client computing system for display on the GUI e.g. the GUI .

In response to receiving the user selection of the customer region attribute name e.g. received by the client computing system an additional call is invoked to the back end server e.g. the enterprise server computing system . For example the additional call can include a request for attribute values associated with the customer region attribute name described further below. The client computing system can transmit the additional call to the enterprise computing system over the network . In some examples metadata of the additional call can be updated to be associated with the customer region attribute name or otherwise associated e.g. tagged. In some implementations the additional call includes only a request for attribute values associated with the customer region attribute name . That is the additional call does not include a request for attribute values associated with unselected attribute names or other data associated with the unselected attribute names. Furthermore the call does not include a request for attribute values associated with other selected attribute names e.g. the customer ID attribute name .

An additional response from the back end server e.g. the enterprise server computing system to the additional invoked call is received e.g. by the client computing system . For example the enterprise server computing system communicates the additional response to the client computing system over the network . The additional response includes a particular set of attribute values that is associated with the user selected attribute name e.g. the customer region attribute name .

In some implementations the additional response includes only the particular set of attribute values that is associated with the user selected attribute name e.g. the customer region attribute name . That is the additional response does not include attribute values associated with unselected attribute names or other data associated with the unselected attribute names. Furthermore the additional response does not include attribute values associated with other selected attribute names e.g. the customer ID attribute name .

Additionally in response to receiving the response from the back end server the selection portion is updated to include a customer region interface element . The customer region interface element includes customer region attribute values that are associated with the customer region attribute name . For example the customer region attribute values can include customer regions e.g. North Am APAC EMEA and South Am. 

The user can select or more of the received attribute values from the customer region interface element e.g. the attribute value . In some examples the customer region interface element is updated to depict selection of the attribute value . For example the attribute value e.g. the graphical representation of the attribute value can be highlighted bolded or otherwise graphically distinct form the remaining unselected attribute values of the customer region interface element .

In some implementations in response to selecting the attribute value the received attribute values associated with the customer ID attribute name are filtered to provide a subset of attribute values. For example the attribute values e.g. the customer IDs . . . n are filtered in view of the selected attribute value . That is the customer IDs are filtered to include customer IDs that are associated with the attribute value that is the North Am customer region.

Additionally the GUI is further updated such that the display portion includes a graphical representation e.g. a chart. In some implementations the graphical representation illustrates a relationship between the subset of the attribute values associated with the customer ID attribute name that are filtered in view of the attribute value and a key figure of the attribute values associated with the customer ID attribute name that are filtered in view of the attribute value e.g. the selected target revenue key .

In some implementations when the graphical representation is a chart the x axis of the bar chart is associated with the received attribute values e.g. the attribute values associated with the customer ID attribute name and the y axis of the bar chart is associated with the selected key figure. For example the x axis of the graphical representation is associated with the attribute values that are filtered in view of the attribute value and the y axis of the graphical representation is associated with the target revenue key .

In response to receiving the user selection of the product BU attribute name e.g. received by the client computing system a further call is invoked to a back end server e.g. the enterprise server computing system . For example the further call can include a request for attribute values associated with the product BU attribute name described further below. The client computing system can transmit the further call to the enterprise computing system over the network . In some examples metadata of the call can be updated to be associated with the product BU attribute name or otherwise associated e.g. tagged. In some implementations the further call includes only a request for attribute values associated with the product BU attribute name . That is the call does not include a request for attribute values associated with unselected attribute names or other data associated with the unselected attribute names. Furthermore the call does not include a request for attribute values associated with other selected attribute names e.g. the customer ID attribute name or the customer region attribute name .

A further response from the back end server e.g. the enterprise server computing system to the further invoked call is received e.g. by the client computing system . For example the enterprise server computing system communicates the further response to the client computing system over the network . The further response includes a particular set of attribute values that is associated with the user selected attribute name e.g. the product BU attribute name .

In some implementations the further response includes only the particular set of attribute values that is associated with the user selected attribute name e.g. the product BU attribute name . That is the further response does not include attribute values associated with unselected attribute names or other data associated with the unselected attribute names. Furthermore the further response does not include attribute values associated with other selected attribute names e.g. the customer ID attribute name or the customer region attribute name .

Additionally in response to receiving the response from the back end server the selection portion is updated to include a product BU interface element . The product BU interface element includes product BU attribute values that are associated with the product BU attribute name . For example the product BU attribute values can include product names e.g. product 1 and product 2. 

The user can select or more of the received attribute values from the product BU interface element e.g. the attribute value . In some examples the product BU interface element is updated to depict selection of the attribute values . For example the attribute values e.g. the graphical representation of the attribute values can be highlighted bolded or otherwise graphically distinct form the remaining unselected attribute values of the product BU interface element .

In some implementations in response to selecting the attribute value the received attribute values associated with the customer ID attribute name are filtered to provide a subset of attribute values. That is the attribute values e.g. the customer IDs . . . n are filtered in view of the selected attribute value e.g. North Am and South Am and further are filtered in view of the selected attribute values e.g. product 1 and product 1. That is the customer IDs are filtered to include customer IDs that are associated with the attribute values that is the North Am and South Am customer regions and further filtered to include customer IDs that are also associated with the attribute values that is product 1 and product 2. 

Additionally the GUI is further updated such that the display portion includes a graphical representation e.g. a chart. In some implementations the graphical representation illustrates a relationship between the subset of the attribute values associated with the customer ID attribute name that are filtered to in view of the attribute values and a key figure of the attribute values associated with the customer ID attribute name that are filtered to in view of the attribute value e.g. the selected target revenue key .

In some implementations when the graphical representation is a chart the x axis of the bar chart is associated with the received attribute values e.g. the attribute values associated with the customer attribute name and the y axis of the bar chart is associated with the selected key figure. For example the x axis of the graphical representation is associated with the attribute values that are filtered in view of the attribute values and the y axis of the graphical representation is associated with the target revenue key .

In step a graphical user interface GUI is provided to a user. The GUI comprises multiple selectable attribute names each attribute name including a metric that is associated with a portion of data. For example the GUI is provided to the user the GUI including the selectable attribute names interface element that includes multiple attribute names.

In step a user selection of a first attribute name of the selectable attribute names is received. For example the user can select one or more of the attribute names from the selectable attribute names interface element e.g. the customer ID attribute name .

In step in response to receiving the user selection of the first attribute name a call is invoked to a back end server. The back end server includes a database. The database stores sets of attribute values each set of attribute values associated with one of the selectable attribute names. For example in response to receiving the user selection of the customer ID attribute name e.g. received by the client computing system a call is invoked to a back end server e.g. the enterprise server computing system that comprises a database e.g. the memory and or the repository .

In some implementations in response to receiving the user selection of the first attribute name the key figures of the attribute values are grouped based on the user selected first attribute name. For example the user can select one of the attribute names of the attribute names interface element . That is when the selection box is selected the key figures of the attribute values associated with the customer ID attribute name are grouped by the customer ID attribute name .

In step a response to the invoked call is received from a back end server. The response includes a particular set of attribute values that is associated with the user selected first attribute name.

The response includes a particular set of attribute values that is associated with the user selected attribute name e.g. the customer ID attribute name .

In some implementations the response includes only the particular set of attribute values that is associated with the user selected first attribute name. For example the response includes only the particular set of attribute values that is associated with the user selected attribute name e.g. the customer ID attribute name . That is the response does not include attribute values associated with unselected attribute names or other data associated with the unselected attribute names.

In step the graphical representation of a relationship between the received attribute values associated with the user selected first attribute name and a key figure of the attribute values is generated. The key figure includes a statistical value associated with each of the received attribute values.

A computer program may but need not correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data e.g. one or more scripts stored in a markup language document in a single file dedicated to the program in question or in multiple coordinated files e.g. files that store one or more modules sub programs or portions of code. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network. While portions of the programs illustrated in the various figures are shown as individual modules that implement the various features and functionality through various objects methods or other processes the programs may instead include a number of sub modules third party services components libraries and such as appropriate. Conversely the features and functionality of various components can be combined into single components as appropriate.

Computers suitable for the execution of a computer program include by way of example can be based on general or special purpose microprocessors or both or any other kind of central processing unit. Generally a central processing unit will receive instructions and data from a read only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a central processing unit for performing or executing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally a computer will also include or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to or both one or more mass storage devices for storing data e.g. magnetic magneto optical disks or optical disks. However a computer need not have such devices. Moreover a computer can be embedded in another device e.g. a mobile telephone a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile audio or video player a game console a Global Positioning System GPS receiver or a portable storage device e.g. a universal serial bus USB flash drive to name just a few.

Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well for example feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback e.g. visual feedback auditory feedback or tactile feedback and input from the user can be received in any form including acoustic speech or tactile input. In addition a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user for example by sending web pages to a web browser on a user s client device in response to requests received from the web browser.

The term graphical user interface or GUI may be used in the singular or the plural to describe one or more graphical user interfaces and each of the displays of a particular graphical user interface. Therefore a GUI may represent any graphical user interface including but not limited to a web browser a touch screen or a command line interface CLI that processes information and efficiently presents the information results to the user. In general a GUI may include a plurality of user interface UI elements some or all associated with a web browser such as interactive fields pull down lists and buttons operable by the business suite user. These and other UI elements may be related to or represent the functions of the web browser.

Implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component e.g. as a data server or that includes a middleware component e.g. an application server or that includes a front end component e.g. a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification or any combination of one or more such back end middleware or front end components.

The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client server relationship to each other.

While this specification contains many specific implementation details these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of any invention or on the scope of what may be claimed but rather as descriptions of features that may be specific to particular implementations of particular inventions. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate implementations can also be implemented in combination in a single implementation. Conversely various features that are described in the context of a single implementation can also be implemented in multiple implementations separately or in any suitable sub combination. Moreover although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination and the claimed combination may be directed to a sub combination or variation of a sub combination.

Similarly while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order e.g. this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order or that all illustrated operations be performed to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover the separation of various system modules and components in the implementations described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all implementations and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.

Particular implementations of the subject matter have been described. Other implementations alterations and permutations of the described implementations are within the scope of the following claims as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. Accordingly the above description of example implementations does not define or constrain this disclosure. Other changes substitutions and alterations are also possible without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure.
