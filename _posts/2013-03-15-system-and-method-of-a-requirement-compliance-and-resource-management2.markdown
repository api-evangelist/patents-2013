Buffer can be used to protect the constraint from varying in the entire the requirement compliance and resource management methodology. Buffer can also allow for normal variation and the occasional upset before and behind the constraint.

An event coordination matrix ECM is a tool that can enable cross functional and cross enterprise coordination for facilitating verification validation certification and accreditation VVC A planning and execution.

The development of the ECM can be driving factor in verification planning activities. Typically ECM can be developed early in the verification planning process to drive an early adoption amongst key stakeholders and also to allow for an identification of potential discrepancies as early as possible.

The responsibility of the development of the ECM primarily relies on inputs from a test and verification T V team a system engineering SE team and an enterprise integration EI team with additional inputs provided by specialty engineering quality assurance mission assurance information assurance and logistics planning.

The development population and refinement of the ECM is coordinated both within the system engineering integration SE I organization and prime contractor organization by the EI team to ensure a thorough and balanced approach across the enterprise.

Once all requirements both imposed and derived have been addressed through VVC A and identified by the SE team then all activities or events where the VVC A will occur have been identified by the T V team the requirements are then allocated to the set of specific events.

As depicted in the left side of the ECM includes the requirements information and the top of the ECM addresses the individual events that are planned to accomplish the VVC A.

Within the ECM all activities and events where VVC A to be performed are documented and tracked. The objective of the ECM is to correlate all requirements to specific activities and events. By focusing on all VVC A activities as opposed to test only it becomes possible to optimize the T V approach across the entire breadth of the program allowing the T V team to factor in analysis inspection and demonstration events into their verification planning. By analyzing the VVC A activities across the program the T V team can act in a truly integrated fashion optimizing the development and re use of test data scenarios run conditions truth models environmental conditions and even the execution of entire events to allow for efficient planning.

By looking at the complete picture of all integrated verification activities the SE I organization truly has insight and oversight into the planned activities of the prime contractors and can identify areas of the program where there is either not enough verification being planned for example mission critical requirements MCRs interoperability requirements and critical technical parameter CTP requirements or too much verification being planned redundant or extraneous events .

An added benefit of this integrated approach to verification planning is that it now becomes possible for the T V organization to report confidence to the customer about when technical functionality will come on board and also to understand the impact of changes to schedule performance and budget thereby facilitating more accurate trade analysis and higher confidence recommendations on how to solve both programmatic and technical problems as they arise.

A key consideration to note is the time phase approach to the identification of Analysis Inspection Demonstration Test AIDT events. Identifying events that only represent final acceptance tests FAT as the primary focus of an integrated T V approach is short sighted and will not allow the SE I to truly act as a system integrator thereby making it much more difficult to report incremental progress and thus confidence to the customer. As the program progresses the SE I organization has identified analysis events that will occur prior to FAT. These analysis events allow the SE I organization to analyze the technical details of the prime contractor s exercises rehearsals and even internal verification activities.

By scheduling analysis events that are centered on both technical capability delivery and reasonable time phasing the SE I organization can more accurately predict when technical capabilities will be delivered and provide more accurate actionable data upon which the customer can make decisions.

Another key consideration is the design versus acceptance verification. The design verification encompasses those things typically performed once for a system induced environments etc. and in many cases by inspection. The acceptance verification can occur on a component by component or build by build basis. As the requirements are allocated to the events the verification type AIDT is captured in the ECM to ensure that the validation and verification is addressed adequately.

Given the considerations defined above in order to optimize the benefit of a truly integrated SE I methodology all aspects of VVC A have to be addressed in one matrix ensuring the AIDT and VVC A activities can be performed once and at the lowest cost risk and most optimum time venue.

A major challenge in the requirement compliance and resource management methodology as described in is in qualitative and imprecise terms.

The use of soft functional requirements in a task based specification methodology can capture the imprecise requirements and formulate soft functional requirements using a fuzzy logic algorithm module. More specifically the soft functional requirements can be represented by canonical form in test score semantics.

A fuzzy logic algorithm module can be implemented as follows a define linguistic variables and terms b construct membership functions c construct rule base d convert crisp inputs into fuzzy values utilizing membership functions fuzzification e evaluate rules in the rule base inference f combine the results of each rules inference and g convert outputs into non fuzzy values de fuzzification .

Fuzzy logic is a relatively new technique for solving problems related to requirement compliance and resource management methodology. The key idea of fuzzy logic is that it uses a simple easy way to secure the output s from the input s wherein the outputs can be related to the inputs by using if statements.

Effective management of requirement compliance and resource management methodology is crucial in producing a new product and or new system.

In a competitive world organizations are forced to look for scientific tools in evaluation of effective management of requirement compliance and resource management methodology. The management team is responsible for producing an output and hence the management team must be constantly aware of the goal purpose and management efficiency. Furthermore effectiveness in requirement compliance and resource management methodology which is a synonym of a project success is measured or assessed in terms of the degree of achievement of project objectives.

For example if project time delay PTD is low L and project time delay gradient PTDG is high H then according to a fuzzy decision the project management efficiency PME is very high VH .

However the boundaries of very high high medium and low of any decision variable are determined by expert knowledge.

A fuzzy decision making system is a scientific tool that can be used to solve the problem. This means that information of expert knowledge and experience in a fuzzy decision making system is used for determining the project management efficiency.

The development of such a fuzzy decision making system can be implemented by utilizing the Mathworks software. Fuzzy Logic Toolbox from Mathworks Software is a menu driven software that can allow the implementation of fuzzy constructs like membership functions and a database of decision rules.

Fuzzy Logic Toolbox from Mathworks Software also provides Mathworks Software s MATLAB functions graphical tools and Mathworks Software s Simulink blocks for analyzing designing and simulating systems based on fuzzy logic.

Furthermore Fuzzy Logic Toolbox from Mathworks Software enables a design fuzzy inference systems including fuzzy clustering and neuro fuzzy system.

A neural network can approximate a function but it is impossible to interpret the result in terms of natural language. The fusion of neural networks and fuzzy logic in neuro fuzzy system can provide both learning as well as readability. Neuro fuzzy system is based on combinations of artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic.

Neuro fuzzy system can use fuzzy inference engine with fuzzy rules for modeling the project uncertainties which is enhanced through learning the various situations with a radial basis function RBF neural network.

A radial basis function RBF neural network consists of an input layer hidden layer and output layer with the activation function of the hidden units being radial basis functions. Normally an RBF consists of a hidden layer and a linear output layer. One of the most common kinds of radial basis function is the Gaussian bell shaped distribution. The response of the hidden layer unit is dependent on the distance of an input is from the centre represented by the radial basis function Euclidean Distance . Each radial function has two parameters a centre and a width. The width of the basis function determines the spread of the function and how quickly the activation of the hidden node decreases with the input being an increased distance from the centre. The output layer neurons are weighted linear combination of the RBF in the hidden layer. RBF network can be modeled by the following equations 

For inherent uncertainties in the requirement compliance and resource management methodology due to external factors shifting business objectives and poorly defined methods a neuro fuzzy system can be utilized for scenario planning.

Fuzzy set theory is a generalization of the ordinary set theory. A fuzzy set is a set whose elements belong to the set with some degree of membership . Let X be a collection of objects. It is called universe of discourse. A fuzzy set AX is characterized by membership function A x represents the degree of membership Degree of membership maps each element between 0 and 1. It is defined as A x x xX.

It is X 15.25 . At X of 18.75 the fuzzy set is a small with membership value of 0.6. Hence 18.75 is 0.6 18.75 is 0.4 and 18.75 is 0.4.

Fuzzy inference system is a rule based system. It is based on fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic. Fuzzy inference system is mappings from an input space to an output space. Fuzzy inference system allows constructing structures which are used to generate responses outputs for certain stimulations inputs . Response of fuzzy inference system is based on stored knowledge relationships between responses and stimulations . Knowledge is stored in the form of a rule base. Rule base is a set of rules. Rule base expresses relations between inputs of system and its expected outputs. Knowledge is obtained by eliciting information from specialists. These systems are usually known as fuzzy expert systems. Another common denomination for fuzzy inference system is fuzzy knowledge based systems. It is also called as data driven fuzzy systems. A fuzzy decision making system is comprised of four main components a fuzzification interface a knowledge base decision making logic and a defuzzification interface. In essence a fuzzy decision making system is a fuzzy expert system. A fuzzy expert system is oriented towards numerical processing where conventional expert systems are mainly symbolic reasoning engines.

There are key four components in a decision flow chart of the fuzzy logic module a The fuzzification interface It measures the values of the input variables on their membership functions to determine the degree of truth for each rule premise b The knowledge base It comprises experts knowledge of the application domain and the decision rules that govern the relationships between inputs and outputs. The membership functions of inputs and outputs are designed by experts based on their knowledge of the system and experience c The decision making logic It is similar to simulating human decision making in inferring fuzzy control actions based on the rules of inference in fuzzy logic. The evaluation of a rule is based on computing the truth value of its premise part and applying it to its conclusion part. This results in assigning one fuzzy subset to each output variable of the rule. In Min Inference the entire strength of the rule is considered as the minimum membership value of the input variables membership values. A rule is said to be fire if the degree of truth of the premise part of the rule is not zero d The defuzzification interface It converts a fuzzy control action a fuzzy output into a nonfuzzy control action a crisp output . The most common used method in defuzzification is the center of area method COA . The center of area method computes the crisp value as the weighted average of a fuzzy set.

Statistical Algorithm Module F Feature 1 Statistics variability. Statistical Algorithm Module F Benefit 1 Provides statistical estimating capability for empirical results that require statistical modeling to assess performance variability.

A Monte Carlo simulation can help solve problems that are too complicated to solve using equations or problems for which no equations exist. It is useful for problems which have lots of uncertainty in inputs.

In cost management one can use Monte Carlo simulation to better understand project budget and estimate final budget at completion. Instead of assigning a probability distribution to the project task durations project manager assigns the distribution to the project costs. These estimates are normally produced by a project cost expert and the final product is a probability distribution of the final total project cost. Project managers often use this distribution to set aside a project budget reserve to be used when contingency plans are necessary to respond to risk events. Monte Carlo simulation can also be used when making capital budgeting and investment decisions. Risk analysis is part of every decision made in the requirement compliance and resource management.

The requirement compliance and resource management is constantly faced with uncertainty ambiguity and variability. And even though there may be an unprecedented access to information one can t accurately model the future.

A Monte Carlo simulation allows seeing all the possible outcomes of decisions and assessing the impact of risk allowing for better decision making under uncertainty for requirement compliance and resource management.

A Monte Carlo simulation encompasses a technique of statistical sampling to approximate a solution to a quantitative problem.

The requirement compliance and resource management methodology contains many variables. However each variable has many possible values represented by a probability distribution function p x .

Probability distribution function p x of each variable is a realistic way of describing uncertainty in each variable in a risk analysis.

By contrast a Monte Carlo simulation can sample probability distribution function for each variable to produce hundreds or thousands of possible outcomes. The results are analyzed to get probabilities of different outcomes occurring.

In contrast to a Monte Carlo simulation a spreadsheet project cost model utilizes traditional what if scenarios wherein what if analysis gives equal weight to all scenarios.

Common probability distribution functions p x are Normal Bell Curve The user simply defines the mean or expected value and a standard deviation to describe the variation about the mean. Values in the middle near the mean are most likely to occur. Lognormal Values are positively skewed not symmetric like a normal distribution. It is used to represent values that don t go below zero but have unlimited positive potential. Uniform All values have an equal chance of occurring and the user simply defines the minimum and maximum. Triangular The user defines the minimum most likely and maximum values. Values around the most likely are more likely to occur. Variables that could be described by a triangular distribution include past sales history per unit of time and inventory levels. PERT The user defines the minimum most likely and maximum values just like the triangular distribution. Values around the most likely are more likely to occur. However values between the most likely and extremes are more likely to occur than the triangular that is the extremes are not as emphasized. Discrete The user defines specific values that may occur and the likelihood of each.

A Monte Carlo simulation performs a risk analysis by building models of possible results by substituting a range of values a probability distribution p x for any variable factor that has an inherent uncertainty. It then calculates results over and over each time using a different set of random values from the probability function p x . Depending on the number of uncertainties and the ranges specified for them a Monte Carlo simulation could involve thousands or tens of thousands of recalculations before it is completed. A Monte Carlo simulation produces distributions of possible outcome values.

A Monte Carlo simulation simulates the requirement compliance and resource management methodology many times thousands or tens of thousands of recalculations and each time selecting a value of each variable from its probability distribution function p x .

The outcome is a probability distribution of overall compliance and resource management methodology through iterations of the model.

A Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful tool to quantify the potential effects of uncertainties of many variables in the requirement compliance and resource management methodology .

But it should be noted a Monte carol simulation is only as good as model it is simulating and data information probability distribution function p x of a variable is fed into.

Furthermore open ended distributions e.g. lognormal distribution can be preferable than closed ended e.g. triangular distribution distributions in a Monte carol simulation.

A Monte Carlo simulation can generally answer to the questions e.g. what is the probability of meeting the project budget or what is the probability of meeting the project time deadline or what is an optimum value of a project cost 

A Monte Carlo simulation provides a number of advantages over deterministic or single point estimate analysis.

For example Probabilistic Results. Results show not only what could happen but how likely each outcome is.

For example Graphical Results. Because of the data a Monte Carlo simulation generates it is easy to create graphs of different outcomes and their chances of occurrence. This is important for communicating findings to all stakeholders.

For example Sensitivity Analysis. With just a few cases deterministic analysis makes it difficult to see which variables impact the outcome the most. In a Monte Carlo simulation it is easy to see which inputs had the biggest effect on bottom line results.

For example Scenario Analysis In deterministic models it is very difficult to model different combinations of values for different inputs to see the effects of truly different scenarios. Using a Monte Carlo simulation analysts can see exactly which inputs had which values together when certain outcomes occurred. This is invaluable for pursuing further analysis.

For example Correlation of Inputs. In a Monte Carlo simulation it s possible to model interdependent relationships between input variables. It s important for accuracy to represent how in reality when some factors go up others go up or down accordingly.

In the weighting logic algorithm module F provides a method of increasing confidence in the prediction of TPMs. Parametric values are vertically summed for each level of integration for a given system i.e. System Segment Element and Assembly and shown in the Spec Sum row. An arbitrary numeric scaling factor or weight is applied to each level of assembly thereby increasing the influence that the summed value has on the overall system for that particular level of integration. Summed values are multiplied by respective scale factors to produce a scaled total which is then added to yield an overall verification amount 485 in this example. The system level parametric value of 15 is then divided by 485 to yield 0.0309 an effective system level scaling factor which can be applied to each measured value of the overall system.

In the system level scaling factor 0.0309 is multiplied by each measured value in the tree then multiplied by the Spec Scale factor from . To obtain the Scaled Total values the system level scaling factor 0.0309 is multiplies by the Spec Sum which is then multiplied by the scale factor for each level of integration. For example the Scaled Total value for the Segment level of integration would be system level scaling factor 0.0309 Spec Scale Factor 2 Spec Sum 21 1.30.

In to obtain the percent total that each level of integration s verification data contributes to the overall system level TPM the Scaled Total values from is divided by the System level requirement value 15 . For example the assembly level contribution would be 9.40 15 or 62.7 .

The requirement compliance and resource management methodology can provide a method of predicting system performance parameters throughout the program development life cycle. As top level system requirements or technical performance measurements TPMs are assessed a statistical weighting algorithm gives users the ability to weight or influence the empirical data of some elements more than others in the same set.

As measurements are collected to verify lower level requirements the requirement compliance and resource management methodology can provide users with the ability to assign an arbitrary weighting coefficient to these measurements to increase their influence on the top level performance prediction at a given point in time.

Lower level measurement weighting coefficients are typically greater than higher level coefficients since there are a fewer system elements variables associated with the lower level measurement thereby increasing measurement confidence.

In the development of the Event Coordination Sheets ECS starts with the baseline specifications. In section 4.0 of system specifications verification methods are assigned to each requirement in accordance with applicable standards. Requirements are then mapped into verification events based on the event objectives. One approach to defining verification events and determining which requirements should be mapped into specific verification events is to develop a spreadsheet similar to that shown in . TPMs and Mission Critical requirements are then identified. A balanced VSS approach will carefully allocate requirements into appropriate venues such that redundant verification or double booking is minimized.

In once requirements have been allocated into verification venues the ECS can now be created using the instructions below
