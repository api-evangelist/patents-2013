This application is related to and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Pat. Appl. Ser. No. 61 593 726 filed Feb. 1 2012 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention generally relates to financial transactions and in particular to receipt delivery.

In a typical financial transaction a consumer makes a purchase and receives a physical receipt. The receipt can be used for record keeping tracking purchases and or returns or exchanges. However physical receipts can be cumbersome to keep and manage and can easily be lost. Recently digital or electronic receipts are being used more often. For example when a consumer makes an online purchase an electronic receipt is typically sent to the consumer via email. The consumer can then organize the electronic receipt more easily such as in an electronic folder or mailbox.

Even with the increased use of electronic receipts physical receipts are still the most common form when the consumer makes a purchase at a physical point of sale POS . One reason for this is that stores typically do not have a consumer s email address. Thus if a consumer would like an electronic receipt the consumer must provide an email address to the sales associate which is time consuming and inconvenient.

However even if the electronic receipt is sent the receipt is typically sent to the consumer s email address. This may make it difficult for the consumer to access the receipt because the consumer may not always have email availability and or the consumer s email may change such that any older emails may no longer be accessible.

Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.

According to one embodiment when a consumer makes a purchase at a POS using a payment provider the payment provider provides to the merchant a payer consumer user identification ID and an authorization number along with the payment approval. In one embodiment the payment provider may also send any applicable coupons loyalty cards points and offers to the merchant device. After receiving the information from the payment provider the PUS device sends a generated digital or electronic receipt to an email address of the payment provider. The email contains information about the payer and the authorization. In one embodiment this information is in the actual email address such as payer ID authorization numbe paypalwallet.com or other email host name or domain. In another embodiment the information is in the body or subject line of the email where the email is sent to a more generic email address.

Upon receipt the payment provider may upload the electronic receipt into the consumer s mobile wallet or account using the payer ID and authorization number. As a result the consumer can easily locate and access a receipt on the consumer s mobile device such as by accessing the user s mobile wallet or the user s payment provider account on the mobile device e.g. through a mobile app.

Thus the consumer can quickly and easily obtain and then access a receipt on the consumer s mobile device without the consumer having to provide an email address to the merchant or having to access an email to locate the receipt.

When ready to make a payment the user may select at step a payment provider such as PayPal Inc. of San Jose Calif. to make the payment on behalf of the user. This may be accomplished by the sales associate conveying information to the payment provider such as by selecting a button indicating payment using PayPal the user selecting a payment with PayPal button on a user mobile device or a merchant terminal such as a PIN pad or other suitable means. The selection of the payment provider may occur at different stages of the checkout process including before a first item is scanned during item scanning or after all items have been scanned and totaled. Selection may include the user providing user identification information such as a user name a phone number a PIN etc. so that the payment provider can access an account of the user with the payment provider.

Once the merchant has totaled the purchase a payment request is sent at step to the payment provider. The purchase request may include information about the item s individual item amount a total payment amount and merchant information. Note that the payment provider in different embodiments may communicate coupons loyalty cards points offers and other incentives or value items to the merchant and or user to apply to the current purchase transaction. In this case the total amount may be reduced by any applied value items.

Based on the received information the payment provider processes the payment request at step . Processing may include determining whether a valid user account exists accessing the account determining any restrictions or limitations on the account such as maximum payment amount maximum transactions etc. location associated with the account location of the payment request amount of the payment request and determining at step whether the payment request can be approved.

If the payment request cannot be approved the merchant and or the user may be notified. The user may be given the opportunity to resubmit authentication information or may receive a call or text requesting additional information and or approval. Alternatively the user may decide to make the payment using another source such as a credit card cash check debit card etc.

However if at step the payment request is approved the payment provider electronically communicates at step transaction information to the merchant and or the user. The transaction information in one embodiment includes a user identifier and a transaction authorization. The user identifier may be a numerical user TD a user name a phone number or other information identifying the user to the payment provider. The transaction authorization may be a sequence of letters and or numbers that uniquely identifies the transaction to the payment provider. The transaction information may also include a message that the payment request has been approved.

Upon receipt of the transaction information the merchant device may automatically send via email an electronic receipt to the payment provider which the payment provider receives at step . In another embodiment the user may be given the option of having the receipt sent electronically to the payment provider for processing. The receipt may be generated any time after the payment is completed or the payment request is approved and include information such as the date of purchase a list of items purchased including any item identifiers and price tax paid discounts coupons applied merchant information transaction number etc.

The email may include the user ID and transaction authorization ID. In one embodiment the information is contained in the email address. The local part or user name portion of the email address may include the user ID and the transaction ID. Examples include user ID transaction ID transaction ID user ID userIDtransactionID and transactionIDuserID. The domain name may include the payment provider e.g. paypalwallet.com. Thus in one example assuming the user ID is jsmith123 and the transaction ID is XcrP38 the email sent to the payment provider may be jsmith123 XcrP38 paypalwallet.com. In another embodiment the user ID and or transaction ID are included in the subject heading and or the body of the email. In another example the email may be jsmith123 paypalwallet.com with a subject header or body referencing transaction authorization ID XcrP38. As such the payment provider can easily identify that the received email is for a user s wallet locate the user using the user ID and associate the receipt with the transaction ID. Additional information may be included in the local part as desired.

The payment provider may then store the electronic receipt at step in the user s mobile wallet or account in a cloud. The mobile wallet may reside on the user s mobile device such as a smart phone. The user may access the receipt by accessing the mobile wallet such as through a mobile app on the device. The user may also access the receipt by logging onto the user s account with the payment provider either online through a mobile browser or through a mobile app. Once in the account the user may locate and view the receipt such as using a search function under a tab or link etc. The receipt may be organized by date of purchase merchant amount etc.

As a result the user can easily obtain and later access an electronic receipt through the user s mobile device. The user does not have to worry about a paper receipt have to give the sales associate the user s email address or try to find the receipt in an email folder.
