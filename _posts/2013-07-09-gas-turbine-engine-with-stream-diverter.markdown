The United States Government has certain rights in this invention pursuant to contract number FA8650 09 D 2923 DO13 between the United States Air Force and United Technologies Corporation.

The present disclosure generally relates to gas turbine engines and more specifically relates to fan nozzles for geared turbofan engines.

Gas turbine engines generally have a plurality of axially aligned components including a fan a compressor section a combustor and a turbine section. The fan positioned at a forward end of the engine rotates to draw in and accelerate ambient air. Some of the accelerated air flows downstream to the compressor section as a core flow where the air is compressed and then flows downstream to the combustor. At the combustor the compressed air is mixed with fuel and combusted to form an exhaust. The exhaust expands from the combustor through the turbine section causing turbines of the turbine section to rotate and then flowing out of the engine at an aft end of the engine. The rotation of the turbines drives the rotation of the fan and compressors by way of a shaft or a plurality of concentrically mounted shafts in the case of a multi spool engine. It can therefore be seen that once this process has begun it is self sustaining.

A reverse core gas turbine engine works differently in that air is pressurized with the fan at the forward end of the engine and transported to the aft end of the engine to the compressor section. From the compressor section the air flows in a forward direction through the combustor and turbine section. From the turbine section the air is redirected in an aftward direction to generate thrust. Typically reverse core engines include three air streams the core stream described above a bypass stream that is utilized for only generating thrust and a middle stream that mixes with the exhaust from the core stream before flowing out of the engine. If the fan pressure ratio between these streams is low a variable fan intake nozzle may be necessary to control an operating line of the fan especially between takeoff and cruise.

While effective the equipment necessary for the variable fan intake nozzle introduces weight and complexity to the fan nozzle. Therefore a new manner of controlling the fan operating line that does not introduce additional weight and complexity into the fan nozzle is necessary.

In accordance with one aspect of the disclosure a stream diverter for a gas turbine engine is disclosed. The stream diverter may include a first air duct a second air duct a third air duct and a door operatively associated with the second and third air ducts of the gas turbine engine. The door may have at least an open position allowing air from the second air duct to flow into the third air duct and a closed position preventing air from flowing between the ducts.

In a refinement the stream diverter may further include an actuator operatively associated with the door such that the actuator may move the door between at least the open and closed positions.

In another refinement the stream diverter may further include a plurality of doors. The doors may be arranged circumferentially around the gas turbine where each door overlaps an adjacent door.

In yet another refinement the stream diverter may further include a hinge mounting the door to the ducts such that the door may swing between at least the open position and the closed position.

In still another refinement the gas turbine engine may be a reverse core engine. One duct may be a middle duct of the reverse core engine and the other duct may be an outer duct of the reverse core engine.

In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure a gas turbine engine is disclosed. The engine may include a first air duct communicating air through the gas turbine engine a second air duct adjacent to the first air duct and communicating air through the gas turbine engine and a third air duct adjacent to the second air duct and communicating air through the gas turbine engine. The engine may further include a stream diverter positioned between the second air duct and the third air duct. The stream diverter may include a door operatively associated with the ducts such that the door has an open position that allows air from the second air duct to flow into the third air duct and a closed position that prevents mixing of air from the second and third air ducts.

In a refinement the gas turbine engine may further include a fan where the stream diverter is positioned immediately downstream of the fan.

In another refinement the stream diverter may be position radially outward from the second air stream.

In yet another refinement the stream diverter may further include an actuator operatively associated with the door such that the actuator moves the door between at least the open position and the closed position.

In still another refinement the gas turbine engine may be a reverse core engine where the second duct may be a middle duct and the third duct may be an outer duct.

In accordance with yet another aspect of the present disclosure a method of operating a stream diverter in a gas turbine engine is disclosed. The method may include the steps of communicating air through the gas turbine engine with at least two ducts and diverting air from one duct to another duct with a stream diverter positioned between the two ducts by opening a door of the stream diverter.

In a refinement the door of the stream diverter may be opened during a cruise mode of operation of the gas turbine engine.

In a further refinement the door of the stream diverter may be fully opened during the cruise mode of operation.

In another refinement the method may further include restricting the flow of air between the two ducts by closing the door of the stream diverter.

In a further refinement the door of the stream diverter may be closed during a takeoff mode of operation of the gas turbine engine.

In yet another refinement the door of the stream diverter may be opened to adjust an air pressure ratio in the two ducts.

In yet another refinement the door of the stream diverter may be opened to centrifuge debris out of the second duct and into the third duct.

In still another refinement the gas turbine engine may be a reverse core engine where one duct may be a middle duct and the other duct may be an outer duct.

These and other aspects and features of the present disclosure will be better understood in light of the following detailed description when read in light of the accompanying drawings.

It should be understood that the drawings are not necessarily to scale and that the disclosed embodiments are sometimes illustrated diagrammatically and in partial views. In certain instances details which are not necessary for an understanding of this disclosure or which render other details difficult to perceive may have been omitted. It should be understood of course that this disclosure is not limited to the particular embodiments illustrated herein.

Referring now to the drawings and with specific reference to a gas turbine engine is illustrated. Specifically a reverse core geared turbofan engine is illustrated. However any engine having multiple intake air streams is envisioned as benefiting from the material disclosed herein.

In downstream sequence distributed along the engine central longitudinal axis the engine includes a fan section a compressor section a combustor and a turbine section . The fan section includes in a downstream sequence a first fan a second fan and a third fan . The compressor section includes in a downstream sequence a low pressure compressor and a high pressure compressor . The turbine section includes in a downstream sequence a high pressure turbine an intermediate turbine and a low pressure turbine . The turbines mechanically drive the compressors and the fan section respectively via a plurality of engine shafts .

As can be seen in a first duct a second duct a third duct and a fan nozzle communicate air through the engine . The fan nozzle positioned at a forward end of the engine accepts air from the atmosphere through a fan nozzle inlet and communicates the air across the first fan . The third duct illustrated as a radial outer duct communicates a bypass stream from the fan nozzle to a bypass air outlet . The second duct illustrated as a radial middle duct receives air from the fan nozzle and communicates that air as a middle stream across the second fan and to a core air outlet . The first duct illustrated as a radial inner duct receives air from the second duct and communicates that air as a core stream across the third fan . Thereafter the air is communicated through the compressor section to the combustor through the turbine section and back into the second duct . The air is then mixed with the middle stream and discharged through the core air outlet .

The engine includes a stream diverter positioned downstream of the second fan between the second duct and third duct as illustrated in . The stream diverter includes a door or other partition that has at least an open position and a closed position. The door is operatively associated with the ducts such that the open position allows a diverted air stream to flow from one duct into the other duct illustrated from the second duct to the third duct . The closed position of the door prevents any mixing of air between the second and third ducts . The stream diverter may include a single door or a plurality of doors distributed circumferentially about the engine between the ducts and . Each of the doors may overlap an adjacent door such that at the open position and the closed position no air passes between the doors .

As also illustrated in the door is operatively associated with a hinge to allow the door to pivot between at least the open position and the closed position. However the door moves between an open position and a closed position via other means as well such as but not limited to a roller or a track to allow the door to slide between open and closed positions such as depicted in .

While the door has been described as having an open position and a closed position other positions are also possible. In one example the door has multiple open positions such that different quantities of air are allowed to flow from the second duct to the third duct at each position. Alternatively the door is capable of being disposed in a position or positions that allow air to flow from the third duct into the second duct .

The door is operatively associated with an actuator that moves the door among the various positions available to the door . The actuator is a hydraulic system as illustrated in or the like and is controlled by an operator or a processor based on predetermined operating conditions or as needed. The actuator moves the door to predetermined positions between and including a fully open position that is a position that allows a relative maximum flow of air between the two ducts and a fully closed position that is a position that prevents air from flowing between the ducts . Alternatively the actuator moves the door freely between and including the fully open and fully closed positions to a position specified by the operator or processor during operation of the engine .

In operation the operator or processor determines when to open or close the door of the stream diverter . For instance the door is opened to allow any debris that may have entered into the second duct to centrifuge out of the second duct and into the third duct . Other situations for opening and closing the door is for but not be limited to modulating air pressure ratios between the second and third ducts and controlling a fan operating line. Alternatively the door is opened during specific operating conditions such as a cruise mode and a takeoff mode of operation or as needed to adjust pressure ratios or the fan operating line.

For example the door is fully opened during the cruise mode of operation as in which sets the operating line during the cruise mode on a fan map of the first fan . The fan map of the first fan being a plot of an air pressure ratio in the third duct to air throughput in the third duct . Where the air pressure ratio is a ratio of an air pressure of incoming air versus outgoing air. Opening the door maximizes the flow of air through the third duct increases the outgoing air pressure but does not alter the incoming air pressure and thus sets the operating line left of a typical operating line. In these illustrated examples the middle stream is pressurized by the fans to a greater pressure than the bypass stream so the diverted air stream flows from the second duct through the stream diverter and into the third duct . To accommodate this flow of air the third duct is sized to pass the sum of the bypass stream and the diverted air stream when the door is fully open. This sets the operating line of the first fan during a cruise mode of operation of the engine . This open position of the door reduces air pressure in the second duct and increases air pressure in the third duct both relative to the closed position by allowing the air in the second duct to flow into the third duct .

In a further example the door is closed during the takeoff mode of operation to increase the air pressure relative the open position discussed above in the second duct by prohibiting the flow of air from the second duct to the third duct . This causes the first fan to upflow and shifts the operating line of the first fan to the right. While only the fully open and fully closed positions of the door have been described any other position between 0 and 100 open are also possible.

From the foregoing it can be seen that the technology disclosed herein has industrial applicability in a variety of settings such as but not limited to providing variable fan nozzle functions for a gas turbine engine with a fixed fan nozzle. The stream diverter may be shifted between set positions or moved freely by an operator or a processor to modulate the pressure ratio of the air streams of the engine and the operating line of the fan.

While various embodiments are positively recited herein no single embodiment is intended on limiting the scope of any other embodiment or the scope of the invention. Moreover while the present disclosure has been made in reference to a gas turbine engine and an aircraft and specifically to diverting air streams in a reverse core geared turbofan engine one skilled in the art will understand that the teachings herein can be used in other applications as well such as but not limited to providing variable nozzle functions to gas turbine engines that have three intake air streams with a fixed fan nozzle. It is therefore intended that the scope of the invention not be limited by the embodiments presented herein as the best mode for carrying out the invention but that the invention include all equivalents falling within the spirit and scope of the appended claims as well.
