title: Utilizing dynamic granularity for application controls
abstract: A user may interact with a control interface in the course of interacting with electronic content. The control interface may include any user interface utilized to adjust various aspects of an application, including, but not limited to, scroll bars, sliders, and/or navigation windows. Input at the control interface may be received from the user indicating that the user desires to manipulate the electronic content (e.g., jump to another location in a movie) or, alternatively, that the user wishes to manipulate the control interface. Upon determining that the input is intended to manipulate the control interface, the control interface may be adjusted to display a control interface view that provides finer or coarser granularity, allowing the user to interact with the control interface with more accuracy.

Tablet computers and other touch screen capable devices have become exceedingly popular with users. However navigating by touch may be difficult for the user given the limitations of these devices e.g. screen size sensitivity etc. . One especially frustrating aspect of navigating by touch involves utilizing control interfaces. For instance many users choose to watch videos e.g. movies on their touch screen device. In one example the user may wish to navigate to another location in the movie. To accomplish this he may select a user interface element on a navigational scroll bar and drag it to the position corresponding to the location where he wishes to continue viewing.

Conventional controls make it difficult for the user to make the exact selection he desires because the control may only allow him to make selections in predetermined increments. For instance the user may wish to replay the last five seconds of a movie but the control only allows navigation by fifteen second increments. This limitation may lead to undesirable results. For instance the user may have to repeatedly use the user interface element in order to navigate to the desired position possibly never getting the exact selection desired. Thus current techniques for navigating control interfaces are cumbersome inefficient and may lead to user frustration and a diminished user experience.

In the following description various embodiments of the present disclosure will be described. For purposes of explanation specific configurations and details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. However it will also be apparent to one skilled in the art that the embodiments may be practiced without the specific details. Furthermore well known features may be omitted or simplified in order not to obscure the embodiment being described.

Some or all of the process described may be performed under the control of one or more computer systems configured with specific computer executable instructions and may be implemented as code e.g. executable instructions one or more computer programs or one or more applications executing collectively on one or more processors by hardware or combinations thereof. The code may be stored on a non transitory computer readable storage medium for example in the form of a computer program including a plurality of instructions executable by one or more processors. The computer readable storage medium may be non transitory.

A control as used herein is intended to refer to any user interface utilized to adjust various aspects of an application or of electronic content including but not limited to scroll bars sliders navigation windows etc. A control interface view as used herein is intended to refer to a zoomed in view of a control interface where a subset of the original control range is viewable in the control interface. Additionally a touch input as used herein is intended to refer to any physical contact made with an electronic device. An adjustment interface as used herein is an interface capable of changing the granularity of a control interface display. A navigational interface as used herein is intended to refer to an interface capable of moving the focus of a control interface. A navigational interface may be included within an adjustment interface. As used herein the phrase zoom in refers to enlarging the display of an object the reducing occurring with respect to a focal point As used herein the term zoom out refers to reducing the display of an object the reducing occurring with respect to a focal point.

Techniques described herein are directed to enabling a user of an electronic device to utilize a dynamic granularity control engine to adjust granularity of control interfaces. For example a user may be provided electronic content e.g. a movie for display on an electronic device of a user e.g. a tablet personal computer PC . In at least one example the electronic device may be any device capable of receiving input e.g. touch input . The electronic content may comprise a control interface such as a scrollbar for navigating within the movie. The user may select to enter an adjustment mode of the scrollbar by selecting an adjustment mode e.g. by checking a box or by selecting and or hovering over the thumb e.g. the navigational control element selectable by the user of the scrollbar. In response to entering the adjustment mode the representation of the control may be adjusted to display a portion of the control with finer granularity than before entering the adjustment mode. The adjustment interface may be displayed over the control interface enabling the user to select various actions including enlarging and or reducing the representation of the control interface. Selecting one of these actions may adjust the granularity the control interface to display another control interface view. For instance continuing with the current example the user may select a particular location of the adjustment interface to display a portion of the control with finer or coarser granularity.

In one non limiting example a user may be watching a movie within a media application. The movie may be an hour and twenty minutes in duration. The user ten minutes into the movie may decide she enjoyed a particular interaction between the actors. As a result she may decide to replay the interaction. As an example consider that she wants to begin reviewing the movie at a point that is two minutes and thirteen seconds prior to where she is currently viewing. However the user may not know exactly where to begin replaying. She may select the control interface and begin dragging in search of the beginning of the portion she wants to watch again. As she slides the control she may find that sliding to the left starts replay too early in the movie while sliding to the right starts replay too late. Within the media application or utilizing any suitable adjustment mode selector the user may indicate that she desires to enter adjustment mode. In this example the user may select the thumb of the control and hold or hover for a period of time. This may result in the interface entering adjustment mode causing the dynamic granularity control engine to provide a graphical user interface enabling the user to access an adjustment interface for the control. Once in adjustment mode the user may zoom in to an area of the control generally located around the desired playback location. Upon zoom in the representation of the control interface may be adjusted to display another control interface view where the range of the control interface has decreased. For instance the zoom in may cause the control interface range to change from a range of 0 120 minutes to a range of 0 30 minutes. As a result the user may be presented with the ability to slide the thumb in smaller increments enabling her to make a more accurate selection with the control than she was previously able to accomplish before adjusting the control interface granularity.

Any control utilizing incremental selection may benefit from the dynamic granularity control engine. Though a scroll bar is given as an example a slider or navigational control may be used. As another non limiting example a user may adjust the granularity of a volume control. Fully displayed in an original control interface view perhaps the volume may only be adjusted in increments of five. Thus if the volume is at seventy percent the user may only adjust the control to sixty five or seventy five percent. However were the user to select the adjustment mode selector she may be enabled to adjust the volume control in increments of two. Thus if the volume is at seventy percent the user may now adjust the control to sixty eight or seventy two percent.

Additionally the user may further be enabled by the provided user interface to scroll through different views of the control. For example perhaps at first a control displays a range of zero to one hundred with control selections allowed in increments of five. The user may indicate he wishes to enter adjustment mode select a location of the control and use the provided adjustment interface to the change the representation of the control interface view at the selected location. Perhaps the user selected the location of thirty on the old control. Once adjusted the control may display a shorter range than previously displayed. In this case instead of displaying zero to one hundred with allowable selections in increments of five the control may display zero to sixty with allowable selections in increments of three. Thus the total area used to display the control is consistent but the granularity of the control may change according to user input.

In one non limiting example a user may configure an adjustment interface for a control. The user may define areas that may serve to adjust the representation of the control. Additionally a navigational interface may be provided such that selection of the navigational interface may change the control interface view while maintaining the granularity of the control interface view. Further the adjustment interface is user configurable and customizable.

Referring now to the drawings in which like reference numerals represent like parts illustrates an example user interface provided by a dynamic granularity control engine in accordance with at least one embodiment. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art any suitable electronic device capable of receiving user input may be utilized to interact with the dynamic granularity control engine. In accordance with at least one embodiment a user of an electronic device e.g. a tablet PC may navigate to an application he wishes to use e.g. a music player application through touch input. Though examples may be given using touch input it should be appreciated by one skilled in the art that a mouse or other suitable user input device may be utilized. For example while interacting with an application the user may wish to interact with a control similar to control . Control comprises a navigational scroll bar used to navigate through the contents of an audio file. Though a navigational scroll bar is depicted in this example any suitable control used to navigate content interact with an application or interact with an operating system may be used.

In accordance with at least one embodiment the user may select content to be played e.g. a song . At first the control may display a thumb located on the far left of control indicating play occurring starting at the beginning of the song. In at least one example the beginning time and end time may be displayed in control . Beginning time and end time may be indicative of a total run time of the song for instance this song may be five minutes in length. At some point the user may wish to jump to another location in the song. To do so the user may use his finger to touch thumb and drag the thumb to location . In at least one example the user may be attempting to navigate to a particular portion of the song. However it may become apparent to the user that he is unable to drag thumb accurately to the location desired. In at least one example the user may wish to modify the granularity of the control in order to navigate within smaller increments of the content.

In accordance with at least one embodiment the user may select an adjustment mode indicator in this case a check box to indicate that the user wishes to enter adjustment mode. Alternatively the user may select and hold thumb for a configurable amount of time. On elapse of a threshold amount of time e.g. the configurable amount of time the dynamic granularity control engine may be notified that the user has entered adjustment mode. Additionally upon activating adjustment mode display of control may be adjusted such that beginning time and end time may be displayed though the overall area utilized by control remains unchanged.

In accordance with at least one embodiment once adjustment mode is active the dynamic granularity control engine may provide to the user an adjustment interface . In at least one example an adjustment interface may utilize an area previously used to display control . For instance the adjustment interface may be overlaid over control and indicated by color shading or any suitable graphical representation of a selectable area. In at least one example the adjustment interface may be transparent in nature. In either example the adjustment interface may comprise multiple areas defined to execute various actions. For instance an adjustment interface may comprise multiple areas including but not limited to a zoom out area a scroll left area a scroll right area and a zoom in area . The scroll left area and the scroll right area may comprise a navigational interface included as part of the adjustment interface.

In accordance with at least one embodiment a user may select a point with zoom in area to gain further granularity of control . Similarly a user may select a point within zoom out area to reduce granularity of control . Scroll left area and scroll right area may be used to scroll the focus of control to the left or right direction respectively. For instance the user may currently be displayed time 1 40 to 3 80. Were the user to select a point within scroll left area the control times displayed may be adjusted to a beginning time of 1 00 to 3 00 while the control granularity remains unchanged. Similarly the user may then select a point within scroll right area the control times displayed may be adjusted to a beginning time of 1 40 and an end time of 3 80 once again leaving the control granularity unchanged. The movement of the control as a result of a selection by the user of scroll left area or scroll right area may emulate a panning animation such that the scroll bar appears to be moving within a consistent area of control . Alternatively a scroll action e.g. selection of scroll left area or scroll right area may not appear to move the focus of control rather the scroll action may update control with a new beginning and end times. In at least one example selection of scroll left area or scroll right area may reduce or miniaturize display of control to display a miniaturized display such that the full range of the control may be shown while a highlighted area is displayed over the miniaturized display indicative of the focus of the zoom user interface .

In accordance with at least one embodiment a user may select a point in zoom out area to return control to its original granularity as depicted by diagram . To exit adjustment mode the user may un check adjustment mode indicator . Alternatively the user may double click double tap control to exit adjustment mode.

In this manner a user may adjust the granularity of control enabling a user to navigate control with greater accuracy.

In accordance with at least one embodiment zoom out area may comprise multiple sub areas including but not limited to a fast speed zoom out area a medium speed zoom out area and a slow zoom out area .
