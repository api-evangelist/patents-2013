title: Time encoded radiation imaging
abstract: The various technologies presented herein relate to detecting nuclear material at a large stand-off distance. An imaging system is presented which can detect nuclear material by utilizing time encoded imaging relating to maximum and minimum radiation particle counts rates. The imaging system is integrated with a data acquisition system that can utilize variations in photon pulse shape to discriminate between neutron and gamma-ray interactions. Modulation in the detected neutron count rates as a function of the angular orientation of the detector due to attenuation of neighboring detectors is utilized to reconstruct the neutron source distribution over 360 degrees around the imaging system. Neutrons (e.g., fast neutrons) and/or gamma-rays are incident upon scintillation material in the imager, the photons generated by the scintillation material are converted to electrical energy from which the respective neutrons/gamma rays can be determined and, accordingly, a direction to, and the location of, a radiation source identified.

This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 694 564 filed on Aug. 29 2012 entitled TIME ENCODED RADIATION IMAGING the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was developed under contract DE AC04 94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.

The detection of special nuclear material SNM at a large stand off distance has application in such fields as nuclear security and counter terrorism. At a given standoff distance a detector can utilize detection of either neutrons or gamma rays as a signature of the nuclear material due to the respectively high penetrating power of the neutrons or gamma rays. Compared with gamma rays neutrons e.g. fast neutrons have a background that is relatively low and understood which can provide an ideal regime for detection of nuclear material in large search area scenarios.

Currently there are two main approaches for generation of a neutron imager. In a first approach a coded aperture can be based on a front pixelated mask plane containing hydrogenous material in combination with a detector array as the rear plane. The pattern of the mask plane can be based on a uniformly redundant array URA which has a mathematical property to facilitate unique reconstruction of the spatial distribution of a source under ideal imaging conditions. Additionally an optimized random mask can also be utilized. However in practice the construction and calibration of a large detector array can impact the cost and performance of such detectors.

In a second approach the front mask plane can be replaced with another large detector plane and accordingly identifies coincidence scattering in the front and rear plane. A device utilizing such technology is known as a scatter camera. In this approach the direction of an incoming neutron can be constrained and hence maps out a source distribution. Such an approach has been shown to be successful in near and medium distance regimes however the requirement of double scatters can greatly reduce system efficiency and further can increase a dwell time necessary for long range detection.

Time encoded imaging TEI is a recently developed method for SNM detection with neutrons that overcomes the limiting factors of the two main approaches. The concept relies on measuring the presence of a nuclear source as a time varying neutron rate as it is modulated by shielding material moving around each detector. TEI designs feature simple construction reducing cost and complexity while maintaining a high efficiency by requiring only single scatters. Additionally by converting spatial variations into temporal rates the system is more robust against non uniformities in the detected background due to detector geometry. For these reasons TEI detectors offer simple low cost and highly efficient solutions for detecting SNM. Another approach utilizes Rotating Modulated Collimators RMC . However while incorporating some of the advantages of a TEI design the RMC approach is unsuitable for neutron detection owing to the required thick masks significantly reduce the efficiency of the imager.

As noted above exemplary embodiments presented herein relate to detecting the presence of radiation. While gamma ray based radiation can be prevalent as a background radiation advantage can be taken of the lower incidence of neutron based radiation. By detecting the presence of neutron based radiation in a gamma ray background it is possible to extrapolate a direction from a detector to a source of the neutron based radiation. As described further herein by utilizing at least two detectors rotating about a common point e.g. both are located on a turntable a second detector can be utilized to occlude a first detector from the radiation source e.g. by absorbing a portion of the neutron radiation at the second detector thereby reducing the number of neutrons incident on the first detector. Accordingly while the first detector is local to radioactive material it is anticipated that a number of detected neutrons will be high e.g. a maxima and alternatively when the radioactive material is being occluded by the second detector the number of neutrons detected at the first detector will be low e.g. a minima . With knowledge of the respective positions of the first detector and the second detector at the time when the maximum occlusion occurs a direction to and a position of the radiation source with respect to the positions of the first detector and second detector can be determined. Fast neutrons are of interest as they have likely not been scattered e.g. by atoms particles etc. comprising air between the radiation source and a detector s and thus retain their directional history with regard to the radiation source from which they were emitted.

Sensor material can be of any suitable composition and phase such as an organic crystal comprising an aromatic hydrocarbon compounds e.g. which can include a benzene ring structure . Organic scintillators include anthracene stilbene CH and naphthalene CH . Organic liquids can also be utilized including p terphenyl CH PBD CHNO butyl PBD CHNO PPO CHNO and a wavelength shifting material such as POPOP CHNO . Solvents can include toluene xylene benzene phenylcyclohexane triethylbenzene and decalin. Further liquid scintillators can be combined with other additives such as wavelength shifters to match the spectral sensitivity range of a particular PMT or to increase the neutron detection efficiency of the scintillation counter itself. For many liquids dissolved oxygen can act as a quenching agent and can lead to reduced light output hence there may be a necessity to seal the scintillating solution in an oxygen free air tight enclosure e.g. PMV . The scintillating material can also comprise of a plastic scintillator where the scintillating material in which the primary fluorescent emitter e.g. a fluor is suspended in the base a solid polymer matrix. Polyethylene naphthalate can be a suitable material as it exhibits scintillation without any additives. Base materials can include aromatic polymers such as polyvinyltoluene PVT polystyrene PS polymethylmethacrylate PMMA polyvinyl xylene PVX polymethyl 2 4 dimethyl 2 4 5 trimethyl styrenes polyvinyl diphenyl polyvinyl naphthalene polyvinyl tetrahydronaphthalene and copolymers of these and other bases. Fluors can include polyphenyl hydrocarbons oxazole and oxadiazole aryls especially n terphenyl PPP 2 5 diphenyloxazole PPO 1 4 di 5 phenyl 2 oxazolyl benzene POPOP 2 phenyl 5 4 biphenylyl 1 3 4 oxadiazole PBD and 2 4 tert butylphenyl 5 4 biphenylyl 1 3 4 oxadiazole B PBD . Scintillators can also include inorganic materials such as an alkali metal halide NaI Tl sodium iodide doped with thallium CsI Tl CsI Na CsI pure CsF KI Tl LiI Eu . Some non alkali crystals include BaF CaF Eu ZnS Ag CaWO CdWO YAG Ce YAlO Ce GSO LSO lanthanum chloride LaCl Ce lanthanum bromide LaBr Ce . LYSO LuYSiO Ce BGO. Gaseous scintillators can include nitrogen and the noble gases helium argon krypton and xenon. Glass scintillators can include cerium activated lithium or boron silicates.

To facilitate construction and protection of the PMV and the PMT the PMV and PMT can be located in a protective vessel such as a container with the PMV located in place via a supporting ring and a lid where either of the supporting ring and the lid can further include an o ring seal or similar system to locate and seal the PMV . A connector can be utilized to facilitate connection of PMT to data acquisition system . In an embodiment components and can be combined to form a detector e.g. detector A. Container ring vessel lid and connector can be formed from any suitable material which is transparent to the passage of gamma rays and neutrons such as steel aluminum etc.

A plurality of detectors can be utilized in a radiation detection system. illustrates a block diagram representation of a system comprising of three detectors A B and C located on a turntable to facilitate rotation of the detectors A B and C about a central point X respectively at an angle of 120 as shown in . With knowledge of the angular spacing between each detector as the detectors rotate through 360 about point X a determination of the location of a radiation source can be made. Completing a full rotation of detectors A B and C about point X can be performed over any required time period. For example the frequency of rotation can be 1 minute where at such a frequency timing effects such as photon generation by a scintillating material scintillator relaxation conversion of the photon to an electrical signal analyzing the electrical signal for both number of pulses and pulse origination e.g. neutron induced or gamma induced as described further below and determination of a direction to a source can be performed on a relatively short timescale compared with the frequency of rotation of detectors A B and C about point X.

In a further embodiment a change in a number of neutrons being detected at a detector e.g. detector A can further act as an indicator of a direction and or location of a radiation source. For example the change in count rate between the count at position Q and the count rates at positions P and R e.g. any of positions 1 5 indicated on . In a further embodiment a rate of change of the count rate e.g. a transition between a high rate and a low rate e.g. any of positions 1 5 indicated on can further provide determination of the direction to and or location of the radiation source. Hence while count rate maxima and minima can be used to determine a direction to and or location of a radiation source the transitions between maxima and minima e.g. any of positions 1 5 indicated on can further refine the determination of the radiation location. In effect a plurality of transitions counts count rate ramps etc. can be utilized across the entire signal modulation pattern as shown in

In a further embodiment by utilizing a time encoded technique it is possible to decouple a count rate pertaining to a neutron radiation background and a count rate resulting from the radiation source. For example the respective magnitudes of the maxima e.g. Q and the minima e.g. P or R in a signal modulation pattern e.g. can enable an estimation of the neutron radiation background to be identified whereby the minima can be considered an indication of the background radiation. While detector A is local to a radiation source an according maxima in count rate can occur. However when the detector A is being occluded from the radiation source e.g. by detector B a neutron count e.g. the count at the minima can be considered to be the neutron radiation background. Hence by identifying a magnitude of the neutron radiation background e.g. from the minima it is possible to determine the location of a radiation source even in the event of the radiation source having a weak neutron signature.

In another scenario a neutron radiation background may not be uniform with respect to angular orientation. Accordingly in an embodiment the rotation of detector about can be broken down into bins of defined angles e.g. 0 30 30 60 60 90 . . . 330 360 etc. with an estimate of the neutron radiation background being identified for each bin. Once an estimate has been defined for each bin a determination can be made regarding whether a radiation source is located in a particular bin based upon a deviation e.g. an increase in neutron count rate from the estimated neutron radiation background. Hence it is possible to locate a source based upon the maxima and or minima in neutron count as previously described and also to detect a source based upon an estimation of a neutron radiation background concurrent with a neutron count rate being received from a radiation source.

Further as shown in double interactions can also be of interest where such double interactions can occur as a result of a radiation particle being scattered by a detector rather than being absorbed by the detector material e.g. sensor material . The double interaction observation map shown in illustrates how the frequency of double interactions from detector B or detector C into detector A can vary as a function of . In a situation where detector B is on the far side of a system and detector A is closer to a source the double interaction signal is fairly constant and low region U of the plot. During such a situation it is difficult for a particle emanated from source to reach detector B and then scatter back into detector A. The higher rate regions S and T on the plot shown in can occur while detector B is closer to the source i.e. detector B is located approximately between or nearly between the detector A and the source . In an embodiment the maxima of S and T can occur when a vector from the source to detector B makes a 30 angle with a vector from detector B to detector A which is in accordance with fast neutron kinematics. In an example determination utilizing detectors with a 5 diameter PMV it was found that there were about 400 times more single scatters than double scatters in a measured plurality of signals. Hence while double interactions may be a small percentage of a total signal adding the double interaction response response to an image reconstruction can help improve the angular resolution of a detector system e.g. imaging system in determining the location of a radiation source .

In an embodiment it is possible to distinguish between whether a gamma ray is incident upon a scintillator material or a neutron is incident. For example a scintillator e.g. a liquid phase scintillator having a neutron gamma pulse shape discrimination PSD can be utilized. Briefly PSD is a technique utilized for the detection of high energy neutrons in the presence of a gamma radiation background. The technique can be based on the difference in the shape of a scintillation signal generated due to excitation by neutrons and the shape of a scintillation signal generated due to excitation by gamma rays in a scintillator e.g. an organic scintillator . According to a commonly accepted mechanism both gamma induced and neutron induced pulses contain a short decay prompt component and a long decay delayed fluorescence component. The prompt component can result from a direct radiative de excitation of excited singlet states S while the slow component can be determined by the kinetics of the triplet T exciton diffusion process preceding the triplet triplet interaction and annihilation T T S S which can lead to the excitation of additional singlet states decaying with the same spectral distribution but over a longer and delayed time scale. The short range of energetic protons produced from neutron collisions yields a high concentration of triplets which can lead to an enhanced level of delayed emission in neutron induced pulses in comparison to those produced by the longer range of the electrons from gamma interactions. The different proportions of the prompt and delayed components in scintillation pulses produced by neutron and gamma interactions can provide the basis for the pulse separation utilized in PSD techniques. Hence in a situation where a high volume of gamma radiation forms a background noise it is possible by analyzing a plurality of scintillation pulses e.g. the pulse profile to determine a number of neutron based pulses within the plurality of scintillation pulses. In an aspect air can act as an attenuator of neutron based radiation for example a reduction in a volume of neutron based radiation emanating from a radiation source can be occur over a distance of about 100 meters. Accordingly a high volume of background noise can be comprised of gamma based radiation. However by utilizing PSD it is possible to identify neutron based radiation in the gamma based background radiation. Thus in an embodiment given the low amount of neutron based radiation e.g. a low neutron count rate occurring after a distance of 100 meters if neutron based radiation is detected then a reasonable determination can be made by identifying the direction in which the majority of neutron based radiation is emanating from.

It is to be appreciated that while an imaging system has been presented comprising an arrangement of three detectors e.g. detectors A B and C in a triangular formation the various embodiments presented herein are not so limited and any number of detectors can be utilized in an imaging system. Owing to the various embodiments presented herein being based on the masking of a first detector by at least one other detector an imaging system can utilize a minimum of two detectors rotating about a common point e.g. common point X . Alternatively as presented in an imaging system can be constructed with four detectors arranged in various configurations such as a square arrangement a diamond arrangement a clover arrangement and a rectangular arrangement . Other arrangements can be configured utilizing any number of detectors 2 to n where n is a positive integer greater than 2.

Moreover the acts described herein may be computer executable instructions that can be implemented by one or more processors and or stored on a computer readable medium or media. The computer executable instructions can include a routine a sub routine programs a thread of execution and or the like. Still further results of acts of the methodology can be stored in a computer readable medium displayed on a display device and or the like.

As previously mentioned by utilizing at least two detectors rotating about a common point and measuring the radiation incident upon at least one of the detectors a direction to and or a location of a radiation source can be determined relative to the at least one detector. Owing to the at least two detectors rotating the first detector can be masked from the radiation source by the second detector. The masking effect e.g. a reduction in radiation incident upon the first detector can be utilized to determine the location of the radiation source. At an imaging system can be constructed whereby a first detector is mounted upon a rotating base such as a turntable. The position of the first detector can be identified in terms of an angular position relative to a full rotation of the turntable. The first detector can include a material e.g. a scintillator which when impacted by energetic particles which can emanate from a radioactive source material e.g. neutron based radiation gamma ray based radiation etc. upon absorbing the energetic particles energy emits a photon or similar particle. The first detector can further include a PMT which can absorb the photon and accordingly generate an electron s as a function of a photoelectric effect. Hence the larger the energy of a particle incident upon the detector the greater the number of photons generated and accordingly the greater the number of electrons emitted in the PMT via the photoelectric effect.

At a second detector can be mounted upon the rotating base and the position of the second detector can be identified in terms of an angular position relative to a full rotation of the turntable. The second detector can also include a scintillating material as well as a PMT which operate as described with regard to the first detector.

At the turntable can be rotated about a central point or axis X. Owing to the rotation of the turntable the first detector and the second detector can respectively be brought into a position closer to a radiation source the position of which is currently unknown and to a position which is furthest away from the radiation source.

At for each angular position of rotation of the turntable an amount of radiation incident upon the first detector can be determined. In an embodiment the scintillating material included in the first detector can facilitate neutron gamma ray PSD where a photon generated by an incident neutron can be have a different profile to the photon generated by an incident gamma ray as previously discussed. Accordingly it is possible to identify whether a photon is generated in response to an incident neutron or an incident gamma ray.

At for each angular position of rotation of the turntable an amount of radiation incident upon the first detector can further be determined in relation to the position of the second detector. As previously mentioned the second detector can be utilized as a mask between a radiation source and the first detector. For example while gamma rays comprise a large volume of a background radiation neutron based radiation can be attenuated by a volume of air such that after a certain distance from a radiation source the count of neutron based radiation diminishes appreciably. Accordingly a location of a radiation source can be identified based upon an amount of neutron based energy being occluded by the second detector being positioned between the radiation source and the first detector. In a manner similar to the radiation being absorbed in the first detector the same effect can be engendered when the second detector is closer to the radiation source than the first detector e.g. the second detector is located on or near to the line of sight between the first detector and the radiation source with the second detector absorbing the radiation particles.

At the location of the radiation source can be determined. By analyzing the amount of radiation energy received at the first detector for the range of angular positions the position of the second detector relative to the position of the first detector at which a drop in received radiation occurs in conjunction with a determination of a radiation type e.g. neutron based gamma ray based it is possible to identify at which angle in the rotation of the first detector about the central point X the reduction in received radiation energy occurs. In an embodiment as previously mentioned when the first detector is local to the radiation source the radiation count rate e.g. a neutron count rate will be at a maximum for the first detector and when the first detector is occluded from the radiation source by the second detector the radiation count rate will be at a minimum for the first detector at this position. The determined angle is the direction from central point X to the radiation source.
