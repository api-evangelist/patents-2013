abstract: Among other things, one or more techniques and/or systems are provided for developing a timeline chronicling events pertaining to an industrial asset. Data is received from a plurality of assets, processed (e.g., to reduce duplicative and/or redundant data), and organized chronologically for presentation in a timeline. The data is further grouped and/or prioritized to display some portions of the data more prominently relative to other portions of the data in the timeline (e.g., which may be hidden). Grouping rules and/or prioritization rules for grouping and/or prioritizing the data may be a function of user interaction with the timeline and/or a function of a machine learning algorithm which may be configured to identify patterns in how users interact with the timeline based upon, among other things, a role the user plays relative to the industrial asset and/or an operating state of the industrial asset.

The present application relates to industrial assets and more particularly to systems and or techniques for chronicling events pertaining to an industrial asset which may be displayed graphically in a timeline. The systems and or techniques find particular application to industrial assets of a power system but may also find applicability in non power related industries where it may be useful to acquire data pertaining to an industrial asset from a plurality of data sources and to present at least some of the data to a user chronologically in an interactive timeline which integrates the data from the plurality of data sources.

A power system comprises a network of electrical components or power system equipment configured to supply transmit and or use electrical power. For example a power grid e.g. also referred to as an electrical distribution grid comprises generators transmission systems and or distribution systems. Generators are configured to produce electricity from combustible fuels e.g. coal natural gas etc. and or non combustible fuels e.g. such as wind solar nuclear etc. . Transmission systems are configured to carry or transmit the electricity from the generators to loads. Distribution systems are configured to feed the supplied electricity to nearby homes commercial businesses and or other establishments.

Electrical components of such a system include among other things turbines transformers circuit breakers capacitors voltage regulators and power lines for example. Often such equipment is designed to lasts decades and is routinely or continuously monitored and or inspected to assess the health of the equipment and develop maintenance schedules for the equipment to mitigate risk of a failure e.g. which may result in power loss . By way of example a sensor onboard a transformer may be configured to intermittently or continuously provide readouts indicative of a temperature of oil within the transformer and or indicative of chemical concentrations in the oil. Such information is typically stored in a database and is used to assess the present health of the transformer e.g. where a temperature above a temperature threshold or a carbon dioxide CO concentration above a COthreshold may indicate the transformer is in need of maintenance .

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

According to an aspect a method for chronicling events pertaining to an industrial asset is provided. The method comprises receiving data pertaining to the industrial asset from a plurality of sources and organizing the data chronologically. The method also comprises grouping the data into a first set of bins where a first bin of the first set represents first data yielded from a first set of one or more sources of the plurality of sources and a second bin of the first set represents second data yielded from a second set of one or more sources of the plurality of sources. The method also comprises providing for presentation of a timeline of the data in a first manner to chronicle events pertaining to the industrial asset where the first data is displayed more prominently in the timeline than the second data.

According to another aspect a system for chronicling events pertaining to an industrial asset is provided. The system comprises one or more processing units and memory configured to store instructions that when executed by at least some of the one or more processing units perform a method. The method comprises receiving data pertaining to an industrial asset from a plurality of sources and organizing the data chronologically. The method also comprises prioritizing the data for presentation in a timeline and providing for presentation of the timeline in a first manner to chronicle events pertaining to the industrial asset the timeline presented in the first manner based upon the prioritizing.

According to yet another aspect a graphical user interface configured to display a timeline chronicling events pertaining to an industrial asset which has been developed from data yielded from a plurality of sources is provided. The graphical user interface comprises a timeline modification window comprising a listing of one or more data types of data available to be presented in the timeline. The graphical user interface further comprises a selection bar comprising a predefined formats element configured to list one or more available timeline formats for a user to select where a manner in which the timeline is presented is a function of a selected format and where the formats respectively corresponding to one or more roles of users relative to the industrial asset. It will be appreciate that multiple of such elements can be included in the graphical user interface.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are generally used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide an understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

A power system comprises thousands if not millions of electrical components. Utility providers and other entities routinely monitor and or inspect such electrical components to assess the health of various electrical components assess environmental risk posed by the various electrical components assess efficiency of the various electrical components detect early signs of failure etc.

Numerous techniques are used to make such assessments and or detections. For example some electrical components comprise sensors that are configured to measure one or more properties of such electrical components e.g. internal temperature ambient air temperature dissolved gas concentration load etc. and or are configured to provide readouts indicative of present operating conditions of such electrical components. Further on site field test and or inspections may be performed by trained technicians to inspect the electrical components for damage signs of failure environmental risk etc. Often information that results from such readouts field tests and or inspections is recorded in performance databases which maintain the data for future use e.g. such as to develop a maintenance schedule to compile compliance reports or other reports etc. .

When a user desires to review data related to an electrical component such as to review past performance of the electrical component and or to generate a report the user may desire to compare numerical data stored in the performance database with events that have occurred to the electrical component such as outages repairs inspection schedules etc. To do so the user has conventionally overlaid graphs or lists of pertinent numerical data e.g. acquired from the performance database s with a calendar or other visualization representing data pertaining to events e.g. acquired from a maintenance database s . While overlaying such information to develop a profile of an electrical component has been useful such a presentation is not easily manipulatable by a user to gain a rich understanding of past performance and or does not easily allow events to be correlated with the numerical data.

Accordingly systems and or techniques for generating a graphical user interface depicting a timeline that chronicles events pertaining to an industrial asset e.g. a history of the industrial asset such as an electrical component are provided. Data from multiple sources such as performance database s and or maintenance database s for example are integrated into a representation which combines sensory information from sensors field tests visual or other sensory inspections etc. with events that have occurred to the industrial asset e.g. such as maintenance logs compliance reports outages etc. . Data presented in the timeline may be aggregated into categories or bins based upon the type of industrial asset to which the timeline pertains user input present operating state of the industrial asset intended use of the timeline etc. Moreover in some embodiments a first portion of data represented in the timeline may be presented differently e.g. more distinctly than a second portion of data represented in the timeline as a function of the type of industrial asset to which the timeline pertains user input present operating state of the industrial asset intended use of the timeline etc. for example. In some embodiments the timeline is further manipulatable such as by a user to alter how the data is presented and or to alter the relative distinctiveness of data presented in the timeline e.g. zooming in to a smaller timeframe zooming out to a larger timeframe etc. .

It will be appreciated that an industrial asset may refer to a single piece of equipment such as a transformer or may refer to a collection of equipment such as a substation. In this way a timeline can be devised for the transformer and or a timeline can be devised for a substation that includes the transformer for example. Moreover a single source of data may be associated with one or more industrial assets. By way of example a first data source may be configured to obtain and or store temperature data yielded from all transformers located within a defined geographic region.

The example method begins at and data pertaining to the industrial asset is received from a plurality of sources at . The plurality of sources can include among other things enterprise resource systems ERPs enterprise asset management systems EAMs relational databases columnar databases business intelligence systems BIs databases associated with a manufacturer s of the industrial asset e.g. manufacturer databases master data management repositories MDMs operational historians and or other sources from which data pertaining to the industrial asset of interest and or similar industrial assets e.g. configured similarly to the industrial asset of interest and or performing a same function role as the industrial asset of interest etc. may be acquired.

The received data may include among other things word processing documents spreadsheet files portable document format PDF documents photographs videos audio recordings etc. Moreover the types of information represented by such data may include numerical information e.g. representative of discrete events such as field test and or streamed events such as substantially continuous readouts from sensors textual information e.g. which may be structured semi structured and or unstructured and or multimedia information e.g. such as photographs videos audio recordings etc. .

In some embodiments one or more sources are configured to store data pertaining to a plurality of industrial assets. In such embodiments the data may be automatically or manually tagged with an identifier that is unique to the industrial asset e.g. relative to other industrial assets of a fleet to identify data within the one or more sources that pertains to the industrial asset of interest e.g. for later retrieval and delivery at . By way of example readouts from one or more sensors embedded within the industrial asset may be automatically tagged with an identifier when the data is readout from the sensor to correlate the data yielded from the sensor with the industrial asset. As another example data yielded from field tests and or on site inspections may be manually tagged by a technician performing the field tests and or inspections for example. Moreover data pertaining to work orders outages compliance reports etc. may be tagged when a ticket and or report is generated for example.

In some embodiments different identification techniques may be utilized by different sources. Accordingly a first source may tag data associated with the industrial asset of interest with a first identifier e.g. a first serial number and a second source may tag data associated with the industrial asset of interest with a second identifier e.g. a second serial number . In such an embodiment prior to receiving the data at one or more identifiers that are associated with the industrial asset of interest are determined. Techniques of varying difficulty and or scope may be utilized to make such a determination. For example in some embodiments a list of identifiers associated with the industrial asset of interest are uploaded and used to identify data for retrieval and subsequent receipt at . In other embodiments a list of identifiers is compiled based upon information known about the industrial asset e.g. manufacturing date location etc. . For example a first source may list a first industrial asset having a first identifier as being located at a first geographic position and a second source may list a second industrial asset having a second identifier as being located at a second geographic position. If the first geographic position and the second geographic position are substantially similar e.g. have similar GPS coordinates or other similar location information it may be determined that the first identifier and second identifier relate to a same industrial asset e.g. the first industrial asset and the second industrial asset are the same asset . Further in some embodiments such a determination may be verified by comparing the manufacturing date of the first industrial asset with the manufacturing date of the second industrial asset to determine if the manufacturing dates are the same and or by comparing other data pertaining to respective industrial assets.

In some embodiments at least a portion of the received data may be pre processed prior to retrieval and or receipt at . By way of example a portion of the data yielded from sensors and or field tests may be pre processed e.g. cleaned prior to receipt at to normalize such data identify outliers in such data etc. In other embodiments at least a portion of the received data is raw data e.g. such as received from the sensor and or the field test which has not been pre processed for example.

Moreover in some embodiments at least a portion of the data that is stored at one or more sources may have been analyzed prior to receipt at . Such an analysis may have included interpolating and or extrapolating the data to make predictions from the data for example. In some instances the data related to such predictions may be stored in one or more of the sources from which data is received and included in the data received at . By way of example temperature data related to the industrial asset may be interpolated and or extrapolated to estimate the temperature at a point in time when the temperature was not actually measured and or to estimate the temperature of the industrial asset at a desired time in the future. In this way the data received at may include data yielded from field tests sensors maintenance databases reports etc. and synthetic data such as yielded from models calculations etc. which utilize as inputs at least some of the data yielded from the field tests sensors reports etc.

At in the example method the data received at is organized chronologically. That is the data is organized by date and time to arrange the data in a manner suitable for presentation in a timeline.

In some embodiments a first portion of the data may be asynchronous with a second portion of the data due to the clocking scheme utilized when generating and or storing the various types of data that are received from the plurality of sources. Such a problem may be exacerbated by the existence of data being stored in numerous sources associated with various types of databases for example. Accordingly in some embodiments organizing the data chronologically at further comprises synchronizing the first portion of the data with the second portion of the data using a clock synchronization scheme. By way of example the clock synchronization scheme may comprise altering first date information e.g. calendar format time format etc. associated with the first portion of the data to standardize the first date information with second data information associated with the second portion of the data. It may be appreciated that various clocking synchronization schemes are contemplated for use herein to perform such a synchronization of the data yielded from the plurality of sources.

At in the example method the data is reviewed and condensed. Condensing such data is configured to at least one of reduce an amount of duplicate data e.g. to mitigate duplicate entries appearing in the timeline and or to reduce an occurrence of redundant data associated with a frequently occurring event e.g. to reduce an amount of data that is superfluous for purposes of the timeline .

In some embodiments condensing the data to reduce an amount of duplicate data may comprise identifying a first subset of data and a second subset of data having similar date information e.g. day and time information and comparing the first subset with the second subset to determine whether the second subset is a duplicate of the first subset. As an example dissolved gas readings may be stored in multiple sources e.g. where data stored in a first source of the multiple sources is utilized for health tracking and data stored in a second source of the multiple source is utilized for compliance analysis . When the data is received at data associated with the dissolved gas readings may be received from two or more sources e.g. causing duplicate data to be received . After the data is organized chronologically at a check may be performed to determine whether two or more subsets of data are present having a similar e.g. the same date information. If two or more subsets of data are present that have similar date information such data may be further analyzed to determine whether the two or more subsets are in fact duplicate subsets e.g. such as by comparing the content of respective subsets and or metadata associated with respective subsets e.g. such as data creator etc. . In this way a duplicate copy of the dissolved gas readings may be identified and discarded or otherwise ignored for purposes of creating the timeline for example.

In some embodiments redundant data e.g. which may not be an exact duplicate is also discarded or otherwise ignored to condense the data at . By way of example some data may correspond to frequently occurring events e.g. temperature readings dissolved gas readings ambient air readings etc. causing a large amount of data pertaining to such events to amass. In some embodiments it may not be necessarily to include all of the data pertaining to such a frequently occurring event in the timeline so a portion of the data may be discarded to reduce an amount of data present in the timeline. By way of example data pertaining to the temperature of the industrial asset may be acquired once per minute. Such a level of granularity with respect to temperature may not be necessary for inclusion into the timeline and perhaps one temperature reading per day is sufficient e.g. where changes in temperature do not exceed some differential threshold . Accordingly a portion of the data corresponding to temperature may be discarded or otherwise ignored to reduce a total amount of data corresponding to temperature that is represented in the timeline.

In some embodiments where condensing data comprises condensing redundant data corresponding to a frequently occurring event the redundant data may be condensed according to a set of condensing rules. Such condensing rules may be user specified e.g. where the user specifies the granularity with which to represent temperature data in the timeline and or model specific e.g. where the granularity is specified according to the model utilized to generate the timeline which may be a function of the intended viewer of the timeline the type of industrial asset the timeline pertains to a present operating state of the industrial asset etc. . Example condensing rules may relate to a frequency with which to retain data e.g. one reading per day how to select data to retain and or to discard e.g. select data associated with highest temperature reading over the period of a time and discard remaining data acquired over the period of time and or how to combine data to reduce redundancy e.g. average the temperature readings over a day to compute an average temperature for the day for example.

In some embodiments synthetic events may be created based upon the condensing. By way of example where redundant data is condensed by averaging a numerical value associated with the data e.g. such as temperature the average numerical value may not match any actual value represented by the redundant data. For example the average temperature for a day may not be equal to any reading used to compute the average temperature. Accordingly the daily average may be a synthetic event that is created when the data is condensed at e.g. because the received data did not include a daily average .

At in the example method data is grouped into a first set of bins or categories. A first bin of the first set represents first data yielded from the one or more sources of the plurality of sources and a second bin of the first set represents second data yielded from one or more sources of the plurality of sources. For example data pertaining to internal temperatures of the industrial asset and data pertaining to ambient air temperatures proximate the industrial asset may be grouped into a first bin. Data pertaining to intentional shutdowns e.g. for maintenance and or data pertaining to unintentional outages may be grouped into a second bin. Data pertaining to routine maintenance schedules and or data pertaining to inspection reports may be grouped into a third bin etc.

In some embodiments the data is categorized e.g. as pertaining to internal temperatures outages and or maintenance schedules etc. prior to the data being grouped into bins at . Various techniques may be used to categorize the data. For example the data may be categorized based upon the source from which the data was received at . By way of example a first source may comprise merely temperature readings and a second source may comprise merely maintenance reports. Accordingly in some embodiments data received from a first source is tagged with a first identifier associated with the first source to categorize the data as temperature data and data received from a second source is tagged with a second identifier associated with the second source to categorize the data as maintenance data. In still other embodiments grouping the data in bins at may comprise reading the data e.g. and converting non readable files such as images into readable files and or reading metadata associated with the data to categorize the data.

In some embodiments the number of bins into which the data is grouped and or criteria for grouping the data may be specified by a set of one or more grouping rules. The grouping rules may be defined for a fleet of industrial assets e.g. where the same set of grouping rules applies regardless of whether the industrial asset is a transformer capacitor circuit breaker etc. may be asset type specific e.g. where a first set of grouping rules applies to a dry transformer and a second set of grouping rules applies to a wet transformer and or may be asset specific e.g. where a first set of grouping rules that applies to a first transformer may be different than a second set of grouping rules that applies to a second transformer even though the first transformer and second transformer may be a same type class of transformer .

In some embodiments the grouping rules are user defined. In other embodiments the grouping rules are defined by a training algorithm configured to derive the grouping rules as a function of past interactions of one or more users with timelines e.g. such as interactions with timelines pertaining to industrial assets of a similar type to the industrial asset of interest . In still other embodiments the grouping rules may be a function of a present operating state of the industrial asset. For example a first set of grouping rules may be defined that are applied when the industrial asset is operating within a defined set of parameters and a second set of grouping rules may be defined that are applied when the industrial asset is operating outside the defined set of parameters e.g. when a sensor reading deviates from a permissible range and or an inspection report indicates a potential problem .

At the data is prioritized by bins such that one or more bins are assigned a higher ranking than one or more other bins. By way of example the first bin may be assigned a higher ranking or priority than the second bin causing data of the first bin to also be assigned a higher ranking or priority relative to data of the second bin. As will be further described below in some embodiments the manner and or distinctiveness with which data is presented on the timeline may be a function how the data is prioritized. For example data comprised within a bin having a higher ranking or higher priority may be displayed more prominently than data comprised within a bin having a low ranking or lower priority.

The data may be prioritized based upon a set of prioritization rules which may be user defined defined by an algorithm configured to predict how a user is likely to desire the data to be prioritized and or defined based upon a present operating state of the industrial asset. Moreover a set of prioritization rules may apply to a fleet of industrial assets e.g. of varying type and or purpose may be asset type specific and or may be asset specific.

By way of example in one embodiment a series of user defined prioritization rules are derived where the applicability of various rules may depend upon a present operating state of the industrial asset. For example a first portion of the series may apply when the industrial asset is operating within a normal state e.g. where a normal state may be determined based upon readouts from one or more sensors embedded within the industrial asset and a second portion of the series may apply when the industrial asset is operating outside what is consider to be normal e.g. one or more readouts may be outside of a permissible range and or a recent inspection report may indicate abnormalities with the industrial asset . In this way how the data is prioritized may be a function of user defined rules and a present operating state of the industrial asset for example.

As another example the prioritization rules may be derived via a training algorithm such as a neural network algorithm linear regression algorithm Bayesian network algorithm support vector algorithm or other machine learning algorithm for example. In some embodiments such a training algorithm may utilize as inputs past user behavior regarding interactions with similar timelines e.g. pertaining to the industrial asset of interest and or other industrial assets and or known operating conditions of the industrial asset. By way of example upon the occurrence of an outage history may indicate that users typically focus on particular data that is pertinent to the outage e.g. such as temperature data dissolved gas concentration data recent video or audio data etc. for a transformer . Accordingly if the timeline indicates that a recent outage has occurred the training algorithm may create a set of prioritization rules for the data that causes data pertaining to such information to be ranked higher than other data that has historically not be of interest to a user immediately upon an occurrence of an outage.

At in the example method a timeline of data is provided for presentation e.g. to a user in a first manner to chronicle events pertaining to the industrial asset. Such a timeline can for example be adapted according to user preferences and or preferences of users within a region in which the timeline is presented. For example the timeline can be localized to illustrate events in local time for a region in which the timeline is provided for presentation and or can be formatted in a 12 hour format or 24 hour format based upon user preference for example. Moreover the data presented in the timeline can be translated into a native language for the region in which the timeline is provided for presentation for example.

The manner in which various data is presented in the timeline may be a function of the prioritization at and may be modifiable based upon user input and or user interaction with the timeline. For example in some embodiments the timeline may be initially presented in a manner that depicts an entire lifespan of the industrial asset from the day the industrial asset was manufactured until the present day or some day in the future. A select number of events and or a select bin of data may be presented more prominently in the initial presentation than other events and or other bins of data. For example the timeline as initially presented in the first manner may depict outages lasting longer than a specified period of time prominently with other data being displayed less prominently and or hidden.

In some embodiments the timeline provided for presentation is interactive. For example a user may select which types of data to be presented prominently and or may select a portion e.g. particular date range of the timeline etc. When a user selects a portion of the timeline the prominence of data associated with the selected portion of the timeline may be increased e.g. by zooming in on the selected portion a portion of the timeline . As another example a user may select a particular event to view additional data pertinent to that event. For example the user may select a particular outage and the timeline may be altered to depict data related to the outage e.g. such as a temperature of the industrial asset in the days leading up to the outage inspection data related to inspections performed in close temporal proximity to the outage etc. . In this way a user may interact with the timeline to change how data is presented causing the timeline to be provided for presentation in a second manner e.g. where the second manner displays different data prominently displays a different timespan etc. .

In some embodiments data stored in one or more of the plurality of sources and pertaining to the industrial asset is updated and or new data is acquired pertaining to the industrial asset. In such embodiments the timeline may be periodically or intermittently updated according to the newly received data. By way of example to initially construct a timeline a request for data pertaining to the industrial asset may be issued and data corresponding to the request may be retrieved from the plurality of sources. The data received at may be incrementally refreshed at routine intervals and or upon identification of a change to the retrieved data e.g. such as indicated by a ping from the source indicative of a change and requesting a service to re crawl the source to extract the updated new data . In other embodiments a full refresh e.g. as opposed to incremental refreshes may be performed upon the occurrence of a specified event e.g. a percentage change to data stored by a source has occurred a specified amount of time has lapsed since the last full refresh etc. . In still other embodiments an incremental refresh and or a full refresh of the data may be initiated at the request of a user e.g. such that data is received on demand . Upon new or updated data being received at least some of the foregoing actions may be repeated to update the timeline provided for presentation at .

The example method begins at and input indicative of an interaction between a user and a timeline is received at and stored in a knowledge base. The input may include information regarding the identity of a user and or the role a user plays at the organization and or plays in relation to the industrial asset e.g. inspector maintenance technician compliance officer auditor etc. and or information pertaining to how the user interacts with the timeline e.g. such as what data the user selects in the timeline and or how the user manipulates a view of the timeline . In this way a record is maintained of how one or more users interact with a timeline to facilitate making predictions regarding how futures users e.g. which may be the same users or different users are expected to interact with the timeline e.g. to update a manner in which the timeline is presented to a future user to increase the distinctiveness of data that the user is likely to find relevant and or to minimize navigation of the timeline by the future user .

At in the example method a model utilized to develop at least one of condensing rules e.g. specifying criteria for determining whether data is redundant and or duplicate and or specifying how redundant duplicate data is to be treated grouping rules e.g. specifying how data is to be binned and or prioritization rules e.g. specifying how data or bins of data are to be prioritized is updated based upon the received input or the input that has accumulated in the knowledge base is used to alter at least one of the condensing rules grouping rules and or prioritization rules. The model may be developing using supervised learning algorithms active learning algorithms and or other algorithms that analyze past user interaction with a timeline to predict or model how a future user is likely to interact with the timeline and or other timelines pertaining to other industrial assets.

The models are configured to alter one or more condensing rules grouping rules and or prioritizing rules based upon how a user s has historically interacted with the timeline. By way of example data pertaining to videos and images may have historically been binned together according to a first set of grouping rules and assigned as same priority in a timeline. However based upon input received at a model may determine that users frequently interact with the timeline in a manner that causes the image data to be enlarged while users interact with video data infrequently. Accordingly the model may adjust the grouping rules to provide for binning the image data to be binned in a different bin than the video data.

In some embodiments the model may further consider how a user interacts with the timeline in conjunction with the operating state of the industrial asset. By way of example the model may analyze at least some of the data that was received to develop the timeline with which the user interacted to identify trends if any exist between the user interaction and the analyzed data. By way of example when an internal temperature of the industrial asset increases above a specified threshold users may interact with the timeline in a manner than causes internal temperature data for the past month recently acquired images of the transformer and or ambient air temperature data for the past month to be presented more distinctly on the timeline than initially presented. Accordingly the model may develop a prioritization rule s that provides for increasing the priority of at least some of the internal temperature data recently acquired images and or ambient air temperature data relative to the priority of such data when the internal temperature is less than the specified threshold. As another example the model may analyze at least some of the data that was received at to determine whether the user interacts with the timeline differently when a first load is applied to the industrial asset relative to the way in which the user s interact with the timeline when a second load is applied. As still another example the model may analyze at least some of the data that was received at to determine whether the user interacts with the timeline differently when the industrial asset is operating normally relative to the way in which the user s interact with the timeline when the industrial asset experiences an intentional shutdown and or an unintentional outage for example.

In other embodiments the model may further consider how the user interacts with the timeline in conjunction with the particular user and or the role of the user relative to the industrial asset. By way of example a compliance officer may interact with a timeline differently than a maintenance technician because the compliance offer may be interested in a different subset of data and or a different timespan of data relative to the maintenance technician. As an example a maintenance technician may be focused merely on data pertaining to events and or recordings that have occurred within the last month where a compliance officer may be focused on data pertaining to events and or recordings that have occurred within the last year. Accordingly the input received at may comprise an indication of who the user is and or the role the user plays relative to an industrial asset to which the timeline pertains and the model may analyze the interaction of the user with the timeline to make a prediction s regarding how the user or other users having a same or similar role may interact with the timeline in the future. In this way the model can adjust at least one of the condensing rules grouping rules and or prioritization rules as a function of the user to whom the timeline is to be presented. By way of example returning to the example of the compliance officer and the maintenance technician the model may update the prioritization rules to prioritize data acquired within the last month if the user to whom the timeline is going to be presented is a maintenance technician and to prioritize data acquired within the last year if the user to whom the timeline is going to be presented is a compliance officer. In other embodiments the model may adjust the grouping rules to bin data in a first manner when the user to whom the timeline is to be presented is a compliance officer and to bin the data in a second manner when the user is a maintenance technician for example.

Although specific reference is made herein to updating a model to alter at least one of the condensing rules the grouping rules and or the prioritization rules in some embodiments the model may be further updated to adjust how data is received and or what data is included in the timeline. By way of example in some embodiments the model may identify data that is being received at in but rarely being viewed by a user. Accordingly the model may request that such data stop being received. As another example the model may identify that users often attempt to view particular types of data at a high level of granularity. Accordingly the model may request a system to retrieve more data of that particular type and or to identify additional sources that store that particular type of data and or similar types of data e.g. which a user may also find relevant . Where such additional data of a desired type is unavailable the model may request that the additional data be generated. For example the model may recognize that users are particularly interested in data associated with dissolved gas concentrations and may request that measurements of dissolved gas concentrations be acquired more frequently to increase available data associated with dissolved gas concentrations. Moreover the model may be updated to adjust how data is condensed by adjusting one or more condensing rules. For example the model may adjust how data pertaining to frequently occurring events and or duplicate data is handled.

At in the example method a timeline is presented for presentation according to at least one of the altered condensing rules altered grouping rules and or altered prioritization rules. The timeline provided for presentation at may pertain to a same industrial asset as the timeline with which the user interacted at or may be a different industrial asset. By way of example the input received at may pertain to how a user interacted with a first timeline pertaining to a first transformer. While users may interact with a second timeline pertaining to a second transformer in a slightly different way a similar set of grouping rules and or prioritization rules may be applicable. Accordingly a model or merely a slight variation thereof may be used to construct or update the first timeline may also be utilized to construct the second timeline which is provided for presentation .

In embodiments where the first timeline with which the user interacted at is the same timeline that is provided for presentation at e.g. the timelines pertain to the same asset the manner in which that timeline is presented for interaction with the user at may nevertheless be different than the manner in which the timeline is provided for presentation at . By way of example one or more datasets may have an increased distinctiveness in the timeline provided for presentation at relative to the distinctiveness of such a dataset s when provided for presentation for interaction with a user at . That is the timeline may be presented in a first manner at and a second manner at for example where the second manner presents the timeline or data therein differently than the first manner.

With respect to a first instance of a graphical user interface displaying a timeline of an industrial asset in a first manner is provided. In the example embodiment the industrial asset is a transformer. Example features of the graphical user interface include a selection bar a user identification field and a timeline modifier window .

The selection bar comprises a plurality of user selectable elements such as drop down menus that comprise one or more commands which alter how the timeline is viewed and or facilitate fast switching between various timelines. For example the selection bar of the illustrated embodiment comprises an asset element a zoom element a history element a predefined formats element and a selection element .

The asset element may list other transformers that are similar in configuration to the presently displayed transformer. In some embodiments the user can select a listed transformer to view a timeline corresponding to the listed transformer e.g. allowing the user to compare events corresponding to the listed transformer to events corresponding to the presently displayed transformer . The zoom element comprises commands which when selected by the user increase a magnitude of the timeline in the display area e.g. so that the user can view a portion of the timeline in more detail and or decrease a magnitude of the timeline e.g. to view a larger portion e.g. date range of the timeline within the display area . The history element is configured to display previous configurations of the timeline e.g. so that if the user modifies how the timeline is presented the user can quickly navigate back to a previous view . The predefined format element is configured to present the user with various predefined timeline formats e.g. where a first format may group data differently than a second format or may cause data to be prioritized differently . For example a user interested in compliance may select a compliance format to increase a distinctiveness of data that is typically of interest to a compliance officer and decrease e.g. or hide data that is typically of little interest to a compliance officer. The selection element when selected is configured to engage a selection tool which allows the user to highlight or focus upon a desired portion of the timeline to view additional data related to the highlighted or focused upon portion.

The user identification field is configured to receive user input regarding the identity or role of the user. By way of example a user may input his her employee identification tag email address title etc. into the user identification field . Information input into such a field may be utilized to among other things authorize the user to view the timeline filter the types of data available to the user e.g. so that company sensitive data is not released to a non authorized entity and or determine a manner in which to present the data e.g. determine how to condense group and or prioritize the data in view a role of the user and or a past interaction of the user with the timeline or other timelines corresponding to other industrial assets .

The timeline modifier window is configured to comprise commands for modifying the content and or scope of the timeline . By way of example the timeline modifier window may comprise a listing of available data types. A user may select temperature to view temperature data corresponding to the transformer and or outages to view outage data corresponding to the transformer. Moreover the user may customize the scope of the timeline by specifying a beginning date and or an end date of the timeline and or by using pre defined links that are intended to cause a limited amount of information to be displayed. By way of example the user may select temperature data from the past week to view merely temperature data acquired during the preceding week. As another example the user may select outages lasting less than 3 days to view merely those outages that lasted less than three days e.g. with longer outages being hidden or presented in a less distinctive manner .

The timeline modifier window can also be used to facilitate the input of additional data pertaining to the transformer and or the deletion of data pertaining to the transformer. By way of example a user may add an image to the timeline via the timeline modifier window . In some embodiments based upon the addition of the image a system may be configured to update an underlying source from which similar types of data e.g. image data were initially retrieved to construct the timeline . As another example a user may identify a report that has been mistakenly categorized as being associated with the transformer e.g. when in fact it was associated with a different transformer and may highlight the report to delete such data from the timeline e.g. and update a source of the report to reflect that the report is not associated with the transformer .

In some embodiments a user may engage the timeline to view additional data pertaining to the transformer. For example the user may use the select feature may click on a portion of the timeline etc. to highlight a portion of the timeline that is of interest and or to select a displayed event. For example upon the selection of the Jun. 16 1984 event the timeline may be updated to present the timeline in a second manner as shown in

At least some data presented in while the timeline was presented in the first manner may be hidden and or the distinctiveness of such data may be reduced when the timeline is presented in the second manner as shown in and or a third manner as shown in . Further data that was hidden when the timeline was presented in the first manner may be shown when the timeline is presented in the second manner and or the third manner.

More particularly with respect to the timeline is altered to depict events that occurred within a 1 2 month window of the Jun. 16 1984 event that was selected in . Data that is often of interest when an outage occurs e.g. as specified by a user and or as determined by a training algorithm may be shown in the timeline since the Jun. 16 1984 event was an outage. By way of example when an outage occurs to a transformer users may often seek to view temperature data and or dissolved gas concentrations for the one month leading up to the outage. Accordingly a first block pertaining to such temperature information and a second block pertaining to such dissolved gas information may be presented. The user may view the temperature information and or the dissolved gas information by selecting a view hyperlink within respective blocks . In another embodiment such data may be presented directly within the timeline so that the user does not have to navigate to another window to view such data.

The timeline may further comprise additional blocks that comprise additional information pertaining to the outage such as a more exact timeframe when the outage started and or when the outage ended and or a preliminary report regarding why the outage occurred e.g. which again may be viewed by selecting a view hyperlink . In some embodiments a user may select an entry to view additional data and or additional options regarding the selected entry. For example the user may select a block to determine a source s of information presented within the block.

With respect to yet another approach is illustrated for depicting events that occurred within a 1 2 month window of the Jun. 16 1984 event that was selected in . More particularly a subset of data such as temperature data and or current data e.g. respectively describing a temperature of and an amount of current through a transformer may be represented on a first axis e.g. a y axis and time may be represented on a second axis e.g. an x axis . In this way a user can view information indicative of an operating state of the transformer during the time leading up to the outage directly within the timeline e.g. instead of selecting boxes to view such data as described with respect to . Further the user can compare data yielded from sensors or other substantially continuous data producing devices e.g. such as temperature data current data etc. with data from discrete events such as data describing the outage images or other multimedia of the transformer acquired during the outage and or reports explaining the outage for example.

By way of example illustrate the timeline as being scaled linearly. In other embodiments the timeline may be scaled differently. For example the timeline may be scaled logarithmically and or may be fish eyed e.g. where a first portion of the timeline has a first scale and one or more other portions have a second scale e.g. the first portion is enlarged relative to the one or more other portions . As another example the data may be chronologically arranged vertically e.g. the timeline is parallel to a vertical axis as opposed to horizontally as shown in .
