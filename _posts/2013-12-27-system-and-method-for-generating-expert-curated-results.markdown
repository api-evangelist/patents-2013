title: System and method for generating expert curated results
abstract: Aspects and embodiments are directed to systems and methods for managing validated information. Validated information can leverage previous research on an issue, track social interaction around the issue, and simplify any request from information on the same or related problems. Additionally, validated information can include background information on an issue being addressed (e.g., a tech support question), information on how the issue was resolved, links to source information used to resolve the issue, and can provide information on whether the resolution continues to be effective for other users. According to some embodiments, validated information can be organized into answer objects configured to provide an answer to a technical question. According to one embodiment, this capture of information into a validated knowledge base facilitates subsequent requests and better leverages the best resolutions by tracking, scoring, and elevating search results (including, for example, answer objects) and/or users that are the most effective.

This application is a non provisional of and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Provisional App. No. 61 839 607 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING EXPERT CURATED RESULTS filed Jun. 26 2013 which application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Conventionally tech support staff and agents primarily use web searches to find solutions to complex technical support questions. While the modern information age provides unprecedented access to tools advice and information conventional systems can fail to integrate resources and provide limited capability to re use and leverage previous knowledge requests.

It is realized that such ad hoc approaches to information gathering and technical support resolution fail to adequately leverage the results of prior research. Accordingly some aspects and embodiments are directed to systems and methods for managing validated information. According to one aspect validated information can leverage previous research on an issue track social interaction around the issue and simplify any request from information on the same or related problems. Additionally validated information can include background information on an issue being addressed e.g. a tech support question information on how the issue was resolved and links to source information used to resolve the issue among other information. Such validated information can provide information on whether the resolution continues to be effective for other users. According to some embodiments validated information can be organized into answer objects configured to provide an answer to a technical question. According to one embodiment this capture of information into a validated knowledge base facilitates subsequent requests and better leverages the best resolutions by tracking scoring and elevating search results including for example answer objects and or users that are the most effective.

Various embodiments of the systems and methods can be configured to perform one or more functions with regard to validated information. For example various embodiments may either alone or in combination with other functions seed search results with automatically validated information capture validated information from user populations record user activity to generate validated knowledge bases integrate validated information with general web based results and can in some examples further serve as an integration platform between validated information web based results and commercial information systems e.g. issue tracking systems customer relationship management CRM software among other options .

Various embodiments can be used to address conventional problems with searching the web and or non validated information to address for example tech support issues. In some conventional approaches once a technical solution is found via web search the solution the search and the source of information are not captured anywhere for re use by other tech support knowledge workers. Some embodiments of the validated system solve this problem by enabling the tech support knowledge worker to tag and store the best solutions and make those validated solutions available to a global community of users. The tech support worker creates validated information by selecting the information that solved his request and saving that information. The system can capture additional information as part of the creation of the validated information e.g. search terms user profile information source among other options . The validated information can be further validated by the system. For example subsequent tech support users will search on the same or similar problem and receive validated information as a search result. Those users can evaluate the answer captured in the validated information. For examples those users can rating the answer comment on the answer use the answer and through system tracking that answer can be promoted so that answer is prominently displayed to later searchers. Rather than having thousands of help desk staff and tech support call center agents around the world spend wasted time searching the web for the same similar answers to the exact same tech support questions the system can enable a community to benefit from the first search result and subsequent tracking on the effectiveness of the result through for example additional validation.

Still other aspects embodiments and advantages of these exemplary aspects and embodiments are discussed in detail below. Moreover it is to be understood that both the foregoing information and the following detailed description are merely illustrative examples of various aspects and embodiments and are intended to provide an overview or framework for understanding the nature and character of the claimed aspects and embodiments. Any embodiment disclosed herein may be combined with any other embodiment. References to an embodiment an example some embodiments some examples an alternate embodiment various embodiments one embodiment at least one embodiment this and other embodiments or the like are not necessarily mutually exclusive and are intended to indicate that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment may be included in at least one embodiment. The appearances of such terms herein are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.

Stated broadly various aspects of the disclosure are directed to systems and methods for managing generating and providing validated content. The validated content can be used in a technical support setting such that previous work searches solutions and source material is preserved for other technical support workers. In some embodiments information for answering a technical support question as well as related information is compiled into an answer object for a respective issue. Use and or access to the validated content e.g. the answer object can be monitored to add additional information e.g. further validation and or to score and promote validated content and the users who generated the validated content. According to one embodiment access to such expertly validated content or the users themselves provides unique opportunities to leverage existing knowledge and preserve its use across user communities.

In an example implementation when a user searches for an answer the user can be served results from validated information that has already been expert validated by another tech support knowledge worker. Based on monitoring knowledge base maintained by the system grows with every user interaction being continually updated e.g. on a global basis as subsequent users access validated information and or create their own. For example the knowledge base can be updated as tech support knowledge workers search the web for solutions e.g. from validated and non validated sources to the newest problems. In one example the system facilitates user identification e.g. tagging of the results s that provide the answer the source of information for the answer and storage of those results and user information that provide a definitive answer. The system may be configured to score and promote potential solutions promoting the most relevant and or best answers facilitating quick and efficient problem resolution.

This invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways. Also the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of including comprising having containing involving and variations thereof herein is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items.

Various embodiments of a validation system include and describe systems applications and or components for providing validated responses to search queries. shows a block diagram of an example embodiment of a system for managing a validated knowledge base. According to some embodiments system can manage the validated knowledge base using a validation engine . According to one embodiment user queries including for example search terms query logic search navigation selection among other options can be processed by the system and or the validation engine to return a set of validated results matching the user query at . Components of system including validation engine can be executed on specially configured computer systems such as the computer system or discussed with reference to .

According to one embodiment system and or engine can be configured to provide end users access to validated search results in the form of answer objects configured to provide an answer or resolution to a technical support problem. The system can be configured to provide validated search results in conjunction with conventional search activity. For example searching executed in conventional browser applications e.g. IE FIREFOX CHROME etc. through available search engines can be augmented with validated search functions that provide or integrate validated results into conventional search results.

In some embodiments the validated search functions can be provided as a stand alone application a browser add on plug in a browser tool bar a search site or other application that delivers validated search results in response to search activity by a user e.g. search queries query terms search navigation faceted search etc. .

The system may also include a community presence where the community can operate to review and validate search result information. In some embodiments the community generates comments on specific results comments on source information for results comments on users ratings of validated information and or answer objects among other options. The commentary submitted can be aggregated by the system along with the results to provide a validated knowledge base. Each comment on a respective information source user or answer can be used by the system to improve the validated knowledge base.

For example community members can provide feedback on search results which can be used by the system to score and promote validated search results. According to one embodiment system and or the community can feature user profiles to facilitate collection of comments and scoring of information among other options. Each user can develop a reputation for example based on score for expertise in one or more areas based on how their answers to specific problems queries or questions are scored. Scoring can include criteria for relevance of an answer and effectiveness of an answer among other options. Results can be presented based on information tiers including validated expert validated and non validated. Within information tiers results can be further ordered based on system scoring and or promotion rules. Ordering on tiers or within tiers can be configured to present validated information having the most relevance and or best score increasing the likelihood of obtaining a useful answer to for example a technical problem.

Dynamic feedback from the community and or tracking of actual use of results can be used by the system to modify scores resulting in varying promotion order over time. In some examples the system is configured to track user search activity and or use of validated and non validated search results. The tracking information can be used by the system to modify scoring of information and or associated users. Additionally user feedback can be evaluated by the system to increase or decrease scoring.

In some embodiments user scores can be incorporated into scoring of validated information affecting the ordering of results e.g. validated and non validated . In one example users can explicitly score validated information on a system defined scale e.g. number of stars 1 10 etc. . The validation score for the validated information can be determined based on an average of submitted scores. In some examples user experience expertise can be weighted into the calculation of total validation score for respective validated information. After scores are generated the validation score associated with the validated information can be used to order any set of results of validated information. In some embodiments the scoring of information and the scoring of users can be linked such that for example user s scores increase as the score for the content they generated increases. Additionally user scores can increase based on activity within the system. For example creating content and commenting and or rating existing content can increase a user s score. In some embodiments user activity can be associated with a knowledge domain or sub domain. The modification of a user s scores may be limited to the knowledge domain or sub domain in which they are participating. In other embodiments user activity can affect the user s score differently within a knowledge domain or sub domain e.g. having greater effect on a domain based user score and for a score associated with the user outside of the knowledge domain or sub domain.

According to some embodiments system is configured to integrate into existing information systems to provide validated results and permit creation of validated content. For example system can be integrated into existing browser applications search sites etc. In one embodiment system can include locally executed functionality that monitors search functions and or applications executing search functions to provide integrated search functions. The system can also provide search integration into stand alone applications that maintain and or host respective knowledge bases.

In some implementations various application programming interfaces API can be executed to monitor search activity capture third party information incorporate third party information sources into validated knowledge bases and return validated results that integrate any one or more of public sourced validated results third party sourced validated results non validated results e.g. public and third party . Additionally the system can include multiple APIs to integrate search operations across multiple third party information systems e.g. customer service software solutions CSS customer relationship management systems CRM issue ticketing systems collaboration software platforms and or search engines e.g. GOOGLE BING etc. .

According to one aspect tracking of such information how it accessed the use of the information and or scoring of the providers e.g. information source and user supplying the information provides unique insight into the information s value respective user s information value etc. The system can be configured to provide reporting and or analytics on specific users and how they are ranked in the system. Some embodiments can be configured to identify expertise in various knowledge domains e.g. with respect to a specific product a company s product line category of product technology area issue etc. . In some embodiments the system can create candidate knowledge domains sub domains and analyze user activity within candidate domains to determine if there is any value to the candidate domain. For example if existing scores for users and or information do not change based on filtering through the candidate domain the candidate domain can be determined not to have value. If validated information changes order and or highest scored users change the system can determine that the candidate domain sub domain has value.

Further activity within the domain sub domain can be used to validate the domain sub domain. For example if the highest scored results are returned or used with an improved frequency e.g. based on usage tacking user ratings or user comments for searches that match the new domain when compared to results that would have been returned in the prior domain sub domain organization the candidate domain sub domain can be validated.

Further analytics tools can be provided to generate trends in the knowledge base of validated and non validated information. In some examples the system can be configured to provide time based analysis. Time based analysis can enable for example administrative users to takes snap shots of current trends as well as trends at past points of time.

Various implementations of system can be configured to interface with a multitude of information sources including for example the Internet proprietary information systems CRM systems CSS systems among other options. According to one embodiment system provides access to and augments a validated knowledge base. The validated knowledge base can be segmented into various knowledge domains where a knowledge domain covers a specific discipline or knowledge area. Various features and embodiments are discussed with respect to a technical support knowledge domain. Various combinations of the features functions and operations performed with respect to the technical support knowledge domain are implemented in other knowledge domains according to other embodiments.

According to one embodiment system can be implemented to provide validated results to users seeking solutions to technical support problems. As discussed a validation system can provide access to validated search results where the validated search results have been vetted through for example others users seeking to resolve the same or similar problems user comments received on search results tracked usage of search results agreement with a solution agreement with a user from a user populations identification of expert technical sources including for example validated information sources etc. Shown in is an example embodiment of a validation system operating in a technical support domain. System can manage the validated knowledge base on technical support issues using a validation engine .

According to one embodiment user search activity including for example search terms query logic search navigation selection among other options can be processed by the system and or the validation engine to return a set of validated results matching the user search activity from a knowledge base e.g. database . Components of the system including validation engine can be executed on specially configured computer systems such as the computer system or discussed with reference to .

According to one embodiment system and or engine can include a generation component configured to search for validated results based on user queries and display validated results e.g. to the user. Displayed results can also include sets of merged results displaying validated and non validated results to the user. In further examples results without validated matches can also be returned. The system engine or generation component can be configured to provide filtered results from non validated information sources. In some embodiments the generation component can be configured to provide suggested sites for resolving a user query.

In one example the system or generation component can be configured to analyze a user query to determine a context and responsive to the context determination deliver recommended sites to query. Further the system can execute the user s query including for example similar query terms on the recommended sites to deliver non validated but improved results for the user query. In one embodiment the system accessed seed sites either known to the system to be good sources of information in a matching information domain or sources of information that have been validated by user commentary or ratings.

According to some embodiments sources of information can be validated based on various sub domains e.g. MAC sub domain LINUX sub domain WINDOWS sub domain networking sub domain IPHONE sub domain ANDRIOD sub domain smart phone sub domain or any other sub domain determined based on subject or related information grouping . In further examples validated sources and validated information can be grouped in domains and sub domains. In some embodiments domain validated information sources can be recommended to users for example when no validated results match a user query. Additionally if a set of results is too few in number or determined not to match well with the user query validated information sources can be provided by the system .

According to one embodiment the generation component can be configured to support users search activity in a knowledge base e.g. database as well as other sources and display validated data e.g. that has been commented on and or tagged by other users. Various embodiments of the generation component can include one or more the example features and any combination of the example features described in greater detail below.

According to one aspect search display and commenting functions can be executed by a generation component e.g. . The generation component can be configured to provide search interfaces to search and display validated i.e. curated results . The generation component can also be configured to capture search activity for example search activity performed on browser applications and or third party search tools. The generation component can be configured to execute the captured search activity on validated knowledge bases to return corresponding validated search results. In one example the validated results can be integrated into any search results provided by the browser and or third party search tool. In another example the generation component can be configured to execute user interface functions that switch between validated result sets and non validated results.

According to one embodiment the system and or generation component is configured to distinguish non validated results e.g. web browser results versus validated results is user interface displays. In one example the generation component can include at least a browser plug in or a browser bar. In further examples generation component can include a mobile application executing on a smart phone. The mobile application can be configured to display when validated results are available and if nothing no validated results available for a query entered.

In further embodiments the generation component can be configured to automatically recognize search activity e.g. search query terms faceted search navigation search etc. and generate recommended queries e.g. similar queries expanded search terms domain specific taxonomy terms etc. . In one example based on a user entered query the system and or generation component generates like queries and or similar validated result sets that may match what the user is looking for.

According to another embodiment the generation component not only monitors search activity but search results as well. The generation component can be configured to automatically store information on non validated search results. For example the system stores information on URLs that have been viewed by other users. The results are identified by the system as possible answers to the query that was previously executed but have not been validated through comments or tagging.

According to one aspect system engine and or generation component are configured to accept user comment on search results to validate the results or to provide opinion on previous comments. In one embodiment the generation component permits users to identify and tag a search result e.g. a URL as relevant to a search query. For example once a result has been confirmed as a valid answer to a search based upon user commentary the system stores that results and commentary from the user as validated information. In further embodiments the generation component provides user facing functionality to clip key information from an information source e.g. a URL page or save the whole page and add relevant annotations tips warnings to create validated information e.g. a tagged URL page or a page having clipped information and or comments saved in the system knowledge base e.g. database . The generation component can be configured to accept user commentary in multiple formations including for example voice capture screen share video capture typed notes into a validated or curated page.

The system can display tagged pages with all relevant data e.g. clipped data comments etc. . In some examples the system also stores information on the user who created the validated information tracks the number of times the result is opened by users and can link similar pages in the knowledge base. Additionally source material e.g. URLs publications etc. can be referenced in the validated information to allow users to easily retrieve an originating URL as desired. As discussed the search activity used to get to the validated information can be stored by the system. In addition the system can maintain identifying information on users executing those searches. In one example as validated information is updated through user comments new notes addition of source material e.g. clipped information the users who previously executed searches matching the validated information provided comments or accessed the validated information can receive automatic notifications regarding the update. Additionally as new validated information is identified that better resolves a query provides an improved solution to a problem etc. the system can be configured to deliver automatic notifications to users.

In one embodiment the system and or generation component can be configured to score validated information and the user scoring to order search results. For example the generation component can be configured to boost or lower position in query results displays. The generation component can execute a set of flexible rating criteria rules to establish scores for each result including validated results and non validated results . In one embodiment the scoring rules modify a score for respective results based on a user or users associated with a result. In another embodiment a skill level associated with a creating user is used by the generation component to modify the score for the created information. Other embodiments include rules that when executed modify scores based on any one or more of associated users user skill usage statistics domain industry segment timeliness e.g. date time opened etc. among other options.

According to one implementation the generation component can provide a knowledge base management facility configured to fine tune scoring of information results etc. The management facility can be used to update scoring rules applied add scoring rules delete scoring rules among other options. In further examples scoring rules can also raise or lower scores based on a user type. For example technical support users operating in a technical support domain will have a greater impact on scoring than non expert users generic users or users from other knowledge domains.

In some embodiments result displays use validation scores to order the displayed results. In one example the scores associated with displayed information e.g. URLs provide for relevancy ranking for the associated query. As respective results are accessed and commented on by users a respective score increases causing the respective results to be promoted in any future result display.

According to another embodiment the generation component can also be configured to generate validated information having multiple sources e.g. web pages publications etc. . The generation component can be configured to created validated information as a container with links and or clipped content from a plurality of information sources. For example where multiple references or information sources are required to solve a particular problem a user can clip information from any number of sources and or provide links to any number of information sources. In one embodiment the validated information can be displayed in conjunction with any linked sources referenced in the validated information. Such displays can facilitate problem resolution enabling users to choose to access source material directly or review the validated information.

In other embodiment the generation component can also be configured to modify displayed information based on whether the information is validated non validated and seeded information. In one embodiment the system can generate seeded information to improve result sets. Seeded information includes information that has not been validated by a user but rather tagged or commented by automated system processing. Discussed in greater detail below system and or engine can include a administration component configured to automatically notate information with seed comments and or provide seeded information content generated from search keywords similar keywords concepts etc. In some embodiments the generation component can prompt users to confirm that seeded comments and or seeded content is relevant or appropriate transforming the seeded content into validated content.

The system engine and or generation component can be implemented in a variety of user environments. For example operating environment can be based on a web browser application and the system operations and functions can be executed through browser plug in or tool bar. Other examples include stand alone applications that execute on a user s computer system or communicate with other portions of a validation system e.g. . In some embodiments the system and or generation component integrates with third party information systems e.g. CSS systems CRM systems collaboration systems etc. . The search and commenting functions can also be extended to information stored on the third party systems. The information stored on the third party systems can likewise be scores and results ordered based on the system scoring.

As search results are generated third party data sources in the results can be associated with information on search activity associated with a result the user s performing the searching whether the content provides the solution to the search technical problem usage information for the respective result user comments user access etc. In various embodiments the system and or generation component is configured to provide visual indications for distinguishing information sourced from public data and information sources from third party information systems. In some examples the generation component is configured to maintain information reflecting a specific third party information system from which information was sourced. The generation component can be configured to limit access to data from third party sources to authorized users.

User feedback e.g. comments tags notes suggestions etc. can be managed by a promotion component. According to one embodiment system and or engine can include promotion component configured to manage scoring ranking and ordering of search results. The promotion component can operate on information collected at the creation of validated information e.g. creating user skill domain search terms identified as the solution etc. and can further monitor and adjust scorings associated with that validated information as additional users access and comment on that information. In some embodiments additional feedback on validated information can be sourced through user communities e.g. via a community component discussed in greater detail below .

According to one embodiment the promotion component is configured to analyze user comments for agreement or disagreement with validated information e.g. a tagged article and respective content as it relates to an associated query. As discussed validated information can be stored in the system . In one example the validated information is a data unit stored as faceted data. Each facet related to the data unit and provides descriptive information detailing content associated relevance etc. In one example one or more queries associated with the validated information can be stored as facets of information. User comments can likewise be stored as information facets. Additional facets can include information on creation time related queries related information accessing users information source agreement or disagreement by users information domain information sub domain user skill level user expertise ratings among other options. According to one embodiment the promotion component accesses available facets of information for validated information to determined a score. In one example the determined score impacts how the validated information is displayed to users.

The promotion component can be configured to re calculate or modify scores responsive to new comments e.g. agree disagree resulting in the promotion or demotion of the validated information within respective results.

According to another embodiment the promotion component can be configured to maintain ratings on users as well as ratings on information. According to one embodiment the promotion component is configured to increase or decrease an expertise score associated with a user within a knowledge domain and or sub domain responsive to a number of validated information objects the user has commented or tagged a number of validated information objects the user has created agreement disagreement from other users use of validated information objects created by the user etc. Expertise scores can be specific to a specific knowledge domain or a knowledge sub domain e.g. APPLE SONY DELL IBM MICROSOFT MAC WINDOWS CISCO networking etc. . In some embodiments the promotion component can be configured to assign skill level and or skill scores to users. In one example skill level and or score is based on user profile information e.g. current job job history publications including for example blogs posts etc and the promotion component calculates a skill level based on the user profile information. In one example the web crawling executed by the system e.g. generation component can also be used to populate user profile information with published articles posts etc.

The promotion component can weight input from different users differently according a stronger weight to input from a domain expert over a user without expertise for example as determined by respective skill level and or expertise score . In addition to updating scoring for information in the knowledge base the promotion component can be configured to update user s expertise scores and or skill level based on respective comments creation and responses to respective validated information and various interactions with the community of users. In further embodiments the promotion component can be configured to add skills to a user profile as their comments and or generation of validate information demonstrates knowledge or expertise in a particular area. The promotion component can also receive aggregate statistics on a user s promotion rates activity etc. and modify expertise scores and or skill levels accordingly. In one embodiment the system can include an analytics component configured to generate statistics on information promotion rates trends in queries and associated problems trends in validated answers comments etc. discussed in greater detail below . For example the promotion component can access statistics generated by the analytic component to modify expertise scores skill level etc.

According to another aspect the promotion component can be configured to incorporate user ratings and information ratings into leaderboards displayed by the system. Leaderboards can be segmented according to knowledge domains e.g. tech support sub domains e.g. MAC WINDOWS ANDROID IPHONE etc. and show top user contributors most prolific commenters taggers top viewed answer e.g. validated information result top community participants top community collaborator hottest new topic and most popular content for a day week month among other options.

According to one embodiment the system is configured to accept user selections within leaderboards enabling filtering and monitoring of specific users e.g. technical support agents tracking of what information those users are commenting on e.g. tagging identify and view similarly commented validated information and or searches. In some embodiments the promotion component is configured to modify validation scores for validated information responsive to users tailored search preferences. For example users can tailor their search preferences based on user they follow on the leaderboards. Users can specify on the system that search results generated in response to their queries should emphasize any validated results associated with followed leaders.

According to some embodiments the system can include information communities. The system can include for example a community component configured to manage the information communities. In some examples the community component is configured to capture information from the user communities and issues are discussed commented on and or resolved through user interaction. In some embodiments users can collaborate within the communities to generate answers to questions. The generated answers and exchanges e.g. comments agreement disagreement etc. can be incorporated in the knowledge base as validated information. In one example the generated answers become searchable on the system as validated information. The answers can be commented on promoted etc. just as any other information in the knowledge base.

In the technical support space for example once validated information has been generated that resolves a particular issue that validated information can be referenced as a potential answer to that particular issue. Promotion scoring e.g. by promotion component of the potential answer and or users associated with it results in the system displaying the highest scored answers to technical problems improving efficiency response time and consistency in resolution. Additionally if better answers are developed for example in the collaboration space of the community promotion scoring elevates the new answers.

In some examples the community component provides access to different areas of the community and can include a separate collaboration space. The collaboration space provides an area for users e.g. technical agents in a community to discuss and ask questions around current technical issues topics of interests and seek out guidance from experts who are skilled in distinct technical arenas. The community component can organize areas within the community and or collaboration space into technical areas broad concepts and or issue specific domains.

In one embodiment the collaboration space is configured to provide an online forum for the agents to ask questions and discuss issues in a traditional format as well as providing for real time interaction e.g. instant message chat video chat voice calls and collaboration services . As discussed any activity from the community and or collaboration space can be added to the system knowledge base. For example once technical issues and questions are discussed and commented on by other agents the potential answer can be automatically captured in as searchable content e.g. validated information .

According to one embodiment the community component is configured to manage an information exchange portion of the community. The information exchange provides an open marketplace for businesses and user e.g. agents who use the system to contract for expert content development and or expertise. In one example the exchange can be accessed as a separate part of the community space hosted by the system e.g. . In other examples the exchange can be integrated into the user communities. For example users associated with a company can access the system to request action by the user community and or specific users. The community component is configured to provide for request submission e.g. wireless network card does not function on newest version of 64 bit Windows 8 . The community component permits requests to be directed generally or targeted to specific users or user e.g. from the leaderboards . Request may specify a reward for finding a solution and may also provide contact information. The community component can be configured to manage communication between responding users and the requestor to defined compensation terms. In another example a company may see that a certain agent is a leader for information on their products. The company can reach out to contract directly for help in creating content for their website by accessing the information exchange.

According to another aspect the system and or engine can include an administration admin component configured to manage user registration. Stated broadly according to some embodiments the admin component can be configured to address system application security and the management of a user s profile and their preferences on how they prefer to use the system and all of its features. In one embodiment the admin component is configured to register users manage user types and permissions e.g. general user technical agent administrative user etc. manage user profiles company affiliation define preferences manage display settings including for example look and feel of the system displays information community etc. among other options.

The admin component is configured to define a unique profile for respective users associated with a username and password. The user profile identifies a respective user e.g. technical agent as they comment and or tag information and search the knowledge based or other sources of information. According to one embodiment the admin component allows users to set information about themselves that will be displayed as part of the system community username avatars industry company area of expertise key skills etc. In one example the users set preferences for searching e.g. the admin component can accept designation of preferred sources of information preferred authors affiliated company date etc. to promote specific results returned from searching browser bar preferences e.g. display position preferences top bottom side display preferences foldering preferences and if they want to be available for real time collaboration in the community.

According to some embodiments the system and or admin component is configured to allow users to capture credibility ratings developed from other sites and information systems e.g. stackoverflow provides for user submission of questions and answers votes received on answers score user responses. to pre set scores associated with any one or more of expertise skill and credibility level. As the users validate information through the system the users scores are dynamically adjusted. For example as user generated answers are promoted the scorings for that user are also recalibrate upward or downward if appropriate .

According to another embodiment the admin component is configured to allow administrative control of user profile information and or settings. In one example a user with administrative privileges can modify settings for company affiliation in one example company affiliation allows for segmentation for reporting and analytics purposes associated users manage which agents are affiliated to which companies through an admin user interface view only access in one example this setting allows for certain users to be set as read only participants within the system and will eliminate or limit ability of a user to validate content e.g. comment agree disagree etc access permission includes controls to completely remove or bar users from the system skill based access in one example the admin component provides controls to limit how a user participates in validating or accessing data setting minimum skill requirements to comment agree disagree curate and wait in one example the admin component provides controls to set criteria for evaluating user content for expert qualification which may include minimum criteria e.g. if user validated information meets the minimum criteria e.g. rating score number of agrees usage minimum etc. the information is displayed in an expert validated or curated section of the system validation level criteria e.g. set criteria for evaluating information according to level expert level validated seeded system generated content and co curation e.g. sets profile information to enable the system to notify a co curator or require approval from the co curator prior to introduction of user content to the system knowledge based this allows expert agents to work with less skilled agents to teach them how to properly validate curate content and write meaningful queries . According to some embodiments the admin component is configured to provide access to any one or more of the preceding settings to customize user interaction with the system.

In one embodiment the admin component enables user to include foldering options in their user profile. The foldering functionality allows users to define personal folders into which validated information can be saved for quick access. In some embodiments the system can provide a favorites folder automatically to preserve a user s most accessed validated information and or a most recently accessed validated information object. The underlying validated information object can be used to store information on how many times it has been save in a personal folder or current saves in a personal folder. The usage information can be rendered in leaderboards for example to suggest the best or hot validated information object based on what other users are selecting. In other examples the analytic component can generate statistics on folders how many times current number of folders in which object saved etc. and that information can be rendered on the leaderboards.

According to another aspect the administration component can also be configured to manage operation of the system and default settings whether the system is implemented as an application browser bar stand alone application distributed application etc. The admin component is configured to register super users who are the administrators of the system and or executing application as opposed to for example administrative users who mange company affiliated users . In one embodiment the super users can configure the system to automatically seed validated content. In one example the system monitors users searching and if the users do not comment tag or endorse the results of their searching the system is configured to automatically provide comments on the results returned to the users and or the results the system infers the user accessed to resolve their issue. For example the admin component can include a seeding module configured to identify content used by users to resolve issues. The seeding component can identify the last accessed information source by a user and validate that information as a seeded validation. In another example in response to user search the seeding module can label each of the accessed results as a potential solution elevating that content above non validated but insuring that subsequent users recognize that any commentary is automated.

Management of the system can also include utilities for controlling relevancy rating management. The rating management functions enable definition of how scores are calculated. For example the rating management functions can define change a number of points awarded per comment submitted on information per new content solutions created by the user agreement comments from other users disagreement comments from other users etc. In one embodiment the admin component is configured to modify scoring rules for information and users. In one example the promotion component can assign points based on number of tags relevance of the tags and or other statistics those points are then fed into the determination of information and or user scores.

Some additional management functions can be implemented by the admin component include archival utilities for archiving of unusable unused content e.g. seeded and validated information and may also include functions for removal of inappropriate content from the knowledge base.

In some embodiments the admin component can include a smart populate module configured to deliver augmented content responsive to user searches. In one example the smart populate module is configured to dynamically crawl additional information source. For example the system analyzes user queries as they are being executed to extract key words and perform dynamic searching based on those key words similar keywords and or related queries. The dynamic searching can be executed on expert domain sites e.g. information sources scored by the system as expert domain validated information sources and other relevant sources from knowledge based to find source content in cases where no validated information matches a search. In another example the smart populate module can crawl information sources including the Internet based on seed lists of known expert sites including for example validated information sources stored on the system to make augmented suggestions when displaying non validated uncurated search results to the end user.

According to another embodiment the system can build and maintain administration libraries that can be accessed by the system and or various components of the system to execute respective functions. According to one embodiment administration libraries can be specific to knowledge domains sub domains information topic etc. The system can maintain and update these domain specific libraries. In one example the libraries are built with a feature set to support technical support space. The system is configured to modify and or update the administration libraries according to user feedback comments received and analyzed on the system. In some examples manual reporting and review can also be incorporated in updating of administration libraries and in other examples through machine learning algorithms. The libraries form one part of the suite of functions configured to analyze information and content to generate augmented information to return to users. In one example the promotion component can access available administration libraries to augment search capabilities skill identification and promotion management and information scoring algorithms.

In some embodiments the administration libraries include at least an ontology and synonym library. The ontology library stores and provides shared vocabularies domain synonyms and unique search terms for example in a technical support space. Each user query and the results generated can be analyzed by the system e.g. based on how well the search terms target the best scored answer for a question to update library information on search terms and synonyms. Further embodiments can also include at least a classification keyword management library. The classification keyword management library is configured to drive faceted and guided search on the system. Each information object e.g. validated information stored on the system can be a data object having a multitude of data facets attributes describing the data object . The facets for the data object can be un structured or structured limiting data objects to system defined facets . In some embodiments the facets and hence structure for data objects can evolve as users interact with system and comment on data.

In another implementation the classification keyword management library is also configured to support auto completion to aid users e.g. agents in creating better queries during search activity. In the technical support space the classification keyword management library develops a unique taxonomy dynamically updated with a real time feedback loop e.g. from user comments and interaction constantly updating the categories facets to assign to data objects and key words to associate with searches based on manual and automated processes.

In other embodiments the administration libraries include at least an expert domain site mapping library. The expert domain site mapping library stores seeded sites and URLs which have been identified as good sources of information. In one example the system can validate sources of information e.g. site web present web domain etc. and those validated sources can be preferred over general search results. The validated seeded information sources can be accessed by other system components for example to help guide directed and dynamic crawls executed by the system e.g. a smart populate module . The validated sites can be associated specific domains on which they have been validated e.g. mobile MAC etc. . The system can access validated sources to augment content delivery for example as seeded content displayed in the seeded section of a user interface. The seeded data can be presented when there are no or little validated data available on the system for that query.

According to other embodiments system can also include an integration component . The integration component can include a variety of APIs configured to integrate system functionality with existing information systems. In one embodiment the integration component enables partners to move data in out of the ANSWR system into their own infrastructure for example to minimize transitions between validated result displays and internal search results of the partner system. Integration between existing information systems and validation system can also reduce dual reporting and data requests through multiple data warehouses in order to analyzing information.

In some examples the integration component provides pre defined integration executables and APIs designed for specific CRM systems used widely in the support space e.g. Salesforce Remedy Microsoft Dynamics among other options . In other examples the integration component provides executables and APIs for CSS systems and other information systems.

The integration with the validation system enables customers to leverage data from their own applications e.g. CRM system and apply that data and any analysis as part of the search augmentation e.g. suggested key words used in searching the validation system knowledge base. In some embodiments data in the partner systems can be captures and directly correlated to information in the knowledge based. In one example the integration component is configured to capture product information from a CRM system s data on consumer interaction. The product information can then be used as search executed on the knowledge based to return validated information matching the product information. The integration component can include APIs and or executables for known support systems as well e.g. Sharepoint .

According to one embodiment the integration component can be configured to provide standardize reporting and analytics across partner system and easily plug into a customer s existing internal data warehouse and reporting infrastructure. For example the integration component is configured with standard APIs which allow customers who are interested in accessing tagged content but not commenting on or curating data themselves to easily access and bring validated content into their own knowledge infrastructures. Various embodiments of system can execute any of the functionality described more generally and need not include the components described to execute the associated functionality.

Shown in is a block diagram of an example architecture of an embodiment of a validation system e.g. system and . System illustrates various technological components that can execute any of the functionality discussed for example with respect to system and . Users are able to interact with system the ANSWR system through the system s user interface UI . The UI can be configured to present a variety of displays for accessing content on the system. In one example the UI can present any one or more of pages for searching at e.g. input queries search terms performing search navigation etc. pages for accessing the system community e.g. at pages for viewing data reporting analytics e.g. at pages for tagging search results e.g. at for example to create validated content. The user can input search queries which can be received by the ANSWR API . The APIs can be configured to execute the search query as a federated search e.g. combining multiple search sources . The federated search can be executed against multiple information sources in one example based on how the user accessed the system.

For example if the user accesses the system through a conventional browser the search will proceed in the browser and through whatever search site the user accessed. The browser may include an ANSWR toolbar configured to capture the search and execute the search against the ANSWR database through the ANSWR search platform in conjunction with the conventional sources and may include other conventional web based sources e.g. GOOGLE BING ALTAVISTA ASK.COM YAHOO etc or in some embodiments any combination of search services . In other embodiments the ANSWR system provides integrated federated search functions as an application executed on the user s computer or accessed on line from the user s computer.

According to one embodiment the ANSWR database serves as a repository of validate information. For example information that has been commented on identified by users as responsive identified as an answer agreed with disagreed with etc. is used by the system as validated information. Based on such endorsements or disparagements the ANSWR system can return augment results to user queries e.g. at . The augmented results can include results returned from conventional searches and sources e.g. . In one example the system can order the returned results to emphasize validated information. Additionally the ANSWR UI allows users to add comments to non validated information to add new content and new information sources to system e.g. at . Users may be given the option to add comment by selecting tags when viewing non validated information e.g. tags for this is the answer agree disagree problem solved etc. In some embodiments user can created validated information from non validated sources clipping portions of a web page into an answer document or validation information object. In one example the system can be configured to capture attribution information from an information source when clipping portions of the displayed information.

In addition to publically accessible information sources system may access information from private or third party sources. For example system can be integrated through a connector framework to other information sources. The connector framework can include specialized APIs for specific known services e.g. Salesforce at connector and or Sharepoint at connector among other examples or more generic APIs that can be configured to integrate third party services with the ANSWR system .

For example the system can execute system generated queries and process the results as seeded data in the knowledge base. The pipeline can also be configured to extracts data URLs or concepts from this organization based information for inclusion in the knowledge base as well as use the extracted data to perform web crawling to find additional source content. The system can also store user queries executed on the ANSWR platform and re execute those queries against others sources to bring in additional information.

The entire knowledge base of validated information or knowledge domains including for example user commented and system seeded data can be accessed by the search platform to return system ranked results. The results can be ranked based on relevancy and system scores. For example relevancy and ranking is determined by the system based on customer scoring algorithms executed by the system. In particular user endorsement can add points to the score for validated information additional user agreement user access user comments can all be associated with for example point values that can be added to the score for respective validated information. Each of the values added can also be weighted based on the users providing the comment or endorsements. User may also be associated with scores and or skill level that influence a weight associated with their activity.

According to one embodiment the search platform can be accessed through the ANSWR API from third party information systems e.g. . The third party systems can execute local applications e.g. to permit integration or can access the application on line. Users on the third party systems can submit queries and receive validated information as results at .

Regardless of how the system is accessed or architected the system can be configured to provide a variety of services. According to one embodiment the system services include logging of search activity. In one example logging of search activity can include storing logged information in association with validated information generated from the search results. Additionally access information can be captured and stored in conjunction with validated information e.g. as summary statistics reflecting use lists of accessing users etc. .

According to another embodiment the system services can also include functions for executing a relevancy management console . The relevancy management console can be configured to tailor scoring of information and or users to implement or adjust system scoring of validated information and thus ordering of results based on the scores. The relevancy management console can be used to define a scoring algorithm and or modify an existing scoring system.

In one embodiment the system services can also include admin functions .

Various embodiments of a validation system including for example can execute a variety of processes to implement the functions discussed and in particular to return validated information as results to user queries. Shown in is an example process flow for delivering curated validated and uncurated non validated data responsive to user searches. At system libraries within the system knowledge base are accessed to match search queries. The system s relevancy scoring algorithm will be used to set the ordering of the results returned e.g. from the system libraries at . The system can provide relevancy rankings within validated data results as well as provide ranking between validated data and non validated data results. For example search results generated can include results drawn from smart populated processing at .

According to some embodiments smart populate processing can include directed crawl operations e.g. at B where the system automatically crawls for example web resources based on seed lists of expert sites. Results returned from directed crawl activity can be promoted over non validated results for example as part of . Additionally smart populated processing can include dynamic crawl operations e.g. at A where the user queries are captured in real time to extract keywords which are used to execute searches on those keywords on web resources expert domain sites and other relevant sources stored for example in administration libraries. Results from the smart populate processing can be included in results sets as uncurated or non validate data at which can be combined with curated or validated data from for display as a complete result set at . For example users may access a search and display interface to input query terms and received curated and non curated results in response.

Process may continue with users rating the results shown or tagging the results as relevant solving the question etc.

Various embodiments of a validation system including for example can execute a variety of processes to implement the functions discussed and in particular to return validated information as results to user queries. Shown in is an example process flow for delivering curated validated as part of sets of results returns to user queries. According to some embodiments the process can be executed by a local browser plug in and or browser bar executing on a user s computer system. Process can begin at with a user e.g. a technical support agent opening up a browser running on a respective computer system. At the search bar e.g. browser tool bar is displayed as part of whatever browser search tool the user prefers. In some embodiment the search bar can be integrated with third party information systems e.g. CRM systems CSS system etc. and native search tools can include tool bar displays for accessing search functionality for returning validated search results.

Process continues at with the user executing a search for example in the browser via a search site tool via NO or for example in browser bar via YES. In some embodiments regardless of whether the user executes the search in the browser process includes capturing and executing of the search against validation information. According to some implementations searches are co executed against validated and non validated information sources e.g. at and .

If validated results are found YES process continues with the display of the highest scored validated results at . According to one embodiment as part of displaying validated results the validated results are displayed as drop down from the browser bar to provide a visual indication that the results are sources from the validated knowledge base e.g. at . The validated results may be displayed above non validated results e.g. at . At the user e.g. agent selects from among the displayed results. For example if the user selects from validated results a validated result is displayed at . According to some embodiments the validated results are each developed through respective user collection of information into potential answers or resolutions of technical support issues. The answer objects can be scored and returned in response to user queries where subsequent users can add their own tags e.g. agree disagree resolved my problem etc. rate the answer object which updates system scoring of the respective result. The system dynamically scores validated information for example based on usage and or user comments. In some examples the dynamic scoring is used by the system to order returned results.

Optionally at the browser bar is still available to return to the list of validated results allowing the user to select different results from the list of validated information results. Additional options can include functions for switching between validated results accessing new result categories user community user preferences and or adding a result to a stored list of results.

According to some embodiments process proceeds at if no validated information matches the executed search NO . At the user can select from a list of non validated information sources. At the browser bar provides a tagging display shown to the user in conjunction with a selected non validated result. If user believes the viewed result provides a solution to their current issue the user can select the entire result or portions of the result to tag for inclusion into an answer object at . In one example the generation of answer object creates validated information stored in the system knowledge base.

Once the user selects information to include as validated information a validated information display can be shown at . The user captured content and any additional user input e.g. notes tags rating etc. can be stored as validated information at part of . Optionally the user may select and include additional information e.g. from other non validated source in the validate page as part of an edit mode. Once the user has completed their validated information page process can conclude at . For example process can conclude once a user has created validated information e.g. an answer object or in another example once the user has reviewed a validated result that the user can use for answering their inquiry. In some embodiments once a user has reviewed a validated result that solved their problem the user can add their own comments insert new content into the answer object among other options. In further examples the reviewing user at can rate the result and or tag the results as a valid response to the user s query.

According to other embodiments any non validated result can be validated based on user input further users can add comments and or tags to validated results each option can be stored on the system to augment knowledge base.

Shown in is an example process for creating validated information and in particular an answer object. According to one embodiment process beings at with a user reviewing non validated information for example from a set of search results. Once the user has found a solution to their inquiry the user can tag the result at to create validated information which can be referenced in the technical support as an answer object. In one embodiment the user tags the result by selecting content within the displayed information e.g. click and drag on portions of the information source copy and paste etc. . The user then selects a tag function displayed on their respective computer system. Responsive to selection of the tag function a tagging window can be displayed requesting the user input a title. In one example the input title can be stored as the title of the answer object being created. In another embodiment the title can be suggested to the user for confirmation. The system may extract concepts from the information source from the search terms that generated the information source as a result among other options. Once a portion of content has been selected and given a title it can be saved as validated information including for example an answer object e.g. at below .

According to one embodiment the answer object is intended to capture the best answer to a particular problem. The system can accomplish development of the best answer via continued generation of other user objects comments agreeing with the user s solution and or usage of the user s solution. In some examples a validation system e.g. and captures access information of other users search to infer that the last accessed result e.g. the answer object solved the user s problem. Inferential determinations can be made when the subsequent user s fail to tag rate or comment on the answer object.

In some embodiments the user can capture information from multiple sources at tagging portions or the entirety of one or more sources of information e.g. web pages blog posts etc. . In some embodiments the user can build a complete answer object by accessing capturing and tagging information from any number of sources.

Once the user has completed assembly and or editing of their validated information for example the answer object the answer object is stored at . In one embodiment responsive to selecting information content the user is presented with a tagging display. The tagging display can request user input on a title and provide the user the opportunity to save the tagged information and title or cancel the request. According to some embodiments storage of the validated information answer object can include capture of the user s search activity. For example the user s search terms can be captured at and associated with a respective answer object. As part of the creation of the answer object the user may define a general question that is being answered by the object. Any user defined question can be captured at for example as a title entered in the tagging display. In other embodiments a title or question to be answered can be created automatically from the user s search activity. Search terms search synonyms etc. can be extracted from for example user queries and used to create the title for the answer object.

According to some implementations answer objects are associated with the search terms and or search activity that returned an associated information source as a search result. In other examples the search terms can be processed to define concepts and or topics associated with the answer object. At YES other answer objects can be associated with a newly created answer object based on a match between any one or more of concept topic search terms synonyms search activity etc. If no matching answer objects are found NO process can terminate at .

If there are matching answer objects process can conclude with optional step with storing any relationship between the objects. Step may also include an ordering of the related objects based for example on scoring of the answer object. As discussed above scoring of validated information and for example an answer objects can be based on a variety of criteria. In one example an answer object can be given a baseline score which is adjusted upward or downward. In some examples the baseline score can be adjusted upward or downward based on the user creating the answer object. If the originator is a recognized expert user the baseline score can be adjusted upward according. Novice users can result in no adjustment or a downward adjustment. In other embodiments subsequent access to the answer object causes the scoring to increase or decrease. User comments received in agreement with the answer object increase the scoring and user comments disagreeing can reduce the scoring.

At a current score including for example a baseline score for the validated information is adjusted. For example the baseline score for an answer object can be adjusted upward as users agree or rate the answer object highly. In another example the current score for the validated information can be adjusted downward based on low ratings or disagreement from other users. According to some embodiments scores can also be adjusted based on disuse. For example if an answer object is not accessed within a pre defined period of time e.g. a month the answer object s score can be reduced. This automatically demotes results that are not being used. In another example disuse adjustments can be limited to reducing the score to a baseline score. Likewise usage information can be used to adjust scores upward even when users do not tag the validated information.

User feedback and use information can also be incorporated into user scoring as well as scores for validated information. At the user feedback e.g. agree disagree rating etc. is captured to adjust a score associated with the user who generated the answer object being commented on. Similar to validation scores each user can start with a baseline user score that is adjusted upwards or downwards responsive to their contributions and other users feedback on the same. According to some embodiments a user s baseline score can also be modified based on their experience any expertise company affiliation other system expertise scores e.g. stackoverflow among other options. In one embodiment the commenting user s score is increased based having commented at . Additionally the user score for the generator of the answer object is also adjusted.

According to one embodiment process can end at . In other embodiments process can be executed continuously as validated information is accessed commented used etc. Both scores for validated information and users can continuously evolve providing for dynamically evolution of a best answer and leading users.

Shown in is an example embodiment of a user interface for searching validated results. According to one embodiment a web browser e.g. the known browser CHROME is augmented by validated search functionality. The augmented search functionality can include a new browser tool bar at . In some embodiments the browser tool bar can remain visualized whenever the underlying browser application is running. In other embodiments the browser tool bar can be visualized responsive to the access of search functionality. In one example access to a search engine e.g. the known GOOGLE search engine results in visualization of the browser tool bar . The tool bar can include functions for tagging results e.g. delivered in response to an input search where the search is entered at or . User can also access folders or saved answers at My Answers. The my answers function at can be configured to transition to a display of saved answers and or user created answers. In one embodiment a user can access and see how well any answer objects they created are performing how they are ranked and what comments are being received among other options. In other embodiments can be configured to take a user to an answer management console where favorite answer objects e.g. answers saved by the user most accessed answers saved answers can be displayed with or without answer objects generated by the user.

According to some embodiments the user interface can also include functionality e.g. Community at for accessing user communities of a validation system. The community function can be configured to transition the web browser to a community interface. In one embodiment the transition can be tailored to a current user context so that the community interface displayed is targeted to an information domain e.g. search concept problem problem topic among other options for example captured from any existing search terms.

The tool bar can also include functions for accessing a user profile on a validation system e.g. . A user may update their information their experience job history publications etc. and stored that information as part of their profile. In some embodiments a user can specify search preferences in their profile. For example a user can identify one or more users to promote. Search results delivered will be weighted to favor such identified users. For example validated information generated by a preferred user can be returned as the top results of a search. In other examples promotion scoring of information can be customized by user preference weighting scorings to favor preferred users and thus promoting those respective results.

Shown in is example embodiment of a user interface presented by a validation system. The user s search terms can be displayed at including drop down selection of complete queries. In some embodiments search synonyms related query terms etc. can be determined from administrative libraries available on the validation system. Library based suggestion can be incorporated at for example instead of suggestions that would be provided by a conventional search engine. At results from searching performed on validation information are displayed. In one example the display at can be shown in real time thus the incomplete terms network solut B may not provide results.

According to one embodiment a knowledge base associated with a validation system can include seeded results. The seeded results can be incorporated in a displayed set of results for example at . In some embodiments responsive to not finding validated results seeded results are displayed. In further examples the seeded results can be incorporated into validated results shown in interface . According to one embodiment validated results are shown preferentially in the user interface appearing at the top of the display of results. In another embodiment validated results are shown at the top of the user interface followed by seeded results and then by non validated results e.g. . Non validated results can be shown as they would be presented in their respective search system. According to other embodiments where multiple search sources are used e.g. GOOGLE BING YAHOO etc. the non validated results from each source can be interleaved to present the highest scored results from each respective source towards the top of the list of results. In further examples duplicate responses received within the non validated results can be eliminated.

Shown in is an example embodiment of a user interface . User interface can be displayed by a validation system for example as part of displaying a validated information result. The validated information results can include a title for the validated information. For example the title can reflect a question answered by the validated information. In the technical support setting the tile can reflect the technical support question resolved by the validated information or answer object. As discussed the title can be generated automatically and or input by a user creating for example an answer object. At source content providing information on the answer and or problem is presented as part of the display of the validated information including for example answer objects . The source content can be captured by a user for example reviewing non validated information. The user can select one or more portions of information or the entirety of an information source they deem relevant to their answer. According to one embodiment each display of validated information can include source information e.g. at . The source information can include a source url at a link to the original article at and an identification of the user who created the validated information at . In some embodiments where the validating information is sources from multiple locations respective sources and links can be displayed for example at .

According to some embodiments displays of validated information are configured to accept reviewing user s input. In some examples input can include tags by the user e.g. agree disagree resolves my problem etc. . In further examples input from users can include explicit rating functions e.g. where users provide input on a subjective score to assign to the validated information.

Users can also enter notes and or tips associated with the validated information. At system rated top tips can be displayed with the validated information as well as tools for entering new notes . If the user wishes to review additional results from the validate information the user may select next e.g. at . In some embodiments a user can cause the system to transition from a validated information display to a system community e.g. at . User can discuss chat and or evaluated validated information in the context of a user community. In some embodiments various user communities can exist where respective communities are direct to certain concepts issues problems etc. Selection of community at can include capture of a user s current context so that a user can be transitioned into a community matching their current context.

Shown in is an example embodiment of a user interface . Responsive to highlighting a portion of a non validated information source at and selecting tag e.g. the user interface presents a tagging display . The tagging display can provide a text box for inputting a title at . In some examples a validation system can suggest a title based on extracted concepts an extracted title search terms etc. and the user can approved or edit the suggested title. At the display includes a text input box for adding notes. Once the user has input at least the title the user can save the now validated information by selecting Add Tag. In some embodiments the highlighted portion is now saved as a searchable object in conjunction with information on the user who created the validated information. The searchable object can also be assigned a validation score. If the user does not wish to save the object or make changes the user can select cancel at .

In one embodiment the validation score can be determined based at least in part on the user who created the object. In another embodiment the source from which the information object was generated can be used as part of a determination of a validation score. In some examples the object can be assigned a baseline score. In further examples the baseline score can be modified based on the generating user the information source etc. As discussed above subsequent access the object can be used by a validation system to modify the scored associated with the object.

According to one embodiment a validation system can be implemented to service technical support workers and or integrate with existing knowledge management systems. In one example the validation system provides significant enhance over conventional approaches e.g. GOOGLE based search . According to one embodiment validated results which have been determined by one or more users to provide a valid answer to a problem are returned in conjunction with conventional search. The technical support worker does not need to do anything different to see new validate results. In one example the system captures search terms entered into GOOGLE and co executes the search against validated information. By promoting validated results research time by the technical support worker is reduced. Further first call resolution rates are increased for example by providing answers that have already been used.
