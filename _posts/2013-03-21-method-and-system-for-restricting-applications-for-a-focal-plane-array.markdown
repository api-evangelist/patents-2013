This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 616 612 filed Mar. 28 2012 entitled METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR RESTRICTING APPLICATIONS FOR A FOCAL PLANE ARRAY and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 616 606 filed Mar. 28 2012 entitled METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR RESTRICTING APPLICATIONS FOR A THERMAL CAMERA each of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.

The embodiments described herein relate generally to thermal imaging systems. More particularly the embodiments relate to disabling a thermal imaging device based on detecting one or more shock pulse events.

All objects emit infrared radiation IR as a function of their temperature. Thermal imaging systems also referred to as thermal cameras or infrared cameras are devices that generate images or video based on infrared radiation. Using IR detectors radiation can be collected and used to generate the thermal imaging data. Thermal imaging systems can include for example a thermal camera and an uncooled infrared focal plane array FPA . A few examples of the many applications for infrared FPAs include missile or related weapons guidance sensors infrared astronomy weapon targeting home inspection thermography security and surveillance automotive object avoidance manufacturing inspection medical imaging and infrared phenomenology such as observing combustion weapon impact rocket motor ignition or other events that are interesting in the infrared spectrum .

Under current United States federal regulations the export of uncooled FPAs as well as other thermal imaging devices has been tightly controlled based in part on concerns related to the use of such FPAs in thermal weapons sights. In order to prevent the export of thermal imaging systems that could be incorporated into thermal weapons systems by foreign entities the export of cameras that incorporate FPAs has accordingly been controlled.

The techniques described herein relate to restricting the applications or activities in which a thermal imaging system can be employed. Merely by way of example the methods systems and apparatuses described herein have been applied to disabling thermal image or video output data from a thermal imaging device in response to detecting one or more acceleration events associated with one or more shock pulses. Although some embodiments relate to disabling functionality of a thermal imaging device when used for applications involving weapons systems skilled artisans will recognize that the techniques described herein have much broader applicability.

According to one embodiment an infrared FPA integrated with one or more accelerometers in a thermal imaging system is provided. The thermal imaging system includes a processor and a detector circuit coupled with the processor to detect acceleration events associated with one or more of the accelerometers.

A counter can also be provided to track the number of detected acceleration events and to initiate the disabling of the thermal imaging system when a predetermined number of acceleration events have been detected. In one embodiment the thermal imaging system can be disabled by blocking one or more output signals of the thermal imager or FPA. In other embodiments the thermal imager or FPA can be prevented from generating a useable output signal in the first place. The thermal imaging system may also disable its output at other points in the signal path as would be well understood by persons of skill in the art.

In yet other embodiments a method of disabling a FPA integrated with one or more accelerometers in a thermal imaging system is provided. The method includes detecting a first acceleration event associated with one or more of the accelerometers determining that the first acceleration event exceeds a first predetermined threshold and storing information related to the first acceleration event in a memory. The method further includes detecting a second acceleration event associated with one or more of the accelerometers determining that the second acceleration event exceeds a second predetermined threshold and disabling the FPA in response to the first acceleration event and the second acceleration event. In one embodiment the first predetermined threshold and the second predetermined threshold can have the same value. In other embodiments they can differ as the case may be. In any case the method includes a tracking the number of detected acceleration events and disabling the FPA or thermal imager when a predetermined number of acceleration events have been detected.

According to other embodiments a FPA system is provided that includes a MEMS based microbolometer device coupled with a MEMS based accelerometer device.

The method also includes determining that the acceleration event exceeds a predetermined threshold and disabling the thermal imaging device in response to the acceleration event exceeding the predetermined threshold.

According to a specific embodiment of the present invention a thermal imaging system is provided. The thermal imaging system includes a thermal camera and a plurality of accelerometers mechanically coupled with the thermal camera.

Numerous benefits are achieved by way of these techniques over conventional methods. For example embodiments are adapted to prevent the use of thermal imaging systems in weapons related activities or applications. This enables such a thermal imaging system to be employed in a wide variety of commercial applications while preventing undesirable use of these devices.

These and other details of embodiments along with many of their advantages and features are described in the following description claims and figures.

Throughout this description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form to avoid obscuring the underlying principles of the described embodiments.

The systems and methods introduced herein are adapted to provide a thermal imaging system. The thermal imaging system includes a processor and a detector circuit coupled with the processor to detect acceleration signals or events associated with one or more accelerometers. In other embodiments the processor can be used to perform the detecting function or the detector circuit can be built into the processor. The thermal imaging system includes a memory adapted to store information related to the acceleration events and a comparison circuit operable to determine whether each acceleration event compares to or exceeds a predetermined threshold by comparing each detected acceleration event with a predetermined signal or threshold value stored in memory. The threshold value may be one of amplitude intensity or duration of the detected acceleration event or any combination of these. The thermal imaging system also includes a disable circuit adapted to disable the thermal imaging system in response to detecting one or more acceleration events that compare to or exceed one or more predetermined thresholds. This can be accomplished using a counter to track the number of detected acceleration events and to disable the thermal imaging system when a predetermined number of acceleration events have been detected.

In one embodiment the thermal imaging system can be disabled by blocking one or more output signals of the thermal imager or FPA. In other embodiments the thermal imager or FPA can be prevented from generating a useable output signal in the first place. For example the thermal imager a logic value in the thermal imager or FPA can be reset such that it deactivates the video functionality in a semi permanent way. Thus the thermal imager or FPA would have to be reprogrammed to switch back the logic value to allow for normal operation to continue. The thermal imager or FPA can be implemented any number of ways that are well known in the art such as for example a Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA programmable logic device PLD applications specific integrated circuit ASIC system on a chip SoC custom circuitry or any combinations or equivalents thereof. Persons of skill in the art would appreciate that any number of different logic arrangements can be provided to accomplish the disabling of the thermal imager or FPA devices.

In yet other embodiments a method of disabling an infrared FPA integrated with one or more accelerometers in a thermal imaging system is provided. The method includes detecting a first acceleration event associated with one or more of the accelerometers determining that the first acceleration event exceeds a first predetermined threshold and storing information related to the first acceleration event in a memory. The method further includes detecting a second acceleration event associated with one or more of the accelerometers determining that the second acceleration event exceeds a second predetermined threshold and disabling the FPA in response to the first acceleration event and the second acceleration event. In one embodiment the first predetermined threshold and the second predetermined threshold can have the same value. In other embodiments they can differ as the case may be. In any case the method can further include tracking the number of detected acceleration events and disabling the FPA or thermal imager when a predetermined number of acceleration events have been detected.

As used herein a shock pulse or shock wave is a type of propagating disturbance. Like an ordinary wave it carries energy and can propagate through a medium or an electromagnetic field. Shock waves are characterized by an abrupt nearly discontinuous change in the characteristics of the medium. Across a shock pulse there is an extremely rapid rise in pressure temperature and density. A shock pulse travels through most media at a higher speed than an ordinary wave but the energy of a shock wave dissipates relatively quickly with distance. Thus a shock wave can be detected by circuitry adapted to detect a rapid rise in pressure temperature or acceleration or any combination of these. For instance a shock pulse can be detected using an accelerometer. As used herein an accelerometer is a device that measures acceleration. The acceleration measured by an accelerometer is not necessarily the rate of change of velocity in a coordinate system. Instead an accelerometer measures the acceleration associated with the phenomenon of weight experienced by any mass at rest in the frame of reference of the accelerometer device. For example an accelerometer at rest on the surface of the earth will measure an acceleration of 1 g 9.81 m sstraight upwards due to its weight. By contrast accelerometers in free fall or at rest in outer space will measure zero. Accelerometers have multiple applications in industry and science.

The firing of the gun produces an acceleration in a direction substantially parallel to the muzzle of the gun. It also produces an acceleration in the other axes. For a gun sight mounted on the gun and having an imaging device such as an FPA oriented with the imaging surface normal to the muzzle of the gun the acceleration detected would be in a direction substantially normal to the imaging device. Since the firing of a gun produces an acceleration in the other axes as well those could also be detected and could be useful in disabling the thermal imager. Although some implementations are discussed in terms of preventing use of a thermal imager in a thermal sight in which the imaging plane of the thermal imager is normal to the optical axis of the thermal sight embodiments are not limited to this particular implementation. In other embodiments the use of a thermal imager could be prevented in thermal sights having folding optics which are utilized to redirect the optical axis along a direction not aligned with the gun muzzle for example at a right angle to the gun muzzle. depicts an empirical graph of acceleration versus time for an observed shock pulse event according to one example embodiment. Here the shock pulse waveform is overlaid onto an observed shock pulse in experimental testing. As can be seen the shock pulse has a very high very short acceleration profile.

According to at least certain embodiments methods and systems are utilized to prevent the use of FPAs in applications related to weapons systems. Utilizing the methods and systems described herein FPAs can be rendered inoperative when utilized in conjunction with firing a weapon of some sort based on detecting shock pulses emitted from the muzzle of a weapon during firing. As an example embodiments can be utilized to disable an imaging system in response to detection of one or more shock pulses from a gunshot or similar discharge from a weapon system of some other type. This enables use of FPAs in a variety of commercial applications that pose limited or no military threat.

In various embodiments outputs from one of the accelerometers from the set of accelerometers are utilized in determining whether there is a gunfire event occurring in the vicinity of the thermal imaging system and thereafter disabling it. In some implementations a predetermined number of gunfire events e.g. gunshots are allowed to occur before the thermal imaging system is disabled. Thus the use of the thermal imaging system is restricted to applications or activities that are not related to operation of a firearm or other weapons system.

The thermal imager can be an infrared sensor such as in a SD thermal camera or in a high definition HD thermal camera or other suitable thermal imager or thermal imaging system. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations modifications and alternatives. The system also includes a processor coupled with a memory . The processor can be any processor configurable to perform the operations described herein. The processor executes instructions and includes that portion of the system that controls the operation of components of the system. Although not depicted in the processor typically includes a control unit configured to organize data and code in the memory and also to transfers data and other information between the various parts of the system . The processor receives input data from system components including the one or more accelerometers and the thermal imager and reads from stored data and code in memory . In some implementations the processor is in communication with a network to receive data and provide data to the external processors including computers.

In addition system includes one or more circuits not shown adapted to detect a shock pulse event as well as one or more circuits for comparing the shock pulse characteristics to certain thresholds. For instance the amplitude of a shock pulse event can be compared to an amplitude value stored in memory using the comparison circuit. The detection and comparison circuits are not shown in but can be located with the set of accelerometers or within processor or other parts of the systems as would be well understood by persons of skill in the art.

Although the system is shown to contain only a single processor the disclosed embodiment applies equally to systems that may have multiple processors. It will be evident to one of skill in the art that the various functions performed by the processors described herein can be performed by a single processor multiple processors or combinations thereof. In some embodiments the processing of data including data measured using the accelerometers may be carried out using dedicated hardware such as an application specific integrated circuit ASIC . In yet other embodiments the processing may be carried out using a combination of software and hardware. As an example such processors include dedicated circuitry ASICs combinatorial logic other programmable processors combinations thereof or the like. Thus processors as provided herein are defined broadly and include processors adapted to receive and process accelerometer data store and output results perform communications functions or other functionality described herein.

The memory represents one or more mechanisms for storing data. For example the memory also referred to as a storage device may include read only memory ROM random access memory RAM magnetic disk storage media optical storage media flash memory devices or any other appropriate computer readable media. Any appropriate type of storage device may be used. Although only one memory is shown multiple storage devices and multiple types of storage devices may be utilized. Further although the system is illustrated as containing the memory it may be distributed across one or more other systems or networks. For example memory can be located remotely on a server or in a cloud based computing solution.

The processor and memory are utilized in some embodiments to receive process and store data obtained from the thermal imager or one or more of the accelerometers and . In an embodiment the processor receives data from all three accelerometers and processes the data to determine that an acceleration event has occurred. As an example processor can be configured to sense a shock pulse from gun fire. After a number of shock pulses exceeding a predetermined threshold number of pulses the processor can disable the thermal imager functionality thus rendering a thermal weapons sight utilizing the thermal imager inoperable. The processor may contain a disable circuit or can execute code from memory to perform the disabling of the thermal imaging system . Accordingly embodiments may enable thermal imaging systems to be exported overseas since their use is prevented in weapons based applications. The system also includes an input output module that provides for control of the system as well as for communication of data obtained by the system with external processor computers communications systems a network which may be the Internet or the like.

FPA can be an infrared microbolometer or other suitable thermal imagers or imaging systems. A microbolometer is a specific type of bolometer used as a detector in a thermal camera. Infrared radiation strikes the detector material in the microbolometer heating it and changing its electrical resistance which change is measured and processed into voltages which can be used to create an image. Unlike other types of infrared detecting equipment microbolometers do not require cooling. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations modifications and alternatives. In one particular embodiment the microbolometer device may include an uncooled VOx detector array that is responsive to radiation between 8 m and 14 m.

The system also includes a processor and a memory as discussed above with respect to . Processor and memory may be utilized to receive process and store data obtained from the FPA or one or more of the accelerometers . In one embodiment processor receives data from all three accelerometers and processes it to determine whether an acceleration event has occurred that could be associated with firing of a weapon or weapons system in the near vicinity to the thermal imaging system . As an example the processor can sense the shock pulse from gun fire and after a number of pulses exceeding a threshold disable the FPA functionality thus rendering a thermal weapons sight utilizing the thermal imager inoperable. Accordingly embodiments may enable systems including FPAs to be exported overseas since their use in weapons based activities is prevented by the circuitry described herein.

Upon determining that the system is being used in one of these applications the FPA can be rendered inoperative for example by blocking its output video signal not shown . In other embodiments the FPA can be disabled by biasing one or more of its electrodes in such a manner as to prevent the FPA from generating a useable output signal. The number of shock pulses can be counted using for example a counter circuit not shown . Once a predetermined number of shock pulses has been detected that are likely to have originated from a weapons related activity the counter circuit can output a signal to a disable circuit not shown adapted to disable the FPA . The counter circuit and disable circuit can be located within processor or can be located in other portions of the thermal imaging system as would be well known by persons of skill in the art.

In some embodiments the one or more accelerometers can be integrated on the same integrated circuit die as the infrared image device FPA whereas in other embodiments the accelerometers can be discrete components coupled with the FPA through one or more intermediate circuits. In embodiments in which the accelerometers and FPA are integrated on a single integrated circuit die they can be integrated using a micro electro mechanical systems MEMS process along with MEMS based accelerometers to provide shock pulse measurements in three axes using a compatible process for both elements. In some embodiments disabling of the FPA can be performed by biasing one or more electrodes of the FPA to prevent it from producing a useable output signal. Thus some embodiments prevent the FPA from producing an output signal as a supplement to or in place of blocking the output video signal.

Data from both the FPA and the accelerometers can also be utilized to reduce false alarms associated with shock pulse acceleration events. As an example if the FPA has been turned off for a predetermined period of time preceding a detected acceleration event then it is likely that the acceleration event is not associated with firing of a weapon but instead is more likely to be associated with dropping of the FPA or other activity unrelated to use in a thermal weapons sight. The counter circuit discussed above or the memory or combination of a counter and memory can be used to track the number of shock pulses detected. Once a certain predetermined number of shock pulse events have occurred that exceed the relevant thresholds thermal imaging functionality can be disabled. In one implementation the imaging functions are disabled by disabling the output video signal so that the imaging system only produced a gray screen image. Embodiments are applicable to both video and still imaging systems.

Further the accelerometers can be used to determine whether the system has been tampered with or otherwise compromised and can enable the system to be disabled as a result. If one of the accelerometers becomes disabled such a modification could be detected since normally there is 1 g of acceleration on the camera as a result of gravity and each accelerometer would detect a change in the 1 g acceleration should the accelerometers be tampered with. In addition a three axis accelerometer integrated with the FPA can be used. Such a three axis accelerometer enables measuring the acceleration at each accelerometer and then comparing those measurements to the measurements of acceleration in other directions from the other two accelerometers. Additionally periodic checks of the accelerometer system can also be performed to verify that the system is working properly and provide accurate and correct data to the processor.
