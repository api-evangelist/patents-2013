The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The present invention relates generally to munitions and more particularly to a warhead case and method for making the same.

Artillery such as tanks cannons and the like typically fire a warhead through a barrel and towards a target by using an explosive charge in the barrel. The artillery warhead is generally cylindrical in shape having a smaller diameter tapered nose at its front end.

The warhead itself includes an outer shell case which defines the overall outer shape of the warhead. The case however forms a hollow interior which is at least partially filled with an explosive charge. Upon impact of the warhead against the target with sufficient velocity the shockwaves created by the impact of the warhead on the target are sufficient to detonate its explosive charge. Alternatively a fusing mechanism may be used to initiate the detonation chain.

The previously known warhead cases have been typically constructed of a metal such as steel which is sufficiently thin that the case will fragment into shrapnel upon impact and detonation with its target. These previously known cases for warheads however have all suffered some common disadvantages.

For example in many situations such as where the warhead is used in an urban environment it is highly desirable that the explosive blast upon detonation of the warhead is directed forwardly of the warhead rather than laterally. Such forward concentration of the force not only maximizes damage to the target but also limits collateral damage that could otherwise result from lateral shrapnel.

The previously known warhead cases constructed of metal such as steel fail to adequately shape or direct the force of the warhead upon detonation in the forward direction. As such when the warhead case breaks into many parts upon detonation of the warhead shrapnel from the fractured warhead case extends not only forwardly but also laterally of the warhead.

A still further disadvantage of these previously known warhead cases is that such warhead cases fail to meet the insensitive munitions requirements because such warheads lack venting capability. Although there have been prior attempts to vent the warhead to prevent detonation of the warhead in the event of an unintended puncture of the warhead through scoring liners and venting mechanisms these attempts have not proven wholly satisfactory. Furthermore unless properly vented upon unintended puncture e.g. impact from shrapnel or other projectile the resulting heat and pressure buildup within the interior of the warhead case may be sufficient to detonate the warhead.

The present invention provides a warhead case which overcomes the above mentioned disadvantages of the previously known warhead cases.

In brief the warhead case of the present invention is constructed by braiding a plurality of elongated wires together into a mesh. The mesh itself is in the shape corresponding to the shape of the warhead case.

After forming the mesh into the shape of the warhead case the mesh is then impregnated with a polymer matrix which upon curing preferably through a thermal curing process forms a rigid warhead case with a hollow interior. The hollow interior is at least partially filled with an explosive charge in the conventional fashion.

Alternatively the mesh is first impregnated with a polymer matrix and then formed into the shape of the warhead case using any conventional shaping process such as a die and press. Furthermore any conventional polymer may be used provided that the strength of the warhead case i.e. the polymer impregnated mesh after curing is sufficient to survive launch of the warhead.

The wires also include a plurality of notches at predetermined locations. Each notch is preferably formed by punching the wire with a chisel which embrittles the wire in the area around the notch. Consequently upon detonation of the warhead the wires will break into segments in the area around the notches. This achieves two important advantages.

First by varying the density of the notches in the mesh depending upon the location along the length of the warhead the notches can shape the direction of the blast caused by detonation of the warhead. For example by providing a high density of notches along the front or nose of the warhead and a lesser density of notches along the base and mid portion of the warhead the higher density of notches in the nose area of the warhead will fracture first causing the blast to be concentrated in the forward direction of the warhead.

Secondly the notches define the shape and size of the shrapnel caused upon detonation of the warhead.

With reference first to a warhead according to the present invention is illustrated and is either of the type shot by artillery such as cannons tanks and the like or the type propelled by rocket motors. The warhead itself is generally cylindrical in shape at its base and tapers to a reduced diameter nose at its forward end. When fired by an explosive charge through a barrel the warhead travels at least initially in the direction of arrow . Still referring to the warhead includes an outer warhead case which forms the outer surface of the warhead and thus the overall shape of the warhead . The warhead case however includes an open interior which is at least partially filled by an explosive charge . Upon impact of the warhead at sufficient velocity the shockwaves caused by the impact of the warhead against the target detonates the explosive charge in the well known fashion or the warhead is detonated by a fusing mechanism.

With reference now to unlike the previously known warhead cases the warhead case of the present invention is constructed from a wire mesh constructed by braiding a plurality of wires woven and or braided together to form the mesh. Preferably the wires do not extend the entire distance from the nose of the warhead and to its base . Instead a plurality of shorter wire segments are braided or woven together to form the mesh with the number of wires decreasing from the base to the nose to accommodate the decreasing outer circumference of the case . illustrates how two wires may be woven or braided together to form the mesh.

The wire mesh may be formed into the shape of the warhead case in any conventional manner. For example the wire mesh may be woven into the shape of the warhead case . Alternatively the wire mesh may be woven into a flat or semi flat sheet and then formed into the shape of the warhead case using conventional shaping methods such as a punch and die. Other shaping methods may also be used.

The wire for example wire which form the mesh may be constructed of any strong dense material. However preferably the wires forming the mesh are constructed of metal such as steel.

With reference now to many if not all of the wires which form the mesh contain notches at spaced intervals along their length. These notches are preferably formed by impacting a punch against the wire to form the notch in the desired location. The use of a punch work hardens the metal wire around the notch which makes the material of the wire around the notch more brittle as well as reducing the cross sectional area of the wire at the notch . Both the reduction in the cross sectional area as well as an increase in the brittleness of the wire around the notch increases the likelihood that upon detonation of the warhead the wire will fracture at or near the notch rather than at random spots along the length of the wire .

Other methods may alternatively be used to control the fracture location for the wires upon detonation. For example the wires may be scored or punched around a portion or all of the circumference of the wire to create a fracture location.

The ability to set and control the point of fracture of the wires forming the mesh forms two important functions. First by varying the density of the notches in the mesh the shape or direction of blast of the warhead upon detonation may be controlled. For example increasing the density of the notches in the mesh around the nose of the warhead as compared with the density of the notches around the base of the warhead causes the warhead case to fracture more readily at its nose than its base upon impact. Consequently the force occurring from the resulting detonation is directed largely in a forward direction i.e. in the direction of arrow . Secondly by controlling the positions of the notches in the wires the size of shrapnel created during the detonation from the wire pieces may be controlled so that different shrapnel sizes may be used for different applications.

With reference particularly to preferably adjacent wires in the mesh are braided together so that the wires are entwined but still extend in a generally axial direction i.e. the direction of arrow . Such a construction improves the aerodynamic characteristics of the warhead and reduces possible tumbling.

After the mesh has been shaped into the shape of the warhead case with the density of the notches arranged as desired the entire mesh is impregnated with a polymer matrix. Once set the polymer matrix together with the mesh form the rigid structure for the warhead case and are together sufficiently stiff and strong to sustain the forces the warhead is subjected to during launch.

Although the mesh is preferably first formed into the shape of the warhead case and then impregnated with the polymer matrix alternatively the mesh is first impregnated with the polymer matrix and then formed into the shape of the warhead case .

With reference now to a flowchart illustrating the manufacture of the warhead case is shown. At step the wires which ultimately will form the mesh for the warhead case are notched preferably by using the punch shown in . As previously described the spacing between the notches along the various wire segments that ultimately form the warhead case will vary depending upon the location of the wire segment in the warhead case . Step then proceeds to step .

At step the notched wires are then braided or woven into a mesh having the overall shape of the warhead case . As previously described the mesh may be woven or braided into the shape of the warhead case or alternatively pressed into the shape of the warhead case using a punch and die or other means. Any conventional means may be used to perform this weaving and forming operation. Step then proceeds to step .

At step the polymer matrix is then cured if required preferably by heating and cooling the impregnated mesh so that upon cooling the matrix hardens and forms the rigid outer case for the warhead . The warhead case is then filled with the explosive charge and detonation components in the conventional manner thus completing the warhead .

In the event that the warhead is punctured by a projectile of some sort such as a bullet the shockwaves or frictional heating resulting from the impact of the projectile will cause the explosive material of the warhead to heat to a temperature less than the detonation temperature of the warhead or in the event that the warhead is within or near some heat source such as a burning vehicle. This heating the rate of which is known as a fast or slow cook off will soften the thermoplastic polymer matrix and allow the pressures resulting from the heating of the explosive material to create openings in the polymer matrix so that the pressure can vent through the openings in the polymer matrix. In doing so such venting is not only automatic but effectively prevents any possible detonation of the warhead caused by these stimuli.

From the foregoing it can be seen that the present invention provides a novel warhead case in which the explosive force resulting from detonation of the warhead may be shaped or directed in a desired direction typically forwardly of path of travel of the warhead. Additionally the present invention provides for automatic venting of pressure buildups that may be caused by impact of a projectile or other stimulus sufficient to create heating and thus pressure buildup of the warhead explosive material but short of detonation. A still further advantage of the present invention is that the size of shrapnel created by detonation of the warhead may be adjusted for different situations by simply varying the spacing of the notches in the mesh forming the warhead case.

Having described our invention many modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which it pertains without deviation from the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims.
