title: Nonlinear optical CdSiP2 crystal for use in surgical laser
abstract: CdSiPcrystals with sizes and optical quality suitable for use as nonlinear optical devices are disclosed, as well as NLO devices based thereupon. A method of growing the crystals by directional solidification from a stoichiometric melt is also disclosed. The disclosed NLO crystals have a higher nonlinear coefficient than prior art crystals that can be pumped by solid state lasers, and are particularly useful for frequency shifting 1.06 μm, 1.55 μm, and 2 μm lasers to wavelengths between 2 μm and 10 μm. Due to the high thermal conductivity and low losses of the claimed CdSiPcrystals, average output power can exceed 10 W without severe thermal lensing. A 6.45 μm laser source for use as a medical laser scalpel is also disclosed, in which a CdSiPcrystal is configured for non-critical phase matching, pumped by a 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser, and temperature-tuned to produce output at 6.45 μm.

This is a divisional application of Ser. No. 12 809 103 filed Jun. 18 2010 and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 107 876 filed Oct. 23 2008 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

The present invention was made in conjunction with Government funding under contract number PA8650 05 C 5425 awarded by the United States Air Force. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.

The invention relates to non linear optics and more particularly to the production and use of birefringent crystals in nonlinear optical devices.

Mid infrared lasers are important for a growing number of applications such as spectroscopy remote chemical sensing laser surgery and infrared countermeasures. Typically laser output at mid infrared wavelengths is produced by using a nonlinear optical NLO crystal to shift the output wavelength of a solid state laser such as a Nd YAG 1.06 m laser or an erbium doped fiber laser 1.55 m to a wavelength in the 2 12 m range. Oxide based crystals such as potassium titanyl phosphate KTiOPO KTP and periodically poled lithium niobate LiNbO PPLN work well at the short end of this spectral range but the output power from these materials falls oil dramatically beyond 4 microns.

The I III VIchalcopyrite crystals AgGaSand AgGaSecan be pumped at 1.06 m and 1.55 m respectively so as to generate output much deeper into the infrared up to 12 m but they are plagued by low damage thresholds and extremely poor thermal properties that preclude their use for high average power applications. Crystals of ZnGeP a II IV Vchalcopyrite have significantly higher nonlinear coefficients and much better thermo mechanical properties for high power operation but they must be pumped by less common sources such as Tm or Tm Ho lasers operating at wavelengths greater than 1.9 m. Furthermore the output power and efficiency of 2 micron laser pumped ZnGePoptical parametric oscillators OPOs is limited by absorption losses at the pump wavelength.

II IV Vchalcopyrites like ZnGePare derived from III V compound semiconductors like GaP by ordered substitution of group II Zn and group IV Ge atoms on the group III Ga site in the same way that chalcopyrites like AgGaSand AgGaSeare derived from II VII compound semiconductors like ZnSe . While the I III VIcompounds offer low absorption losses they are usually plagued by scattering losses due to precipitates which form on cooling as a result of off stoichiometry congruent melting and retrograde solubility of the IIIVI rich phase. They tend to have larger band gaps than their II IV Vcounterparts but are inferior in terms of hardness thermal conductivity anisotropic thermal expansion and thermo optic coefficients all of which makes them prone to thermal lensing and laser induced damage in both the surface and the hulk. They also have lower nonlinear coefficients than the II IV Vchalcopyrites.

The II IV Vcompounds therefore offer superior properties in almost every respect. They are generally free of scattering centers and absorption losses at least in the phosphides can be very low in the center of their transparency range. While they can be plagued by defect related absorption losses near the band edge when grown from the melt these losses can often be eliminated by post growth processing.

Of course not all II IV Vcompounds are suitable for nonlinear optical applications. To be useful for nonlinear optical frequency conversion a crystal must have sufficient birefringence for phase matching. Because the speed of light as determined by the refractive index n inside a crystal varies as a function of wavelength a phenomenon known as dispersion the input and output waves will normally remain in phase over a very short distance 10 100 m in the infrared termed the coherence length beyond which frequency conversion ceases. A birefringent crystal exhibits two refractive indices one for light polarized perpendicular to the optic axis ordinary or o polarized and another for light polarized parallel to the optic axis extraordinary or e polarized . If the difference between the two refractive indices i.e. the birefringence n n exceeds the difference in refractive index at the two wavelengths i.e. the dispersion then a direction inside the crystal can be chosen such that input and output waves of opposite polarization can experience the same refractive index. Under these conditions the two waves remain in phase i.e. are phase matched allowing the frequency conversion process to build to reasonable efficiencies over a long interaction length.

In addition to phase matching a nonlinear optical crystal must be highly transparent at the input and output wavelengths of interest and it must have a band edge that is near or below one half of the shortest wavelength involved in the frequency conversion process so as to avoid two photon absorption. For down conversion processes such as optical parametric oscillation OPO optical parametric amplification OPA and difference frequency generation DFG the input wave represents the shortest wavelength whereas for up conversion processes such as second harmonic generation SHG or sum frequency generation SFG the shortest wavelength s is are at the output. Pumping with a 1064 nm Nd YAG solid state laser for example requires a band edge near or below 532 nm.

Finally even if a candidate compound has adequate nonlinearity transparency and phase matching properties it will not be possible to use the compound as the basis of an optical device unless a method is found for growing crystals of sufficient size and optical quality so that devices with the required crystallographic orientation can be fabricated. Oriented crystals with dimensions of at least 3 min 3 mm 10 min are typically required for practical devices and the crystals must be free of cracks twins voids inclusions grain boundaries and other macroscopic defects at least within the aperture and propagating path of the interacting waves.

Although at the time the present invention was made CdSiPwas known to be a II IV Vchalcopyrite compound with at least some properties consistent with use in NLO devices CdSiPwas not generally considered by those skilled in the art to be a likely candidate for practical NLO devices. The crystal structure of CdSiPhad been reported by S. C. Abrahams and J. L. Bernstein . Vol. 55 p. 796 1971 incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. Specifically Abrahams and Bernstein had reported that CdSiPbelongs to the tetragonal space group that its lattice parameters are respectively 5.68 A and 10.431 A for a and c and Z 4 in each unit cell and that the mass density of CdSiPis 4.70 g cm.

The birefringence of tiny 2 2 0.2 mmCdSiPcrystals grown from a molten tin flux had been measured in the prior art and reported in N. Itoh T. Fujinaga and T. Nakau Birefringence in CdSiP Jap. J. Appl Phys. 17 951 2 1978 incorporated herein by reference for all purposes to be 0.045 at 840 nm but no measurements were made in the infrared.

Several other optically relevant properties of CdSiPwere either uncertain or unknown at the time the present invention was made. For example values reported in the prior art for the band gap of CdSiPhad ranged from 2.2 eV 563 nm to 2.45 eV 506 nm causing it to be unclear if CdSiPwould exhibit two photon absorption if pumped by a pulsed 1064 nm laser. The long wavelength transparency limit of CdSiPhad not been measured in the prior art. And while tiny samples up to 5 2 1 mm had been grown in the prior art by halogen assisted vapor transport as reported for example in E. Buehler and J. H. Wernick 8 324 1971 incorporated herein by reference for all purposes the CdSiPcrystals produced thereby were far too small to be used for nonlinear optical devices. In fact these prior art crystals were too small to enable measurement of the most relevant nonlinear optical properties including the nonlinear coefficient the transparency range and the phase matching characteristics. Furthermore the methods used to grow these prior art crystals were not scalable to produce crystals having the required size and quality.

At the time the present invention was made it therefore appeared doubtful to those of average skill in the art that CdSiPcrystals of optical device size and quality could be grown. Buehler and Wernick had reported an approximate melting point of 1120 C. for CdSiPand a vapor pressure of 19.4 atm at 1100 C. which extrapolates to 20.4 atm at 1120 C. and 23.9 atm at 1175 C. . The present inventors had even attempted to grow CdSiPdirectly from a stoichiometric melt without success finding that the quartz ampoules devitrified and reacted with CdSiP and that the solidified melts were porous and polycrystalline. An equilibrium phase diagram for CdSiPsystem had not been determined in the prior art and it was not known if the compound would melt congruently which is a necessary condition for melt growth.

A method was known in the prior art see U.S. Pat. No. 5 611 856 incorporated herein in its entirety for all purposes for producing single crystals of group II IV Vcompounds of sufficient size and optical quality for use in NLO devices by pre synthesizing the compound material from its constituents and separately melting and re crystallizing by directional solidification in sealed quartz ampoules using a two zone horizontal transparent furnace. Crystals with melting points as high as 1027 C. and vapor pressures as high as 7 atmospheres had been grown by this method. However it did not appear at the time of the present invention that this method would tolerate the significantly higher temperatures 1175 C. in the hot zone and pressures 24 atm required to produce a CdSiPcrystal. In addition it was not known whether the compound itself would melt congruently and whether the quartz ampoules could be used without devitrifying or reacting with the compound. Filially it was not apparent that a crystal of CdSiPwould be transparent and phase matchable for mid infrared frequency conversion even if a crystal of sufficient size and quality could somehow be grown.

For all of these reasons at the time the present invention was made CdSiPwas not generally considered by those skilled in the art to be a likely candidate crystal for practical NLO device applications.

A need exists therefore for CdSiPsingle crystals of sufficient size and optical quality to be suitable for use in NLO devices and for a method of producing such crystals. A need also exists for NLO devices that use such CdSiPcrystals to frequency shift the output of 1.06 m and 1.55 m lasers to mid infrared wavelengths ranging from 2 10 m and for frequency shifting 2 m lasers at high efficiencies and output powers into the 3 10 m range. Furthermore a need exists for a method of using such crystals of frequency shifting the output of 1.06 m 1.55 m and 2 m lasers to mid infrared wavelengths ranging from 2 10 m.

Large high optical quality CdSiPcrystals suitable for use in nonlinear optical devices are claimed as well as a method of producing such crystals by directional solidification from a stoichiometric melt. CdSiPcrystals of sufficient size and optical quality for use in NLO devices do not occur in nature and could not be artificially produced before invention of the method claimed herein. The crystals of the present invention are therefore compositions of matter with essential differences in their properties as compared to naturally occurring and prior art manufactured crystals wherein these essential differences include enhanced optical quality and size that enable the claimed crystals to be used as the basis of practical NLO devices in contrast with CdSiPcrystals of the prior art that cannot be so used.

The claimed method of producing NLO compatible CdSiPcrystals is similar to the prior art method of U.S. Pat. No. 5 611 856. However it was unexpected at the time the present invention was made that large ingots of the compound CdSiPcould be successfully synthesized without explosion of the quartz ampoule due to the high temperatures and pressures required. Furthermore it was unexpected that large high optical quality single crystals could be successfully grown in horizontal transparent furnaces by directional solidification at the required temperatures and pressures.

Nonlinear optical devices are also claimed that use the CdSiPcrystals of the present invention to produce a shifted wavelength laser beam having a wavelength different from all incident beams. The claimed devices are capable of efficiently shifting laser wavelengths as short as 1 m so as to produce electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the 2 10 m wavelength range and with average power levels in excess of 10 W while avoiding severe thermal lensing due to the low absorption losses and high thermal conductivity of the claimed CdSiPcrystals.

The features and advantages described herein are not all inclusive and in particular many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings specification and claims. Moreover it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes and not to limit the scope of the inventive subject matter.

With reference to the method of the present invention for producing a single crystal of CdSiPsuitable for use in NLO devices includes the following steps 

a placing red phosphorus P at one end of a quartz ampoule and a PBN or PBN coated graphite boat containing cadmium Cd and silicon Si at the other end of the ampoule in a molar ratio of Cd Si P 1 1 2 and evacuating and sealing the ampoule 

b heating the sealed ampoule in a two zone furnace so that the P end of the furnace is maintained at a cold zone temperature of 485 C. and the Cd and Si end of the furnace is maintained at a hot zone temperature of 1180 C. and waiting until the P fully transports and reacts with Cd and Si to form CdSiP 4 24 hours and then cooling to room temperature 

c loading the resulting synthesized CdSiPingot into a PBN or PBN coated graphite boat fitted with a well containing a seed crystal and vacuum encapsulating the boat in a fused silica ampoule 

d heating the encapsulated PBN or PBN coated graphite boat in a furnace with an axial gradient of 1 5 C. cm to about 1130 C. and adjusting the temperature so as to fully melt the CdSiPingot and partially melt the seed crystal 

e cooling the encapsulated PBN or PBN coated graphite boat at a rate of between 0.32 C. per hour and 1 C. per hour so as to achieve directional solidification of the CdSiPat a crystal growth rate of 0.2 to 2 min hour and

f cooling the resultant CdSiPcrystal to room temperature at a rate of between 5 C. hour and 100 C. hour .

The method described above has been used to produce single crystals of CdSiPsuitable for use in NLO devices with diameters up to 19 mm or more and lengths up to several centimeters. These crystals of the present invention have been used to measure the following NLO properties 

The inventors of the present invention have examined the transmission characteristics of CdSiPsingle crystals produced using the method disclosed above and have found that the CdSiPsingle crystals are transparent in the wavelength range of 500 nm to 9500 nm. The measured transparency range of a CdSiPcrystal of the present invention plotted as absorption coefficient versus wavelength is shown in . The thick line indicates the measured absorption spectrum for CdSiP whereas the thin line indicates the measured absorption spectrum for a nonlinear optical crystal of the prior art ZnGeP. Note that the absorption losses between the band edge and 2 m are substantially lower in a CdSiPcrystal of the present invention than in the prior art ZnGePcrystal allowing CdSiPcrystals to be pumped by 1 m and 1.55 m lasers which are processes not phase matchable using the prior art crystal ZnGeP.

In addition CdSiPcrystals of the present invention exhibit a 2 m absorption coefficient up to 20 times lower than that ZnGeP making CdSiPpromising alternative to ZnGePfor powerful and efficient mid infrared OPOs pumped by Tm and Ho lasers. The onset of multi phonon absorption in a CdSiPcrystal of the present invention with peaks at 7 m and 7.6 m occurs at shorter wavelengths than in the prior art ZnGePcrystal which has a peak at 9 m . This limits the usefulness of CdSiPcrystals for frequency conversion processes involving wavelengths beyond 6.7 m.

The inventors have measured the nonlinear coefficient of a CdSiPsingle crystal produced using the method disclosed above and have obtained a value of 84.5 pm V which is 2.56 times that of AgGaSe 33 pm V and 7 times larger than that of AgGaS 12 m V . This was an unexpectedly high value for the nonlinear optical coefficient since plotting the nonlinear coefficients of other II VI Vchalcopyrites as a function of band gap predicted a value closer to 53 pm V. This measured value of 84.5 pm V is in fact the highest nonlinear optical coefficient of any known phase matchable nonlinear optical crystal that can be pumped by a solid state laser.

The inventors have measured the thermal conductivity of an 8 mm 8 mm 1.97 mm CdSiPsample using a NETZSCH LFA 447 Nanoflash instrument. The sample faces were coated with gold 0.1 m and carbon paint 5 m to block any transmitted light. Room temperature 25 C. measurements of thermal diffusivity heat capacity and thermal conductivity yielded values of 7.69 mm s 0.446 J g K and 13.6 W mK respectively. This thermal conductivity value is an order of magnitude higher than that of the prior art NLO crystals AgGaS 1.4 W mK and AgGaSe 1.0 W mK used in the prior art for shifting 1.06 m and 1.55 lm lasers into the mid ER. This high thermal conductivity coupled with the low absorption losses illustrated in enables the generation of mid infrared laser radiation in excess of 10 W.

Employing the method of prism minimum deviation the inventors of the present invention also measured the principal refractive indices of CdSiP. Using the least square fitting method the Sellmeier equations were obtained as follows 

According to pumping a CdSiPNLO device with a 2055 nm laser curve at internal phase matching angles between 43 and 45 degrees relative to the c axis optic axis will generate output wavelengths between 2.6 m and 9.31 m. Pumping with a 1550 nm laser curve at internal phase matching angles between 45.5 and 60.5 degrees relative to the c axis optic axis will generate output wavelengths from 1.71 m to greater than 10.5 m. And pumping with a 1064 nm laser at internal phase matching angles between 50 and 90 degrees relative to the c axis optic axis will generate signal output wavelengths from 1.1 m to 1.3 m curve and idler output wavelengths from 6 m to greater than 10.5 m curve . Although 1064 m pumping is unable to access the 1.3 m to 6 m range CdSiPdoes allow non critically phase matched output i.e. 90 degree phase matching with no walk off around 6.2 m which would be advantageous for medical applications in this range.

The present inventors also measured the change in the ordinary and extra ordinary refractive indices and the consequent change in the corresponding Sellmeier equations as a function of temperature. The resulting temperature dependent Sellmeier coefficients are listed below in Table 1 and indicate that the CdSiPcrystals of the present invention are more temperature tunable than most other nonlinear optical chalcopyrite crystals known in the prior art. The data indicate for example that a 2 m pumped OPO based on CdSiPcan be tuned in wavelength between 3.4 and 4.8 m by varying the temperature of the CdSiPcrystal between 10 C. and 70 C. Likewise a 1.064 m pumped Type I CdSiPOPO will produce non critically phase matched output at 6.18 m at 25 C. but can be temperature tuned to produce non critically phase matched output at 6.45 m at 99 C. a modest temperature increase that can easily be achieved in practical hardware . The ability to efficiently directly generate 6.45 m radiation from a 1.064 m pumped non critically phase matched OPO is valuable for laser surgery applications 

In various embodiments the polarizations of the interacting waves and the crystallographic orientation of the optic axis and tuning axis are chosen so as to satisfy the conditions for a given phase matching type type I type II etc. and so as to maximize the efficiency of the frequency conversion process using the principles detailed for example in M. J. Weber ed. . Vol. 3. CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. 1986 relevant portions incorporated by reference for all purposes.

One example of a device according to is a medical laser scalpel. The device is pumped by a conventional laser such as a Nd YAG laser at 1.06 m and produces an output laser beam of approximately 6.45 m which is a wavelength with high soft tissue absorbance and cutting efficiency. In various embodiments of this device the CdSiPcrystal is oriented for noncritical phase matching with no walk off of the emerging beam relative to the incident beam. The crystal is heated by the heater to a temperature of approximately 100 C. so as to tune the output wavelength to approximately 6.45 m. A specific medical laser scalpel embodiment is discussed in more detail in Example 3 below.

It can be seen from the discussion above that the claimed single crystals of CdSiPare novel NLO crystals having excellent NLO properties. The claimed NLO devices made using the claimed CdSiPcrystals have superior properties as compared to prior art NLO devices made using either AgGaSeor AgGaSecrystals. In particular the claimed devices have a higher nonlinear coefficient and higher thermal conductivity than these prior art devices making them more attractive for high average power laser frequency conversion in the mid infrared.

22.0453 g of red phosphorus was loaded into one end of a heavy walled fused silica ampoule and a PBN coated graphite boat containing 9.9948 g silicon and 40.0034 g cadmium was loaded into the opposite end. The ampoule was evacuated sealed and loaded into a two zone shunt type tube furnace with a Hastelloy C 276 protective liner. The programmed heating cycle was as follows zone 1 hot zone containing the boat with Cd and Si was heated at 50 C. hr to 1025 C. 37.9 hr soak 25 C. hr to 1180 C. 8 hr soak cool at 100 C. hr zone 2 containing P was heated at 50 C. hr to 485 C. 28 hr soak 25 C. hr to 1180 C. 8 hr soak cool at 100 C. hr.

The resulting single phase polycrystalline ingot was loaded into a PBN coated graphite boat with a seed well containing a CdSiPsingle crystal seed oriented for horizontal growth along the 001 c axis direction with the 110 axis normal to the top surface. The boat charge and seed were vacuum encapsulated in a heavy walled fused silica ampoule and heated in a two zone transparent furnace at 16.7 C. hour to set points of 1125 C. and 1115 C. respectively to establish an axial temperature gradient of 1.5 C. cm. The set points were gradually raised to 1130 C. and 1120 C. to partially melt the seed crystal followed by cooling at 0.15 C. hr for 160 hours to induce directional solidification at a rate of 1 mm hour. Once fully solidified the crystal was cooled at 5 C. hour to room temperature. The resulting D shaped crystal was 19 mm wide 10 mm high and 140 mm long the first 15 mm of growth were a clear crack free single crystal grain that reproduced the orientation of the seed crystal.

A CdSiPcrystal obtained by using the procedure of Example 1 with excellent mechanical properties was cut and polished into a body of 3 6 12 mmafter determination of the crystallographic axes a and c at phase matching angles of 42.5 degrees and 45 degrees. The crystal was placed in the optical path shown in without mirrors and . The incident wave was from a frequency doubled Q switched COlaser of wavelength 4.64 microns. The emerging second harmonic wave with a wavelength of 2.32 microns was obtained. The uncoated crystal achieved 30 optical to optical conversion efficiency.

A CdSiPcrystal obtained by using the procedure of Example 1 was cut into a body of 6 6.75 9.5 mmafter determination of the crystallographic axes a and c at phase matching angles of 90 degrees and 45 degrees. The residual losses measured for the relevant polarizations e for the pump and o for the signal and idler were 0.185 cmat 1064 nm 0.114 cmnear 13 m and 0.014 cmnear 6.4 m. Both faces were AR coated for the three wavelengths pump signal and idler and the 8 layer coating resulted in averaged reflectivity per surface of 0.35 at 1064 nm 0.4 at 1275 m and 0.8 at 6400 nm. The crystal was placed in the optical path shown in . The incident wave was from a Q switched 1064 nm Nd YAG laser no two photon absorption was observed. The internal crystal angle was approximately 0.67 below the desired 90 interaction angle resulting in a signal wavelength of 1.277 m and an idler wavelength of 6.398 m which was increased to 6.45 m by heating the crystal using a heater . This interaction is extremely useful for laser surgery applications at 6.45 m including minimally invasive neurosurgery. An extremely effective laser scalpel for cutting soft tissue has been demonstrated at this wavelength using a free electron laser see 371 416 419 29 Sep. 1994 incorporated herein in its entirety for all purposes which is an enormous and extremely expensive laser source. The CdSiPcrystal of the present invention will allow direct efficient non critically phase matched generation of the desired wavelength from a compact powerful and readily available Nd YAG pump laser.
