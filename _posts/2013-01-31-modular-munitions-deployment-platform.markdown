title: Modular munitions deployment platform
abstract: The subject munitions deployment platform for an Anti-Personnel Obstacle Breaching System munitions set provides prepositioned compartments to receive the ALICE packs of the munitions set to ensure that they are positioned and aligned for proper deployment. The pre-positioned compartments ensure that when the APOBS is deployed, the front edge of the rear ALICE pack properly engages the rear edge of the front ALICE pack providing a fulcrum aiding rotation of the rear pack allowing it to clear the engaging elements to lift the rear pack off the platform and into the air where it further functions as a drogue to assist in extending the charge line over the chosen target line. Combining the subject platform with a vehicle, or with a towed wagon, allows a Soldier to remain in a safe location while remotely positioning the munitions set to clear a minefield or other anti-personnel obstacle.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61 594 633 filed on Feb. 3 2012.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the United States Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties therefore or thereon. This patent application and any resulting patent has been assigned to the United States Government.

The subject invention relates to munitions deployment by unmanned ground vehicles and more specifically to a specially designed modular munitions deployment platform that enables a munitions set specifically designed to be deployed by personnel to be deployed remotely by a vehicle e.g. an Unmanned Ground Vehicles UGV robot or the like and more specifically a modular munitions deployment platform that can be operated in its standard configuration e.g. the platform s frame mounted to a physical structure as a payload for a UGV or other vehicle for a wagon towed by an unmanned ground vehicle or in any other configuration as a means of delivery as understood by one of skill in the art or to be outfitted with wheels as a wagon to be towed by a UGV. The modular deployment platform is adapted to mount an APOBS Munitions Set in an operative and deployable position. Thus the invention might also be called a Remote APOBS Deployment System.

The Anti Personnel Obstacle Breaching System APOBS is an obstacle clearance system for clearance of a minefield or other anti personnel obstacle hereafter referred to as obstacle fielded by the US Department of Defense in January 2003. It replaced the prior mine clearance device called the Bangalore Torpedo. The APOBS munitions set uses a rocket to launch a line charge of multiple grenades across a minefield or another anti personnel obstacle which grenades are then detonated to create a cleared path through the minefield or obstacle. Currently the APOBS is contained in two packs called ALICE All purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment packs each of which are typically carried and deployed by individual soldiers. The APOBS requires the Soldier to connect and position the two ALICE packs relative to each other and to the minefield or obstacle in order that the APOBS be properly and effectively deployed. While the APOBS is uniformly considered a vast improvement over the Bangalore torpedoes the placement of the APOBS system for deployment over an obstacle often still exposes Soldiers to enemy fire. For this reason deployment of the APOBS would be improved by use of Unmanned Ground Vehicles UGV outfitted with a system capable of appropriately deploying the APOBS through a very specific mechanism thus sparing the Soldiers from unnecessary exposure to hostile fire during positioning and deployment of the APOBS munitions set across the identified targeted area to be cleared.

The subject invention presents a modular munitions deployment platform that can combine into a system comprising an Unmanned Ground Vehicle e.g. UGV robot or the like and a method of remote deployment of that platform. The modular deployment platform can be either payload mounted to a physical structure for a UGV wherein the deployment platform is specifically designed to mount an Anti Personnel Obstacle Breaching System APOBS for deployment for its obstacle clearing function. Alternatively the platform may be configured with bolt on wheels to be configured as a wagon designed to be towed by a UGV. The subject modular munitions deployment platform is provided with compartments specifically sized and designed to hold the two ALICE packs of the existing APOBS munitions set in specific relative positions to facilitate deployment of the APOBS across the obstacle to be cleared. Mounting the subject deployment platform on such wagon or UGV controlled by a safely positioned Soldier allows the combined system to transport e.g. carry traverse or the like the two ALICE packs of the current APOBS Munitions in operative position relative to each other to allow the charge line to be fired over a minefield or other obstacle to be cleared.

The modular munitions deployment platform has a front compartment adapted to receive the front ALICE pack and a rear compartment adapted to receive the rear ALICE pack. These compartments are fitted with means to accurately position the packs in a unique functional position securing the packs appropriately the front pack to remain in position on the system and the rear pack to be free to be propelled upward at the end of the charge line to act as a drogue to assist in extending the charge line. The compartments are positioned so that the rear pack pivots around a fulcrum formed by the respective adjacent edges of the two front and rear ALICE packs disengaging the rear ALICE pack from the deployment platform.

The present invention is a modular munitions deployment platform adapted to receive the two ALICE packs of a current APOBS munitions set in specific relative positions to facilitate deployment of the APOBS across the obstacle to be cleared. The munitions deployment platform of the present invention may be combined into a system comprising a vehicle unmanned ground vehicle robot or the like or a motor vehicle the platform capable of being mounted directly onto the vehicle or other physical structure or onto a wagon designed to be towed by the vehicle . Whether modular deployment platform is configured or mounted onto an existing structure onto a vehicle or as a wagon towed by the vehicle careful maneuvering of the vehicle will position munitions deployment platform and the supported APOBS munitions set for deployment of the APOBS to clear a minefield or other anti personnel obstacle.

As seen in the APOBS munitions set as currently known and used comprises a front ALICE pack and a rear ALICE pack . Each ALICE pack includes a frame rail and respectively which generally extends at a stand off distance provided by support elements along three edges of the underside of the ALICE pack which like the frame of a backpack serves to support webbing that braces the ALICE pack easing the load of the pack as it is carried by a soldier. The lower portions of each side of frame rails and have a projection plate that serve to assist in location of the ALICE pack as is described within. The front ALICE pack contains a first half of a charge line with a front fuze as well as a rocket and rocket tube . The rear ALICE pack contains the second half of the charge line connected to the first half of the charge line before deployment a rear fuze and a drogue chute.

Deployment of the APOBS munitions set requires alignment of these two ALICE packs and at a prescribed distance from a minefield or other anti personnel obstacle to be cleared. Proper deployment requires aiming the rocket for the desired trajectory connecting the two halves of the charge line and placing the two ALICE packs and in proper alignment and position relative to each other such that the rocket properly drags both halves of the line charge over the selected trajectory the drogue chute and attached pack body of rear ALICE pack providing proper drag of the second half rear pack portion of the line charge to allow proper extension of the entire line charge. As mentioned in many cases soldiers involved in the placement and deployment of the APOBS munitions set at the edge of a minefield or obstacle without the benefit of an unmanned ground vehicle robot or the like combined with the subject invention are exposed to hostile fire while accomplishing these functions.

A munitions deployment platform in accordance with this invention is sized to accept the APOBS munitions set consisting of two ALICE packs a front ALICE pack and a rear ALICE pack . The front pack is secured to a front compartment of the munitions deployment platform by three features at least two front toe lugs a spring loaded latch release mechanism and two flanges . As will be explained later the latch release mechanism and flanges are part of the rear compartment but serve to secure the front ALICE pack into front compartment . The at least two front toe lugs the spring loaded latch release mechanism and two flanges generate a multi point mechanical positioning hold on the front pack .

The munitions deployment platform includes a front compartment comprising a front frame portion . The front frame portion includes two side rails . In a preferred embodiment side rails are U shaped but those of skill in the art will realize that the precise shape of the side rails is not critical. Each of side rails includes at least two joining holes . Front frame portion also includes a front horizontal plate and at least one rear horizontal beam . Front horizontal plate and all rear horizontal beams extend between the two side rails forming front frame portion . Front compartment also includes at least two front toe lugs . However stability of the mounted front ALICE pack is enhanced by use of multiple toe lugs and a preferred embodiment as shown in includes four front toe lugs . Front toe lugs are flat plates disposed upon front horizontal plate of front frame portion and have a hook end adapted to grasp the frame rail of front ALICE pack . The front toe lugs provide forward vertical and lateral location and securement of the front ALICE pack . The flanges are plates secured to the rear horizontal plate of rear frame portion and provide lead in guidance for the insertion of front ALICE pack into latch release mechanism . The flanges assist in providing a specific location to the front ALICE pack within front compartment . This specific location is important to the relative positioning of the front and rear ALICE packs and to ensure their respective operative positions for subsequent deployment of the APOBS munitions set .

Munitions deployment platform also includes a rear compartment having a rear frame portion . Rear frame portion includes two rear side rails each of the rear side rails having at least two joining holes . In a preferred embodiment rear side rails are U shaped and are sized to fit snugly within front side rails . Those of skill in the art will understand that the precise shape of front side rails and rear side rails are not critical so long as the respective side rails are shaped and sized to allow the front and rear side rails to slide together in a nesting relationship. When the front frame portion is joined to the rear frame portion by nesting the respective front side rails and rear side rails the joining holes and joining holes are to be aligned so that the respective frame portions can be secured with appropriate fasteners . In a preferred embodiment fasteners will be quick release fasteners.

Rear side rails of rear frame portion are joined to each other by multiple horizontal plates . This set of multiple horizontal plates include at least a latch release horizontal plate which plate includes a latch release flange and at least two ALICE pack angled flanges . Horizontal plates may also include a toe lug horizontal plate and a rear horizontal plate . Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the set of horizontal plates may also be formed as a single horizontal plate.

The rear compartment also comprises a latch release mechanism which is an element of rear frame portion . As shown in latch release horizontal plate includes a latch release flange which supports a latch release base plate . Base plate has a centrally disposed shaft receiving hole through which is mounted a shaft . At one end of shaft there is disposed a dihedral plate .

The latch release mechanism also includes two link plates which are attached at generally diametrically opposed locations on dihedral plate by dihedral plate shoulder screws . Each of the other ends of link plates are joined to one of a pair of sliding dogs respectively by link plate shoulder screws . Each of sliding dogs include a pair of dog slots that are slidably mounted to base plate by slot shoulder screws . The more centrally located end of each of sliding dogs has an extended dog end . The more distally located end of each of sliding dogs has an angled dog end . Extended dog end is connected to a first end of extension spring . The second end of extension spring is attached to base plate by spring shoulder screws at a position between extended dog end and angled dog end . Thus each of extension springs tend to bias sliding dogs which are slidably mounted to base plate to a position away from the center of base plate .

Each of angled dog ends which are at the end of each sliding dog most distant from the center of the base plate is angled such that the downward pressure of the frame rail of front ALICE pack will move the sliding dog downwardly and towards a central position against the bias of extension springs . When the frame rail of front ALICE pack clears the lower corner of the angled dog end extension springs will again bias the sliding dogs to their outermost position distal from the center of the base plate . In this outermost position each of sliding dogs thus secures the frame rail of the ALICE pack . When necessary after deployment of the munitions set shaft handle may be rotated by a user to again overcome the bias of extension springs pulling the sliding dogs into a position near the center of base plate . In this manner the frame rail of ALICE pack is again free to be lifted upwardly and clear of the locked position it previously had beneath the angled dog end of sliding dogs . The munitions deployment platform is then ready to receive a subsequent APOBS munitions set for subsequent use.

The rear pack is secured to the rear compartment of munitions deployment platform system by three features at least two rear toe lugs at least one angled flange and at least one frame flange . In a preferred embodiment as shown in there are four rear toe lugs two angled flanges and two frame flanges . The rear toe lugs are flat plates permanently affixed to toe lug horizontal plate the rear frame portion . Toe lugs provide a hooked end to grasp the forward portion of the rear ALICE pack frame rail . The rear toe lugs provide forward vertical and lateral location and securement of the rear APOBS ALICE pack . The angled flanges are bent plates permanently affixed to rear horizontal plate of rear frame portion . The angled flanges provide lateral location of the frame rail of rear ALICE pack . The frame flanges are also permanently affixed to rear horizontal plate of rear frame portion and provide lead in for insertion of projection plates of frame rail of rear ALICE pack . The interaction of projection plates with frame flanges ensures that the rear portion of rear ALICE pack is releasably secured in proper and functional position.

The current procedure for deployment of the APOBS munitions set is done by hand by the soldiers who have typically carried the two ALICE packs and on their backs. Proper deployment requires that the two ALICE packs and be positioned on the ground in a specific spaced and aligned offset configuration then aimed and fired. Currently these steps are implemented using solely human judgment and thus the process is susceptible to human error.

This invention modifies the current procedure eliminating a substantial portion of the potential user error by positioning the two ALICE packs and into the required in line configuration by providing front and rear compartments and pre positioned in proper spatial and aligned relationship. Among the objectives achieved by use of the subject munitions deployment platform is the spacing and alignment of the respective front and rear ALICE packs and that are critical to effectuate the required release of the forward frame rail of the rear ALICE pack from its respective toe lugs . As seen in when the munitions set is launched the front ALICE pack stays locked to the front compartment by operation of the latch release mechanism while the rear ALICE pack decouples from the munitions deployment platform and is pulled into the air by the rocket propelled munitions.

The decoupling action is accomplished by the upward rotation of rear ALICE pack caused by the continued flight of the rocket which remains connected to rear ALICE pack by the attached charge line. At the initial stage of the decoupling action rear ALICE pack rotates upwardly about the frontal axis of the rear ALICE pack frame rail . As the rotation of rear ALICE pack continues the front portion of the body of rear ALICE pack contacts the rear portion of the body of front ALICE pack . The resulting horizontal area of contact creates a fulcrum and the continued rotation of rear ALICE pack now rotating about this fulcrum causes the rear ALICE pack frame rail to move rearwardly in the direction denoted by the arrow freeing it from rear toe lugs . The rear ALICE pack is then able to fly free acting as a drogue to assist in extending the charge line over the desired target.

As seen in a camera may be positioned and supported at the end of a camera arm . Camera arm may be constructed in any number of ways but preferably is a bolted assembly of formed sheet metal. The camera arm has a camera pan and tilt adjustment bracket at the end for mounting of camera using quick release pins to facilitate tool less mounting. A preferred embodiment provides mounting of the pan and tilt adjustment bracket to camera arm with bolts. The camera arm is secured to a pair of tabs disposed on the rear horizontal plate by alignment of bracket holes with tab holes within each of tabs through which aligned bracket holes and tab holes are secured by quick release pins . Camera arm is sized to extend upwardly above rear frame portion to a height sufficient to provide direct line of sight over top of the APOBS munitions set to a point on the ground at a prescribed stand off distance in accordance to the munitions employed in front of the unmanned ground vehicle or wagon. While camera may be an independent camera it may also be the normally rear facing camera on the unmanned ground vehicle which may be removed from that vehicle and reinstalled in a forward facing position at the top of the pan and tilt bracket on the top of the camera arm to assist in providing wagon alignment and range estimation to target.

As shown in the present figures the modular munitions deployment platform of the subject invention may be combined with a wagon which is designed to be towed by an unmanned ground vehicle. A suitable wagon may be the one described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 677 587 directed to a robot and trailer system which disclosure is incorporated by reference herein. Although U.S. Pat. No. 7 677 587 characterizes the relevant component as a trailer in the subject application it will be characterized as a wagon as it is steerable as it provides the wagon with an Ackerman style steering mechanism connected to the front wheels. Wagon is to be modified as necessary to include a support structure suitable to allow selective mounting of the subject munitions deployment platform upon wagon by any suitable attachment means know to current practice.

Of course modular munitions deployment platform of the subject invention adds a number of features onto the trailer wagon of the 587 system to achieve the structure of the present combination making it suitable for the present objective of serving as a robotic platform for the positioning and deployment of the APOBS munitions set mounted upon it. More specifically the subject munitions deployment platform adds a number of elements necessary to receive and locate the front ALICE pack and rear ALICE pack of the APOBS munitions set into precise position relative to each other so that the APOBS can deploy properly and effectively.

This wagon also contains a video module enclosure which can house a video overlay module. This enclosure is preferably attached to the underside of front frame portion and more specifically to horizontal beams by any suitable means including but not limited to screws bolts and nuts welding or rivets. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the video module enclosure may also be mounted onto any suitable portion of the vehicle or the wagon towed by a vehicle upon which the subject munitions deployment platform is mounted so long as suitable electrical connection may be made.

The combination of the video overlay module and mounted rear camera provides a unique targeting system for this invention. Although the video overlay module is preferably a commercial off the shelf item its application in this invention is unique in that the video overlay is used to generate cross hairs for munitions alignment to a distant target and is integrated onto a robot towed wagon or deployable payload . While the current standard operating procedures for the APOBS munitions entail staging of the munitions set by hand with target alignment by user s eye this invention provides a more precise method for target alignment done remotely without the direct manual aid of the user deploying the munitions and without requiring direct line of sight of the munitions set to target.

One objective of this invention is to provide a modular munitions deployment platform designed for assembly disassembly and stowage for storage and transportation in shipping crate. It is currently intended that the munitions deployment platform complement a specific unmanned ground vehicle a TALON manufactured by QinetiQ NA and or wagon to be towed by same and therefore also complement the shipping crates currently used with that unmanned ground vehicle. Of course other stowage containers can be employed and still be within the spirit of this invention.

The process for using the subject munitions deployment platform will be described in the context of the platform in combination with a wagon . The process will be substantially the same if the platform is mounted as a payload directly onto an unmanned ground vehicle . In either case the munitions deployment platform is mounted onto appropriate support elements on unmanned ground vehicle or wagon using any selectively securable and releasable attachment means known to the art. The attachment means may be for example screws nuts and bolts or quick release locking pins placed through suitably positioned mating holes.

The process begins with the step of joining the front frame portion and the rear frame portion by mating their respective side rails and until joining holes and respectively are aligned. At that time quick release fasteners are placed through the mated joining holes and thereby joining the frame portions and into a united modular munitions deployment platform . The integral munitions deployment platform is then mounted onto a wagon and the wagon is joined to an unmanned ground vehicle . The camera lead from the wagon is connected to the vehicle UGV robot or the like .

The next step mounts the front ALICE pack into front compartment of the subject platform . More specifically as front ALICE pack is positioned over front compartment the front ALICE pack frame rail is engaged under front toe lugs . The pack is then lowered such that the projection plates extending from frame rail are guided by flanges into a position whereby the latch release mechanism engages frame rail of front ALICE pack . Pack is pushed down in turn pushing frame rail down causing rail to bear against angled dog end which forces the sliding dogs against the bias of springs toward the center of the latch release mechanism . The downward motion of the Alice pack is continued until rail clears the edge of angled dog end at which time the bias of springs urges sliding dogs away from the center and locks the frame rail and thus the front ALICE pack into a proper position for effective interaction with the rear ALICE pack for subsequent deployment of APOBS munitions set .

The next step of the subject process is to place rear ALICE pack into rear compartment of munitions deployment platform . To do this the soldier tilts the front end of rear ALICE pack so that frame rail is engaged by the hook end of rear toe lugs . The rear end of rear ALICE pack is then lowered being guided into proper position by the interaction of angled flanges and frame flanges upon projection plate of frame rail as the rear end of rear ALICE pack moves downwardly. The rear ALICE pack is thus releasably secured into rear compartment of platform .

In a subsequent step the covers for both ALICE packs and are then removed and discarded an improved launch rod is inserted into a hole located at the forward location of the front pack and the APOBS munitions are configured for deployment per standard operating procedures aside from the firing mechanism. These standard procedures include i mating the open end of a tube mounted to the side of the rocket to the free tip of the launch rod and moving the rocket downwardly along the launch rod until the rocket is fully engaged effectively hanging the rocket from the launch rod ii the rocket of the APOBS munitions set is connected to the first half of the charge line contained within the front ALICE pack . The other end of first half is then connected to the second half of the charge line contained within rear ALICE pack .

In the next step the electrical lead of camera that has been mounted onto camera arm is connected to the proper lead of the viewing system of the vehicle towing wagon . Then to connect the firing mechanism the shock tube detonator is connected to a fire control system mounted on the towing unmanned ground vehicle .

In another step the vehicle and the towed wagon in combination with the mounted munitions deployment platform of the subject invention are then steered by the operating Soldier into position adjacent the obstacle to be cleared. In this step the operator will control the unmanned ground vehicle and wagon by use of the navigational camera s on the unmanned ground vehicle as well as the target alignment camera maneuvering the combined system of platform ground vehicle and wagon so that the two joined halves of the charge line will fire in the proper selected trajectory across the minefield or other obstacle.

In the subsequent step at a time selected by the operator following placement of the system into proper position the APOBS munitions set is deployed by firing the rocket in the selected trajectory. The firing of the rocket deploys the first half of the charge line which is operatively connected to the rocket until it is fully extended from the front ALICE pack . As the rocket continues on its trajectory the second half of the charge line which has been connected to the first half of the charge line is also extended from the rear ALICE pack . When the entire second half of the charge line is extended the continued trajectory of the rocket then pulls the rear portion of the body of rear ALICE pack .

In this step as has been described in more detail above ALICE pack is pulled forward and upward the front edge of the rear ALICE pack engages the rear edge of the front ALICE pack . The contact of these two edges forms a fulcrum around which the attached rear ALICE pack body is pivoted disengaging the rear ALICE pack frame rail from the rear toe lugs and assisting in elevating the pack into the air as the charge line continues to be extended by the rocket. The rear ALICE pack provides a weight that combines with the drogue chute to ensure full extension of the charge line along the chosen path.

In the next step once the charge line has been thus deployed across the minefield or other obstacle the grenades on the charge line are fired their concurrent explosions also causing detonation of any mines proximate to the grenades along the charge line. With the concurrent detonation of the grenades on the charge line and the adjacent mines is employed to clear a minefield a path is cleared though the obstacle.

In a final step the operator may then turn shaft handle of latch release mechanism causing sliding dogs to open allowing release of frame rail of front ALICE pack from latch release mechanism . The front ALICE pack is then discarded and the munitions deployment platform is again ready for subsequent use.
