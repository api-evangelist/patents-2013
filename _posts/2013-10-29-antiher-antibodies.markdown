This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 USC 119 e of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 210 562 filed Mar. 20 2009 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present invention concerns anti HER antibodies including multispecific anti HER antibodies with binding specificity for at least two different HER receptors and use of the antibodies to treat diseases or disorders.

The HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases are important mediators of cell growth differentiation and survival. The receptor family includes four distinct members including epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR ErbB1 or HER1 HER2 ErbB2 or p185 HER3 ErbB3 and HER4 ErbB4 or tyro2 .

EGFR encoded by the erbB 1 gene has been causally implicated in human malignancy. In particular increased expression of EGFR has been observed in breast bladder lung head neck and stomach cancer as well as glioblastomas. Increased EGFR receptor expression is often associated with increased production of the EGFR ligand transforming growth factor alpha TGF by the same tumor cells resulting in receptor activation by an autocrine stimulatory pathway. Baselga and Mendelsohn 64 127 154 1994 . Monoclonal antibodies directed against the EGFR or its ligands TGF and EGF have been evaluated as therapeutic agents in the treatment of such malignancies. See e.g. Baselga and Mendelsohn. supra Masui et al. 44 1002 1007 1984 and Wu et al. 95 1897 1905 1995 .

The second member of the HER family HER2 p185 was originally identified as the product of the transforming gene from neuroblastomas of chemically treated rats. The activated form of the neu proto oncogene results from a point mutation valine to glutamic acid in the transmembrane region of the encoded protein. Amplification of the human homolog of neu is observed in breast and ovarian cancers and correlates with a poor prognosis Slamon et al. 235 177 182 1987 Slamon et al. 244 707 712 1989 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 968 603 . Overexpression of HER2 frequently but not uniformly due to gene amplification has also been observed in other carcinomas including carcinomas of the stomach endometrium salivary gland lung kidney colon thyroid pancreas and bladder. See among others King et al. 229 974 1985 Yokota et al. 1 765 767 1986 Fukushige et al. 6 955 958 1986 Guerin et al. 3 21 31 1988 Cohen et al. 4 81 88 1989 Yonemura et al. 51 1034 1991 Borst et al. 38 364 1990 Weiner et al. 50 421 425 1990 Kern et al. 50 5184 1990 Park et al. 49 6605 1989 Zhau et al. 3 254 257 1990 Aasland et al. 57 358 363 1988 Williams et al. 59 46 52 1991 and McCann et al. 65 88 92 1990 . HER2 may be overexpressed in prostate cancer Gu et al. 99 185 9 1996 Ross et al. 28 827 33 1997 Ross et al. 79 2162 70 1997 and Sadasivan et al. 150 126 31 1993 .

Antibodies directed against the rat p185and human HER2 protein products have been described. Drebin and colleagues have raised antibodies against the rat neu gene product p185See for example Drebin et al. 41 695 706 1985 Myers et al. 198 277 290 1991 and WO94 22478. Drebin et al. 2 273 277 1988 report that mixtures of antibodies reactive with two distinct regions of p185result in synergistic anti tumor effects on neu transformed NIH 3T3 cells implanted into nude mice. See also U.S. Pat. No. 5 824 311 issued Oct. 20 1998.

Hudziak et al. 9 3 1165 1172 1989 describe the generation of a panel of HER2 antibodies which were characterized using the human breast tumor cell line SK BR 3. Relative cell proliferation of the SK BR 3 cells following exposure to the antibodies was determined by crystal violet staining of the monolayers after 72 hours. Using this assay maximum inhibition was obtained with the antibody called 4D5 which inhibited cellular proliferation by 56 . Other antibodies in the panel reduced cellular proliferation to a lesser extent in this assay. The antibody 4D5 was further found to sensitize HER2 overexpressing breast tumor cell lines to the cytotoxic effects of TNF . See also U.S. Pat. No. 5 677 171 issued Oct. 14 1997. The HER2 antibodies discussed in Hudziak et al. are further characterized in Fendly et al. 50 1550 1558 1990 Kotts et al. 26 3 59A 1990 Sarup et al. 1 72 82 1991 Shepard et al. J. 11 3 117 127 1991 Kumar et al. 11 2 979 986 1991 Lewis et al. 37 255 263 1993 Pietras et al. 9 1829 1838 1994 Vitetta et al. 54 5301 5309 1994 Sliwkowski et al. 269 20 14661 14665 1994 Scott et al. 266 14300 5 1991 D souza et al. 91 7202 7206 1994 Lewis et al. 56 1457 1465 1996 and Schaefer et al. 15 1385 1394 1997 .

A recombinant humanized version of the murine HER2 antibody 4D5 huMAb4D5 8 rhuMAb HER2 trastuzumab or HERCEPTIN U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 is clinically active in patients with HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancers that have received extensive prior anti cancer therapy Baselga et al. 14 737 744 1996 . Trastuzumab received marketing approval from the Food and Drug Administration Sep. 25 1998 for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein.

Other HER2 antibodies with various properties have been described in Tagliabue et al. 47 933 937 1991 McKenzie et al. 4 543 548 1989 Maier et al. 51 5361 5369 1991 Bacus et al. 3 350 362 1990 Stancovski et al. 88 8691 8695 1991 Bacus et al. 52 2580 2589 1992 Xu et al. 53 401 408 1993 WO94 00136 Kasprzyk et al. 52 2771 2776 1992 Hancock et al. 51 4575 4580 1991 Shawver et al. 54 1367 1373 1994 Arteaga et al. 54 3758 3765 1994 Harwerth et al. 267 15160 15167 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 783 186 and Klapper et al. 14 2099 2109 1997 .

Homology screening resulted in the identification of two other HER receptor family members HER3 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 968 511 5 183 884 and 5 480 968 as well as Kraus et al. 86 9193 9197 1989 and HER4 EP Pat Appln No 599 274 Plowman et al. 90 1746 1750 1993 and Plowman et al. 366 473 475 1993 . Both of these receptors display increased expression on at least some breast cancer cell lines.

The HER receptors are generally found in various combinations in cells and heterodimerization is thought to increase the diversity of cellular responses to a variety of HER ligands Earp et al. 35 115 132 1995 . EGFR is bound by six different ligands epidermal growth factor EGF transforming growth factor alpha TGF amphiregulin heparin binding epidermal growth factor HB EGF betacellulin and epiregulin Groenen et al. 11 235 257 1994 . A family of heregulin proteins resulting from alternative splicing of a single gene are ligands for HER3 and HER4. The heregulin family includes alpha beta and gamma heregulins Holmes et al. 256 1205 1210 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 869 and Schaefer et al. 15 1385 1394 1997 neu differentiation factors NDFs glial growth factors GGFs acetylcholine receptor inducing activity ARIA and sensory and motor neuron derived factor SMDF . For a review see Groenen et al. 11 235 257 1994 Lemke G. . 7 247 262 1996 and Lee et al. 47 51 85 1995 . Three additional HER ligands have been identified neuregulin 2 NRG 2 which is reported to bind either HER3 or HER4 Chang et al. Nature 387 509 512 1997 and Carraway et al 387 512 516 1997 neuregulin 3 which binds HER4 Zhang et al. 94 18 9562 7 1997 and neuregulin 4 which binds HER4 Harari et al. 18 2681 89 1999 HB EGF betacellulin and epiregulin also bind to HER4.

While EGF and TGF do not bind HER2 EGF stimulates EGFR and HER2 to form a heterodimer which activates EGFR and results in transphosphorylation of HER2 in the heterodimer Dimerization and or transphosphorylation appears to activate the HER2 tyrosine kinase. See Earp et al. supra. Likewise when HER3 is co expressed with HER2 an active signaling complex is formed and antibodies directed against HER2 are capable of disrupting this complex Sliwkowski et al. 269 20 14661 14665 1994 . Additionally the affinity of HER3 for heregulin HRG is increased to a higher affinity state when co expressed with HER2. See also Levi et al. 15 1329 1340 1995 Morrissey et al. 92 1431 1435 1995 and Lewis et al. 56 1457 1465 1996 with respect to the HER2 HER3 protein complex. HER4 like HER3 forms an active signaling complex with HER2 Carraway and Cantley 78 5 8 1994 .

Therapeutics that target the HER pathway are presently in use in treating diseases such as breast cancer non small cell lung cancer colorectal cancer head and neck cancer and pancreatic cancer. While these therapeutics have had some success there remain issues related to native and induced resistance and toxicity. Arteaga C L. 21 289 91s 2003 Hoshi S et al. 31 1209 13 2004 Viloria Petit A M and Kerbel R S. 58 914 26 2004 Bianco R et al. 12 S159 71 2005 Engelman J A and Janne P A. 14 2895 9 2008 Davoli A et al. 65 4 611 23 2010 Pohlmann P R et al. 15 24 7479 7491 2009 . In particular therapeutics that target HER1 EGFR are often associated with undesirable side effects such as significant levels of skin toxicity. Robert et al. 6 491 500 2005 .

The term antibody herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies multispecific antibodies and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. The term multispecific antibody is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers an antibody comprising an antigen binding domain that has polyepitopic specificity i.e. is capable of specifically binding to two or more different epitopes on one biological molecule or is capable of specifically binding to epitopes on two or more different biological molecules . One specific example of an antigen binding domain is a VVunit comprised of a heavy chain variable domain V and a light chain variable domain V . Such multispecific antibodies include but are not limited to full length antibodies antibodies having two or more Vand Vdomains antibody fragments such as Fab Fv dsFv scFv diabodies bispecific diabodies and triabodies antibody fragments that have been linked covalently or non covalently. A bispecific antibody is a multispecific antibody comprising an antigen binding domain that is capable of specifically binding to two different epitopes on one biological molecule or is capable of specifically binding to epitopes on two different biological molecules. The bispecific antibody is also referred to herein as having dual specificity or as being dual specific .

In certain embodiments an antibody of the invention has a dissociation constant Kd of 1 M 100 nM 10 nM 1 nM 0.1 nM 0.01 nM or 0.001 nM e.g. 10M or less e.g. from 10M to 10M e.g. from 10M to 10M for its target HER or HERs.

The basic 4 chain antibody unit is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein composed of two identical light L chains and two identical heavy H chains an IgM antibody consists of 5 of the basic heterotetramer units along with an additional polypeptide called J chain and therefore contains 10 antigen binding sites while secreted IgA antibodies can polymerize to form polyvalent assemblages comprising 2 5 of the basic 4 chain units along with J chain . In the case of IgGs the 4 chain unit is generally about 150 000 daltons. Each L chain is linked to an H chain by one covalent disulfide bond while the two H chains are linked to each other by one or more disulfide bonds depending on the H chain isotype. Each H and L chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each H chain has at the N terminus a variable domain V followed by three constant domains C for each of the and chains and four Cdomains for and isotypes. Each L chain has at the N terminus a variable domain V followed by a constant domain C at its other end. The Vis aligned with the Vand the Cis aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain C1 . Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains. The pairing of a Vand Vtogether forms a single antigen binding site. For the structure and properties of the different classes of antibodies see e.g. 8th edition Daniel P. Stites Abba I. Ten and Tristram G. Parslow eds. Appleton Lange Norwalk Conn. 1994 page 71 and Chapter 6.

The L chain from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types called kappa and lambda based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains C immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes or isotypes. There are five classes of immunoglobulins IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM having heavy chains designated and respectively. The and classes are further divided into subclasses on the basis of relatively minor differences in Csequence and function e.g. humans express the following subclasses IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA1 and IgA2.

The term variable refers to the fact that certain segments of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies. The V domain mediates antigen binding and defines specificity of a particular antibody for its particular antigen. However the variability is not evenly distributed across the 110 amino acid span of the variable domains. Instead the V regions consist of relatively invariant stretches called framework regions FRs of 15 30 amino acids separated by shorter regions of extreme variability called hypervariable regions or HVR. The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs largely adopting a beta sheet configuration connected by three hypervariable regions which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the beta sheet structure. The hypervariable regions in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and with the hypervariable regions from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies see Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC .

The term hypervariable region HVR or HV when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and or form structurally defined loops. Generally antibodies comprise six HVRs three in the VH HVR H1 HVR H2 HVR H3 and three in the VL HVR L1 HVR L2 HVR L3 . In native antibodies H3 and L3 display the most diversity of the six HVRs and H3 in particular is believed to play a unique role in conferring fine specificity to antibodies. See e.g. Xu et al. Immunity 13 37 45 2000 Johnson and Wu in 248 1 25 Lo ed. Human Press Totowa N.J. 2003 . Indeed naturally occurring camelid antibodies consisting of a heavy chain only are functional and stable in the absence of light chain. See e.g. Hamers Casterman et al. 363 446 448 1993 Sheriff et al. 3 733 736 1996 .

HVRs generally comprise amino acid residues from the hypervariable loops and or from the complementarity determining regions CDRs the latter being of highest sequence variability and or involved in antigen recognition. A number of HVR delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The Kabat Complementarity Determining Regions CDRs are based on sequence variability and are the most commonly used Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops Chothia and Lesk 196 901 917 1987 . The AbM HVRs represent a compromise between the Kabat HVRs and Chothia structural loops and are used by Oxford Molecular s AbM antibody modeling software. The contact HVRs are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures. The residues from each of these HVRs are noted below.

HVRs may comprise extended HVRs as follows 24 36 or 24 34 L1 46 56 or 50 56 L2 and 89 97 or 89 96 L3 in the VL and 26 35 H1 50 65 or 47 65 H2 and 93 102 94 102 or 95 102 H3 in the VH. The variable domain residues are numbered according to Kabat et al. supra for each of these definitions.

 Framework or FR residues are those variable domain residues other than the HVR residues as herein defined.

The term variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat or amino acid position numbering as in Kabat and variations thereof refers to the numbering system used for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al. supra. Using this numbering system the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of or insertion into a FR or HVR of the variable domain. For example a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert residue 52a according to Kabat after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues e.g. residues 82a 82b and 82c etc. according to Kabat after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a standard Kabat numbered sequence.

The Kabat numbering system is generally used when referring to a residue in the variable domain approximately residues 1 107 of the light chain and residues 1 113 of the heavy chain e.g Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . The EU numbering system or EU index is generally used when referring to a residue in an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region e.g. the EU index reported in Kabat et al. supra . The EU index as in Kabat refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody. Unless stated otherwise herein references to residue numbers in the variable domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the Kabat numbering system. Unless stated otherwise herein references to residue numbers in the constant domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the EU numbering system e.g. see WO 2006 073941 .

 Affinity refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule e.g. an antibody and its binding partner e.g. an antigen . Unless indicated otherwise as used herein binding affinity refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1 1 interaction between members of a binding pair e.g. antibody and antigen . The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant Kd . Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art including those described herein.

An affinity matured antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more HVRs or framework region thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration s . In one embodiment an affinity matured antibody has nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies may be produced using certain procedures known in the art. For example Marks et al. Bio Technology 10 779 783 1992 describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of HVR and or framework residues is described by for example Barbas et al. 91 3809 3813 1994 Schier et al. 169 147 155 1995 Yelton et al. 155 1994 2004 1995 Jackson et al. 154 7 3310 9 1995 and Hawkins et al 226 889 896 1992 .

The class of an antibody refers to the type of constant domain or constant region possessed by its heavy chain. There are five major classes of antibodies IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM and several of these may be further divided into subclasses isotypes e.g. IgG IgG IgG IgG IgA and IgA. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called and respectively.

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are substantially similar and bind the same epitope s except for possible variants that may arise during production of the monoclonal antibody such variants generally being present in minor amounts. Such monoclonal antibody typically includes an antibody comprising a variable region that binds a target wherein the antibody was obtained by a process that includes the selection of the antibody from a plurality of antibodies. For example the selection process can be the selection of a unique clone from a plurality of clones such as a pool of hybridoma clones phage clones or recombinant DNA clones. It should be understood that the selected antibody can be further altered for example to improve affinity for the target to humanize the antibody to improve its production in cell culture to reduce its immunogenicity in vivo to create a multispecific antibody etc. and that an antibody comprising the altered variable region sequence is also a monoclonal antibody of this invention. In addition to their specificity the monoclonal antibody preparations are advantageous in that they are typically uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques including the hybridoma method e.g. Kohler et al. Nature 256 495 1975 Harlow et al.

An intact antibody is one which comprises an antigen binding site as well as a Cand at least heavy chain constant domains C1 C2 and C3. The constant domains can be native sequence constant domains e.g. human native sequence constant domains or amino acid sequence variant thereof. Preferably the intact antibody has one or more effector functions.

 Antibody fragments comprise a portion of an intact antibody preferably the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fv Fab Fab F ab Fab SH diabodies linear antibodies see U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870 Example 2 Zapata et al. Protein Eng. 8 10 1057 1062 1995 single chain antibody molecules e.g. scFv . While in the present description and throughout the specification reference is made to antibodies and various properties of antibodies the same disclosure also applies to functional antibody fragments e.g. dual action Fab fragments.

The expression linear antibodies generally refers to the antibodies described in Zapata et al. Protein Eng. 8 10 1057 1062 1995 . These antibodies comprise a pair of tandem Fd segments V C1 V C1 which together with complementary light chain polypeptides form a pair of antigen binding regions. In a preferred embodiment the fragment is functional i.e. qualitatively retains the ability of the corresponding intact antibody to bind to the target HER receptor and if the intact antibody also inhibits HER activation or function qualitatively retains such inhibitory property as well. Qualitative retention means that the activity in kind is retained but the degree of binding affinity and or activity might differ.

Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments called Fab fragments and a residual Fc fragment a designation reflecting the ability to crystallize readily. The Fab fragment consists of an entire L chain along with the variable region domain of the H chain V and the first constant domain of one heavy chain C1 . Pepsin treatment of an antibody yields a single large F ab fragment which roughly corresponds to two disulfide linked Fab fragments having divalent antigen binding activity and is still capable of cross linking antigen. Fab fragments differ from Fab fragments by having additional few residues at the carboxy terminus of the C1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab SH is the designation herein for Fab in which the cysteine residue s of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F ab antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.

The Fc fragment comprises the carboxy terminal portions of both H chains held together by disulfides. The effector functions of antibodies are determined by sequences in the Fc region this region is also the part recognized by Fc receptors FcR found on certain types of cells.

 Fv consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable region domain in tight non covalent association. From the folding of these two domains emanate six hypervariable loops 3 loops each from the H and L chain that contribute the amino acid residues for antigen binding and confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However even a single variable domain or half of an Fv comprising only three HVRs specific for an antigen has the ability to recognize and bind antigen although often at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.

 Single chain Fv also abbreviated as sFv or scFv are antibody fragments that comprise the Vand Vantibody domains connected into a single polypeptide chain. Preferably the sFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the Vand Vdomains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of sFv see Pluckthun in vol. 113 Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer Verlag New York pp. 269 315 1994 Borrebaeck 1995.

The term diabodies refers to small antibody fragments prepared by constructing sFv fragments see preceding paragraph with short linkers about 5 10 residues between the Vand Vdomains such that inter chain but not intra chain pairing of the V domains is achieved resulting in a bivalent fragment i.e. fragment having two antigen binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in for example EP 404 097 WO 93 11161 and Hollinger et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 6444 6448 1993 .

An antibody that binds to the same epitope as a reference antibody refers to an antibody that blocks binding of the reference antibody to its antigen in a competition assay by 50 or more and conversely the reference antibody blocks binding of the antibody to its antigen in a competition assay by 50 or more.

The term chimeric antibody refers to an antibody in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is derived from a particular source or species while the remainder of the heavy and or light chain is derived from a different source or species.

A human antibody is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human or a human cell or derived from a non human source that utilizes human antibody repertoires or other human antibody encoding sequences. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non human antigen binding residues.

A human consensus framework is a framework which represents the most commonly occurring amino acid residues in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH framework sequences. Generally the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally the subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al. Fifth Edition NIH Publication 91 3242 Bethesda Md. 1991 vols. 1 3. In one embodiment for the VL the subgroup is subgroup kappa I as in Kabat et al. supra. In one embodiment for the VH the subgroup is subgroup III as in Kabat et al. supra.

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. rodent antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from the non human antibody. For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or non human primate having the desired antibody specificity affinity and capability. In some instances framework region FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies can comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see Jones et al. Nature 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. Nature 332 323 329 1988 and Presta Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2 593 596 1992 .

An antibody of this invention which binds an antigen of interest is one that binds the antigen with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful as a diagnostic and or therapeutic agent in targeting a protein or a cell or tissue expressing the antigen. With regard to the binding of a antibody to a target molecule the term specific binding or specifically binds to or is specific for a particular polypeptide or an epitope on a particular polypeptide target means binding that is measurably different from a non specific interaction. Specific binding can be measured for example by determining binding of a molecule compared to binding of a control molecule. For example specific binding can be determined by competition with a control molecule that is similar to the target for example an excess of non labeled target. In this case specific binding is indicated if the binding of the labeled target to a probe is competitively inhibited by excess non labeled target. In one particular embodiment specifically binds refers to binding of an antibody to its specified target HER receptors and not other specified non target HER receptors. For example the antibody specifically binds to EGFR and HER3 but does not specifically bind to HER2 or HER4 or the antibody specifically binds to EGFR and HER2 but does not specifically bind to HER3 or HER4 or the antibody specifically binds to EGFR and HER4 but does not specifically bind to HER2 or HER3.

A HER receptor is a receptor protein tyrosine kinase which belongs to the HER receptor family and includes EGFR ErbB1 HER1 HER2 ErbB2 HER3 ErbB3 and HER4 ErbB4 receptors. The HER receptor will generally comprise an extracellular domain which may bind an HER ligand and or dimerize with another HER receptor molecule a lipophilic transmembrane domain a conserved intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and a carboxyl terminal signaling domain harboring several tyrosine residues which can be phosphorylated. The HER receptor may be a native sequence HER receptor or an amino acid sequence variant thereof. Preferably the HER receptor is a native sequence human HER receptor.

 HER activation refers to activation or phosphorylation of any one or more HER receptors. Generally HER activation results in signal transduction e.g. that caused by an intracellular kinase domain of a HER receptor phosphorylating tyrosine residues in the HER receptor or a substrate polypeptide . HER activation may be mediated by HER ligand binding to a HER dimer comprising the HER receptor of interest. HER ligand binding to a HER dimer may activate a kinase domain of one or more of the HER receptors in the dimer and thereby results in phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in one or more of the HER receptors and or phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in additional substrate polypeptides s such as Akt or MAPK intracellular kinases.

 Phosphorylation refers to the addition of one or more phosphate group s to a protein such as a HER receptor or substrate thereof.

A heterodimeric binding site on HER2 refers to a region in the extracellular domain of HER2 that contacts or interfaces with a region in the extracellular domain of EGFR HER3 or HER4 upon formation of a dimer therewith. The region is found in Domain II of HER2. Franklin et al. 5 317 328 2004 .

A HER2 antibody that binds to a heterodimeric binding site of HER2 binds to residues in domain II and optionally also binds to residues in other of the domains of the HER2 extracellular domain such as domains I and III and can sterically hinder at least to some extent formation of a HER2 EGFR HER2 HER3 or HER2 HER4 heterodimer. Franklin et al. 5 317 328 2004 characterize the HER2 pertuzumab crystal structure deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank ID Code IS78 illustrating an exemplary antibody that binds to the heterodimeric binding site of HER2.

An antibody that binds to domain II of HER2 binds to residues in domain II and optionally residues in other domain s of HER2 such as domains I and III.

 Isolated when used to describe the various antibodies disclosed herein means an antibody that has been identified and separated and or recovered from a cell or cell culture from which it was expressed. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would typically interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the polypeptide and can include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or non proteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments the antibody will be purified 1 to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator or 2 to homogeneity by SDS PAGE under non reducing or reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or preferably silver stain. Isolated antibody includes antibodies in situ within recombinant cells because at least one component of the polypeptide natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however isolated polypeptide will be prepared by at least one purification step. In some embodiments the multispecific anti HER antibody is an isolated antibody.

The term control sequences refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes for example include a promoter optionally an operator sequence and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters polyadenylation signals and enhancers.

Nucleic acid is operably linked when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally operably linked means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous and in the case of a secretory leader contiguous and in reading phase. However enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.

 Percent amino acid sequence identity with respect to a reference polypeptide sequence is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the reference polypeptide sequence after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art for instance using publicly available computer software such as BLAST BLAST 2 ALIGN or Megalign DNASTAR software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for aligning sequences including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein however amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN 2. The ALIGN 2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech Inc. and the source code has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office Washington D.C. 20559 where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN 2 program is publicly available from Genentech Inc. South San Francisco Calif. or may be compiled from the source code. The ALIGN 2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system including digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN 2 program and do not vary.

In situations where ALIGN 2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons the amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to with or against a given amino acid sequence B which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain amino acid sequence identity to with or against a given amino acid sequence B is calculated as follows 100 times the fraction X Y

where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN 2 in that program s alignment of A and B and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B the amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the amino acid sequence identity of B to A. Unless specifically stated otherwise all amino acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described in the immediately preceding paragraph using the ALIGN 2 computer program.

 Stringency of hybridization reactions is readily determinable by one of ordinary skill in the art and generally is an empirical calculation dependent upon probe length washing temperature and salt concentration. In general longer probes require higher temperatures for proper annealing while shorter probes need lower temperatures. Hybridization generally depends on the ability of denatured DNA to reanneal when complementary strands are present in an environment below their melting temperature. The higher the degree of desired homology between the probe and hybridizable sequence the higher the relative temperature which can be used. As a result it follows that higher relative temperatures would tend to make the reaction conditions more stringent while lower temperatures less so. For additional details and explanation of stringency of hybridization reactions see Ausubel et al. Wiley Interscience Publishers 1995 .

 Stringent conditions or high stringency conditions as defined herein can be identified by those that 1 employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing for example 0.015 M sodium chloride 0.0015 M sodium citrate 0.1 sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50 C 2 employ during hybridization a denaturing agent such as formamide for example 50 v v formamide with 0.1 bovine serum albumin 0.1 Ficoll 0.1 polyvinylpyrrolidone 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium chloride 75 mM sodium citrate at 42 C. or 3 overnight hybridization in a solution that employs 50 formamide 5 SSC 0.75 M NaCl 0.075 M sodium citrate 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.8 0.1 sodium pyrophosphate 5 Denhardt s solution sonicated salmon sperm DNA 50 g ml 0.1 SDS and 10 dextran sulfate at 42 C. with a 10 minute wash at 42 C. in 0.2 SSC sodium chloride sodium citrate followed by a 10 minute high stringency wash consisting of 0.1 SSC containing EDTA at 55 C.

 Moderately stringent conditions can be identified as described by Sambrook et al. New York Cold Spring Harbor Press 1989 and include the use of washing solution and hybridization conditions e.g. temperature ionic strength and SDS less stringent that those described above. An example of moderately stringent conditions is overnight incubation at 37 C. in a solution comprising 20 formamide 5 SSC 150 mM NaCl 15 mM trisodium citrate 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.6 5 Denhardt s solution 10 dextran sulfate and 20 mg ml denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA followed by washing the filters in 1 SSC at about 37 50 C. The skilled artisan will recognize how to adjust the temperature ionic strength etc. as necessary to accommodate factors such as probe length and the like.

Antibody effector functions refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region of an antibody and vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity Fc receptor binding antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC phagocytosis down regulation of cell surface receptors e.g. B cell receptor and B cell activation.

 Antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity or ADCC refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors FcRs present on certain cytotoxic cells e.g. Natural Killer NK cells neutrophils and macrophages enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. The antibodies arm the cytotoxic cells and are absolutely required for such killing. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9 457 92 1991 . To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest an in vitro ADCC assay such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337 can be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest can be assessed in vivo e.g. in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95 652 656 1998 .

 Fc receptor or FcR describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody a gamma receptor and includes receptors of the Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII subclasses including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc RII receptors include Fc RIIA an activating receptor and Fc RIIB an inhibiting receptor which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif ITAM in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor Fc RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibition motif ITIM in its cytoplasmic domain see review M. in Daeron Annu. Rev. Immunol. 15 203 234 1997 . FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9 457 492 1991 Capel et al. Immunomethods 4 25 34 1994 and de Haas et al. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 126 330 41 1995 . Other FcRs including those to be identified in the future are encompassed by the term FcR herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. J. Immunol. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. J. Immunol. 24 249 1994 .

 Human effector cells are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. Preferably the cells express at least Fc RIII and perform ADCC effector function. Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC natural killer NK cells monocytes cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils with PBMCs and NK cells being preferred. The effector cells can be isolated from a native source e.g. from blood.

 Complement dependent cytotoxicity or CDC refers to the lysis of a target cell in the presence of complement. Activation of the classical complement pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system C1q to antibodies of the appropriate subclass which are bound to their cognate antigen. To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. J. Immunol. Methods 202 163 1996 can be performed.

As used herein treatment and grammatical variations thereof such as treat or treating refers to clinical intervention in an attempt to alter the natural course of the individual being treated and can be performed either for prophylaxis or during the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include but are not limited to preventing occurrence or recurrence of disease alleviation of symptoms diminishment of any direct or indirect pathological consequences of the disease preventing metastasis decreasing the rate of disease progression amelioration or palliation of the disease state and remission or improved prognosis. In some embodiments antibodies of the invention are used to delay development of a disease or to slow the progression of a disease.

The term therapeutically effective amount refers to an amount of an antibody or antibody fragment to treat a disease or disorder in a subject. In the case of tumor e.g. a cancerous tumor the therapeutically effective amount of the antibody or antibody fragment may reduce the number of cancer cells reduce the primary tumor size inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop tumor metastasis inhibit to some extent tumor growth and or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the disorder. To the extent the antibody or antibody fragment may prevent growth and or kill existing cancer cells it may be cytostatic and or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy efficacy in vivo can for example be measured by assessing the duration of survival time to disease progression TTP the response rates RR duration of response and or quality of life.

By reduce or inhibit is meant the ability to cause an overall decrease preferably of 20 or greater more preferably of 50 or greater and most preferably of 75 85 90 95 or greater. Reduce or inhibit can refer to the symptoms of the disorder being treated the presence or size of metastases the size of the primary tumor or the size or number of the blood vessels in angiogenic disorders.

The terms cancer and cancerous refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. Included in this definition are benign and malignant cancers. By early stage cancer is meant a cancer that is not invasive or metastatic or is classified as a Stage 0 I or II cancer.

The term precancerous refers to a condition or a growth that typically precedes or develops into a cancer.

By non metastatic is meant a cancer that is benign or that remains at the primary site and has not penetrated into the lymphatic or blood vessel system or to tissues other than the primary site. Generally a non metastatic cancer is any cancer that is a Stage 0 I or II cancer and occasionally a Stage III cancer.

A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier refers to an ingredient in a pharmaceutical formulation other than an active ingredient which is nontoxic to a subject. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes but is not limited to a buffer excipient stabilizer or preservative.

In certain embodiments the antibodies herein inhibit a biological activity driven at least partially by a HER receptor to which they do not bind. For example antibodies that bind EGFR and HER3 might still be able to inhibit a HER2 driven biological activity.

Inhibition of a biological activity can be measured in assays well known in the art. Thus for example the antibodies herein may inhibit phosphorylation of one or more of the HER receptors and or may inhibit the binding of a HER ligand to its receptor and or may inhibit ligand induced proliferation of HER receptor expressing cells and or may inhibit downstream signaling pathways that are activated via a HER receptor.

Two major downstream signaling pathways that are activated in response to EGFR phosphorylation are the Ras MAPK and the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase PI3K Akt pathways. Therefore the ability of an antibody herein to inhibit the biological activity of a HER receptor can be measured by assessing whether it can block the activation of these pathways for example in NR6 cells. Thus the ability of the antibodies to block ligand induced phosphorylation of p44 42MAPK pAKT or other downstream signaling molecules can be measured. HER3 signaling has also been implicated in several other pathways including c met and FGFR. The ability of an antibody herein to inhibit the biological activity of a HER receptor can be measured by assessing whether it can block the activation of these pathways.

One aspect of invention provides for multispecific antibodies that are generated by diversifying an antibody with specificity for one HER receptor such that it develops specificity for a second HER receptor while retaining specificity for the first HER receptor. In generic terms this method comprises the steps of 1 diversifying the amino acid sequence of a light chain variable domain V of an antibody wherein prior to the diversification the antibody comprised a Vand a heavy chain variable domain V capable of binding to an epitope on a first HER receptor and 2 selecting a diversified antibody capable of binding to the epitope on the first HER receptor and an epitope on a second HER receptor. These steps can be repeated in order to generate multi specific antibodies. A detailed description of this method is provided in United States Patent Publication No. 20080069820 the entire disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein. This method is further illustrated in the Examples. In the method described in the Examples an anti EGFR antibody is used as a template for diversification and thus for the preparation of multispecific anti HER antibodies however other anti HER antibodies such as anti HER2 anti HER3 or anti HER4 antibodies could also serve as a template.

The invention further provides for monospecific antibodies that are capable of specifically binding to one HER receptor and do not specifically bind to the other HER receptors. In one embodiment the antibody specifically binds to EGFR. In one embodiment the antibody specifically binds to Domain III of EGFR. In some embodiments the antibody specifically binds to EGFR and inhibits a biological activity of EGFR. In another embodiment the antibody specifically binds to HER3. In one embodiment the antibody specifically binds to Domain III of HER3. In some embodiments the antibody specifically binds to HER3 and inhibits a biological activity of HER3.

The monospecific antibodies can be used as the template antibody for further diversification to add binding specificity to other HER receptors or to other target antigens.

Toxicity of EGFR antagonists is well documented in both pre clinical and clinical studies. For example the anti EGFR antibody cetuximab exhibits various forms of toxicity at therapeutically effective levels. The most common adverse reactions with cetuximab ERBITUX Imclone incidence 25 are cutaneous adverse reactions including rash pruritus and nail changes headache diarrhea and infection. The most serious adverse reactions associated with cetuximab treatment are infusion reactions cardiopulmonary arrest dermatologic toxicity and radiation dermatitis sepsis renal failure interstitial lung disease and pulmonary embolus. See Biologics License Agreement BLA for cetuximab Application No. 125084 incorporated by reference herein . Similar toxicity issues are observed for panitumumab VECTIBIX Amgen where dermatologic toxicity occurred in 89 of patients administered this antibody. These toxicities were severe CTC grade 3 and higher. VECTIBIX FDA label. 

The anti EGFR chemotherapeutic agent erlotinib has been reported to cause in some instances acute renal failure or renal insufficiency hepatic failure and or hepatorenal syndrome gastrointestinal perforations bullous and exfoliative skin disorders and corneal ulceration and perforation. See FDA Warnings and Precautions safety labeling for erlotinib TARCEVA Genentech OSI Pharmaceuticals 2009 .

 Toxic or toxicity refers to any adverse effect caused by an agent when administered to a subject. Measures of toxicity include but are not limited to mortality loss of body weight organ failure altered organ function central nervous system toxicity gastrointestinal toxicity as indicated for example by diarrhea dermatologic toxicity as indicated for example by appearance of rash skin lesion desquamation or pruritus cardiac toxicity infection sepsis and cytotoxicity.

Toxicity can be determined by methods known in the art such as monitoring clinical cage side observations body weight food consumption respiration rate pulse oximetry measurements physical examination ophthalmic evaluations neurological evaluations metabolic parameters cardiovascular parameters clinical pathology including clinical chemistry hematology urinalysis and coagulation parameters and macroscopic and microscopic pathology.

The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 CTCAE prepared by the National Cancer Institute incorporated by reference in its entirety herein provides information regarding particular accepted indicators of toxicity in human subjects. provides information regarding observed non clinical and clinical toxicities for EGFR antagonist therapies.

Toxicity can be measured in terms of total toxic events or severity of the toxic event events. Severity of the events can be described using the grading system set up in the CTCAE. Grades are assigned each adverse event using unique clinical descriptions of severity based on the general guideline that Grade 1 refers to a mild event Grade 2 refers to a moderate event Grade 3 refers to a severe event Grade 4 refers to a life threatening or disabling event and Grade 5 refers to a death related to the event. The CTCAE provides the specific clinical descriptions for the toxic events. The descriptors for dermatologic toxicity are provided beginning at page 14 of the CTCAE v.3. As an example shows grading for rash desquamation and acne acneiform rash. CTCAE v.3 There are a number of models known in the art that are used to monitor for potential indicators of toxicity including but not limited to in vitro cell based models and in vivo non human animal models. Toxicity is also monitored in human subjects in clinical trial studies.

In one particular embodiment toxicity is measured in cynomolgus monkeys. The toxic effect of EGFR antagonists in cynomolgus monkeys is well documented. As set forth in the Biologics License Agreement BLA for cetuximab Application No. 125084 incorporated by reference herein all monkeys receiving cetuximab exhibited mild to severe lesions on the skin consisting of scale formation reddening erythema dermatitis fissures wounds and exanthema and or hair thinning or loss. The dermatologic toxicity was dose dependent in both severity and time of onset where severity for high mid and low doses were severe moderate and mild and time of onset occurred on Study Days 15 22 and 64 respectively. Secondary complications of severe skin lesions were bacterial infection or sepsis with subsequent mortality or euthanasia of 50 of the animals in the high dose group. Other dose related toxicities included changes in certain clinical pathology parameters associated with macroscopic and microscopic evidence of cellular and tissue damage in the liver bone marrow spleen and lymphoid organs.

As set forth in the Examples cynomolgus monkeys dosed with a bispecific antibody that specifically binds to EGFR and HER3 exhibited fewer incidences of toxicity as indicated by dermal lesions as compared to cynomolgus monkeys dosed with an equal amount of the EGFR antagonist cetuximab. One of three cynomolgus monkeys dosed with 25 mg kg of the bispecific antibody developed dermal lesions whereas 3 of 3 cynomolgus monkeys dosed with 25 mg kg of cetuximab developed dermal lesions. The lesion that occurred in a bispecific antibody dosed monkey was less severe than the lesions of the cetuximab dosed monkeys and the onset of the lesion was delayed. The animal dosed with the bispecific antibody developed the skin lesion one week after the last sixth dose compared to the monkeys dosed with cetuximab where the onset of dermal lesions occurred after the third dose in all animals.

In clinical studies of cetuximab dermatologic toxicities including acneiform rash skin drying and fissuring and inflammatory and infectious sequelae were observed. The reported incidence of dermatologic toxicity was as high as 89 for those patients with advanced colorectal cancer .

Models of skin toxicity are known and can be used to determine dermatologic toxicity of the antibodies. Examples of such models include human epidermal keratinocytes NHEK Clonetics San Diego Calif. Lonza Bioscience Walkersville Md. HEKa Cascade Biologics Portland Oreg. Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. and reconstituted human epidermis EpiDerm cultures MatTek Ashland Mass. . These models can be used to examine the effect of the antibodies on cellular proliferation gene expression protein expression receptor phosphorylation cell viability and changes in histopathology.

A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called alanine scanning mutagenesis as described by Cunningham and Wells 1989 244 1081 1085. Here a residue or group of target residues are identified e.g. charged residues such as arg asp his lys and glu and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid e.g. alanine or polyalanine to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at or for the sites of substitution. Thus while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed immunoglobulins are screened for the desired activity.

Amino acid sequence insertions include amino and or carboxyl terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N terminal methionyl residue. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N or C terminus of the antibody to an enzyme e.g. for ADEPT or a polypeptide which increases the serum half life of the antibody.

In certain embodiments an antibody of the invention is altered to increase or decrease the extent to which the antibody is glycosylated. Glycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N linked or O linked. N linked refers to the attachment of a carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine X serine and asparagine X threonine where X is any amino acid except proline are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N aceylgalactosamine galactose or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid most commonly serine or threonine although 5 hydroxyproline or 5 hydroxylysine may also be used.

Addition or deletion of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that one or more of the above described tripeptide sequences for N linked glycosylation sites is created or removed. The alteration may also be made by the addition deletion or substitution of one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody for O linked glycosylation sites .

Where the antibody comprises an Fc region the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. Native antibodies produced by mammalian cells typically comprise a branched biantennary oligosaccharide that is generally attached by an N linkage to Asn297 of the CH2 domain of the Fc region. See e.g. Wright et al. 1997 15 26 32. The oligosaccharide may include various carbohydrates e.g. mannose N acetyl glucosamine GlcNAc galactose and sialic acid as well as a fucose attached to a GlcNAc in the stem of the biantennary oligosaccharide structure. In some embodiments modifications of the oligosaccharide in an antibody of the invention may be made in order to create antibody variants with certain improved properties.

In one embodiment antibody variants are provided having a carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached directly or indirectly to an Fc region. For example the amount of fucose in such antibody may be from 1 to 80 from 1 to 65 from 5 to 65 or from 20 to 40 . The amount of fucose is determined by calculating the average amount of fucose within the sugar chain at Asn297 relative to the sum of all glycostructures attached to Asn 297 e.g. complex hybrid and high mannose structures as measured by MALDI TOF mass spectrometry as described in WO 2008 077546 for example. Asn297 refers to the asparagine residue located at about position 297 in the Fc region Eu numbering of Fc region residues however Asn297 may also be located about 3 amino acids upstream or downstream of position 297 i.e. between positions 294 and 300 due to minor sequence variations in antibodies. Such fucosylation variants may have improved ADCC function. See e.g. US Patent Publication Nos. US 2003 0157108 Presta L. US 2004 0093621 Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd . Examples of publications related to defucosylated or fucose deficient antibody variants include US 2003 0157108 WO 2000 61739 WO 2001 29246 US 2003 0115614 US 2002 0164328 US 2004 0093621 US 2004 0132140 US 2004 0110704 US 2004 0110282 US 2004 0109865 WO 2003 085119 WO 2003 084570 WO 2005 035586 WO 2005 035778 WO2005 053742 WO2002 031140 Okazaki et al. 336 1239 1249 2004 Yamane Ohnuki et al. 87 614 2004 .

Antibodies variants are further provided with bisected oligosaccharides e.g. in which a biantennary oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region of the antibody is bisected by GlcNAc. Such antibody variants may have reduced fucosylation and or improved ADCC function. Examples of such antibody variants are described e.g. in WO 2003 011878 Jean Mairet et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 684 Umana et al. and US 2005 0123546 Umana et al. . Antibody variants with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region are also provided. Such antibody variants may have improved CDC function. Such antibody variants are described e.g. in WO 1997 30087 Patel et al. WO 1998 58964 Raju S. and WO 1999 22764 Raju S. .

In certain embodiments one or more amino acid modifications may be introduced into the Fc region of an antibody provided herein thereby generating an Fc region variant. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence e.g. a human IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region comprising an amino acid modification e.g. a substitution at one or more amino acid positions.

In certain embodiments the invention contemplates an antibody variant that possesses some but not all effector functions which make it a desirable candidate for applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions such as complement and ADCC are unnecessary or deleterious. In vitro and or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction depletion of CDC and or ADCC activities. For example Fc receptor FcR binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc R binding hence likely lacking ADCC activity but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 492 1991 . Non limiting examples of in vitro assays to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 see e.g. Hellstrom I. et al. 83 7059 7063 1986 and Hellstrom I et al. 82 1499 1502 1985 U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 see Bruggemann M. et al. 166 1351 1361 1987 . Alternatively non radioactive assays methods may be employed see for example ACTI non radioactive cytotoxicity assay for flow cytometry CellTechnology Inc. Mountain View Calif. and CytoTox 96 non radioactive cytotoxicity assay Promega Madison Wis. . Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. 95 652 656 1998 . C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity. See e.g. C1q and C3c binding ELISA in WO 2006 029879 and WO 2005 100402. To assess complement activation a CDC assay may be performed see for example Gazzano Santoro et al. 202 163 1996 Cragg M. S. et al. 101 1045 1052 2003 and Cragg M. S. and M. J. Glennie 103 2738 2743 2004 . FcRn binding and in vivo clearance half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art see e.g. Petkova S. B. et al. 18 12 1759 1769 2006 .

Antibodies with reduced effector function include those with substitution of one or more of Fc region residues 238 265 269 270 297 327 and 329 U.S. Pat. No. 6 737 056 . Such Fc mutants include Fc mutants with substitutions at two or more of amino acid positions 265 269 270 297 and 327 including the so called DANA Fc mutant with substitution of residues 265 and 297 to alanine U.S. Pat. No. 7 332 581 .

Certain antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs are described. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 737 056 WO 2004 056312 and Shields et al. 9 2 6591 6604 2001 . 

In certain embodiments an antibody variant comprises an Fc region with one or more amino acid substitutions which improve ADCC e.g. substitutions at positions 298 333 and or 334 of the Fc region EU numbering of residues .

In some embodiments alterations are made in the Fc region that result in altered i.e. either improved or diminished C1q binding and or Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity CDC e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551 WO 99 51642 and Idusogie et al. 164 4178 4184 2000 .

Antibodies with increased half lives and improved binding to the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. 24 249 1994 are described in US2005 0014934A1 Hinton et al. . Those antibodies comprise an Fc region with one or more substitutions therein which improve binding of the Fc region to FcRn. Such Fc variants include those with substitutions at one or more of Fc region residues 238 256 265 272 286 303 305 307 311 312 317 340 356 360 362 376 378 380 382 413 424 or 434 e.g. substitution of Fc region residue 434 U.S. Pat. No. 7 371 826 .

In certain embodiments it may be desirable to create cysteine engineered antibodies e.g. thioMAbs in which one or more residues of an antibody are substituted with cysteine residues. In particular embodiments the substituted residues occur at accessible sites of the antibody. By substituting those residues with cysteine reactive thiol groups are thereby positioned at accessible sites of the antibody and may be used to conjugate the antibody to other moieties such as drug moieties or linker drug moieties to create an immunoconjugate as described further herein. In certain embodiments any one or more of the following residues may be substituted with cysteine V205 Kabat numbering of the light chain A118 EU numbering of the heavy chain and 5400 EU numbering of the heavy chain Fc region. Cysteine engineered antibodies may be generated as described e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 7 521 541.

In certain embodiments an antibody provided herein may be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. The moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody include but are not limited to water soluble polymers. Non limiting examples of water soluble polymers include but are not limited to polyethylene glycol PEG copolymers of ethylene glycol propylene glycol carboxymethylcellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl pyrrolidone poly 1 3 dioxolane poly 1 3 6 trioxane ethylene maleic anhydride copolymer polyaminoacids either homopolymers or random copolymers and dextran or poly n vinyl pyrrolidone polyethylene glycol propropylene glycol homopolymers prolypropylene oxide ethylene oxide co polymers polyoxyethylated polyols e.g. glycerol polyvinyl alcohol and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary and if more than one polymer are attached they can be the same or different molecules. In general the number and or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including but not limited to the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions etc.

In another embodiment conjugates of an antibody and nonproteinaceous moiety that may be selectively heated by exposure to radiation are provided. In one embodiment the nonproteinaceous moiety is a carbon nanotube Kam et al. 102 11600 11605 2005 . The radiation may be of any wavelength and includes but is not limited to wavelengths that do not harm ordinary cells but which heat the nonproteinaceous moiety to a temperature at which cells proximal to the antibody nonproteinaceous moiety are killed. See for example Petkova S. B. et al. 18 12 1759 1769 2006 .

Other antibody variants having one or more amino acid substitutions are provided. Sites of interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of preferred substitutions. More substantial changes denominated exemplary substitutions are provided in Table 4 or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes. Amino acid substitutions may be introduced into an antibody of interest and the products screened e.g. for a desired activity such as improved antigen binding decreased immunogenicity improved ADCC or CDC etc.

Modifications in the biological properties of an antibody may be accomplished by selecting substitutions that affect a the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution for example as a sheet or helical conformation b the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site or c the bulk of the side chain. Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains in A. L. Lehninger in Biochemistry second ed. pp. 73 75 Worth Publishers New York 1975 

Alternatively naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common side chain properties 

Non conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Such substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution sites or into the remaining non conserved sites.

One type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody e.g. a humanized or human antibody . Generally the resulting variant s selected for further development will have modified e.g. improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. An exemplary substitutional variant is an affinity matured antibody which may be conveniently generated using phage display based affinity maturation techniques. Briefly several hypervariable region sites e.g. 6 7 sites are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibodies thus generated are displayed from filamentous phage particles as fusions to at least part of a phage coat protein e.g. the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity e.g. binding affinity . In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification scanning mutagenesis e.g. alanine scanning can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively or additionally it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to techniques known in the art including those elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated the panel of variants is subjected to screening using techniques known in the art including those described herein and variants with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.

Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include but are not limited to isolation from a natural source in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants or preparation by oligonucleotide mediated or site directed mutagenesis PCR mutagenesis and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non variant version of the antibody.

The invention also provides immunoconjugates interchangeably referred to as antibody drug conjugates or ADCs comprising an antibody conjugated to one or more cytotoxic agents such as a chemotherapeutic agent a drug a growth inhibitory agent a toxin e.g. a protein toxin an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin or fragments thereof or a radioactive isotope such as At I I Y Re Re Sm Bi P Pband radioactive isotopes of Lu i.e. a radioconjugate .

Immunoconjugates have been used for the local delivery of cytotoxic agents i.e. drugs that kill or inhibit the growth or proliferation of cells in the treatment of cancer Lambert J. 2005 5 543 549 Wu et al 2005 23 9 1137 1146 Payne G. 2003 i 3 207 212 Syrigos and Epenetos 1999 19 605 614 Niculescu Duvaz and Springer 1997 26 151 172 U.S. Pat.

Toxins used in antibody toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin plant toxins such as ricin small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin Mandler et al 2000 92 19 1573 1581 Mandler et al 2000 10 1025 1028 Mandler et al 2002 13 786 791 maytansinoids EP 1391213 Liu et al. 1996 93 8618 8623 and calicheamicin Lode et al 1998 58 2928 Hinman et al 1993 53 3336 3342 . The toxins may exert their cytotoxic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding DNA binding or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.

In certain embodiments an immunoconjugate comprises an antibody and a chemotherapeutic agent or other toxin. Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of immunoconjugates are described herein e.g. above . Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See e.g. WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include Bi I In Y and Re. Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithiol propionate SPDP iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. Science 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026.

Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins such as a calicheamicin maytansinoids dolastatins aurostatins a trichothecene and CC1065 and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity are also contemplated herein.

In some embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody full length or fragments conjugated to one or more maytansinoid molecules.

Maytansinoids are mitototic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub U.S. Pat. No. 3 896 111 . Subsequently it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids such as maytansinol and C 3 maytansinol esters U.S. Pat. No. 4 151 042 . Synthetic maytansinol and derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 137 230 4 248 870 4 256 746 4 260 608 4 265 814 4 294 757 4 307 016 4 308 268 4 308 269 4 309 428 4 313 946 4 315 929 4 317 821 4 322 348 4 331 598 4 361 650 4 364 866 4 424 219 4 450 254 4 362 663 and 4 371 533.

Maytansinoid drug moieties are attractive drug moieties in antibody drug conjugates because they are i relatively accessible to prepare by fermentation or chemical modification derivatization of fermentation products ii amenable to derivatization with functional groups suitable for conjugation through the non disulfide linkers to antibodies iii stable in plasma and iv effective against a variety of tumor cell lines.

Immunoconjugates containing maytansinoids methods of making same and their therapeutic use are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 208 020 5 416 064 and European Patent EP 0 425 235 B1 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Liu et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 8618 8623 1996 described immunoconjugates comprising a maytansinoid designated DM1 linked to the monoclonal antibody C242 directed against human colorectal cancer. The conjugate was found to be highly cytotoxic towards cultured colon cancer cells and showed antitumor activity in an in vivo tumor growth assay. Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 describe immunoconjugates in which a maytansinoid was conjugated via a disulfide linker to the murine antibody A7 binding to an antigen on human colon cancer cell lines or to another murine monoclonal antibody TA.1 that binds the HER 2 neu oncogene. The cytotoxicity of the TA.1 maytansinoid conjugate was tested in vitro on the human breast cancer cell line SK BR 3 which expresses 3 105 HER 2 surface antigens per cell. The drug conjugate achieved a degree of cytotoxicity similar to the free maytansinoid drug which could be increased by increasing the number of maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule. The A7 maytansinoid conjugate showed low systemic cytotoxicity in mice.

Antibody maytansinoid conjugates are prepared by chemically linking an antibody to a maytansinoid molecule without significantly diminishing the biological activity of either the antibody or the maytansinoid molecule. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference . An average of 3 4 maytansinoid molecules conjugated per antibody molecule has shown efficacy in enhancing cytotoxicity of target cells without negatively affecting the function or solubility of the antibody although even one molecule of toxin antibody would be expected to enhance cytotoxicity over the use of naked antibody. Maytansinoids are well known in the art and can be synthesized by known techniques or isolated from natural sources. Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 and in the other patents and nonpatent publications referred to hereinabove. Preferred maytansinoids are maytansinol and maytansinol analogues modified in the aromatic ring or at other positions of the maytansinol molecule such as various maytansinol esters.

There are many linking groups known in the art for making antibody maytansinoid conjugates including for example those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 or EP Patent 0 425 235 B1 Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 960 602 filed Oct. 8 2004 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Antibody maytansinoid conjugates comprising the linker component SMCC may be prepared as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 960 602 filed Oct. 8 2004. The linking groups include disulfide groups thioether groups acid labile groups photolabile groups peptidase labile groups or esterase labile groups as disclosed in the above identified patents disulfide and thioether groups being preferred. Additional linking groups are described and exemplified herein.

Conjugates of the antibody and maytansinoid may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . Particularly preferred coupling agents include N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP Carlsson et al. Biochem. J. 173 723 737 1978 and N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate SPP to provide for a disulfide linkage.

The linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions depending on the type of the link. For example an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group using conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C 3 position having a hydroxyl group the C 14 position modified with hydroxymethyl the C 15 position modified with a hydroxyl group and the C 20 position having a hydroxyl group. In a preferred embodiment the linkage is formed at the C 3 position of maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.

In some embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody conjugated to dolastatins or dolostatin peptidic analogs and derivatives the auristatins U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 635 483 5 780 588 . Dolastatins and auristatins have been shown to interfere with microtubule dynamics GTP hydrolysis and nuclear and cellular division Woyke et al 2001 Antimicrob. Agents and Chemother. 45 12 3580 3584 and have anticancer U.S. Pat. No. 5 663 149 and antifungal activity Pettit et al 1998 Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 42 2961 2965 . The dolastatin or auristatin drug moiety may be attached to the antibody through the N amino terminus or the C carboxyl terminus of the peptidic drug moiety WO 02 088172 .

No. 10 983 340 filed Nov. 5 2004 the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Typically peptide based drug moieties can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more amino acids and or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared for example according to the liquid phase synthesis method see E. Schroder and K. L bke The Peptides volume 1 pp 76 136 1965 Academic Press that is well known in the field of peptide chemistry. The auristatin dolastatin drug moieties may be prepared according to the methods of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 635 483 5 780 588 Pettit et al 1989 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111 5463 5465 Pettit et al 1998 Anti Cancer Drug Design 13 243 277 Pettit G. R. et al. Synthesis 1996 719 725 and Pettit et al 1996 J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1 5 859 863.

No. 10 983 340 filed Nov. 5 2004 hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety disclosing e.g. linkers and methods of preparing monomethylvaline compounds such as MMAE and MMAF conjugated to linkers .

In other embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double stranded DNA breaks at sub picomolar concentrations. For the preparation of conjugates of the calicheamicin family see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 712 374 5 714 586 5 739 116 5 767 285 5 770 701 5 770 710 5 773 001 5 877 296 all to American Cyanamid Company . Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include but are not limited to 1I 2I 3I N acetyl 1I PSAG and I1 Hinman et al. Cancer Research 53 3336 3342 1993 Lode et al. Cancer Research 58 2925 2928 1998 and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid . Another anti tumor drug that the antibody can be conjugated is QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore cellular uptake of these agents through antibody mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects.

Other antitumor agents that can be conjugated to the antibodies include BCNU streptozoicin vincristine and 5 fluorouracil the family of agents known collectively LL E33288 complex described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 053 394 5 770 710 as well as esperamicins U.S. Pat. No. 5 877 296 .

Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See for example WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993.

The present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity e.g. a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease DNase .

For selective destruction of the tumor the antibody may comprise a highly radioactive atom. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include At I I Y Re Re Sm Bi P Pband radioactive isotopes of Lu. When the conjugate is used for detection it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies for example tc99m or 1123 or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance NMR imaging also known as magnetic resonance imaging mri such as iodine 123 again iodine 131 indium 111 fluorine 19 carbon 13 nitrogen 15 oxygen 17 gadolinium manganese or iron.

The radio or other labels may be incorporated in the conjugate in known ways. For example the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving for example fluorine 19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as tcm or I Re Reand Incan be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium 90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method Fraker et al 1978 Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun 80 49 57 can be used to incorporate iodine 123. Monoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy Chatal CRC Press 1989 describes other methods in detail.

Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. Science 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026. The linker may be a cleavable linker facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example an acid labile linker peptidase sensitive linker photolabile linker dimethyl linker or disulfide containing linker Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 may be used.

The compounds expressly contemplate but are not limited to ADC prepared with cross linker reagents BMPS EMCS GMBS HBVS LC SMCC MBS MPBH SBAP SIA STAB SMCC SMPB SMPH sulfo EMCS sulfo GMBS sulfo KMUS sulfo MBS sulfo STAB sulfo SMCC and sulfo SMPB and SVSB succinimidyl 4 vinylsulfone benzoate which are commercially available e.g. from Pierce Biotechnology Inc. Rockford Ill. U.S.A . See pages 467 498 2003 2004 Applications Handbook and Catalog.

In the antibody drug conjugates ADC an antibody Ab is conjugated to one or more drug moieties D e.g. about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody through a linker L . The ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes employing organic chemistry reactions conditions and reagents known to those skilled in the art including 1 reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent to form Ab L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with a drug moiety D and 2 reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a bivalent linker reagent to form D L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group of an antibody. Additional methods for preparing ADC are described herein. Ab L D I

The linker may be composed of one or more linker components. Exemplary linker components include 6 maleimidocaproyl MC maleimidopropanoyl MP valine citrulline val cit alanine phenylalanine ala phe p aminobenzyloxycarbonyl PAB N Succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate SPP N Succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC and N Succinimidyl 4 iodo acetyl aminobenzoate SIAB . Additional linker components are known in the art and some are described herein. See also Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands U.S. Ser. No. 10 983 340 filed Nov. 5 2004 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In some embodiments the linker may comprise amino acid residues. Exemplary amino acid linker components include a dipeptide a tripeptide a tetrapeptide or a pentapeptide. Exemplary dipeptides include valine citrulline vc or val cit alanine phenylalanine af or ala phe . Exemplary tripeptides include glycine valine citrulline gly val cit and glycine glycine glycine gly gly gly . Amino acid residues which comprise an amino acid linker component include those occurring naturally as well as minor amino acids and non naturally occurring amino acid analogs such as citrulline. Amino acid linker components can be designed and optimized in their selectivity for enzymatic cleavage by a particular enzymes for example a tumor associated protease cathepsin B C and D or a plasmin protease.

Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include but are not limited to i N terminal amine groups ii side chain amine groups e.g. lysine iii side chain thiol groups e.g. cysteine and iv sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine thiol and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT dithiothreitol . Each cysteine bridge will thus form theoretically two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody or fragment thereof by introducing one two three four or more cysteine residues e.g. preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non native cysteine amino acid residues .

Antibody drug conjugates may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties which can react with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage or may be reduced e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either glactose oxidase or sodium meta periodate may yield carbonyl aldehyde and ketone groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug Hermanson Bioconjugate Techniques . In another embodiment proteins containing N terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta periodate resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid Geoghegan Stroh 1992 Bioconjugate Chem. 3 138 146 U.S. Pat. No. 5 362 852 . Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.

Likewise nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include but are not limited to amine thiol hydroxyl hydrazide oxime hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups.

Alternatively a fusion protein comprising the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.

In yet another embodiment the antibody may be conjugated to a receptor such streptavidin for utilization in tumor pre targeting wherein the antibody receptor conjugate is administered to the patient followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a ligand e.g. avidin which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a radionucleotide .

Antibodies may be produced using recombinant methods and compositions e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567. In one embodiment isolated nucleic acid encoding an anti HER antibody described herein is provided. Such nucleic acid may encode an amino acid sequence comprising the VL and or an amino acid sequence comprising the VH of the antibody e.g. the light and or heavy chains of the antibody . In a further embodiment one or more vectors e.g. expression vectors comprising such nucleic acid are provided. In a further embodiment a host cell comprising such nucleic acid is provided. In one such embodiment a host cell comprises e.g. has been transformed with 1 a vector comprising a nucleic acid that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising the VL of the antibody and an amino acid sequence comprising the VH of the antibody or 2 a first vector comprising a nucleic acid that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising the VL of the antibody and a second vector comprising a nucleic acid that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising the VH of the antibody. In one embodiment the host cell is eukaryotic e.g. a Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cell or lymphoid cell e.g. Y0 NS0 Sp20 cell . In one embodiment a method of making an anti HER antibody is provided wherein the method comprises culturing a host cell comprising a nucleic acid encoding the antibody as provided above under conditions suitable for expression of the antibody and optionally recovering the antibody from the host cell or host cell culture medium .

For recombinant production of an anti HER antibody nucleic acid encoding an antibody e.g. as described above is isolated and inserted into one or more vectors for further cloning and or expression in a host cell. Such nucleic acid may be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody .

Suitable host cells for cloning or expression of antibody encoding vectors include prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells described herein. For example antibodies may be produced in bacteria in particular when glycosylation and Fc effector function are not needed. For expression of antibody fragments and polypeptides in bacteria see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 648 237 5 789 199 and 5 840 523. See also Charlton Methods in Molecular Biology Vol. 248 B. K. C. Lo ed. Humana Press Totowa N.J. 2003 pp. 245 254 describing expression of antibody fragments in . After expression the antibody may be isolated from the bacterial cell paste in a soluble fraction and can be further purified. In addition to prokaryotes eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for antibody encoding vectors including fungi and yeast strains whose glycosylation pathways have been humanized resulting in the production of an antibody with a partially or fully human glycosylation pattern. See Gerngross Nat. Biotech. 22 1409 1414 2004 and Li et al. Nat. Biotech. 24 210 215 2006 .

Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated antibody are also derived from multicellular organisms invertebrates and vertebrates . Examples of invertebrate cells include plant and insect cells. Numerous baculoviral strains have been identified which may be used in conjunction with insect cells particularly for transfection of cells.

Plant cell cultures can also be utilized as hosts. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 959 177 6 040 498 6 420 548 7 125 978 and 6 417 429 describing PLANTIBODIES technology for producing antibodies in transgenic plants .

Vertebrate cells may also be used as hosts. For example mammalian cell lines that are adapted to grow in suspension may be useful. Other examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 COS 7 human embryonic kidney line 293 or 293 cells as described e.g. in Graham et al. J. Gen Virol. 36 59 1977 baby hamster kidney cells BHK mouse sertoli cells TM4 cells as described e.g. in Mather Biol. Reprod. 23 243 251 1980 monkey kidney cells CV1 African green monkey kidney cells VERO 76 human cervical carcinoma cells HELA canine kidney cells MDCK buffalo rat liver cells BRL 3A human lung cells W138 human liver cells Hep G2 mouse mammary tumor MMT 060562 TRI cells as described e.g. in Mather et al.

Acad. Sci. USA 77 4216 1980 and myeloma cell lines such as Y0 NS0 and Sp2 0. For a review of certain mammalian host cell lines suitable for antibody production see e.g. Yazaki and Wu Methods in Molecular Biology Vol. 248 B. K. C. Lo ed. Humana Press Totowa N.J. pp. 255 268 2003 .

The antibodies and antibody fragments described herein can be used for the treatment of cancer including pre cancerous non metastatic metastatic and cancerous tumors e.g. early stage cancer or for the treatment of a subject at risk for developing cancer for example breast cancer. The antibodies and antibody fragments can also be used to treat or prevent non maligant diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders psychiatric disorders or autoimmune diseases.

The term cancer embraces a collection of proliferative disorders including but not limited to pre cancerous growths benign tumors and malignant tumors. Benign tumors remain localized at the site of origin and do not have the capacity to infiltrate invade or metastasize to distant sites. Malignant tumors will invade and damage other tissues around them. They can also gain the ability to break off from where they started and spread to other parts of the body metastasize usually through the bloodstream or through the lymphatic system where the lymph nodes are located. Primary tumors are classified by the type of tissue from which they arise metastatic tumors are classified by the tissue type from which the cancer cells are derived. Over time the cells of a malignant tumor become more abnormal and appear less like normal cells. This change in the appearance of cancer cells is called the tumor grade and cancer cells are described as being well differentiated moderately differentiated poorly differentiated or undifferentiated. Well differentiated cells are quite normal appearing and resemble the normal cells from which they originated. Undifferentiated cells are cells that have become so abnormal that it is no longer possible to determine the origin of the cells.

The tumor can be a solid tumor or a non solid or soft tissue tumor. Examples of soft tissue tumors include leukemia e.g. chronic myelogenous leukemia acute myelogenous leukemia adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia acute myelogenous leukemia mature B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia chronic lymphocytic leukemia polymphocytic leukemia or hairy cell leukemia or lymphoma e.g. non Hodgkin s lymphoma cutaneous T cell lymphoma or Hodgkin s disease . A solid tumor includes any cancer of body tissues other than blood bone marrow or the lymphatic system. Solid tumors can be further separated into those of epithelial cell origin and those of non epithelial cell origin. Examples of epithelial cell solid tumors include tumors of the gastrointestinal tract colon breast prostate lung kidney liver pancreas ovary head and neck oral cavity stomach duodenum small intestine large intestine anus gall bladder labium nasopharynx skin uterus male genital organ urinary organs bladder and skin including melanoma . Solid tumors of non epithelial origin include sarcomas brain tumors and bone tumors.

Epithelial cancers generally evolve from a benign tumor to a preinvasive stage e.g. carcinoma in situ to a malignant cancer which has penetrated the basement membrane and invaded the subepithelial stroma.

In one embodiment the multispecific antibodies specifically bind EGFR and at least one other HER receptor such as HER2 or HER3 or HER4 and find utility in the prevention and or treatment of solid tumors in particular colorectal lung such as non small cell lung cancer and squamous cell carcinoma head and neck ovarian skin pancreatic and or breast tumors.

The multispecific antibodies also find use in reducing or preventing resistance to HER pathway targeted treatment. A significant limitation in using treatments that target the HER pathway is the resistance many cancer patients exhibit to the therapeutic effects of the treatment. Some cancer patients show no response to HER pathway targeted treatment. Other cancer patients may show an initial response but then become resistant to the treatment. A cancer is resistant to a treatment if the cancer has progressed while receiving the treatment refractory or if the cancer has progressed within 12 months after completing a treatment regimen relapse .

In one embodiment the HER pathway targeted treatment comprises treatment with antibodies that target the HER pathway for example EGFR antibodies HER2 antibodies HER3 antibodies and or HER4 antibodies . In another embodiment the HER pathway targeted treatment comprises treatment with a chemotherapeutic agent.

The antibody or antibody fragment compositions herein will be formulated dosed and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated the particular mammal being treated the clinical condition of the individual patient the cause of the disorder the site of delivery of the agent the method of administration the scheduling of administration and other factors known to medical practitioners. The therapeutically effective amount of the antibody or antibody fragment to be administered will be governed by such considerations and is the minimum amount necessary to prevent ameliorate or treat a cancer. The antibody or antibody fragment need not be but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat cancer or a risk of developing a cancer. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody or antibody fragment present in the formulation the type of disorder or treatment and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as used hereinbefore or about from 1 to 99 of the heretofore employed dosages. Generally alleviation or treatment of a cancer involves the lessening of one or more symptoms or medical problems associated with the cancer. The therapeutically effective amount of the drug can accomplish one or a combination of the following reduce by at least 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 or more the number of cancer cells reduce or inhibit the tumor size or tumor burden inhibit i.e. to decrease to some extent and or stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs reduce hormonal secretion in the case of adenomas reduce vessel density inhibit tumor metastasis reduce or inhibit tumor growth and or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. In some embodiments the antibody or antibody fragment is used to prevent the occurrence or reoccurrence of cancer in the subject.

In one embodiment the present invention can be used for increasing the duration of survival of a human patient susceptible to or diagnosed with a cancer. Duration of survival is defined as the time from first administration of the drug to death. Duration of survival can also be measured by stratified hazard ratio HR of the treatment group versus control group which represents the risk of death for a patient during the treatment.

In yet another embodiment the treatment of the present invention significantly increases response rate in a group of human patients susceptible to or diagnosed with a cancer who are treated with various anti cancer therapies. Response rate is defined as the percentage of treated patients who responded to the treatment. In one aspect the combination treatment of the invention using an antibody or antibody fragment and surgery radiation therapy or one or more chemotherapeutic agents significantly increases response rate in the treated patient group compared to the group treated with surgery radiation therapy or chemotherapy alone the increase having a Chi square p value of less than 0.005.

Additional measurements of therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of cancers are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20050186208.

Therapeutic formulations are prepared using standard methods known in the art by mixing the active ingredient having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 20.sup.th edition ed. A. Gennaro 2000 Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. . Acceptable carriers include saline or buffers such as phosphate citrate and other organic acids antioxidants including ascorbic acid low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptides proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagines arginine or lysine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol salt forming counterions such as sodium and or nonionic surfactants such as TWEEN PLURONICS or PEG.

Optionally but preferably the formulation contains a pharmaceutically acceptable salt preferably sodium chloride and preferably at about physiological concentrations. Optionally the formulations of the invention can contain a pharmaceutically acceptable preservative. In some embodiments the preservative concentration ranges from 0.1 to 2.0 typically v v. Suitable preservatives include those known in the pharmaceutical arts. Benzyl alcohol phenol m cresol methylparaben and propylparaben are preferred preservatives. Optionally the formulations of the invention can include a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant at a concentration of 0.005 to 0.02 .

The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.

The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsule and poly methylmethacylate microcapsule respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences supra.

Sustained release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsule. Examples of sustained release matrices include polyesters hydrogels for example poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylalcohol polylactides U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 copolymers of L glutamic acid and .gamma. ethyl L glutamate non degradable ethylene vinyl acetate degradable lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate and poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene vinyl acetate and lactic acid glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated antibodies remain in the body for a long time they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37 C. resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S S bond formation through thio disulfide interchange stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues lyophilizing from acidic solutions controlling moisture content using appropriate additives and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.

The antibodies and antibody fragments described herein are administered to a human subject in accord with known methods such as intravenous administration as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time by intramuscular intraperitoneal intracerobrospinal subcutaneous intra articular intrasynovial intrathecal oral topical or inhalation routes. Local administration may be particularly desired if extensive side effects or toxicity is associated with HER e.g. EGFR HER2 HER3 HER4 etc. antagonism. An ex vivo strategy can also be used for therapeutic applications. Ex vivo strategies involve transfecting or transducing cells obtained from the subject with a polynucleotide encoding an antibody or antibody fragment. The transfected or transduced cells are then returned to the subject. The cells can be any of a wide range of types including without limitation hemopoietic cells e.g. bone marrow cells macrophages monocytes dendritic cells T cells or B cells fibroblasts epithelial cells endothelial cells keratinocytes or muscle cells.

In one example the antibody or antibody fragment is administered locally e.g. by direct injections when the disorder or location of the tumor permits and the injections can be repeated periodically. The antibody or antibody fragment can also be delivered systemically to the subject or directly to the tumor cells e.g. to a tumor or a tumor bed following surgical excision of the tumor in order to prevent or reduce local recurrence or metastasis.

For the prevention or treatment of disease the appropriate dosage of an antibody of the invention when used alone or in combination with one or more other additional therapeutic agents will depend on the type of disease to be treated the type of antibody the severity and course of the disease whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the antibody and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to 20 mg kg e.g. 0.1 mg kg 15 mg kg of antibody can be an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment would generally be sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of the antibody would be in the range from about 0.05 mg kg to about 20 mg kg. Thus one or more doses of about 0.5 mg kg 2.0 mg kg 4.0 mg kg 10 mg kg 12 mg kg 15 mg kg or 20 mg kg or any combination thereof may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently e.g. every week every two weeks or every three weeks e.g. such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty or e.g. about six doses of the antibody . An initial higher loading dose followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg kg followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg kg of the antibody. However other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.

An antibody of the invention may be combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen as combination therapy with a second compound having anti cancer properties. The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen may have complementary activities to the antibody of the combination such that they do not adversely affect each other. In one embodiment the multispecific antibody is used in combination with another anti HER antibody such as HERCEPTIN pertuzumab and or cetuximab. Antibodies of the invention can also be used in combination with radiation therapy.

The second compound may be a chemotherapeutic agent cytotoxic agent cytokine growth inhibitory agent anti hormonal agent and or cardioprotectant. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. A pharmaceutical composition containing an antibody of the invention may also have a therapeutically effective amount of a chemotherapeutic agent such as a tubulin forming inhibitor a topoisomerase inhibitor a DNA intercalator or a DNA binder.

Other therapeutic regimens may be combined with the administration of an anticancer agent identified in accordance with this invention. The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially the combination may be administered in two or more administrations.

Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturer s instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also described in Chemotherapy Service 1992 Ed. M. C. Perry Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md.

The combination therapy may provide synergy and prove synergistic i.e. the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are 1 co formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined unit dosage formulation 2 delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations or 3 by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially e.g. by different injections in separate syringes. In general during alternation therapy an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially i.e. serially whereas in combination therapy effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.

Enzymes and M13 KO7 helper phage were purchased from New England Biolabs. XL1 Blue was from Stratagene. Bovine serum albumin BSA ovalbumin and Tween 20 were purchased from Sigma. Neutravidin casein and Superblock were purchased from Pierce. anti M13 conjugated horse radish peroxidase HRP was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia. Maxisorp immunoplates were purchased from NUNC Roskilde Denmark . Tetramethylbenzidine TMB substrate was purchased from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories Gaithersburg Md. .

Phage displayed antibody libraries were generated based on human antibody framework from humanized 4D5 h4D5 trastuzumab where side chain and length diversity were incorporated into heavy chain complementarity determining regions CDR1 CDR2 CDR3 in the first library Library 1 and into heavy chain CDRs and light chain CDR3 in the second library Library 2 still focusing on the diversification in heavy chain as described Lee et al. J. Mol. Biol 340 1073 1093 2004 . Libraries were constructed as described Lee et al. J. Mol. Biol 340 1073 1093 2004 except that the degenerate oligonucleotides used were modified modestly.

Library 1 and Library 2 were directly subjected to target hEGFR ECD Fc human EGFR extracellular domain fused to an Fc region of human IgG1 and EGFRvIII Fc binding selection. EGFRvIII Fc protein is a variant of EGFR missing most of domain II E1 P353 not including the signal peptide fused to an Fc region of hIgG1. See Kuan C T et al. Endocrine Related Canc. 8 83 96 2001 Bigner S H et al. Cancer Research 50 8017 8022 1990 . 96 well Nunc Maxisorp plates were coated with 100 l well of target antigen hEGFR ECD Fc EGFRvIII Fc 5 g ml in PBS 0.05M Sodium Carbonate buffer pH9.6 at 4 C overnight or room temperature for 2 hours. The plates were blocked with alternating blocking agents. Phage solutions of 10phage ml 3 5 OD ml were incubated with the coated antigens for 18 h in the first round of selection. Phage input was decreased in each round of selection as following 1round 3 5 O.D ml 2round 3 O.D ml 3round 0.5 1 O.D ml and 4round input 0.1 0.5 O.D ml. The diluted phage was incubated for 30 minutes on ice. 1 M of an Fc Fusion protein was added to the blocked phage from 3round to remove Fc binders. Following incubation of the phage solutions 100 l well to 8 target antigen coated wells and 2 uncoated wells on the immunoplates to allow binding to the immobilized antigen overnight for 1round 2 hours for remaining rounds immunoplates were washed at least ten times continuously with PBS and 0.05 Tween 20. Bound phage was eluted with 100 ul well of 100 mM HCl at room temperature for 20 minutes. The eluted phage from coated wells and background phage from uncoated wells were neutralized by adding 1 10 volume 1M Tris pH 11.0 and BSA to final 0.1 . The recovery of phage per antigen coated immunoplate well was calculated and compared to that of a blocked well without coated antigen to study the enrichment of phage clones displaying Fabs that specifically bound the target antigen. Eluted phage were amplified in and used for further rounds of selection.

Random clones from round 4 were selected for screening and assayed using phage ELISA in which binding to target and anti gD was compared to binding of non relevant proteins BSA HER2 an anti EGFR antibody trastuzumab .

384 well format immunoplates were coated with 1 g ml of target anti gD and non relevant proteins at 4 C. overnight or room temperature for 2 hours and blocked 1 h with 1 BSA in PBS. Phagemid clones in XL1 Blue were grown in 150 ul of 2YT broth supplemented with carbenicillin and M13 KO7 helper phage the cultures were grown with shaking overnight at 37 C. in a 96 well format. Culture supernatants containing phage were diluted five fold in PBST PBS with 0.05 Tween 20 and 0.5 w v BSA . 30 l of mixture was added to each quadrant of 384 well coated plate and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. The plate was washed with PBT PBS with 0.05 Tween 20 and incubated for 30 minutes with anti M13 antibody horse radish peroxidase conjugate diluted 5000 fold to 1 nM in PBST. The plates were washed developed with TMB substrate for approximately five minutes quenched with 1.0 M HPO and read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm.

The clones that bound the anti gD antibody and target but not the non specific proteins were considered specific positives. VH library enabled the isolation of specific binders for both EGFR ECD Fc and EGFRvIII Fc.

The binding affinity of selected binding clones was determined by solution binding competition ELISA.

Selected phagemid clones in XL1 Blue were grown in 20 ml of 2YT broth supplemented with carbenicillin Kanamycin and M13 KO7 helper phage the cultures were grown with shaking overnight at 30 C. Supernatant of phage was purified by double precipitation in 20 PEG 2.5M NaCl resuspended in PBS and read spectrophotometrically at 268 nM for concentration determination in OD ml .

Purified phage was titered on immunoplates coated with 1 g ml of hEGFR ECD Fc to determine optimal concentration for solution competition ELISA.

The dilution that gave a 1 OD ml signal at 450 nM was used in the solution binding assay in which phage were first incubated with increasing concentration of antigen hEGFR ECD for one hour and then transferred to antigen coated immunoplates for 15 minutes to capture unbound phage. ICwas calculated as the concentration of antigen in solution binding stage that inhibited 50 of the phage from binding to immobilized antigen. The solution binding competition ELISA was performed at room temperature. The ICvalues for selected clones ranged from 36.2 nM to 1000 nM.

To accurately determine affinity specificity and other properties selected clones were expressed as free hIgG.

The variable domains of light chain and heavy chain were cloned into vectors previously designed for transient human IgG expression in mammalian cells. Leet et al. J. Mol. Biol. 23 340 1073 1093 2004 .

The Vregion of phagemid DNA was digested with restriction enzymes which cleaved the DNA upstream of the region encoding for CDR L1 EcoRV and downstream of the region encoding for CDR L3 KpnI .

The Vregion of phagemid DNA was digested with restriction enzymes which cleaved the DNA upstream of the region encoding for CDR H1 ApaI and downstream of the region encoding for CDR H3 BsiwI .

Secreted free IgG were purified with protein A affinity chromatography and tested in direct binding ELISA on hEGFR coated immunoplates.

The ability of the isolated anti EGFR antibodies to compete with another anti hEGFR antibody known to bind to domain III of EGFR was studied in order to determine the epitopes recognized by the anti hEGFR antibodies.

The assays were done in a competitive ELISA format. For the competitive ELISA EGFR ECD Fc was immobilized on Maxisorp immunoplates at 2 mg ml. A fixed concentration of the anti EGFR antibody or an unspecific antibody control was captured by coated EGFR ECD Fc and the purified selected anti EGFR phage Fabs were added and detected with M13 conjugated HRP. Antibodies that were blocked from binding EGFR ECD Fc coated plates are likely to share over lapping epitopes.

For the TGF competitive ELISA EGFR ECD Fc was captured first by coated anti human Fc antibody then a fixed concentration of TGF was captured by EGFR ECD Fc. The purified phage Fabs were added and detected with M13 conjugated HRP.

Finally the binding of selected clones to constructs with exposed and deleted domains of EGFR was assessed to confirm previous competitive ELISA. Clone designated D1 competes with the anti EGFR antibody and is likely to bind EGFR at domain III.

order to determine if selected anti EGFR antibody D1 inhibits I EGF binding to H1666 cells ATCC CRL 5885 Manassas Va. the purified IgGs version of D1 was tested in a ligand binding assay as follows. H1666 cells were plated in 12 well plates. The next day growth medium was removed and cells were pretreated with 200 nM antibody for 2 hours at room RT. 20 l well of radiolabelled EGF was added use conc. below Kd of cell line and cells were treated for an additional 2 hours at room temperature. Cells were washed with binding buffer and solubilized transferred and samples were counted using an iso Data counter. Unlabelled EGF was used as a cold competitor. The results demonstrate that D1 inhibits I EGF ligand binding to H1666 cells.

To determine if anti EGFR antibody D1 selectively blocks TGF induced EGFR phosphorylation stably transfected EGFR NR6 cells were serum starved for 2 3 hours and pre incubated with various concentrations of D1 for 2 hours. Cells were stimulated with 1 nM TGF . Whole cell lysates were subjected to SDS PAGE analysis and immunoblots were probed with anti phosphotyrosine and anti EGFR as a loading control. A commercially available anti EGFR antibody was used as a positive control. The data demonstrated that D1 inhibits TGF induced EGFR phosphorylation in a cell based assay.

Two phage displayed libraries L3 H3 and L3 H1H2 libraries were created using oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis as described Lee et al. Blood 108 3103 3111 2006 . The library template vectors contained a stop codon TAA embedded in CDR L3 which was repaired during the mutagenesis reaction using degenerate oligonucleotides that annealed over the sequences encoding CDR L3 all libraries CDR H3 L3 H3 library CDR H2 and CDR H1 L3 H1H2 library . The library mutagenesis reactions were performed according to the method of Kunkel et al Methods Enzymol. 1987 154 367 82 . The oligonucleotides were combined in different ratios to fine tune the diversity to reflect the amino acid frequency in natural repertoire at selected positions. The mutagenesis products were pooled into one reaction per library and electroporated in to SS320 cells and grown supplemented with KO7 helper phage as described Lee et al. 2004 supra .

For affinity improvement selection phage libraries were subjected to plate sorting against hEGFR ECD Fc for the first round followed by three rounds of solution sorting.

Three rounds of solution sorting were performed with increasing stringency of selection Immunoplates were coated with 5 ug ml Neutravidin overnight at 4 C. and blocked with Superblock Pierce and PBST. 3 5 OD ml of propagated phage was pre incubated with 100 nM of biotinylated EGFR ECD in Superblock then diluted 10 and added to blocked immunoplates for 5 10 minutes. Plates were washed 8 times the phage were eluted and propagated for next round of solution sorting decreasing phage input 0.5 OD ml and concentration of biotinylated EGFR ECD down to 1 nM.

Random clones from last round of solution sorting were picked for screening and assayed using phage single point competition ELISA in which binding to target of phage supernatant pre incubated or not with hEGFR ECD is compared.

Phagemid clones in XL1 Blue were grown in 150 ul of 2YT broth supplemented with carbenicillin and M13 KO7 helper phage the cultures were grown with shaking overnight at 37 C. in a 96 well format. Culture supernatants containing phage were diluted five fold in PBST PBS with 0.05 Tween 20 and 0.5 w v BSA with or without 5 nM EGFR EC . The OD reduction was calculated by the following equation ODreduction ODof wells with competitor ODof well with no competitor 100

The binding affinity of selected binding clones by single spot ELISA was determined by solution binding competition ELISA as described above.

The phage IC50s of one clone selected from D1 parent clone affinity maturation D1.5 was determined as described above. The IC50 for D1.5 was 0.39 nM. D1.5 was reformatted into mIgG2A for further characterization using same restriction site described above and vectors designed for transient murine IgG expression in mammalian cells.

Surface plasmon resonance assays on a BIAcore 2000 was used to determine the affinity of anti EGFR mIgG2A. Immobilized mIgG D1.5 on CM5 chips at 150 response units RU were used in the BIAcore assays. Increasing concentration from 12.5 nM to 200 nM of EGFR ECD were injected at 30 l min at 25 C. Binding responses were corrected by subtracting RU from a blank flow cell. For kinetics analysis 1 1 Languir model of simultaneous fitting of kand kwas used. The KD determined by this method for D1.5 was 1.2 nM.

The binding of selected clones to constructs with exposed and deleted domains of EGFR was assessed to confirm inherited binding epitope from parent clones. D1.5 the affinity improved clone selected from D1 sorting binds EGFR at domain III.

D1.5 was tested to determine if it inhibited TGF induced EGFR phosphorylation with higher potency compared to the parental clone. The antibodies were tested on EGFR NR6 cells and the assay was performed as described above in Example 2. A commercially available anti EGFR antibody was used as a positive control.

The results demonstrate that D1.5 showed a greater inhibition of ligand induced EGFR phosphorylation when compared with parent clone D1.

An assay was performed to determine whether D1.5 inhibits cell proliferation of a NSCLC cancer cell line H1666 that expresses EGFR HER2 and HER3 at moderate levels. H1666 cells ATCC CRL 5885 Manassas Va. were seeded in 96 well plates at a density of 5000 cells. The following day cells were simultaneously treated with various concentrations of antibody up to 50 ug ml in 1 serum containing medium. After 3 days Alamar Blue was added and fluorescence was detected using a fluorometer. The results were expressed in RFUs.

An A431 xenograft model was used to validate the in vivo efficacy of affinity matured anti EGFR antibody D1.5. A431 cells are EGFR amplified and respond very well to anti EGFR agents. The study was conducted in nu nu mice and a commercially available anti EGFR antibody was used as a reference.

In a first step the cross reactivity of D1.5 with murine EGFR was assessed in a competitive ELISA. Immunoplates were coated with hEGFR ECD Fc. Serial dilutions of mEGFR ECD Fc were incubated with fixed concentration of D1.5. The results show that D1.5 cross reacted with murine EGFR. To assess the dosing needed for the in vivo efficacy study D1.5 was first injected at a single dose 50 mg kg and serum IgG concentration were measured by ELISA. D1.5 was cleared more rapidly and diminishing concentrations were seen after seven days post injection. The efficacy study A431 xenograft model revealed that D1.5 inhibited tumor growth completely. D1.5 was as effective as the anti EGFR antibody at 50 mg kg. Its reduced potency in the lower dose group 25 mg kg was due to the faster clearance of the antibody. . 

Libraries based on a D1.5 template were designed for diversifying the amino acid composition and CDR length of antibody light chain. A subset of the randomized positions were tailored to represent amino acids which are part of the natural repertoire at these sites whereas the remaining sites were randomized to include all 20 naturally occurring amino acids. In addition randomized positions in CDR L3 were tailored and biased toward the native sequence of the template because this CDR is considered important for the binding of D1.5. For CDR L1 each length was a mix of three oligonucleotides containing codons for positions 28 33. For longer L1 NNK was inserted in between position 30 and 31.

 GACallows 70 of the designated nucleotide and 10 each of the other three to encode approximately 50 Glu and 50 of the other amino acids. See US Patent Publication No. 20080069820 and Bostrom J. et al. Science 323 1610 1614 2009 .

The diversity for CDR L3 is derived from the mixture of the following oligonucleotides. D1.5 CDR L3 oligonucleotides

In all of the libraries the heavy chain was held constant with the parent clone sequence. All library templates contained a stop codon embedded in CDR L1 preventing the presence of template light chain among the phage displayed antibody library members.

Libraries were constructed by mutagenesis method Kunkel mutagenesis using the single strand DNA template containing stop codon to anneal with the sets of oligonucleotides for three CDR L1 L2 and L3 simultaneously. Library DNA from mutagenesis were transformed into bacterial cell strain SS320 by electroporation and grown up with helper phage KO7. Single colonies from constructed libraries were evaluated for display levels by the detection of gD Tag at the c terminus of light chain and for the retention of binding for primary antigen EGFR in a single spot ELISA format. An average of 35 of evaluated single colonies from D1.5 libraries show a high level of display and retained EGFR binding property.

The libraries were subject to an initial round of binding selection with anti gD antibody as the capture target to eliminate clones in which the Fab gene had been deleted or were not expressed and binding selection with hEGFR ECD Fc followed by 4 rounds of plated antigen selection HER2 ECD HER2 ECD Fc HER2 I III Fc HER3 ECD Fc HER4 ECD Fc in each case the Fc in the fusion constructs is the complement binding fragment from hIgG1 . Alternatively they were directly subjected to target binding selection without pre selection with anti gD and hEGFR ECD Fc.

Each round of plate selection was performed as previously described in Example 3. Random clones from round 3 and 4 were selected for screening and assayed using phage ELISA in which binding to target and anti gD was compared to binding of a non relevant protein BSA for checking non specific binding. Clones that bound the anti gD antibody and target but not the non targeted protein controls such as bovine serum albumin other IgGs were considered specific positives.

The light chain variable domain regions of the positive clones were amplified by PCR and sequenced. The DNA sequence analysis of the positive specific binders revealed 1 unique binder for both EGFR and HER2 D1.5 201 SEQ ID NO 36 7 unique binders for both EGFR and HER3 D1.5 100 SEQ ID NO 40 D1.5 103 SEQ ID NO 41 D1.5 113 SEQ ID NO 42 D1.5 115 SEQ ID NO 43 D1.5 116 SEQ ID NO 44 D1.5 121 SEQ ID NO 45 D1.5 122 SEQ ID NO 46 1 unique binder for both EGFR and HER4 D1.5 400 SEQ ID NO 39 .

Eight out of the nine bispecific clones retained the proline at position 93 in HVR L3 Since the adoption of proline at this position with tyrosine at position 96 dramatically increased D1.5 affinity for EGFR compared to its parent clone D1 it is likely that it is a contributor in retention of binding for EGFR.

To determine if the nine clones with dual activities were specific to their cognate targets their binding to a panel of antigens in a direct plate ELISA format was evaluated.

2 g ml of several proteins were coated on immunoplates overnight at 4 C. The plates were blocked with 1 BSA in PBST and a dilution of phage Fab supernatant grown as described in Example 1 was applied to the plate for 30 minutes.

The plates were washed and binding signals recorded and analyzed as described in Example 1. The results show that all clones with dual specificities were specific to their cognate target. Clones D1.5 4 and parent clone D1.5 were used as control. . 

All clones with dual specificity were reformatted into mIgG2A for further characterization using same restriction site described above and vectors previously designed for transient murine IgG expression in mammalian cells.

To determine if the seven selected antibodies with dual specificity block TGF induced EGFR phosphorylation stably transfected EGFR NR6 cells were treated as described in Example 2. The data in demonstrate that EGFR HER3 and EGFR HER2 antibodies inhibited TGF induced EGFR phosphorylation at high concentration. A commercially available anti EGFR antibody was used as a positive control.

A dose response on clones D1.5 100 and D1.5 103 showed that clone D1.5 100 lost its parent clone s D1.5 high potency to inhibit EGFR phosphorylation. D1.5 103 however had a similar potency to D1.5 in this assay.

To determine whether the selected anti EGFR HER3 antibodies could inhibit heregulin binding to HER3 ECD Fc protein purified IgGs were tested in a radiolabeled ligand binding assay.

Binding assays were performed in Nunc break apart strip wells. Plates were coated at 4 C. overnight with 100 l of 5 mg mL goat anti human Ab in 50 mM carbonate buffer pH 9.6 . Plates were rinsed twice with wash buffer PBS 0.005 Tween20 and blocked with 100 l 1 BSA PBS for 30 min. Buffer was removed and each well was incubated with 200 ng of HER3 ECD Fc in 1 BSA PBS for 1.5 h. Plates were rinsed three times with wash buffer and antibodies in 1 BSA PBS were pre bound to HER3 IgG at 4 C. overnight. I HRG was added and plates were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Plates were rinsed three times and individual wells were counted using a 100 Series Iso Data counter. . The results demonstrate that all seven antibodies with dual specificity for EGFR and HER3 can inhibit heregulin binding to HER3 ECD Fc.

To determine whether the selected anti EGFR HER4 antibody D1.5 400 could inhibit heregulin binding to HER4 ECD Fc a ligand binding assay as described above was performed. 25 ng HER4 ECD Fc was used instead of HER3 ECD Fc. The results demonstrate that D1.5 400 inhibited heregulin binding to HER4.

To determine whether the seven selected antibodies with dual specificity for EGFR and HER3 could inhibit heregulin induced HER2 HER3 phosphorylation in MCF7 cells they were tested in a receptor phosphorylation assay MCF 7 cells ATCC HTB 22 Manassas Va. were plated in 12 well plates. Following serum starvation cells were incubated with indicated antibodies 75 ug ml or 150 ug ml for 2 hours. Cells were stimulated with 0.5 nM HRG for 8 minutes and total cell lysates were run on SDS PAGE and Western blots were probed with anti phospho HER3 anti pTyr or anti tubulin as loading control. . The results demonstrate that all anti EGFR HER3 antibodies inhibited heregulin induced HER2 HER3 phosphorylation at high concentration. Pertuzumab Pmab was used as a positive control.

To determine the growth inhibitory potential of anti EGFR HER3 antibodies on HRG driven cell growth MDA 175 cells ATCC HTB 25 Manassas Va. 20000 cells well were plated in 96 well plates. The following day cells were simultaneously treated with various concentrations of antibody up to 50 ug ml in 1 serum containing medium. After either 4 days or 5 days Alamar Blue was added and fluorescence was detected using a fluorometer. The results were expressed in RFUs. MDA 175 cells were chosen since their growth is the result of an autocrine stimulation by HRG. The anti EGFR HER3 antibody D1.5 100 and clone D1.5 122 showed inhibition of MDA 175 cell growth. Pertuzumab Pmab was used as a positive control. . 

An alanine and homolog shotgun scanning analysis was performed using combinatorial phage displayed libraries Vajdos et al. J. Biol. Biol. 320 415 28 2002 to investigate the interaction between each antibody with its two antigens EGFR and HER3.

Binding selections on the antigens hEGFR and HER3 to isolate functional clones followed by DNA sequencing enabled calculations of wild type mutant ratios at each varied position. These ratios were then used to determine the contribution of each scanned side chain to EGFR and HER3 binding.

Solvent exposed residues in the CDRs were scanned using phage displayed libraries in which the wild type residues were allowed to vary as either alanine or wild type Alanine Scan or as a homolog residue or wild type Homolog Scan . The nature of the genetic code required some other substitutions to be included in the library in addition to Wt Alanine or Wt Homolog residues. Separate heavy chain and light chain alanine and homolog scanning libraries were constructed. The degeneracy ranged from 1.3 10to 7.5 10.

Libraries were constructed as previously described except that a single Fab was expressed on the surface of bacteriophage fused to C terminal domain of the M13 gene 3 minor coat protein after removal of leucine zipper from original plasmid by kunkel mutagenesis Oligo F220 TCT TGT GAC AAA ACT CAC AGT GGC GGT GGC TCT GGT . SEQ ID NO 77 

The light chain alanine and homolog scanning library had stop codons in HVR L1 HVR L2 and HVR L3 and the heavy chain alanine and homolog libraries contained stop codons in each heavy chain HVRs. The libraries were constructed by previously described methods Sidhu et al. J. Mol. Biol. 338 299 310 2004 using Kunkel mutagenesis Kunkel et al. 1987 supra on the respective stop templates. Alanine scanning libraries are phage displayed libraries that allow selected side chains to vary as wild type or alanine. Homolog scan means that the phage displayed libraries allow selected side chains to vary as wild type or similar amino acids.

NUNC 96 well Maxisorp immunoplates were coated with 5 mg ml capture target EGFR ECD Fc HER3 ECD Fc or Protein L and blocked with 1 BSA w v in PBS. Phage from the above described libraries were propagated with KO7 helper phage NEB as described Lee et al. 2004 supra . The library phage solutions were added to the coated plates at a concentration of 10phage particles ml and incubated for 1 2 h in RT. The plates were washed 8 times with PBST and followed by elution of bound phage with 0.1 M HCl for 30 min. Enrichment after each round of selection was determined as described previously. After 2 rounds of target selection a number of random clones from each library were selected for sequencing as described Sidhu et al. 2004 supra .

The DNA sequences of binding clones were used to determine wild type mutation ratios at each varied position. The ratios were used to assess binding contribution to antigen of each selected side chain. Dividing wt mut ratio from antigen selection by wt mut ratio from display selection provides quantitative estimate of each mutation s effect on antigen binding affinity Function ratio F . If the ratio is greater than 1 the mutation is deleterious. If the ratio is less than 1 the mutation is beneficial. 2500 clones were sequenced.

Based on the alanine and homolog scan results hot spots of the antibody D1.5 100 for the binding of EGFR and HER3 were mapped on the structure of known anti HER2 antibody 4D5 Fv. As shown in the mapping suggests that for EGFR binding the heavy chain dominates and heavy and light chains work together for the binding of HER3. Acidic E D residues play an important role in binding both EGFR and HER3 and especially HER3.

Single colonies from the last round of sort were picked and phage were grown as described in Example 1. 384 wells were coated with EGFR ECD Fc at 1 l ml. For each colony grown 25 l of phage supernatant or ELISA buffer were incubated with 25 l of EGFR ECD 50 nM and HER3 ECD Fc 10 nM . 4 l of incubation was added to EGFR ECD Fc coated plate and the plate was washed eight times. 60 l of 1 5000 anti M13 HRP conjugates antibody was added the plate was washed eight times and developed with TMB HPO.

Eight unique clones were selected that show greater inhibition than D1.5 100 for EGFR and HER3 using the following single spot competition protocol 

3. For each colony grown 25 l of phage supernatant or ELISA buffer were incubated with 25 l of EGFR ECD 50 nM and HER3 ECD Fc 10 nM 

8 unique clones were selected that show greater inhibition than D1.5 100 for both EGFR and HER3 DL6 SEQ ID NO 63 DL7 SEQ ID NO 64 DL8 SEQ ID NO 65 DL9 SEQ ID NO 66 DL10 SEQ ID NO 67 DL11 SEQ ID NO 28 DL12 SEQ ID NO 68 DL13 SEQ ID NO 69 . For anti HER3 antibodies 7 unique clones were selected that show greater inhibition than D1.5 100 for HER3.

Specificity of binding of selected affinity matured bispecific antibodies was assessed by direct binding to a panel of various proteins as described in Example 5. As shown in the selected antibodies showed specificity of binding for both EGFR and HER3.

IC50 values were calculated for two selected bispecific antibodies DL7 and DL11 as described in Example 1 and compared to D1.5 100 parent clone. Both selected bispecific antibodies show similar affinity for HER3 ECD Fc and increased affinity for EGFR. DL1.5 100 had an IC50 of 44 nM for EGFR ECD 0.1 nM for HER3 FC DL7 had an IC50 of 6.1 nM for EGFR ECD 0.25 nM for HER3 FC DL11 had an IC50 of 5.7 nM for EGFR ECD 0.43 nM for HER3 FC.

The specificity of binding of selected anti HER3 antibodies was assessed by direct binding to a panel of various proteins as previously described. The selected antibodies DL3.5 DL3.6 DL3.7 show binding specificity for HER3 only.

Phage IC50 values were calculated for selected antibodies as described above and compared to the D1.5 100 parent clone. All antibodies DL3.1 3.7 show increased affinity for HER3 ECD Fc with IC50s of between 1 and 3.8 nM. The parent DL1.5 100 had an IC50 of 4.6 nM.

Binding of selected bispecific antibodies and anti HER3 antibodies was compared to the binding of HER3 domain III protein N term His tag using the competition ELISA described above. EGFR HER3 and monospecific anti HER3 antibodies have similar affinities for HER3 ECD Fc and HER3 domain III constructs Phage IC50 .

Selected affinity matured bispecific antibodies and anti HER3 antibodies were reformatted into mIgG2A and validated in a competition ELISA as described above. mIgG2A bispecific antibodies show increased affinity for both EGFR ECD and HER3 domain III compared to the D1.5 100 parent clone.

Using BIAcore 300 for the kinetic analysis of affinity matured EGFR HER3 antibodies DL7 and DL11 and anti HER3 specific antibodies DL3.6 and DL3.7 purified mIgG2A of each antibody DL1.5 100 DL7 DL11 DL3.6 DL3.7 was coupled onto a CM5 chip and several dilutions of antigen EGFR ECD HER3 domainIII HER3 ECD were flowed over the coated chip under the conditions described in Example 4. The CM5 chip was regenerated between each injection of antigen. Finally KD was determined using a 1 1 binding analysis with mass transfer. The affinity matured EGFR HER3 antibodies DL7 and DL11 have improved KD M for both targets.

In order to assess the inhibitory function of affinity matured antibodies DL7 DL11 and parental antibody D1.5 on EGFR EGFR NR6 cells that only express EGFR were pretreated with various amounts of antibodies up to 20 ug ml for one hour and subsequently phosphorylation of EGFR was induced by TGF 5 nM . Inhibition of receptor phosphorylation by the antibodies was detected using an anti Phosphotyrosine antibody. Inhibitions of MAPK activation was also seen in a dose dependent manner. Antibody DL11 was more potent than DL7 in inhibiting EGFR and ERK1 2 phosphorylation. . 

The inhibitory function of DL7 DL11 and monospecific anti HER3 antibody DL3.6 on HER3 transactivation was compared. . MCF 7 cells that express HER2 HER3 and EGFR were pretreated with indicated amounts of antibody up to 50 ug ml for one hour and activation of HER3 and transphosphorylation of HER3 was induced by HRG. Inhibition of HER3 phosphorylation was detected using an anti phospho HER3 antibody. Inhibition of downstream signaling molecules ERK1 2 as well as Akt was seen in a dose dependent manner. DL11 again was more potent than DL7.

The growth inhibitory function of DL11 was compared to that of a commercially available anti EGFR antibody pertuzumab and an anti HER3 antibody or to that of DL3.6 D1.5 or the combination of D1.5 plus DL3.6. H1666 cells ATCC CRL 5885 Manassas Va. an NSCLC cell line that expresses HER2 HER3 EGFR and EGFR ligands 6000 cells well were growth stimulated with HRG 3 nM . The antibodies were tested in a dose dependent manner and growth inhibitory characteristics compared to all other monospecific antibodies. As shown in DL11 inhibited cell growth to a greater extent than the monospecific antibodies or combinations thereof.

Similar results were obtained when the assay was repeated using H1666 cells growth stimulated with HRG 3 nM TGF 6 nM . .

The growth inhibitory function of DL11 was compared to pertuzumab an anti EGFR antibody and an anti HER3 antibody or DL3.6 D1.5 or to the combination of D1.5 plus DL3.6 in HCA 7 cells. HCA 7 is a colorectal cell line that expresses HER2 HER3 and EGFR. Cell growth was stimulated with HRG 3 nM in the presence of 1 serum. The antibodies were tested in a dose dependent manner and cell viability was detected after 3 days using Alamar Blue reagent. As shown in DL11 showed superior growth inhibitory characteristics compared to all other treatments.

Cell growth 10 000 cells well was stimulated with HRG 3 nM in the presence of 1 serum and antibodies were tested in a dose dependent manner. As shown in DL11 showed superior activity compared to the monospecific antibodies.

For affinity maturation of D1.5 201 a light chain soft homolog library was designed on selected amino acids. Some soft residues were soft randomized where wild type residue frequency was 50 . Some residues were randomized using codons encoding for wild type residue or homolog residue. Some homolog randomization allows 1 or 2 extra residues besides wild type and homolog. Finally some residues were unchanged.

The sequences of light chain variable region for the selected affinity matured EGFR HER2 bispecific antibodies were determined D1.5 201 SEQ ID NO 36 D1.5 201 2 SEQ ID NO 37 D1.5 201 3 SEQ ID NO 38 . Phage IC50 were calculated for two selected affinity matured bispecific antibodies D1.5 201 2 D1.5 201 3 as previously described and compared to D1.5 201 parent clone. Both affinity matured bispecific antibodies show increased affinity for HER2 ECD and EGFR ECD.

DL11 was further affinity matured as described above resulting in two additional bispecific antibodies with specificity for EGFR and HER3 DL11b and DL11f and two antibodies specific for HER3 DL3 11fb and DL3 11f . The heavy chain and light chain amino acid sequence of DL11b are shown in SEQ ID NOs 12 and 13 respectively. The heavy chain and light chain amino acid sequence of DL11f are shown in SEQ ID NOs 14 and 13 respectively. The heavy chain and light chain amino acid sequence of DL3 11b are shown in SEQ ID NOs 19 and 13 respectively and the heavy chain and light chain amino acid sequence of DL3 11f are shown in SEQ ID NOs 20 and 13 respectively.

The binding affinities for DL11b and DL11f their EGFR and HER3 targets were determined in the following Biocore assay. Both DL11b and DL11f showed improved affinity for their targets as compared to DL11.

Measurements were done using surface plasmon resonance on a BIAcore 2000 instrument GE Healthcare BIAcore Life Sciences Piscataway N.J. . cDNAs encoding the extracellular domains ECDs of human EGFR amino acids 1 637 and human HER3 amino acids 1 640 were cloned into a mammalian expression vector containing sequences encoding the Fc region of human IgG1 to generate human Fc fusion protein. Recombinant human EGFR IgG1 2.65 mg ml human HER3 IgG1 3.35 mg ml were produced by transiently transfecting Chinese hamster ovary cells and were purified via protein A affinity chromatography. cDNA encoding the extracellular domain of human EGFR amino acids 1 637 was cloned into a mammalian expression vector containing a N terminal flag sequence.

The binding affinities for DL11f as both a Fab and IgG antibody were determined. For the Fab assay the DL11f Fab was the analyte and was flowed over a CM5 chip where the different ligands human EGFR Fc and human HER3 Fc were first captured using the BIAcore human Antibody Capture Kit BR 1008 39 Lot 10020611 . A 2 fold dilution series of DL11f Fab was injected in a range of 0.244 250 nM in PBS 0.05 Tween20 at a flow rate of 30 l minute at 25 C. Between each injection of Fc fusion ligands and analyte 3M Magnesium chloride was used to regenerate the sensor chip 5 l at a flow rate of 10 l mn . To determine the affinity constants of DL11f Fab to human EGFR and human HER3 Fc fusion proteins the signal from the reference cell was subtracted from the observed test sensorgram. Kinetic constants were calculated by non linear regression fitting of the data according to a 1 1 Langmuir binding model using BIAcore evaluation software GE Healthcare version 4.1 supplied by the manufacturer. Two replicates of a representative concentration of DL11f Fab 125 nM gave very similar fitting and kinetics constants for all Fc fusions proteins. DL11f Fab bound to human EGFR Fc with a KD value of 1.92 nM and to human HER3 Fc with a KD value of 0.39 nM.

A second experimental condition was explored to obtain binding kinetics from DL11f as IgG. Here DL11f human IgG1 was immobilized on the sensor chip CM5 and monomeric human EGFR ecd and human HER3 ecd were used as the analyte. A 2 fold dilution series of human EGFR ecd and human HER3 ecd was injected in a range of 0.244 250 nM in PBS 0.05 Tween20 at a flow rate of 30 l minute at 25 C. Binding kinetics were determined as for the Fab. DL11f bound to human EGFR ecd and human HER3 Fc with Kvalues of 19.9 nM and 2.63 nM respectively. In both experiments we observed that DL11f antibody has a consistent 5 8 fold higher affinity for HER3 than for EGFR. The weaker affinities found in experiment 2 for both receptors when compared to experiment 1 could be due to a difference between having EGFR ecd or HER3 ecd as analytes in solution and the receptor as Fc fusion immobilized on the flow cell chip. It is possible that these multi domain receptors as free ECD may encounter more entropic penalty for binding energy when in solution thus resulting in weaker affinity.

DL11b showed similar binding affinities for EGFR and HER3 as DL11f under similar conditions in a separate Biacore analysis.

DL3 11b and DL3 11f lost the ability to specifically bind to EGFR while retaining the ability to specifically bind to HER3.

Inhibition of MDA 175 cell proliferation by DL11b and DL11f was investigated as described above. Both DL11b and DL11f inhibited proliferation of MDA 175 cells to a similar degree as the DL11 antibody. . The IC50s of DL11 DL11f and DL11b were all around 0.8 1.0 ug ml.

DL11f mediates ADCC in vitro. A431 H292 ATCC CRL 1848 Manassas Va. FaDu BxPC3 and MDA 468 ATCC HTB 132 Manassas Va. cells all from ATCC were plated in 96 well plates in the presence of indicated concentrations of antibodies. After pre incubation for 30 minutes at 37 C. isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC were added and the incubation continued for 4 more hours at 37 C. After 4 hours the plates were centrifuged and the supernatants were harvested. The LDH activity in the supernatants was determined according to the Promega CytoTox One homogeneous membrane integrity assay procedure. To determine the percentage cell mediated cytotoxicity the average absorbance were calculated and the background was subtracted. As shown in DL11f mitigates ADCC in EGFR expressing cell lines in a dose dependent manner.

An amino acid substitution of N297A was introduced into DL11f to delete the effector function. N297 is required for FcR and or complement binding. DL11f N297A exhibits a lack of ADCC in vitro. As expected the growth inhibitory function of DL11f in vitro is not affected by the mutation. . 

DL11f and DL11f N297A were tested in mice with established tumors derived from the NSCLC cell line H292 ATCC CRL 1848 Manassas Va. . 5 10A431 cells were inoculated subcutaneously in C.B17 SCID mice.

Initially DL11f and DL11f N297A inhibited tumor growth equivalently by inhibiting HER pathway signaling. But as doses diminished DL11f exhibited prolonged anti tumor activity compared to DL11f N297A due to its ADCC capability. . 

A study was conducted to determine the relative toxicity of DL11f and cetuximab. Cynomolgus monkeys were assigned into three Groups and dosed with either DL11f or cetuximab Capital Wholesale Drug Columbus Ohio once weekly for six weeks as follows 

All 3 cetuximab dosed animals developed skin lesions between the 3rd and 4th dose indicating toxicity. This result was expected based on prior Cynomolgus studies conducted during FDA approval of cetuximab. None of the DL11f dosed animals showed signs of toxicity at this point in the study.

One of the animals receiving the 25 mg kg dose of DL11f developed a skin lesion one week following the 6th dose. This lesion measured approximately 4 cm 7 cm and was very mild and limited to a smaller area when compared to lesions observed in the cetuximab treated animals.
