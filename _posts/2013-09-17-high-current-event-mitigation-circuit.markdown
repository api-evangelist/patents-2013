This invention was made with Government support awarded by the Aerospace Corporation. The government has certain rights in this invention.

Integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices may be used in environments where radiation may induce a high current event. For example an integrated circuit in outer space or in an environment exposed to nuclear radiation may experience a transient voltage spike or a transient current spike e.g. the high current event caused by a collision of a high energy particle such as a high energy proton or ion associated with cosmic radiation or nuclear radiation with the integrated circuit. When the integrated circuit includes a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor MOSFET circuit such a collision may cause the integrated circuit to latchup or enter a latchup state.

When the integrated circuit enters the latchup state a low impedance path e.g. a short may be created between power supply rails of the integrated circuit. The integrated circuit may transition from the latchup state to a normal operating state e.g. the latchup state may be exited when a magnitude of current flow through the integrated circuit no longer exceeds a latchup holding current value. If the integrated circuit remains in the latchup state for an extended time period a latent failure may occur within the integrated circuit. A latent failure may indicate damage to the integrated circuit that does not cause an immediate error and such damage is therefore difficult to detect. For example a region of the integrated circuit may melt due to the current flow through the integrated circuit but the integrated circuit may not generate a detectable error until a later time.

Some integrated circuits may use a latchup recovery circuit to detect a latchup condition and decouple the integrated circuit from one or more power supplies. After decoupling the one or more power supplies power cycling may be performed on the one or more power supplies to reset voltage levels and to recover the integrated circuit from the latchup condition. Detecting the latchup condition and decoupling the integrated circuit from the one or more power supplies may take a time period on the order of hundreds of nanoseconds. Depending on an amount of the current flow through the integrated circuit and or a temperature of the integrated circuit a latent failure may occur before the integrated circuit is decoupled from the one or more power supplies. Thus the latchup recovery circuit may not operate fast enough to prevent a latent failure from occurring within the integrated circuit. Additionally circuit elements used to detect the latchup condition and to decouple the integrated circuit from the one or more power supplies add cost and complexity to the latchup recovery circuit.

Particular embodiments disclosed herein provide a high current event mitigation circuit including a protection circuit configured to mitigate effects on a protected circuit of a high current event. The protection circuit may be coupled to the protected circuit and may be configured to provide a bias current to the protected circuit. The protection circuit may include a first resistive element coupled to a voltage regulator. A magnitude of the bias current provided to the protected circuit may be related to a first resistance value of the first resistive element. The first resistance value of the first resistive element may be selected such that the magnitude of the bias current is within an operating current range of the protected circuit during normal operation and the magnitude is below a latchup holding current value. By such a selection of the first resistance value the protection circuit may be configured to enable the protected circuit to autonomously transition from the latchup state to a normal operating state after a high current event.

The protection circuit may further include a bypass capacitor coupled to the first resistive element and to the voltage regulator and a second resistive element coupled between the bypass capacitor and the protected circuit. The second resistive element may be configured to reduce energy provided to the protected circuit by dissipating a portion of the energy in the protection circuit without providing the portion of the energy to the protected circuit. For example the second resistive element may dissipate the portion of the energy by converting the portion of the energy into heat. A second resistance value of the second resistive element may be selected based on a threshold energy level a threshold temperature a latent damage threshold latchup time period or a combination thereof associated with an occurrence of a latent failure within the protected circuit. By such a selection of the second resistance value the second resistive element may be configured to dissipate sufficient energy to cause the protected circuit to exit the latchup state before the protected circuit experiences a latent failure. For example when the protected circuit experiences a latchup event the second resistive element may dissipate a portion of the energy provided to the protected circuit sufficient to enable the protected circuit to exit the latchup state before the protected circuit experiences a latent failure.

By providing the bias current having the magnitude below the latchup holding current value to the protected circuit the protection circuit may enable the protected circuit to autonomously exit the latchup state after the high current event. Thus cost and complexity of the protection circuit may be reduced as compared to a latchup recovery circuit that detects a high current level and decouples an integrated circuit from one or more power supplies to recover from the latchup state. Further by dissipating sufficient energy in the protection circuit the protection circuit may cause the protected circuit to exit the latchup state before the protected circuit experiences a latent failure. Thus an integrated circuit or other semiconductor device that is subject to latchup may be used in circumstances in which high current events may occur.

In a particular embodiment a protection circuit includes a first resistive element configured for coupling to a protected circuit. The first resistive element has a particular resistance value. The protection circuit also includes a voltage regulator coupled to the first resistive element. The particular resistance value is selected to enable a magnitude of a bias current provided to the protected circuit to remain within a first operating current range associated with the protected circuit and to remain below a latchup holding current value associated with the protected circuit.

In another particular embodiment a circuit includes a protected circuit. The circuit also includes a protection circuit coupled to the protected circuit. The protection circuit includes a first resistive element. The protection circuit also includes a voltage regulator coupled to the first resistive element. The protection circuit includes a bypass capacitor coupled to the voltage regulator and to the first resistive element. The protection circuit further includes a second resistive element coupled between the bypass capacitor and the protected circuit.

In another particular embodiment a method includes providing a bias current to a protected circuit. The bias current is provided by a protection circuit coupled to the protected circuit. The method also includes dissipating energy in the protection circuit during a high current event that causes the protected circuit to enter a latchup state. The protection circuit dissipates sufficient energy to enable the protected circuit to autonomously exit the latchup state.

The features functions and advantages that have been described can be achieved independently in various embodiments or may be combined in yet other embodiments further details of which are disclosed with reference to the following description and drawings.

Particular embodiments of the present disclosure are described below with reference to the drawings. In the description common features are designated by common reference numbers throughout the drawings.

The high current event mitigation circuit may include the protection circuit coupled to the protected circuit . The protected circuit may include a particular integrated circuit or semiconductor device or a portion of an integrated circuit or semiconductor device that is subject to latchup during a high current event. For example the protected circuit may include an operational amplifier op amp that is subject to latchup during the high current event. The protection circuit may provide protection in addition to or instead of conventional electrostatic discharge ESD protection. For example an ESD circuit coupled to a power supply may mitigate effects of a transient voltage spike from the power supply but the ESD circuit may not mitigate effects of a high current event caused by a collision between a charged particle and a surface of the protected circuit . The protection circuit may be configured to mitigate the effects of the high current event caused by such collisions. For example the protection circuit may be internal to the protected circuit or may be disposed downstream from the one or more power supplies and the corresponding ESD circuit.

During the high current event a collision between the charged particle and the protected circuit may induce a transient high current in the protected circuit . When the transient high current exceeds a threshold current value the protected circuit may enter a latchup state. For example the transient high current may cause a low impedance path e.g. a short to be formed between power rails of the op amp and the transient high current may flow between the power rails. After the transient high current dissipates the protected circuit e.g. the op amp may remain in the latchup state as long as a magnitude of the current flow through the protected circuit exceeds a latchup holding current value. After the transient high current dissipates the magnitude of the current flow through the protected circuit may decrease to a magnitude of a current provided to the protected circuit such as a bias current. In a case where the latchup holding current value is less than the threshold current value the protected circuit remains in the latchup state while the magnitude of the current provided to the protected circuit is between the threshold current value and the latchup holding current value.

The protection circuit may be configured to mitigate effects of the high current event on the protected circuit by providing a bias current I to the protected circuit that enables the protected circuit to autonomously transition from the latchup state to a normal operating state e.g. autonomously exit the latchup state . For example the high current event may be caused by a collision of a charged particle with the protected circuit that induces the transient high current in the protected circuit . The protection circuit may be configured to maintain the magnitude of the bias current I below the latchup holding current value and within an operating current range of the protected circuit . As further described herein appropriate selection of one or more electrical characteristics of one or more circuit elements of the protection circuit may enable the protection circuit to provide the bias current I having a magnitude that does not exceed the latchup holding current value.

In a circuit that does not include the protection circuit a high current event may cause a magnitude of a bias current provided to an unprotected circuit to exceed the latchup holding current value after the high current event ends e.g. after the transient high current dissipates until a power supply is decoupled or until power cycling is performed. However because the magnitude of the bias current I received by the protected circuit does not exceed the latchup holding current value the current flow through the protected circuit falls below the latchup holding current value after the transient high current dissipates. Thus the protected circuit may autonomously exit the latchup state after the high current event ends e.g. after the transient high current dissipates without being decoupled from one or more power supplies and without performing power cycling on the one or more power supplies to reduce the current flow through the protected circuit . For example the protected circuit may remain coupled to one or more power supplies during a transition of the protected circuit from the latchup state to the normal operating state. The one or more power supplies may not be reset or power cycled during the entirety of the high current event. The protection circuit may be a passive circuit. For example the protection circuit may not include a transistor or a switch configured to actively control the magnitude of the bias current I . As another example the protection circuit may not include circuitry to sense a current level or a voltage level. Thus the protection circuit may enable the protected circuit to autonomously exit the latchup state without performing any active operation such as sensing or decoupling. Additionally the protection circuit may mitigate an effect of the high current event on the protected circuit without providing an additional path to ground e.g. a shunt during the high current event such as in a conventional ESD circuit. Because the protection circuit is a passive circuit the protection circuit may have reduced complexity and may be smaller e.g. use less chip area as compared to an active latchup recovery circuit. Circuits for use in environments subject to collisions with charged particles may have size e.g. chip area restrictions that the active latchup recovery circuit exceeds. However the protection circuit may be used in such circuits due to the reduced chip area. Thus the protection circuit may be a passive switchless circuit that enables the protected circuit to autonomously exit the latchup state caused by a collision with a charged particle.

Additionally the protection circuit may cause the protected circuit to exit the latchup state before the protected circuit experiences a latent failure. The protection circuit may reduce energy provided to the protected circuit by dissipating a portion of the energy without providing the portion of the energy to the protected circuit . For example the protection circuit may dissipate the portion of the energy in the protection circuit by converting the portion of the energy into heat. By reducing the energy provided to the protected circuit the protection circuit may cause the protected circuit to exit the latchup state before experiencing a latent failure such as melting of metal lines or migration of dopants between regions of the protected circuit during the high current event.

The protection circuit may include resistive elements R1 R2 R3 and R4 voltage regulators U1 and U2 bypass capacitors C1 and C2 and power supply rails V and V . A first portion of the protection circuit may include a first resistive element R1 coupled between a positive power supply rail V and a first node a first voltage regulator U1 coupled between ground and the first node a first bypass capacitor C1 coupled between ground and the first node and a second resistive element R2 coupled between the first node and the protected circuit e.g. coupled between the first bypass capacitor C1 and the protected circuit . A second portion of the protection circuit may include a third resistive element R3 coupled between a negative power supply rail V and a second node a second voltage regulator U2 coupled between ground and the second node a second bypass capacitor C2 coupled between ground and the second node and a fourth resistive element R4 coupled between the second node and the protected circuit e.g. coupled between the second bypass capacitor C2 and the protected circuit .

When powered by the positive power supply rail V and by the negative power supply rail V the protection circuit may provide the bias current I to the protected circuit . For example the positive power supply rail V and the negative power supply rail V may be coupled to a positive power supply and to a negative power supply respectively such that the bias current I flows through the protection circuit and to the protected circuit .

The magnitude of the bias current I may be related to the first resistive element R1 and the second resistive element R2 . The first resistive element R1 may include any circuit element that provides a selected resistance in the protection circuit . For example the first resistive element R1 may include a resistor. As another example the first resistive element R1 may be a current source configured to generate the bias current I . The second resistive element R2 may include any circuit element such as a resistor that dissipates energy within the protection circuit . A switching noise associated with the bias current I may be reduced by use of the first bypass capacitor C1 . For example the first bypass capacitor C1 may be configured to reduce the switching noise to within a switching noise tolerance of the protected circuit .

A voltage level at the first node may be substantially constant across varying temperatures. For example the first voltage regulator U1 may be configured to enable the voltage level at the first node to be substantially temperature independent. The first voltage regulator U1 may include any device capable of sustaining the voltage level at the first node across the varying temperatures. For example the first voltage regulator U1 may include a diode such as a Zener diode that provides a substantially constant temperature independent voltage across a wide temperature range. Thus a bias voltage provided to the protected circuit may be substantially constant across the varying temperatures.

Receiving the bias current I and the bias voltage may enable the protected circuit to perform one or more functions in a normal operating state. For example when the protected circuit is an op amp and is in the normal operating state the op amp may compare two input voltages. However during a high current event the protected circuit may transition from the normal operating state into the latchup state. The high current event may induce a transient high current through the protected circuit e.g. between power rails of the op amp . While in the latchup state the protected circuit e.g. the op amp may incorrectly compare the two input voltages. The protection circuit may be configured to mitigate the effects of the high current event on the protected circuit . For example the protection circuit may be configured to enable the protected circuit to autonomously transition from the latchup state to the normal operating state by maintaining the magnitude of the bias current I provided to the protected circuit below the latchup holding current value. The magnitude of the bias current I may be determined based on one or more electrical characteristics of the protection circuit .

To mitigate the effects of the high current event on the protected circuit the protection circuit may be designed e.g. the one or more electrical characteristics of the protection circuit may be selected based on one or more electrical characteristics of the protected circuit . The one or more electrical characteristics of the protected circuit may be determined by analysis of the protected circuit empirical data associated with the protected circuit or a combination thereof. The one or more electrical characteristics may be determined by studying a simulated high current event on a test circuit that is the same as or similar to the protected circuit . For example a laser may be used to simulate a high current event in the test circuit the test circuit may include the same type of op amp as the protected circuit . During the simulated high current event the test circuit may be studied and measurements such as a current level a voltage level a temperature an energy level or a combination thereof may be taken using one or more tools such as an oscilloscope. The measurements may be used to determine the one or more electrical characteristics of the test circuit that correspond to one or more characteristics of the protected circuit . For example the latchup holding current value and the threshold current value may be determined based on measurements that indicate when the test circuit enters the latchup state e.g. when the current flow through the test circuit increases . The simulated high current event may induce a transient high current that causes a latent failure within the test circuit. A threshold energy level a threshold temperature a latent damage threshold latchup time period or a combination thereof may be determined based on measurements of a voltage a current an energy level a temperature a length of time between application of the simulated high current event to the test circuit and an occurrence of the latent failure or a combination thereof of the test circuit when the latent failure occurs.

The protection circuit may be designed based on the one or more electrical characteristics of the protected circuit to enable the protection circuit to mitigate the effects of the high current event on the protected circuit . During a design process of the protection circuit one or more circuit elements of the protection circuit may be selected based on the one or more electrical characteristics of the protected circuit . For example a first resistance value of the first resistive element R1 may be selected based on the operating current range and the latchup holding current value of the protected circuit as further described herein. A particular resistive element having the first resistance may be included in the protection circuit based on the selection. Other electrical characteristics of other circuit elements may be similarly selected during the design process.

The first resistance value may be selected based on the operating current range associated with the protected circuit and based on a latchup holding current value associated with the protected circuit . The first resistance value may be selected to enable the magnitude of the bias current I to not exceed a particular value e.g. to be within a particular range regardless of whether the protected circuit is in the normal operating state or the latchup state. For example the first resistance value of the first resistive element R1 may be selected to be high enough that the magnitude of the bias current I is below the latchup holding current value and low enough that the magnitude of the bias current I is within the operating current range associated with the protected circuit . In a particular embodiment the first resistance value of the first resistive element R1 may be greater than or equal to two kilo ohms. For example when the protection circuit is powered by a positive 13 volt power source and a negative 13 volt power source a minimum operating current of the protected circuit is 5 milliamps mA and the latchup holding current value is 10 mA the first resistance value may be approximately 2.5 kilo ohms. In this case use of an approximately 2.5 kilo ohm resistor as the first resistive element R1 may cause the magnitude of the bias current I to be above 5 mA e.g. within the operating current range of the protected circuit and to be below 10 mA e.g. the latchup holding current value . The first resistance value of the first resistive element R1 may be further selected based on a different operating current range associated with the first voltage regulator U1 . For example the first resistance value may be appropriately selected to enable the magnitude of the bias current I to be within the operating current range of the protected circuit to be within the different operating current range of the first voltage regulator U1 and to be below the latchup holding current value. When the magnitude of the bias current I is within the different operating current range the first voltage regulator U1 may stay in regulation e.g. the first voltage regulator U1 may regulate the voltage level of the first node . The operating range of the protected circuit and the different operating range of the first voltage regulator U1 may overlap such that the magnitude of the bias current I may be within both ranges.

A first capacitance value of the first bypass capacitor C1 may be selected to reduce the switching noise associated with the bias current I and to reduce a time period that the protected circuit is in the latchup state. For example after the protected circuit enters the latchup state the energy provided to the protected circuit may result from a discharge of the first bypass capacitor C . The time period that the protected circuit is in the latchup state may be based on the amount of energy provided to the protected circuit which may be related to the energy discharged by the first bypass capacitor C1 . For example as additional energy is provided to the protected circuit the transient high current flowing through the protected circuit may remain above the latchup holding current value. A temperature of the protected circuit may increase as the protected circuit receives the energy e.g. as the protected circuit remains in the latchup state .

Appropriate selection of the first capacitance value of the first bypass capacitor C1 may reduce the amount of the energy provided to the protected circuit and the time period the protected circuit is in the latchup state. For example the first capacitance value may be selected to be low enough to reduce the time period that the protected circuit is in the latchup state and high enough to enable the switching noise to be within switching noise tolerance of the protected circuit . In a particular embodiment the first capacitance value may be selected to be a minimum capacitance value that enables the switching noise to be within the switching noise tolerance of the protected circuit . For example the first capacitance value may be less than or equal to 0.1 microfarads. As another example the first capacitance value may be at least one order of magnitude less than a one microfarad bypass capacitor.

A second resistance value of the second resistive element R2 may be selected to enable the protection circuit to reduce the energy provided to the protected circuit . Reducing the energy provided to the protected circuit may enable the transient high current flowing through the protected circuit to be reduced below the latchup holding current value while the protected circuit is in the latchup state without decoupling one or more power supplies from the protection circuit . For example the second resistive element R2 may be configured to reduce the energy provided to the protected circuit by dissipating a portion of the energy from the protection circuit without providing that portion e.g. the dissipated portion of the energy to the protected circuit . As explained above energy is discharged by the first bypass capacitor C1 when the protected circuit is in the latchup state and the second resistive element R2 may dissipate a portion of the energy within the protection circuit to reduce the energy provided to the protected circuit . For example the second resistive element R2 may dissipate the portion of the energy in the protection circuit by converting the portion of the energy into heat. However including the second resistive element R2 between the first bypass capacitor C1 and the protected circuit may increase the switching noise of the protected circuit . The second resistance value may be selected to be high enough to dissipate energy in the protection circuit without causing the switching noise to exceed the switching noise tolerance of the protected circuit . In a particular embodiment the second resistance value may be less than or equal to ten ohms. In another embodiment the second resistance value may be approximately zero ohms e.g. the second resistive element R2 may not be included in the protection circuit . The second resistance value may be further selected such that a first impedance of the second resistive element R2 is greater than a second impedance of the protected circuit while the protected circuit is in the latchup state.

The time period that the protected circuit is in the latchup state may be determined based on the first capacitance value of the first bypass capacitor C1 and the second resistance value of the second resistive element R2 . For example the time period may be related to the first capacitance value and to the second resistance value and to latchup characteristics of the protected circuit e.g. the latchup holding current value or a latchup holding voltage value . The time period may also be related to the magnitude of the bias current I provided to the protected circuit . The time period may also be related to the first resistance value of the first resistive element R1 . In a particular embodiment a relationship between the time period and the first resistance value may be a second order relationship. By appropriate selection of the first capacitance value and the second resistance value and of the first resistance value the protection circuit may be configured to reduce the energy provided to the protected circuit and to prevent the time period from exceeding the latent damage threshold latchup time period. The threshold time period may be associated with a potential latent failure within the protected circuit . Reducing the energy provided to the protected circuit may enable the protected circuit to autonomously exit the latchup state before the latent damage threshold latchup time period is exceeded. Additionally reducing the energy provided to the protected circuit may prevent the energy from exceeding the threshold energy level and may prevent the temperature of the protected circuit from exceeding the threshold temperature. The threshold energy level and the threshold temperature may be associated with a potential latent failure within the protected circuit . As explained above the latent damage threshold latchup time period the threshold energy level and the threshold temperature may be determined by measuring values associated with an occurrence of a latent failure at a test circuit similar to the protected circuit . For example a latent failure may occur in the test circuit when a temperature of the test circuit exceeds 400 Celsius C . The latent failure may include movement of dopant atoms between regions in the test circuit. In this example the first capacitance value and the second resistance value may be selected such that a temperature of the protected circuit does not exceed 400 C. As another example the latent failure may include electromigration of one or more metal lines in the test circuit when an amount of energy provided to the test circuit exceeds the threshold energy level. The threshold energy level may correspond to a threshold current density of the test circuit. In this example the first capacitance value and the second resistance value may be selected such that an amount of energy provided to the protected circuit does not exceed the threshold energy level. Thus the first capacitance value and the second resistance value may be selected based on the latent damage threshold latchup time period the threshold energy level the threshold temperature or a combination thereof. By reducing the energy provided to the protected circuit the protection circuit may prevent one or more the protected circuit from exceeding one or more thresholds associated with a potential latent failure within the protected circuit .

Electrical characteristics of the second portion of the protection circuit such as a third resistance value of the third resistive element R3 a fourth resistance value of the fourth resistive element R4 and a second capacitance value of the second bypass capacitor C2 may be selected in a similar manner to the first resistance value of the first resistive element R1 the second resistance value of the second resistive element R2 and the first capacitance value of the first bypass capacitor C1 respectively. However the second portion of the protection circuit may mitigate effects of a negative polarity high current event whereas the first portion of the protection circuit may mitigate a positive polarity high current event.

During operation of the high current event mitigation circuit the protection circuit may be coupled to one or more power sources via the power supply rails and to provide the bias current I to the protected circuit . The magnitude of the bias current I may be within the operating current range associated with the protected circuit and below the latchup holding current value. During the high current event the protected circuit may enter the latchup state and a transient high current may flow through the protected circuit . The magnitude of the bias current I remains below the latchup holding current value. The protection circuit may reduce the energy provided to the protected circuit by dissipating a portion of energy from the protection circuit without providing the dissipated portion of the energy to the protected circuit . By maintaining the magnitude of the bias current I below the latchup holding current value and by dissipating the portion of the energy in the protection circuit the protection circuit causes a magnitude of the current flow through the protected circuit to fall below the latchup holding current value when the high current event ends. When the magnitude of the current flow through the protected circuit falls below the latchup holding current value the protected circuit autonomously transitions from the latchup state to the normal operating state.

By providing the bias current I to the protected circuit such that the bias current I does not exceed the latchup holding current value the protection circuit may enable the protected circuit to autonomously exit a latchup state when the high current ends without decoupling the protected circuit . Because the protection circuit is a passive circuit the protection circuit provides faster latchup recovery than an active latchup recovery circuit that senses a current level or a voltage level and decouples an integrated circuit from one or more power supplies. Additionally the protection circuit provides faster latchup recovery than an active latchup recovery circuit that uses switches to control a bias voltage or current or that performs power cycling. Thus the protection circuit may have reduced cost and complexity as compared to an active latchup recovery circuit that senses high current levels that decouples an integrated circuit from one or more power supplies that performs power cycling or that uses switches to control a bias voltage or bias current to cause the integrated circuit to exit the latchup state. The faster latchup recovery and the reduced costs and complexity may enable the protection circuit to be used in environments subject to high current events caused by a collision with a charged particle such as an environment subject to radiation. Further by dissipating the portion of the energy in the protection circuit e.g. via the second resistive element R2 the protection circuit may prevent the protected circuit from exceeding one or more thresholds associated with a potential latent failure within the protected circuit . Thus by using the high current event mitigation circuit that includes the protection circuit an integrated circuit that is subject to latchup conditions may be included in a device configured for use in environments that are subject to high current events such as in outer space or in an ionizing radiation environment.

The method includes providing a bias current to the protected circuit at . For example the bias current may include the bias current I of and the protected circuit may include the protected circuit of . The bias current is provided by a protection circuit coupled to the protected circuit. For example the protection circuit may include the protection circuit of . The protection circuit may be a passive circuit e.g. the protection circuit may not include an active element such as a switch or a transistor . A magnitude of the bias current may be related to a first resistance value of a first resistive element of the protection circuit and a power source voltage of the protection circuit. The first resistive element may include the first resistive element R1 of . The first resistance is selected to enable the protection circuit to maintain the magnitude of the bias current below a latchup holding current value associated with the protected circuit.

Energy may be dissipated within the protection circuit during a high current event at . The high current event may cause the protected circuit to enter a latchup state. For example the high current event may induce a transient high current to flow through the protected circuit which causes the protected circuit to enter the latchup state due to the transient high current exceeding a threshold latchup current. Energy provided to the protected circuit from the protection circuit may also cause the protected circuit to enter the latchup state. The protected circuit may remain in the latchup state until the current flow through the protected circuit no longer exceeds the latchup holding current value. The protection circuit may be configured to enable the protected circuit to autonomously exit the latchup state instead of remaining in the latchup state after the high current event ends.

The protection circuit may dissipate sufficient energy to enable the protected circuit to autonomously exit the latchup state. The protected circuit may autonomously exit the latchup state when the current flow through the protected device is below the latchup holding current value. For example when the high current event ends e.g. dissipates the current flow through the protected circuit may fall below the latchup holding current value based on to the magnitude of the bias current provided to the protected circuit and the reduction of energy in the protection circuit . Thus the protection circuit may be configured to dissipate energy so that the protected circuit does not remain in the latchup state after the high current event ends. For example the protection circuit may include a second resistive element configured to reduce the energy provided to the protected circuit. The second resistive element may include the second resistive element R2 of . The second resistive element may reduce the energy provided to the protected circuit by dissipating a portion of the energy in the protection circuit without providing the portion of the energy to the protected circuit such as by converting the portion of the energy into heat. An amount of energy dissipated in the protection circuit may be related to a second resistance value of the second resistive element. By dissipating the portion of the energy in the protection circuit and by maintaining the magnitude of the bias current below the latchup holding current value the current flow through the protected circuit falls below the latchup holding current value after the high current event ends and the protected circuit autonomously exits the latchup state.

Further reducing the energy provided to the protected circuit may mitigate effects of the high current event on the protected circuit. Damage to the protected circuit such as a latent failure may be based on a current density of the high current event and a subsequent latchup of the protected circuit. For example a high current event having a large current density may cause damage to the protected circuit more quickly than a high current event having a small current density. Reducing the energy provided to the protected circuit may reduce the current density associated with the protected circuit and may reduce a time period that the protected circuit is in the latchup state. For example a latent failure may occur in the protected circuit when the energy provided to the protected circuit exceeds a threshold energy level when a temperature of the protected circuit exceeds a threshold temperature or when a time period the protected circuit is in the latchup state exceeds a latent damage threshold latchup time period. An amount of the energy provided to the protected circuit may be related to the second resistance value of the second restive element and to a capacitance value of a bypass capacitor of the protection circuit. The bypass capacitor may include the first bypass capacitor C1 of . Thus appropriate selection of the second resistance value and the capacitance value may prevent the energy provided to the protected circuit from exceeding the threshold energy level. Appropriate selection of the second resistance value and the capacitance value may also prevent the temperature of the protected circuit from exceeding the threshold temperature and or prevent the time period from exceeding the latent damage threshold latchup time period.

By dissipating sufficient energy in the protection circuit the method of may enable the protected circuit to autonomously exit a latchup state after a high current event. For example after the high current event ends the protected circuit may autonomously exit the latchup state when the current flow through the protected circuit falls below the latchup current holding value due to the dissipation of energy in the protection circuit and due to the magnitude of the bias current remaining below the latchup holding current value. Additionally by using a passive circuit to dissipate the energy the method may cause the protected circuit to autonomously exit the latchup state faster than through use of an active circuit such as a circuit that senses a current level that decouples a power supply from an integrated circuit or that uses one or more switches to control a voltage or current level. Thus the protection circuit used to perform the method may have reduced cost and complexity as compared to an active latchup recovery circuit. Because of the benefits to speed and complexity the method may be used to mitigate high current events in an environment subject to collisions with charged particles. Further by dissipating sufficient energy in the protection circuit the method may maintain a time period that the protected circuit is in the latchup state below a latent damage threshold latchup time period.
