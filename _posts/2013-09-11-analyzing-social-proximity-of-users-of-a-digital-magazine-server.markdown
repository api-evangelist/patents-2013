title: Analyzing social proximity of users of a digital magazine server
abstract: Connections between an online system user and one or more social networking system users maintained by various social networking systems are analyzed to determine social proximity between the online system user and social networking system users connected to the online system user via a social networking system. Social networking system users connected to the online system user via each of a plurality of social networking systems are identified. Based on a number of social networking system users connected to both the online system user and to a social networking system user connected to the online system user, a social proximity score indicating relative social “closeness” of the digital magazine server user and the social networking system user connected to the digital magazine server user is generated.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 700 308 filed Sep. 12 2012 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 752 952 filed Jan. 15 2013 each of which is incorporated by reference in their entirety.

This invention relates generally to online systems and more specifically to determining social proximity between users of an online system.

An online system offering content for consumption by their users often recommends content items to its users to keep the users engaged with the online system. For example an online system identifies content items to recommend to users based on a content item s popularity or the content item s similarity to content items with which a user previously interacted. However a content item that is popular among some online system users may not be interesting to another online system user because the user does not share common interests with the online system users with which the content item is popular. Accordingly determining which content items to recommend to a user based merely on the popularity of content items across an online system s entire user base often results in recommending content items to users who are not interested in the recommended items.

An online system determines social proximity of its users to each other based on connections between an online system user and additional users of each of a plurality of social networking systems. In a social networking system a user may have a connection to one or more additional users. The online system communicates with a plurality of social networking systems to retrieve information maintained by various social networking systems describing connections between a user and additional users of one or more social networking systems. To determine social proximity between a user of the online system and a social networking system user connected to the user of the online system via a social networking system the online system accesses profiles of the user of the online system from each of the social networking systems and identifies users of each social networking system connected to the user based on information maintained by the various social networking systems. A set of additional users of social networking systems connected to both the user of the online system and to an identified user of a social networking system connected to the user of the online system are identified from the information maintained by the plurality of social networking systems. Based on the number of additional users of one or more social networking system users connected to the user of the online system and connected to the identified user of the social networking system connected to the user of the online system as well as additional information retrieved from the social networking system pertaining to the user of the online system the online system generates a social proximity score indicating relative social closeness of the user and the identified user of the online system of the social networking system connected to the user of the online system. For example the social proximity score is proportional to a fraction of the users of the plurality of social networking system users connected to the user of the online system and to the identified user of the social networking system connected to the user of the online system via one or more social networking systems.

In one embodiment the online system generates social proximity scores by analyzing groups of users connected to each other in one or more social networking systems. The online system may calculate or define a distribution of social proximity scores for the groups of users connected to each other and normalize the social proximity score between a user and an additional user connected to the user in the group to the distribution of social proximity scores for the group. The online system may additionally or alternatively use other characteristics of connection between the user and an additional user via a social networking system such as directionality of the connection between the user and the additional user in the social networking system.

The online system may use the social proximity scores between various online system users to recommend content items to its users. In one embodiment two users with at least a threshold social proximity score to each other are determined to share common interests so the online system accounts for the social proximity score when recommending content items to one of the users. For example if two users have at least a threshold social proximity score to each other content items that one of the users interacted with or viewed are recommended to the other user.

The features and advantages described in this summary and the following detailed description are not all inclusive. Many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings specification and claims.

The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.

A digital magazine server determines social proximities between various users of the online system based on users of social networking systems connected to the users of the online system via the one or more social networking systems connections between the users and additional users of the social networking systems. For purposes of illustration example embodiments of determining social proximity are described herein with respect to a digital magazine server. However other embodiments may be implemented by other online systems such as social networking systems or online content providers.

In one embodiment the digital magazine server retrieves content from one or more sources and generates a personalized customizable digital magazine for a user based on the retrieved content. The generated digital magazine is retrieved by a digital magazine application executing on a computing device such as a mobile communication device tablet computer or any other suitable computing system and presented to the user. For example based on selections made by the user and or on behalf of the user the digital server application generates a digital magazine including one or more sections including content items retrieved from a number of sources and personalized for the user. The generated digital magazine allows the user to more easily consume content that interests and inspires the user by presenting content items in an easily navigable interface via a computing device.

The digital magazine may be organized into a number of sections that each include content having a common characteristic e.g. content obtained from a particular source . For example a section of the digital magazine includes articles from an online news source such as a website for a news organization another section includes articles from a third party curated collection of content associated with a particular topic e.g. a technology compilation and an additional section includes content obtained from one or more accounts associated with the user and maintained by one or more social networking systems. For purposes of illustration content included in a section is referred to herein as content items or articles which may include textual articles pictures videos products for sale user generated content e.g. content posted on a social networking system advertisements and any other types of content capable of display within the context of a digital magazine.

A source is a computing system capable of providing various types of content to a client device . Examples of content provided by a source include text images video or audio on web pages web feeds social networking information messages or other suitable data. Additional examples of content include user generated content such as blogs tweets shared images video or audio social networking posts and social networking status updates. Content provided by a source may be received from a publisher e.g. stories about news events product information entertainment or educational material and distributed by the source or a source may be a publisher of content it generates. For convenience content from a source regardless of its composition may be referred to herein as an article a content item or as content. A content item may include various types of content such as text images and video.

The sources communicate with the client device and the digital magazine server via the network which may comprise any combination of local area and or wide area networks using both wired and or wireless communication systems. In one embodiment the network uses standard communications technologies and or protocols. For example the network includes communication links using technologies such as Ethernet 802.11 worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX 3G 4G code division multiple access CDMA digital subscriber line DSL etc. Examples of networking protocols used for communicating via the network include multiprotocol label switching MPLS transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP hypertext transport protocol HTTP simple mail transfer protocol SMTP and file transfer protocol FTP . Data exchanged over the network may be represented using any suitable format such as hypertext markup language HTML or extensible markup language XML . In some embodiments all or some of the communication links of the network may be encrypted using any suitable technique or techniques.

The client device is one or more computing devices capable of receiving user input as well as transmitting and or receiving data via the network . In one embodiment the client device is a conventional computer system such as a desktop or a laptop computer. Alternatively the client device may be a device having computer functionality such as a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile telephone a smartphone a tablet computer or another suitable device. In one embodiment the client device executes an application allowing a user of the client device to interact with the digital magazine server . For example an application executing on the client device communicates instructions or requests for content items to the digital magazine server to modify content presented to a user of the client device . As another example the client device executes a browser that receives pages from the digital magazine server and presents the pages to a user of the client device . In another embodiment the client device interacts with the digital magazine server through an application programming interface API running on a native operating system of the client device such as IOS or ANDROID . While shows a single client device in various embodiments any number of client devices may communicate with the digital magazine server .

A display device included in the client device presents content items to a user of the client device . Examples of the display device include a liquid crystal display LCD an organic light emitting diode OLED display an active matrix liquid crystal display AMLCD or any other suitable device. Different client devices may have display devices with different characteristics. For example different client devices have display devices with different display areas different resolutions or differences in other characteristics.

One or more input devices included in the client device receive input from the user. Different input devices may be included in the client device . For example the client device includes a touch sensitive display for receiving input data commands or information from a user. Using a touch sensitive display allows the client device to combine the display device and an input device simplifying user interaction with presented content items. In other embodiments the client device may include a keyboard a trackpad a mouse or any other device capable of receiving input from a user. In another example the input device is configured to receive information from a user of the client device through a touchless interface. Examples of a touchless interface include sensors such as an image capture device to receive gestures from a client device user without the user physically contacting the display device or the client device . Additionally the client device may include multiple input devices in some embodiments. Inputs received via the input device may be processed by a digital magazine application associated with the digital magazine server and executing on the client device to allow a client device user to interact with content items presented by the digital magazine server .

The digital magazine server receives content items from one or more sources generates pages in a digital magazine by processing the received content and provides the pages to the client device . As further described below in conjunction with the digital magazine server generates one or more pages for presentation to a user based on content items obtained from one or more sources and information describing organization and presentation of content items. For example the digital magazine server determines a page layout specifying positioning of content items relative to each other based on information associated with a user and generates a page including the content items arranged according to the determined layout for presentation to the user via the client device . This allows the user to access content items via the client device in a format that enhances the user s interaction with and consumption of the content items. For example the digital magazine server provides a user with content items in a format similar to the format used by print magazines. By presenting content items in a format similar to a print magazine the digital magazine server allows a user to interact with content items from multiple sources via the client device with less inconvenience from horizontally or vertically scrolling to access various content items.

A social networking system is a computing system allowing its users to communicate or otherwise interact with each other. Additionally a social networking system allows its users to establish connections with other users of the social networking system . Connections between users of a social networking systems may be unidirectional e.g. user A connects to user B but user B does not necessarily connect to user A or bidirectional e.g. users A and B are connected if both user A and user B authorize the connection . When a first user is connected to a second user by a unidirectional connection the first user can view content posted by the second user in the social networking system . When two users are connected by a bidirectional connection each user can view content posted by the other.

Each social networking system maintains user profiles describing each of its users. Examples of information stored in a user profile include demographic data e.g. gender information biographic data e.g. interest information actions taken by the users involving other users or content maintained by the social networking system and additional users of a social networking system connected to a social networking system user described by the user profile. In one embodiment the user profile also identifies groups of additional users of the social networking system connected to a user. A social networking system may allow a user to form logical groups of additional users of the social networking system connected to the user. A user may assign a subset of the users connected to the user to groups to organize the additional users connected to the user or to prioritize presentation of content from additional users connected to the user. For example a user assigns additional users connected to the user via a social networking system to groups of family friends coworkers or classmates based on the relationship between the user and the additional users. Each additional user connected to a user of a social networking system may be assigned to zero one or more groups within each social networking system .

In another embodiment a social networking system enables users to join groups that represent virtual communities of users within the social networking system . For example users join groups for an event attended by the users for a common interest of the users or for communities outside of the social networking system such as a group of coworkers classmates or members of an organization . Members of a group may communicate with each other through for example a forum provided by the social networking system for the group. A user may or may not be connected to the other members of a group. In yet another embodiment a social networking system may automatically assign a subset of additional users connected to the user via the social networking system to a group based on a common characteristic or attribute of the user and the additional users connected to the user. For example a social networking system generates a group including the user s coworkers or classmates based on work or education history in the user s user profile and in the user profiles of the additional users connected to the user.

Users interact with content such as pages presented by one or more social networking systems via the client device . In one embodiment the social networking systems serve as sources for content of the digital magazines served by the digital magazine server . A user of the digital magazine server and one or more social networking systems may provide the digital magazine server with the user s authentication information e.g. login credentials for accessing one or more of the social networking systems that maintain a user profile for the user. Using the authentication information the digital magazine server accesses one or more of the social networking systems and retrieves content for presentation to the digital magazine server user in a format similar to print magazines for example.

Each user of the digital magazine server is associated with a user profile which is stored in the user profile store . A user profile includes declarative information about the user that was explicitly shared by the user and may also include profile information inferred by the digital magazine server . In one embodiment a user profile includes multiple data fields each describing one or more attributes of the corresponding digital magazine server user. Examples of information stored in a user profile include biographic demographic and other types of descriptive information such as gender hobbies or preferences location or other suitable information. A user profile in the user profile store also includes data describing interactions by a corresponding user with content items presented by the digital magazine server . For example a user profile includes a content item identifier a description of an interaction with the content item corresponding to the content item identifier and a time when the interaction occurred. Interactions with the content items may include for example viewing or reading the content item saving the content item to a favorites collection providing explicit positive or negative feedback about the content item or sharing the content item with one or more connections in the digital magazine server or in a social networking system .

While user profiles in the user profile store are frequently associated with individuals allowing individuals to provide and receive content items via the digital magazine server user profiles may also be stored for entities such as businesses or organizations. This allows an entity to provide or access content items via the digital magazine server . An entity may post information about itself about its products or provide other content items associated with the entity to users of the digital magazine server . For example users of the digital magazine server may receive a digital magazine or section including content items associated with an entity via the digital magazine server .

The template store includes page templates each describing a spatial arrangement layout of content items relative to each other on a page for presentation by a client device . A page template includes one or more slots each configured to present one or more content items. In some embodiments slots in a page template may be configured to present a particular type of content item or to present a content item having one or more specified characteristics. For example a slot in a page template is configured to present an image while another slot in the page template is configured to present text data. Each slot has a size e.g. small medium or large and an aspect ratio. One or more page templates may be associated with types of client devices allowing content items to be presented in different relative locations and with different sizes when the content items are viewed using different client devices . Additionally page templates may be associated with sources allowing a source to specify the format of pages presenting content items received from the source . For example an online retailer is associated with a page template to allow the online retailer to present content items via the digital magazine server with a specific organization. Examples of page templates are further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 187 840 filed on Jul. 21 2011 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The content store stores objects that each represents various types of content. For example the content store stores content items received from one or more sources within a threshold time of a current time. Examples of content items stored by the content store include a page post a status update a photograph a video a link an article video data audio data a check in event at a location or any other type of content. A user may specify a section including content items having a common characteristic and the common characteristic is stored in the content store along with an association with the user profile or the user specifying the section.

The layout engine retrieves content items from one or more sources or from the content store and generates a page including the content items based on a page template from the template store . Based on the retrieved content items the layout engine may identify candidate page templates from the template store score the candidate page templates based on characteristics of the slots in different candidate page templates and based on characteristics of the content items. Based on the scores associated with candidate page templates the layout engine selects a page template and associates the retrieved content items with one or more slots to generate a page where the retrieved content items are presented relative to each other and sized based on their associated slots. When associating a content item with a slot the layout engine may associate the content item with a slot configured to present a specific type of content item or to present content items having one or more specified characteristics. An example of using a page template to present content items is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 187 840 filed on Jul. 21 2011 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The connection generator monitors interactions between users and content items presented by the digital magazine server . Based on the interactions the connection generator determines connections between various content items connections between users and content items or connections between users of the digital magazine sever . For example the connection generator identifies when users of the digital magazine system provide feedback about a content item access a content item share a content item with other users or perform other actions with content items. In some embodiments the connection generator retrieves data describing user interaction with content items from the user s user profile in the user profile store . Alternatively user interactions with content items are communicated to the connection generator when the interactions are received by the digital magazine server . The connection generator may account for temporal information associated with user interactions with content items for example the connection generator identifies user interactions with a content item within a specified time interval or applies a decay factor to identified user interactions based on a time associated with an interaction. The connection generator generates a connection between a user and a content item if the user s interactions with the content item satisfy one or more criteria. In one embodiment the connection generator determines one or more weights specifying a strength of the connection between the user and the content item based on user interactions with the content item that satisfy one or more criteria. Generation of connections between a user and a content item is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 905 016 filed on May 29 2013 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

If multiple content items are connected to a user the connection generator establishes implicit connections between each of the content items connected to the user. In one embodiment the connection generator maintains a user content graph identifying the implicit connections between content items connected to a user. In one embodiment weights associated with connections between a user and content items are used to determine weights associated with various implicit connections between content items. User content graphs for multiple users of the digital magazine server are combined to generate a global content graph describing connections between various content items provided by the digital magazine server based on user interactions with various content items. For example the global content graph is generated by combining user content graphs based on mutual connections between various content items in user content graphs.

In one embodiment the connection generator generates an adjacency matrix from the global content graph or from multiple user content graphs and stores the adjacency matrix in the connection store . The adjacency matrix describes connections between content items. For example the adjacency matrix includes identifiers of content items and weights representing the strength or closeness of connections between content items based on the global content graph. As an example the weights indicate a degree of similarity in subject matter or other characteristics associated with various content items. In other embodiments the connection store includes various adjacency matrices determined from various user content graphs the adjacency matrices may be analyzed to generate an overall adjacency matrix for content items provided by the digital magazine server . Graph analysis techniques may be applied to the adjacency matrix to rank content items to recommend content items to a user or to otherwise analyze relationships between content items. An example of the adjacency matrix is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 905 016 filed on May 29 2013 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In addition to identifying connections between content items the connection generator may also determine a social proximity between users of the digital magazine server based on interactions between users and content items. The digital magazine server determines social proximity or social distance between users using a variety of techniques. An example method for determining social proximity is further described below in conjunction with . For example the digital magazine server analyzes additional users connected to each of two users of the digital magazine server within one or more social networking systems to determine the social proximity of the two users. In another example the digital magazine server determines social proximity between a first and a second user by analyzing the first user s interactions with content items posted by the second user whether the content item is posted using the digital magazine server or on another social networking system . Additional examples for determining social proximity between users of the digital magazine server are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 905 016 filed on May 29 2013 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In one embodiment the connection generator determines a connection confidence value between a user and an additional user of the digital magazine server based on the user s and the additional user s interactions with content items. The connection confidence value may be a numerical score representing a measure of closeness between the user and the additional user. For example a larger connection confidence value indicates a greater similarity between the user and the additional user. In one embodiment if a user has at least a threshold connection confidence value with another user the digital magazine server stores a connection between the user and the additional user in the connection store .

The social proximity module determines social proximity between users of the digital magazine server . In one embodiment the social proximity module analyzes information retrieved from various social networking systems to determine the social proximity of a user of the digital magazine server to social networking system users connected to the user of the digital magazine server via one or more social networking systems . In another embodiment the social proximity module analyzes inferred connections between users of the digital magazine server e.g. as generated by the connection generator and stored in the connection store to determine social proximity between users of the digital magazine server . Based on a number of users of one or more social networking systems connected to a digital magazine server user via the one or more social networking systems and to an additional user connected to the digital magazine server via a social networking system the social proximity module generates a social proximity score between the digital magazine server user and the additional user connected to the digital magazine server user via the social networking system . The social proximity score represents the relative closeness of the digital magazine server user via the social networking system . For example a social proximity score having at least a threshold value indicates that two users are very close socially such as family or close friends. A low social proximity score below a minimum threshold value indicates that two users are not socially close such as one time acquaintances or users who have never met. The social proximity module may also use information other than a number of social networking system users connected to the digital magazine server user and an additional user connected to the digital magazine server via a social networking system maintained by one or more social networking system describing a connection between the digital magazine server user via a social networking system to generate the social proximity score such as a number of social networks in which the users are connected the directionality of the connection between the digital magazine server user and the additional user of a social networking system connected to the digital magazine server user via a social networking system or groups maintained by one or more social networking system networks including the digital magazine server user and the additional user of a social networking system . The social proximity module is described below with respect to .

Using the social proximity score generated by the social proximity module and data from the connection store the recommendation engine identifies content items from one or more sources for recommending to a digital magazine server user. Hence the recommendation engine identifies content items potentially relevant to a user. In one embodiment the recommendation engine retrieves data describing interactions between a user and content items from the user s user profile and data describing connections between content items connections between users from the connection store and or social proximity scores between the users generated by the social proximity module . In one embodiment the recommendation engine uses stored information describing content items e.g. topic sections subsections and interactions between users and various content items e.g. views shares saved links topics read or recent activities to identify content items that may be relevant to a digital magazine server user. For example content items having an implicit connection of at least a threshold weight to a content item with which the user interacted are recommended to the user. As another example the recommendation engine presents a user with content items having one or more attributes in common with a content item with which an additional user having a threshold social proximity score with the user interacted. Recommendations for additional content items may be presented to a user when the user views a content item using the digital magazine may be presented as a notification to the user by the digital magazine server or may be presented to the user through any suitable communication channel.

In one embodiment the recommendation engine applies various filters to content items received from one or more sources or from the content store to efficiently provide a user with recommended content items. For example the recommendation engine analyzes attributes of content items in view of characteristics of a user retrieved from the user s user profile. Examples of attributes of content items include a type e.g. image story link video audio etc. a source from which a content item was received time when a content item was retrieved and subject matter of a content item. Examples of characteristics of a user include biographic information about the user users connected to the user social proximity scores between the connections and the user and interactions between the user and content items. In one embodiment the recommendation engine analyzes attributes of content items in view of a user s characteristics for a specified time period to generate a set of recommended content items. The set of recommended content items may be presented to the user or may be further analyzed based on user characteristics and on content item attributes to generate more refined set of recommended content items. A setting included in a user s user profile may specify a length of time that content items are analyzed before identifying recommended content items to the user allowing a user to balance refinement of recommended content items with time used to identify recommended content items.

The search module receives a search query from a user and retrieves content items from one or more sources based on the search query. For example content items having at least a portion of an attribute matching at least a portion search query are retrieved from one or more sources . The user may specify sources from which content items are received through settings maintained by the user s user profile or by identifying one or more sources in the search query. In one embodiment the search module generates a section of the digital magazine including the content items identified based on the search query as the identified content items have a common attribute of their association with the search query. Presenting identified content items identified from a search query allows a user to more easily identify additional content items at least partially matching the search query when additional content items are provided by sources .

To more efficiently identify content items based on search queries the search module may index content items groups or sections of content items and user profile information. In one embodiment the index includes information about various content items such as author source topic creation data time user interaction information document title or other information capable of uniquely identifying the content item. Search queries are compared to information maintained in the index to identify content items for presentation to a user. The search module may present identified content items based on a ranking. One or more factors associated with the content items may be used to generate the ranking Examples of factors include global popularity of a content item among users of the digital magazine server connections between users interacting with a content item and the user providing the search query social proximity of the user providing the search query to the user s connections and information from a source . Additionally the search module may assign a weight to the index information associated with each content item selected based on similarity between the index information and a search query and rank the content items based on their weights. For example content items identified based on a search query are presented in a section of the digital magazine in an order based in part on the ranking of the content items.

To increase user interaction with the digital magazine the interface generator maintains instructions associating received input with actions performed by the digital magazine server or by a digital magazine application executing on a client device . For example instructions maintained by the interface generator associate types of inputs or specific inputs received via an input device of a client device with modifications to content presented by a digital magazine. As an example if the input device is a touch sensitive display the interface generator includes instructions associating different gestures with navigation through content items or presented via a digital magazine. Instructions from the interface generator are communicated to a digital magazine application or other application executing on a client device on which content from the digital magazine server is presented. Inputs received via an input device of the client device are processed based on the instructions when content items are presented via the digital magazine server is presented to simplify user interaction with content presented by the digital magazine server .

The web server links the digital magazine server via the network to the one or more client devices as well as to the one or more sources . The web server serves web pages as well as other content such as JAVA FLASH XML and so forth. The web server may retrieve content item from one or more sources . Additionally the web server communicates instructions for generating pages of content items from the layout engine and instructions for processing received input from the interface generator to a client device for presentation to a user. The web server also receives requests for content or other information from a client device and communicates the request or information to components of the digital magazine server to perform corresponding actions. Additionally the web server may provide application programming interface API functionality to send data directly to native client device operating systems such as IOS ANDROID WEBOS or BlackberryOS.

For purposes of illustration describes various functionalities provided by the digital magazine server . However in other embodiments the above described functionality may be provided by a digital magazine application executing on a client device or may be provided by a combination of the digital magazine server and a digital magazine application executing on a client device . For example the social proximity module may be a module executed by the digital magazine server by a client device or by a combination of the digital magazine server and the client device . In yet another embodiment the social proximity module may be executed by a social networking system or by an online system other than the digital magazine server .

In the example of when a digital magazine server generates a page for presentation to a user the digital magazine server populates slots in a page template with content items. Information identifying the page template and associations between content items and slots in the page template is stored and used to generate the page. For example to present a page to a user the layout engine identifies the page template from the template store and retrieves content items from one or more sources or from the content store . The layout engine generates data or instructions associating content items with slots within the page template . Hence the generated page includes various content regions presenting one or more content items associated with a slot in a location specified by the slot.

A content region may present image data text data a combination of image and text data or any other information retrieved from a corresponding content item. For example in the content region A represents a table of contents identifying sections of a digital magazine and content associated with the various sections are presented in content regions B H. For example content region A includes text or other data indicating that the presented data is a table of contents such the text Cover Stories Featuring followed by one or more identifiers associated with various sections of the digital magazine. In one embodiment an identifier associated with a section describes a characteristic common to at least a threshold number of content items in the section. For example an identifier refers to the name of a user of social network from which content items included in the section are received. As another example an identifier associated with a section specifies a topic an author a publisher e.g. a newspaper a magazine or other characteristic associated with at least a threshold number of content items in the section. Additionally an identifier associated with a section may further specify content items selected by a user of the digital magazine server and organized as a section. Content items included in a section may be related topically and include text and or images related to the topic.

Sections may be further organized into subsections with content items associated with one or more subsections presented in content regions. Information describing sections or subsections such as a characteristic common to content items in a section or subsection may be stored in the content store and associated with a user profile to simplify generation of a section or subsection for the user. A page template associated with a subsection may be identified and slots in the page template associated with the subsection used to determine presentation of content items from the subsection relative to each other. Referring to the content region H includes a content item associated with a newspaper to indicate a section including content items retrieved from the newspaper. When a user interacts with the content region a page template associated with the section is retrieved as well as content items associated with the section. Based on the page template associated with the section and the content items the digital magazine server generates a page presenting the content items based on the layout described by the slots of the page template. For example in the section page includes content regions presenting content items associated with the section. The content regions may include content items associated with various subsections including content items having one or more common characteristics e.g. topics authors etc. . Hence a subsection may include one or more subsections allowing hierarchical organization and presentation of content items by a digital magazine.

The social network interface retrieves information from one or more social networking systems describing a user of the digital magazine server that maintains a user profile on the one or more social networking systems . For example the social network interface retrieves information from one or more social networking systems identifying additional users of a social networking system connected to the user of the digital magazine server and may retrieve additional information describing the user of the digital magazine server e.g. demographic information actions performed by the user of the digital magazine server and maintained by the social networking system etc. . The social network interface may access information from the social networking systems on a periodic basis such as once per day. The social network interface accesses the social networking systems using social networking authentication information associated with a user of the digital magazine server access to a social networking system such as username email address password or other information suitable for providing the user of the digital magazine server access to a social networking system .

In one embodiment the social network interface accesses social networking system information when a user of the digital magazine server accesses a social networking system from an interface in a generated digital magazine. In another embodiment the social network interface accesses social networking system information when the user sets up an account or user profile with the digital magazine server . A user of the digital magazine server may access multiple social networking systems from the interface in a generated digital magazine or otherwise provide the digital magazine server with authentication credentials for accessing profiles associated with the user of the digital magazine server and maintained by multiple social networking systems . Identifiers of the user s user profiles in each of the social networking systems may be stored in the user profile maintained by the digital magazine server for the user of the digital magazine server . Accordingly the social network interface may identify several user profiles maintained by multiple social networking systems associated with a single user of the digital magazine server and retrieve social network information from each of the user profiles maintained by the various social networking systems . In another embodiment the social network interface accesses social networking system information without the user of the digital magazine server explicitly providing social networking authentication information to the digital magazine server .

Information retrieved by the social network interface from each social networking system includes information identifying additional users of each of the social networking systems connected to the user of the digital magazine server through a social networking system . If the user of the digital magazine server has grouped additional social networking system users connected to the user of the digital magazine server into one or more groups in a social networking system the names of the groups and social networking system users in each group may be identified by the information retrieved from a social networking system . In one embodiment the information retrieved from a social networking system may also include a set of users of the social networking system connected to both the user of the digital magazine server and to each additional user of the social networking system that is connected to the user of the digital magazine server through the social networking system . The social network interface may retrieve the set of social networking system users connected to a digital magazine server user and to an additional user of a social networking system connected to the digital magazine server user may retrieve a number of common social networking system users connected to a digital magazine server user and to an additional user of a social networking system connected to the digital magazine server user or may identify the number of social networking system users connected to a digital magazine server user and to an additional user of a social networking system connected to the digital magazine server user based on user profiles maintained by a social networking system for the digital magazine server user and for the additional social networking system user connected to the digital magazine server user via the social networking system . In some embodiments additional information retrieved from the one or more social networking systems includes actions by the digital magazine server user on each social network e.g. posting content viewing content posted by other users sharing content with connections or providing explicit positive or negative feedback for content . In one embodiment the social network interface retrieves the information from various social networking systems by executing a call provided by an application programming interface API associated with each of the social networking systems .

The group analysis module analyzes groups of additional social networking system users connected to a digital magazine server user via one or more social networking systems . As described above a subset of social networking system users connected to the digital magazine server user via a social networking system may be assigned to one or more groups in the social networking system by the user by the social networking systems or by the choice of the social networking system users to join a group. For each user of the digital magazine server the group analysis module analyzes groups maintained by various social networking systems including the digital magazine server user.

For example the group analysis module identifies social networking system users connected to a digital magazine server user via a social networking system user that are assigned to a group. In one embodiment the group analysis module classifies the groups by their names. Group names may indicate relative social proximity of the social networking system users in the groups to each other. For example groups named friends amigos buddies mates amici interesting people freunde vrienden or the like may indicate that the social networking system users included in the group have a moderately high social proximity to the digital magazine server user included in the group the group analysis module may assign these groups and the social networking system users in these groups to a medium social proximity group class. Groups named best friends inner circle top fays favorites close or the like may indicate that the social networking system users included in the group have a relatively higher social proximity to the digital magazine server user included in the group the group analysis module may assign the social networking system users in these groups to a high social proximity group class. Groups named family relatives conocidos conhecidos familia familie or the like may indicate the highest social proximity between the digital magazine server user and each of the social networking system users in the group. In one embodiment the group analysis module assigns social networking system users in these groups to a highest social proximity group class. The group analysis module may assign social networking system users in another group including the digital magazine server user to an unknown social proximity group class if for example the name of the group does not indicate a relative social proximity of the social networking system users included in the group to the digital magazine server user in the group.

The social proximity calculator generates a score indicating the social proximity of a digital magazine server user and a social networking system user connected to the digital magazine server user via a social networking system . As described above the social proximity score is a representation of the relative closeness of a digital magazine server user and a social networking system user connected to the digital magazine server user via a social networking system to each other. A high social proximity score e.g. a social proximity score exceeding a threshold value indicates that the digital magazine server user and a social networking system user connected to the digital magazine server user are very close and a low social proximity score e.g. a social proximity score less than a minimum threshold value indicates that the digital magazine server user and a social networking system user connected to the digital magazine server user are not socially close. In one embodiment the social proximity score is a number between 0 and 1000 where 0 indicates that the users are not socially close e.g. the users have never met and 1000 indicates that the users are very socially close e.g. the users are family members . However in other embodiments the social proximity score may have any suitable range of values.

In one embodiment for each user U of the digital magazine server the social proximity calculator generates the social proximity score between the user U and a social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user via a social networking system based on the number of additional social networking system users connected to both digital magazine server user U and to social networking system user C. In one embodiment if social networking system user C is not a user of the digital magazine server the social proximity calculator generates a score sp U C representing the social proximity between the digital magazine server U and the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U via the social networking system by the equation sp common conn 1 where common U C is the number of social networking system users of a social networking system connected to both the digital magazine server U and the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U via the social networking system and conn U is the number of social networking system users connected to the digital magazine server user U in the social networking system . Thus the social proximity between the digital magazine server U and the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U according to equation 1 represents a fraction of the social networking system users of the social networking system connected to the digital magazine server user U that are connected to both the digital magazine server user U and the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U through the social networking system . The social proximity calculator may normalize the social proximity scores for the digital magazine server user U to a predefined range such as 0 1000.

If the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server U by the social networking system is also a user of the digital magazine server the social proximity calculator in one embodiment generates the social proximity score sp U C by the equation sp common conn 1 conn 2 where common U C is the number of users of the social networking system connected to the digital magazine server user U and connected to the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server U through the social networking system conn U is the number of social networking system users connected to the digital magazine server user U via the social network and conn C is the number of connections of the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U via the social networking system . The weights and may be heuristically determined. For example a may be a value greater than one e.g. 1.2 such that the social proximity score between the digital magazine server U and the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U through the social networking system is higher when social networking system users connected to the digital magazine server user U and connected to the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U are both known than when only the social networking system users connected to the digital magazine server user U via the social networking system are known. The weight may have a value between zero and one inclusive e.g. 0.9 . Thus the social proximity score between the digital magazine server U and the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U through the social networking system according to equation 2 uses a weighted average of the number of respective social networking system users connected to digital magazine server user U and connected to social networking system user C connected to digital magazine server user U and represents a fraction of the average number of social networking system users connected to both the digital magazine server U and the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U through the social networking system . The social proximity calculator may normalize the social proximity scores for the digital magazine server user U to a predefined range such as 0 1000.

The social proximity calculator may alternatively use other methods for generating the social proximity score between a digital magazine server user and a social networking system user connected to the digital magazine server user through the social networking system based on the number of social networking system users connected to the digital magazine server user and to the social networking system user connected to the digital magazine server user. For example the social proximity calculator may divide the number of social networking system users connected to both the digital magazine server user U and to the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U via a social networking system by the number of social networking system users connected to the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U. Hence the social proximity score represents the fraction of social networking system users connected to the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U that are common to the digital magazine server user U and to the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U.

In one embodiment the social proximity calculator aggregates connections between users via multiple social networks to generate the social proximity score. For example the social proximity calculator calculates the social proximity score using equations 1 or 2 in which common U C represents the number of users of multiple social networking systems connected to both the digital magazine server user U and to a social networking system user connected to the digital magazine server user C via a social networking system . In this example conn U and conn C represent respectively the number of unique social networking system users connected to of the digital magazine server user U and connected to the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U in each of the social networking systems .

As another example the social proximity calculator generates a social proximity score between the digital magazine server user U and a social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U via a social networking system for each of a plurality of social networks and generates an overall social proximity score by combining the individual social proximity scores for example by calculating a weighted average of the individual social networking system social proximity scores . By aggregating connections from multiple social networking systems to generate the social proximity score the social proximity calculator may generate a social proximity score that more accurately represents the social proximity of the digital magazine server user to the social networking system user connected to the digital magazine server user. For example if a digital magazine server user uses several social networking systems the digital magazine server user may be connected to a different set of social networking system users via each social networking system . Accordingly social networking system users connected to the digital magazine server user via a single social networking system may be only a subset of the users of various social networking systems connected to the digital magazine server user. Identifying users of various social networking systems connected to both the digital magazine server user and to a social networking system user connected to the digital magazine server user across several social networking systems allows the social proximity calculator to account for a larger number of social networking system users connected to the digital magazine server user when generating the social proximity score.

In one embodiment the social proximity calculator adjusts the generated social proximity scores based on other characteristics of a connection between a digital magazine server user and a social networking system user connected to the digital magazine server user. In one embodiment the social proximity calculator adjusts the social proximity score based on directionalities of the connection between the digital magazine server user and social networking system users connected to the digital magazine server user via a social networking system . For example if the digital magazine server user U and the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U are both connected to one another in a social network the relative social proximity of the digital magazine server user U and the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U may be greater than the relative social proximity of the digital magazine server user U and the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U when the digital magazine server user U is connected to the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U but the social networking system user C is not connected to the digital magazine server user U. Accordingly the social proximity calculator may adjust the social proximity score to account for directionality of the connection between the digital magazine server user U and the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U. For example the social proximity calculator generates the social proximity score by the equation 

In another embodiment the social proximity calculator adjusts the social proximity score between a digital magazine server user U and each social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U based on groups including the social networking system users C in one or more social networking systems . For example if a subset G of social networking system users C connected to the digital magazine server user U are in a group the social proximity calculator may analyze the group to generate a social proximity score between the user U and each social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U in the subset G. In one embodiment the social proximity calculator generates the social proximity score between a digital magazine server user U and a social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U based on for example equations 1 2 or 3 above and increasing the score if the social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U is part of a subset G. For example the social proximity calculator may add a fixed value e.g. 50 to the social proximity score between digital magazine server user U and a social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U if the digital magazine server user U included the social networking system user C in a group in one or more social networking systems . Alternatively the social proximity calculator may multiply the social proximity score determined by equation 1 2 or 3 by a scaling factor e.g. 1.2 if the digital magazine server user U included the social networking system user C in a group in one or more social networking systems .

In another embodiment the social proximity calculator analyzes the name of the group to adjust the social proximity between the digital magazine server user U and each social networking system user connected to the digital magazine server user U in the subset G. For each class of group names generated by the group analysis module the social proximity calculator defines parameters of the social proximity scores in the group. In one embodiment the social proximity calculator defines a mean an upper bound a lower bound and a standard deviation for the social proximity scores of the social networking system users connected to the digital magazine server user in each group. For example if the social proximity scores are on a scale from zero to 1000 the social proximity calculator may use the following parameters for each group class 

The social proximity calculator may adjust social proximity scores based on a determination that the social proximities are similar between the digital magazine server user U and each social networking system users C connected to the digital magazine server user U in the subset G. When generating a social proximity score for each social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server U the social proximity calculator may generate an initial score using equations 1 or 2 above for example then normalize the initial scores to the parameters of the class of the group including a social networking system user C connected to the digital magazine server user U.

The social proximity calculator stores the generated and or adjusted social proximity scores in the social proximity store in association with an identifier of the digital magazine server user and an identifier of the social networking system user connected to the digital magazine server user. The social proximity calculator may use any combination of the factors described above to generate the social proximity score between a digital magazine server user and a social networking system user connected to the digital magazine server via a social networking system . In other embodiments characteristics of a connection in a social networking system between the digital magazine server user and a social networking system user may be used to generate and or adjust the social proximity scores such as the frequency of interaction between the digital magazine server user and a social networking system user connected to the digital magazine server user through a social networking system or the digital magazine server .

In one embodiment the social proximity module generates a social proximity score between an online system user and each social networking system user connected to the online system user through the process illustrated in . Furthermore the process illustrated in may be performed for each of a plurality of users of the digital magazine server . In one embodiment the social proximity module generates the social proximity scores on a periodic basis such as once per day.

The social proximity module accesses user profiles maintained by one or more social networking systems and associated with a user of the digital magazine server . The user profiles may be maintained by one or more social networking systems or may be generated and stored by the digital magazine server . Based on the accessed user profiles the social proximity module identifies one or more social networking system users connected to the user of the digital magazine server via a social networking system . For example the social proximity module selects a social networking system and identifies a user of the selected social networking system connected to the user of the user of the digital magazine server .

For a social networking system user connected to the user of the digital magazine server via a social networking system the social proximity module determines a number of additional users of the social networking system connected to the social networking system user and connected to the user of the digital magazine sever . The social proximity module may determine the number of additional users of the social networking system connected to the social networking system user and connected to the user of the digital magazine sever in a single social networking system or may determine an aggregated number of additional users connected to both the user of the digital magazine server and to the social networking system user connected to the user of the digital magazine server across two or more social networks.

Based on the number of additional users of the social networking system connected to the social networking system user and connected to the user of the digital magazine sever the social proximity module generates a social proximity score between the user of the digital magazine server and the social networking system user connected to the user of the digital magazine server . The social proximity module may adjust the social proximity score based on other characteristics of the connection between the user of the digital magazine server and the social networking system user connected to the user of the digital magazine server . For example the social proximity module may scale the social proximity score based on the number of social networking systems in which the user of the digital magazine sever is connected to the social networking system user the directionality of the connection between the user of the digital magazine server and the social networking system user one or more groups including the social networking system user connected to the user of the digital magazine server or types and frequency of interactions between the user of the digital magazine server and the social networking system user connected to the user of the digital magazine server through the digital magazine server or through one or more social networking systems . Alternatively the social proximity module may add to or subtract from the social proximity score based on the characteristics of the connection between the user of the digital magazine server and the social networking system user.

The social proximity module stores the adjusted social proximity score. In one embodiment the digital magazine server uses the adjusted social proximity score to recommend content items to its users or provide relevant search results to its users or otherwise uses the social proximity score. For example two digital magazine server users with at least a threshold social proximity score to each other may be determined to share common interests. Accordingly using the social proximity score to determine recommendations allows the digital magazine server to present the users with content items likely to interest the users. As another example the digital magazine server ranks search results presented to a digital magazine sever user based at least in part on social proximity scores between the digital magazine server user and other digital magazine server users that interacted with content items in the search results.
