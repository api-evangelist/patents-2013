Governmental Interest The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.

Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to a matrix composite systems for ballistic resistant material systems which may be useful for military homeland security law enforcement and other applications.

More particularly these systems provide enhanced protection against blast and shockwaves along with the potential for increased protection against mild traumatic brain injury mild TBI blunt impacts as well as ballistic impact performance against high energy fragments and small arms threats in accordance with the respective performance specification requirements.

The present invention identifies and discloses matrix composites that are used in a variety of applications such as helmet and armor material systems with enhanced blast mitigation and blunt impact protection and face shields with enhanced blast mitigation and ballistic impact protection potentially against traumatic brain injuries for next generation integrated headgear protective systems. Embodiments of the present invention also can provide transparent lightweight armor with improved ballistic impact protection for vehicle windows shield systems.

Protective helmets and armor have been used for both military and non military applications to provide personnel protection and are designed through a number of mechanisms including elastic plastic deformation strain delocalization and shock impedance mismatch. These ballistic resistant articles are typically formed by combining multi layers of high strength fibers consolidated in a polymer matrix material. Thermoset resins are commonly used in a fiber reinforced composite structure for ballistic resistance. These include but are not limited to butyl rubber toughened phenolics along with aramid fabric reinforcements.

Also thermoplastic resins are used in both rigid and flexible composites applications. These include elastomers such as styrene isoprene styrene and styrene ethylene butylene styrene block copolymers as well as polyurethanes. One of the major advantages of these thermoplastic resins is their applicability in the form of aqueous dispersions without the need of organic solvents thus lessening environmental concerns. These types of thermoplastic resins are often used in conjunction with polyethylene fibers or the hybrid of aramid and polyethylene fibers to achieve the desired ballistic impact performance and stiffness requirements.

While conventional helmets and armor are suitable for protection against small arms fire e.g. 9 mm hand gun bullets and fragmentation these designs are not capable to divert and dissipate shockwaves from the head and thus are unable to prevent subsequent traumatic brain injury. Protection against blast and shockwaves however requires substantial improvement over such helmets due to the significantly increased pressure and energy expelled by the blast and shockwaves. In fact it has been reported that soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan when encountered shockwaves as a result of air blasts with overpressures in the kPa 1 MPa range often suffered mild to severe traumatic brain injury TBI which is detrimental and can result in long term medical problems.

Aspects of the present invention relate to a matrix composite comprising high strain rate sensitive elastomers in the form of a multi layer construct which provides ballistic resistant material systems with enhanced protection against blast damage as well as ballistic impact. High strain rate sensitive elastomers in accordance with this invention are those with the capability to transition from rubbery like towards glassy like deformation response at strain rates typically in the range of 10 10 sec and correspondingly with potential to exhibit significant enhancement in shockwaves dissipation as well as in mechanical strength in comparison to the low rate loading properties.

According to one embodiment a matrix composite for impact resistance and blast mitigation formed in a multi layer configuration may include a one or more outer layers comprising poly urethane urea having a strain rate sensitivity characteristic in the range of 1 000 sec to 1 000 000 sec and b one or more inner layers comprising poly urethane urea having a strain rate sensitivity characteristic in the range of 10 000 sec to 1 000 000 sec.

The poly urethane urea may be formed of 4 4 dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate diethyltoluenediamine and poly tetramethylene oxide for example. In some embodiments the poly urethane urea s of the one or more outer layers are formed of about 39 wt. 4 4 dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate about 13 wt. diethyltoluenediamine and about 48 wt. poly tetramethylene oxide with the molecular weight of the poly tetramethylene oxide being about 650 g mol. Or in other embodiments the poly urethane urea s of the one or more inner layers are formed of about 31 34 wt. 4 4 dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate about 10 14 wt. diethyltoluenediamine and about 52 59 wt. poly tetramethylene oxide with the molecular weight of poly tetramethylene oxide being about 1 000 g mol. In some instances the materials of the outer and inner layers may comprise the same poly urethane urea chemistry but have a predominantly phase mixed microstructure.

The poly urethane urea s of the outer and inner layers are generally amorphous. And the poly urethane urea s of the outer and inner layers are not covalently cross linked. In some embodiments the one or more outer layers or an intermediate layer can be formed of a prepreg material with the prepreg materials including fiber reinforcements encapsulated in a poly urethane urea matrix.

In some embodiments one or more outer layers may include hollow glass microspheres encapsulated in a poly urethane urea matrix. The inner and outer layers can have a tensile modulus of at least about 1 320 psi 9.1 MPa at 100 strain measured at a strain rate about 0.01 sec. And the one or more inner layers can have a greater tensile strength than those of the one or more outer layers despite the one or more inner layers and the one or more outer layers having similar tensile modulus values.

The compressive flow stress values of the inner and outer layers at strain rates about 1 000 2 500 sec may be higher in comparison with the corresponding compressive flow stress values at strain rates about 0.01 sec. Also the strain rate sensitivity of the one or more outer layers may be greater than those of the one or more inner layers at a strain rates of about 1 000 2 500 sec. The outer most of the one or more outer layers may have the greatest strain rate hardening characteristic of all layers. The segmental relaxation time of the outer most of the one or more outer layers can be approximately 2 10s at 25 C. The values of segmental relaxation time of the one or more inner layers may be approximately 7.5 10.5 10s at 25 C. The one or more inner layers may comprise at least two different types of layers as a unit the unit being repeated one or more times in the matrix composite. In various embodiments one or more of the poly urethane urea layers can be applied as an adhesive aqueous dispersion or a film. Also one of the one or more outer layers can comprises a bi layer that includes a poly urethane urea layer and a glass layer in some embodiments.

According to various embodiments the matrix composites may be incorporated into various ballistic resistant material systems. These may be configured as a helmet armor face shield or a transparent window element for instance. In the ballistic resistant material system each of the one or more outer layers may be approximately the same thickness and each of the one or more inner layers may be approximately the same thickness.

High performance elastomers which are capable of visco elastic rubber to glass transition at increasing strain rates have potential for greater energy absorption and dissipation upon impact. This mechanism as recognized by Bogoslovov R. B. Roland C. M. Gamache R. M. Applied Physics Letters 90 221910 12 2007 is significantly different from a number of other potential mechanisms including elastic plastic deformation strain delocalization and shock impedance mismatch which have been utilized in design of conventional ballistic and blast resistant material systems.

By exploiting high strain rate sensitive elastomers a matrix composite formed of a multi layer construct is highly effective to dissipate impact energy. The matrix composite provides effective protection for helmets and other armor related systems against blast and shockwaves from explosions and ballistic impacts in addition to protection against high energy fragments small arms threats and blunt impacts. This will considerably enhance the safety of military personnel and law enforcement users when confronted with not only dangerous and potentially life threatening situations such as projectile impact and blast events but also with potentially long term depression as a result of mild traumatic brain injury from shockwave hazards.

More specifically a matrix composite formed of a multi layer construct is a key to providing an ballistic resistant material system with enhanced energy dissipation and shockwaves damage mitigation capabilities. In addition a broad range of applications can be derived in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.

For purposes of the invention a matrix composite comprised of multiple elastomers having high strain rate hardening characteristics is configured in a multilayer construct to provide ballistic resistant material system with the potential of enhanced protection against blast and shockwaves blunt trauma and mild traumatic brain injuries in addition to protection against shrapnel high energy fragments and small arms threats. As used herein the term strain rate hardening characteristic means that the elastomers can undergo dynamic strain rate hardening and stress dissipation by transitioning from a rubbery like deformation response towards a glassy like deformation response. More particularly in the context of the invention strain rates which the matrix composite in a multilayer construct may be subjected to typically are expected to be in the range of about 10 10 second. This range may be of relevance to many ballistic impact and blast events that are anticipated for many armor systems.

In accordance with various embodiments of this invention elastomers that are capable of providing high strain rate sensitivity may be utilized to dissipate impact energy. This can be realized as the deformation strain rate is approaching or even greater than the average segmental mobility of a poly urethane urea elastomer in which the elastomer will have a glassy like behavior. The average segmental mobility is equivalent to the reciprocal of an average segmental relaxation time of a given polymer. The average segmental relaxation time can be determined for example by using broadband dielectric spectroscopy via a control system such as a Novocontrol Concept system for instance whereby measurements of dielectric loss as a function of frequency are obtained in the frequency range of 10to 10Hz. The segmental relaxation time is typically defined as the reciprocal of 2 f where fis the frequency of the peak maximum in the plot of dielectric loss vs. frequency.

Different types of intermolecular hydrogen bonding are present among the family of polyurethane poly urethane urea and polyurea elastomers. The binding energy calculated using quantum mechanics for the hydrogen bonding between the urethane and urethane groups is about 10.3 kcal mol which is weaker than the corresponding binding energy values calculated for the hydrogen bonding between urethane and urea groups about 13.0 kcal mol as well as for that between urea and urea groups about 14.2 kcal mol . The urethane urethane hydrogen bonding is predominant in polyurethanes whereas intermolecular urea urea urea urethane and urethane urethane hydrogen bonding are all present in poly urethane urea s suggesting poly urethane urea s provide better mechanical strength in comparison with the corresponding polyurethanes.

Thus in accordance with various embodiments of this invention poly urethane urea which may be abbreviated herein simply as PUU may preferably be used. PUU elastomers are thermoplastic prepared from reaction of a diisocyanate a diamine and a polyol. In various embodiments the diisocyanate may be selected from the group consisting of 4 4 methylene diphenyl diisocyanate isophorone diisocyanate 4 4 dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate and any mixture thereof the diamine may be selected from the group consisting of dimethylphenylenediamine diethyltoluenediamine 4 4 methylenebis cyclohexylamine and any mixture thereof and the polyol may be selected from the group consisting of poly propylene oxide poly tetramethylene oxide polycaprolactone diol polycarbonate diol and any mixture thereof.

The PUU elastomers may be formed to be generally amorphous and not chemically cross linked. For instance the choice of diisocyanate diamine and polyol may all have functionality equal to about two but no more to ensure no chemical cross linking reaction occurred during synthesis. Moreover the choice of diisocyanate diamine and polyol may be selected to render PUUs amorphous but not crystalline or semi crystalline.

According to aspects of the invention elastomers may be prepared having unique properties. More particularly the elastomers may have tunable microstructure and viscoelastic relaxation characteristics. In the case of PUU segmental dynamics derived from the analysis of dielectric relaxation data obtained from dielectric spectroscopy measurements for select model PUU elastomers can be used to tune the dynamic relaxation over a range of approximately four decades or greater in ambient conditions for energy absorption dissipation and shock wave mitigation. The response tuning can vary with respect to their corresponding segmental mobility.

Previously the influence of molecular mechanisms on microstructure evolution in select model PUUs was demonstrated by Strawhecker K. E. Hsieh A. J. Chantawansri T. L. Kalcioglu Z. I. Van Vliet K. J. in Influence of microstructure on micro nano mechanical measurements of select model transparent poly urethane urea elastomers Polymer 54 2013 901 908 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. PUUs for instance comprise a plurality of both hard and soft segments in polymer form giving rise to a complex microstructure wherein a broad range of phase formation may occur including phase mixed and microphase separated regions as well as any mixture thereof that influence dynamic mechanical strengthening and chemical hardening. The extent of microphase separation which dependent upon the composition can be analyzed by using small angle X ray scattering transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Hard segments are formed by reaction of a diisocyanate and a diamine and provide rigidity and stiffness whereas soft segments are predominantly composed of a long chain polyol and provide flexibility and toughness wherein polyol also reacts with a diisocyanate to form covalent bonds linking with hard segments in a polymer chain. The ratio or amount of hard and soft segments in the PUU polymer can be selectively tailored based on its versatile chemistry.

Using the molecular mechanisms previously demonstrated the overall dynamic mechanical response thus can be optimized for one or more and preferably each elastomer layer of a multilayer construct in accordance with embodiments herein. In some cases energy dissipation within the outermost layer s that face impacts may be maximized and energy absorption may be significantly improved throughout the multilayer construct. Molecular dynamic models can be used to study the effects of hard segment content and or the molecular weight of the soft segments on local morphology and rate dependent mechanical behaviors in the ballistic regime to determine a PUU chemistry having a particular strain rate sensitivity characteristic.

On the other hand the lamellar segments form through self assembly of hard segments oriented generally perpendicular to the axis of the polymer chain. They form primarily because of the strong bonding strength between hard segments wherein the binding energy is about 14.2 kcal mol calculated using quantum mechanics for the hydrogen bonding between urea and urea groups. This is higher than the corresponding binding energy values calculated for the hydrogen bonding between urea and urethane groups as well as between urethane and urethane groups in a PUU based polymer chain.

The degree of each structure present in the PUU elastomer depends on the specific chemistry of the polymer. More particularly it has been found that the molecular weight of soft segment i.e. PTMO plays an important role in the extent of phase mixing and its effect on the corresponding segmental dynamics.

Table 1 below lists the compositions of three PUU elastomers PUU A PUU B and PUU C along with the corresponding tensile modulus and tensile strength values determined at a strain rate about 0.01 second.

Tensile modulus refers to a measure of the stiffness of a material whereas tensile strength refers to a measure of the ultimate capacity of a material to resist a tensile load before failure although having the same units. In the context of the invention these are important variables because the preferred PUU elastomers comprising optimized tensile stiffness and tensile strength particularly in the form of a matrix composite in a multi layer construct can provide sufficient and desired mechanical strengthening for protection against ballistic impact. In some cases PUU elatomers having similar tensile modulus values can possess different tensile strength values. Both the tensile modulus and the tensile strength can be varied by changing the composition of PUU elastomers.

Specifically PUU A comprises about 31 wt. 4 4 dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate about 10 wt. diethyltoluenediamine and about 59 wt. poly tetramethylene oxide where the molecular weight of poly tetramethylene oxide is 1 000 g mol. PUU B comprises about 34 wt. 4 4 dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate about 14 wt. diethyltoluenediamine and about 52 wt. poly tetramethylene oxide where the molecular weight of poly tetramethylene oxide is 1 000 g mol. PUU C comprises about 39 wt. 4 4 dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate about 13 wt. diethyltoluenediamine and about 48 wt. poly tetramethylene oxide where the molecular weight of poly tetramethylene oxide is 650 g mol.

Microstructure is known to be very complex in thermoplastic elastomers. Typically engineering thermoplastic elastomers such as Kraton and spandex or Lycra are microphase separated. In accordance with various embodiments of this invention the preferred poly urethane urea elastomers that are capable of providing high strain rate sensitivity comprise a preferred microstructure which is mostly phase mixed but predominantly not microphase separated.

In further accordance of various embodiments of this invention the extent of phase mixing is most significant in PUU C of the preferred poly urethane urea elastomers based on the atomic force microscopy measurements for example as described by Strawhecker K. E. Hsieh A. J. Chantawansri T. L. Kalcioglu Z. I. Van Vliet K. J. in Influence of microstructure on micro nano mechanical measurements of select model transparent poly urethane urea elastomers Polymer 54 2013 901 908.

Poly urethane urea elastomers of choice are versatile for property optimization. As will be appreciated PUU B and PUU C are stiffer than PUU A whereas tensile strength of PUU B is greater than that of PUU C despite both have similar tensile modulus values.

Table 2 below lists the values of segmental relaxation time determined at 25 C. of various PUU elastomers useful for this invention wherein the strain rate sensitivity varies over the range of strain rate 10 10 sec. This range is of particular relevance to the blast and ballistic loading conditions and thus the potential of dynamic strain rate hardening to provide an armor material with significantly enhanced dynamic strengthening and energy dissipation capabilities. Also the average segmental relaxation time is much shorter for PUU C than PUU B indicative of greater strain rate sensitivity for PUU C at strain rates about 10sec despite both having similar tensile modulus values. Thus PUU C has potential to provide effective blast mitigation capability particularly with respect to protection against mild traumatic brain injuries.

These PUU elastomers and others useful in the present invention have dynamic strain rate hardening characteristics in the strain rate range of 10 000 sec to 1 000 000 sec. Furthermore some poly urethane urea elastomers such as PUU C have a broader dynamic strain rate hardening capability in particular over the range of 1 000 sec to 1 000 000 sec.

At strain rates of about 1 000 2 500 sec the flow stress values obtained for PUU C are about 7 200 8 000 50 55 MPa which are higher than those for PUU B about 6 100 6 800 psi 42 47 MPa . This is despite the fact that both PUU B and PUU C have similar flow stress values at low strain rates over the range between about 0.001 second and about 0.1 second. This is indicative of higher strain rate sensitivity of PUU C than PUU B over the strain rate about 1 000 2 500 sec which is a result of the difference in average segmental relaxation time shown in Table 2 based on the dielectric relaxation measurements via utilizing broadband dielectric spectroscopy. The segmental relaxation time determined at 25 C. is approximately 2 10sec correspondingly the apparent segmental mobility which is approximately equivalent to the reciprocal of segmental relaxation time is approximately 50 sec suggesting that PUU C will readily undergo glassy like deformation at strain rates about 10sand higher. The average segmental relaxation time is much shorter for PUU C than PUU B indicative of greater strain rate sensitivity for PUU C at strain rates about 10sec despite both having similar tensile modulus values. Thus PUU C has potential to provide effective blast mitigation capability particularly with respect to protection against mild traumatic brain injuries.

Dynamic strain rate hardening of the PUU B elastomer is further highlighted by using plate impact measurement wherein extremely high pressure and high strain rate loading conditions are present. Details of plate impact testing procedures can be found in Casem D. T. Hsieh A. J. U.S. Army Research Laboratory Technical Report ARL TR 6482 June 2013 . In general the poly urethane urea specimens of disk shaped nominally 3.4 mm in thickness and 40 mm in diameter are accelerated in a light gas gun and impacted against stationary soda lime glass target plates nominally 2.0 mm thick 40 mm diameter at select impact speeds. The soda lime glass remains elastic throughout the experiments and the poly urethane urea undergoes uni axial strain loading whereby an inherent local confinement results in high stress in poly urethane urea elastomers.

In some embodiments thermoplastic poly urethane urea elastomers of high strain rate sensitivity may be formed to be generally amorphous rather than crystalline or semi crystalline. These types of PUU elastomers having a tensile modulus at 100 strain of at least 1 320 psi 9.1 MPa . Despite being amorphous they have considerably higher tensile modulus values in comparison with what has been previously reported for semi crystalline polyurethane in U.S. Pat. No. 8 256 019 B2.

In accordance with certain embodiments the amorphous thermoplastic poly urethane urea elastomers that are high strain rate hardening are not chemically cross linked. These compositions are formed of three components i.e. a diisocyanate a diamine and a long chain polyol for properties optimization with the choice of diisocyanate diamine and polyol having preference to render PUUs being amorphous but not crystalline or semi crystalline. The choice of diisocyanate diamine and polyol all having functionality equal to about two but not higher to ensure no chemical cross links formation. The choice of a three component poly urethane urea is robust in varying composition for property optimization. The dynamic strain rate hardening characteristics can be greater than that of conventional elastomers. For example the tensile modulus of poly urethane urea elastomers can be tailored to be at least about 1 320 psi 9.1 MPa at 100 strain higher than that previously reported for polyurea elastomer of about 1 000 psi 6.9 MPa as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7 300 893 B2.

In Table 3 below the flow stress at 20 strain for the poly urethane urea elastomer increases from about 928 psi to about 4 293 psi from low rate loading to high rate loading at about 3200 sec which is much more strain rate sensitive in comparison with an increase from about 833 psi to about 2 361 psi at high rate loading of about 3500 sec for the polyurea disclosed in FIG. 6 of U.S. Pat. No. 7 300 893 B2.

In further accordance with embodiments the poly urethane urea elastomers in a multi layer construct may be designed and configured to provide ballistic resistant articles such as helmet and armor material systems with enhanced protection against shockwaves varying from blast loading e.g. strain rates about 10 10 sec to ballistic impact under extreme strain rates up to about 10 sec.

For example the outer and inner layers of the multi layer construct may be configured to behave differently to the strain rate. More particularly in a multi layer construct one or more outer layers of poly urethane urea elastomer materials i.e. those which are exterior or close to the exterior to a helmet or armor material system are configured to have greater dynamic strain rate hardening characteristics to provide the helmet or armor material system with enhanced dynamic strengthening and stiffening against ballistic and blast threats than other more interior layers. As such one or more outer layers may be configured to provide significantly high energy dissipation whereas one or more inner layers may be configured to provide moderate energy dissipation but significant energy absorption compared to the outer layers under both ballistic impact and blast exposure conditions. Furthermore the outer most layer of poly urethane urea multi layer construct may be configured to have the greatest dynamic strain rate hardening of the layers so as to provide the greatest capability to efficiently dissipate the shockwaves and impact energy. In one embodiment the one or more outer layers may have strain rate sensitivity characteristics in the range of 1 000 sec to 1 000 000 sec and the one or more inner layer may have strain rate sensitivity characteristic in the range of 10 000 sec to 1 000 000 sec.

In layers each of thickness T and in layers each of thickness T3 poly urethane urea elastomers have moderate dynamic strain rate hardening characteristics. Layers may be formed of about 34 wt. 4 4 dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate about 14 wt. diethyltoluenediamine and about 52 wt. poly tetramethylene oxide where the molecular weight of poly tetramethylene oxide is 1 000 g mol for example.

Layer may be formed of about 31 wt. 4 4 dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate about 10 wt. diethyltoluenediamine and about 59 wt. poly tetramethylene oxide where the molecular weight of poly tetramethylene oxide is 1 000 g mol for example.

The thicknesses T T and T of the corresponding PUU layers and shown in embodiment may vary in accordance design specifications and or intended use or application. For example in some embodiments T may be about 6 12 m T may be over the range between about 6 12 m and about 2 3 mm and T may be over the range between about 0.15 mm and about 2 3 mm.

The poly urethane urea elastomers for layer are efficient against shockwaves over the range of strain rates 10 10 sec along with poly urethane urea elastomers for layer having strong dynamic strengthening capability over the range of strain rates 10 10 sec are key attributes to a multi layer construct with the potential to provide an armor material with enhanced protection against both ballistic and blast damages. Thus layer may be oriented towards the exterior of the matrix composite to be first impacted.

In accordance with embodiments of the present invention a method for fabrication of embodiment includes first casting the poly urethane urea elastomers in the form of thin films of desired thickness followed by laying out the preferred polyethylene fiber reinforced prepreg materials along with poly urethane urea films for consolidation.

Each ply of poly urethane urea interlayers comprising approximately the same thickness preferably about 30 60 m wherein each poly urethane urea elastomers and among the outer most layers to both the exterior and interior of the helmet comprising approximately the same thickness preferably about 1 3 mm. The total number of prepreg plies as well as the details of the layup may be selected accordingly to the area density and or performance specification requirements. For some applications the prepregs and poly urethane urea films may be consolidated following a commercial molding cycle process per manufacturer s recommendation for fabrication of composites for helmets in accordance with the detailed military specification MIL DTL 62474F.

In further accordance with another embodiment of the present invention poly urethane urea elastomer PUU B having greater dynamic mechanical strengthening characteristics than poly urethane urea matrix PUU A can be utilized as the matrix for the core prepreg material layers.

In fabricating embodiment and embodiment for example the poly urethane urea elastomers can be prepared in an aqueous dispersion for coating of select fiber reinforcements. The fiber reinforcements may be polyethylene fibers such as Dyneema and Spectra Shield II as well as aramid fibers or any mixture thereof to form prepreg materials. Each prepreg may comprise a multi layer assembly of cross plies with fibers at orientation at 0 90 0 90 with each individual prepreg ply comprising approximately the same thickness approximately 6 12 m with each prepreg assembly among the outer most layers to both the exterior and interior of the helmet comprising approximately the same thickness preferably about 0.5 2 mm. The total number of prepreg plies as well as the details of the layup may be selected accordingly to the area density and or performance specification requirements. For some applications the prepregs may be consolidated following a commercial molding cycle process per manufacturer s recommendation for fabrication of composites for helmets in accordance with the detailed military specification MIL DTL 62474F.

In some embodiments the PUU elastomers having high strain rate hardening characteristics may be further utilized to encapsulate the hollow glass microspheres of various size for fabrication of poly urethane urea matrix hollow glass microsphere based composites to provide an armor material to further the blast mitigation capability.

In accordance with the present invention a method for fabrication of composite layers and includes encapsulating hollow glass microspheres in poly urethane urea elastomer matrix PUU B where the poly urethane urea and hollow glass microspheres are mixed and cast in the form of thin films of desired thickness preferably about 1 3 mm. The hollow glass microspheres may be formed of 3 M IM30K of soda lime borosilicate glass density of 0.6 g cm having a broad range of particle size distribution ranging from about 9 m to 29 m in diameter and having crash strength of about 30 000 psi. The hollow glass microsphere along with dynamic strain rate hardening of poly urethane urea matrix can provide a helmet or armor material system with enhanced protection against blast damage.

In fabricating embodiment according to embodiments of the present invention a method includes an aqueous dispersion comprising poly urethane urea elastomer PUU B and hollow glass microspheres is pre mixed wherein the well mixed coating is applied to completely encapsulate the body armor plate at desired thickness preferably about 1 3 mm wherein the preferred hollow glass microspheres such as 3M IM30K of soda lime borosilicate glass density of 0.6 g cm comprising a broad range of particle size distribution from 9 m to 29 m having crash strength of about 30 000 psi. Additional layers of topcoat are applied comprising poly urethane urea elastomer layers and of thickness preferably about 1 2 mm.

In the case of fabrication for embodiment according to the present invention a method including the steps wherein poly urethane urea elastomers are first cast and used in film form followed by lamination in accordance with the manufacturer s specification for transparent armor.

In accordance with the present invention shows embodiment with an improvement in transparent armor. The striking face layer of thickness T may include one or more glass layers or a combination of glass and ceramic layers illustrated as a single layer along with poly methyl methacrylate interlayers of thickness T illustrated as a single layer and a spall shield backing layer such as polycarbonate of thickness T bonded with poly urethane urea elastomers. Poly urethane urea elastomers PUU C of thickness T in layer and PUU B of thickness T in layer formed in a multilayer construct are amorphous and not covalently cross linked and of high strain rate sensitivity are also included. The thickness of poly urethane urea film layer may be about 0.45 0.65 mm whereas the thickness of poly urethane urea film layer may be about 1.0 1.3 mm. Poly urethane urea adhesive PUU C in layer having greater dynamic strain rate hardening is used to bond between glass and poly methyl methacrylate as well as between poly methyl methacrylate interlayers not shown due to illustration as a single layer than poly urethane urea adhesive PUU B in layer used to bond between poly methyl methacrylate and said polycarbonate layers as well as between glass layers not shown due to illustration as a single layer . The poly urethane urea elastomers have a tensile modulus at 100 strain significantly higher than those reported for a commercial Deerfield Dureflex A4700 polyurethane film adhesive available from Bayer MaterialScience used in many conventional transparent glass plastic armors. An example projectile P such a bullet is also illustrated in relation to embodiment .

The choice of thickness T for the glass layer thickness T of poly methyl methacrylate interlayers and thickness T of polymer backing layer depends on the system performance specification requirements. In the case of fabrication for embodiment according to the present invention a method includes casting the poly urethane urea elastomers in film form followed by the layup of glass poly methyl methacrylate and polycarbonate plates as well as the cast poly urethane urea films and assembled for consolidation in accordance with the manufacturer s specification for transparent armor also described in Patel P. J. Hsieh A. J. Gilde G. A. Improved Low Cost Multi Hit Transparent Armor 25Army Science Conference Orlando Fla. 2006 .

A bi layer design comprising poly urethane urea elastomers can have varying dynamic strain rate hardening characteristics in contrast to a single thin cover glass design with polyurethane adhesive disclosed for example in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2012 0174761 A1. For instance a combination of multiple thin cover glass layers in conjunction of multi layers of poly urethane urea elastomers of dynamic strain rate hardening characteristics according to the present invention can be utilized to provide an armor material with further improved multi hit performance with the face of the bi layer adhesive comprising poly urethane urea elastomer of thickness T having great dynamic strain rate hardening is used to bond the front cover glass layer whereas the rear of the bi layer adhesive comprising poly urethane urea elastomer of thickness T is used to bond the second cover glass layer . Poly urethane urea adhesive can be used to bond between cover glass layers having greater dynamic strain rate hardening than poly urethane urea adhesives used to bond between all other layers wherein combined benefits including a synergy with respect to dynamic strain rate hardening readily in both glassy poly methyl methacrylate and poly urethane urea elastomers.

The construction comprising multiple thin cover glass layers and poly urethane urea elastomers enables confinement of inherently dynamic strain rate hardening poly urethane urea elastomer adhesive as well as dynamically strengthening as a result of encapsulated thin cover glass layer. The thickness of cover glass may be about 1 mm for instance. The thickness of poly urethane urea films and is about 0.35 0.45 mm and in the case of a bi layer the thicknesses may be about 0.15 mm and 0.30 mm for film and respectively whereas thicknesses may be about 0.45 0.65 mm and about 1.0 1.3 mm for poly urethane urea films and respectively with the poly urethane urea elastomers having tensile modulus at 100 strain significantly higher than those reported for a commercial Deerfield A4700 polyurethane film adhesive used in many conventional transparent glass plastic armor.

In the case of fabrication for embodiment according to the present invention a method include first casting poly urethane urea elastomers in film form followed by the layup of thin cover glass glass plates poly methyl methacrylate and polycarbonate as well as the cast poly urethane urea films and assembled for consolidation in accordance with the manufacturer s specification for transparent armor also similarly described in Patel P. J. Hsieh A. J. Gilde G. A. Improved Low Cost Multi Hit Transparent Armor 25Army Science Conference Orlando Fla. 2006 .
