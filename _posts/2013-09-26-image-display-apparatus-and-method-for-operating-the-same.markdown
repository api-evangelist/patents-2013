This application is a Continuation application of prior U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 044 340 filed on Mar. 9 2011 which claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10 2010 0086151 filed in Korea on Sep. 2 2010 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 379 369 filed on Sep. 1 2010 the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

Display apparatuses and methods for operating the same are known. However they suffer from various disadvantages.

The CP may create and provide content. The CP may be for example a terrestrial broadcaster a cable System Operator SO or Multiple System Operator MSO a satellite broadcaster an Internet broadcaster as illustrated in or another appropriate content provider. Besides broadcast content the CP may also provide various applications.

The SP may provide content received from the CP in a service package. For instance the SP may package a first terrestrial broadcasting second terrestrial broadcasting cable broadcasting satellite broadcasting Internet broadcasting and or applications and may provide the package to users. The SP may unicast or multicast a service to the client . Unicast is a form of transmission in which information is sent from only one transmitter to only one receiver. In other words unicast transmission is point to point involving two nodes only. In an example of unicast transmission upon receipt of a request for data from a receiver a server may transmit the data to a single receiver.

Multicast is a type of transmission or communication in which a transmitter transmits data to a group of receivers. For example a server may transmit data to a plurality of pre registered receivers at one time. For multicast registration the Internet Group Management Protocol IGMP may be used.

The NP may provide a network over which a service may be provided to the client . The client may construct a home network and receive a service over the home network.

Content transmitted in the above described broadcasting system may be protected through conditional access or content protection. CableCard and Downloadable Conditional Access System DCAS are examples of conditional access or content protection.

The client may also transmit content over a network. In this case the client serves as a CP and thus the CP may receive content from the client . Therefore an interactive content service or data service can be provided.

The section filter may perform section filtering on the four types of data received through the broadcast interface . The section filter may output the AIT data to the AIT filter the linear A V content to the broadcast data processor and the stream events and application data to the application data processor .

Meanwhile the image display apparatus may receive non linear A V content and application data through the Internet interface . The non linear A V content may be for example a Content On Demand CoD application. The non linear A V content and the application data may be transmitted to the media player and the runtime module respectively. The runtime module may include for example an application manager and a browser as illustrated in . The application manager controls the life cycle of an interactive application using the AIT data for example. The browser displays and processes the interactive application.

In order to receive information about the SD servers an SD server address list can be detected for example using three methods. Specifically the SD server address list may be obtained by an address preset in the image display apparatus or an address manually set by a user Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol DHCP based SP Discovery and Domain Name System Service DNS SRV based SP Discovery. The image display apparatus accesses a specific SD server using the SD server address list obtained through one of the above three methods and receives a SP Discovery record from the specific SD server. The Service Provider Discovery record may include information needed to perform Service Discovery on an SP basis. The image display apparatus may then start a Service Discovery operation using the SP Discovery record. These operations can be performed in a push mode or a pull mode.

The image display apparatus may access an SP attachment server specified by an SP attachment locator included in the SP Discovery record and performs a registration procedure or a service attachment procedure . Further after accessing an authentication service server of an SP specified by an SP authentication locator and performing an authentication procedure the image display apparatus may perform a service authentication procedure. After service attachment is successfully performed a server may transmit data in the form of a provision information table to the image display apparatus.

During service attachment the image display apparatus may include an Identifier ID and location information thereof in data and transmit the data to the service attachment server. Thus the service attachment server may specify a service that the image display apparatus has subscribed to based on the ID and location information. In addition the service attachment server may provide in the form of a provisioning information table address information from which the image display apparatus can obtain Service Information SI . The address information may correspond to access information about a Master SI Table. This method facilitates provisioning of a customized service to each subscriber.

The SI may be divided into a Master SI Table record for managing access information and version information about a Virtual Channel Map a Virtual Channel Map Table for providing a list of services in the form of a package a Virtual Channel Description Table that contains details of each channel and a Source Table that contains access information about actual services.

For example when the Source Table is changed the version of the Source Table is incremented and the version of the Virtual Channel Description Table that references the Source Table is also incremented. Hence a change in any lower table may lead to a change in its higher tables and eventually a change in the Master SI Table.

One Master SI Table may exist for each SP. However in the case where service configurations differ for regions or subscribers or subscriber groups an SP may have a plurality of Master SI Tables in order to provide a customized service on a region subscriber or subscriber group basis. Thus it is possible to provide a customized service to a subscriber according to a region in which the subscriber is located and subscriber information regarding the subscriber.

A Virtual Channel Map Table may contain a list of one or more virtual channels. A Virtual Channel Map includes not details of the channels but information about the locations of the details of the channels. In the Virtual Channel Map Table VirtualChannelDescriptionLocation specifies the location of a Virtual Channel Description Table that provides virtual channel descriptions.

The Virtual Channel Description Table contains the details of the virtual channels. The Virtual Channel Description Table can be accessed using VirtualChannelDescriptionLocation of the Virtual Channel Map Table.

A Source Table provides information necessary to access actual services e.g. IP addresses ports AV Codecs transmission protocols etc. on a service basis.

The above described Master SI Table the Virtual Channel Map Table the Virtual Channel Description Table and the Source Table may be delivered in four logically separate flows in a push mode or a pull mode. For version management the Master SI Table may be multicast and thus a version change may be monitored by receiving a multicast stream of the Master SI Table.

The network interface may transmit packets to and receives packets from a network. Specifically the network interface may receive services and content from an SP over the network.

The TCP IP manager is involved in packet reception and transmission of the image display apparatus that is packet delivery from a source to a destination. The TCP IP manager may classify received packets according to appropriate protocols and may output the classified packets to the service delivery manager the service discovery manager the service control manager and or the metadata manager .

The service delivery manager may control received service data. For example when controlling real time streaming data the service delivery manager may use the Real time Transport Protocol Real time Transport Control Protocol RTP RTCP . If real time streaming data is transmitted over RTP RTCP the service delivery manager may parse the received real time streaming data using RTP and output the parsed real time streaming data to the DEMUX . The service deliver manager may also store the parsed real time streaming data in the SI metadata DB under the control of the service manager . In addition the service delivery manager may feed back network reception information to a server that provides the real time streaming data service using RTCP.

The DEMUX may demultiplex a received packet into audio data video data and PSI data and outputs the audio data video data and PSI data to the audio decoder the video decoder and the PSI PSIP and or SI decoder respectively.

The PSI PSIP and or SI decoder may decode SI such as PSI. More specifically the PSI PSIP and or SI decoder may decode PSI sections PSIP sections or SI sections received from the DEMUX . The PSI PSIP and or SI decoder may construct an SI DB by decoding the received sections and may store the SI DB in the SI metadata DB .

The audio decoder and the video decoder may decode the audio data and the video data received from the DEMUX and may output the decoded audio and video data through the display A V and OSD module .

The UI manager and the service manager may manage the overall state of the image display apparatus provide UIs and manage other managers. The UI manager may provide a Graphical User Interface GUI in the form of an OSD and may perform a reception operation corresponding to a key input received from the user. For example upon receipt of a key input signal regarding channel selection from the user the UI manager may transmit the key input signal to the service manager .

The service manager may control managers associated with services such as the service delivery manager the service discovery manager the service control manager and or the metadata manager . The service manager may also make a channel map and may select a channel using the channel map according to the key input signal received from the UI manager . The service manager may set the audio video Packet ID PID of the selected channel based on SI about the channel received from the PSI PSIP and or SI decoder .

The service discovery manager may provide information necessary to select an SP that provides a service. Upon receipt of a channel selection signal from the service manager the service discovery manager may detect a service based on the channel selection signal.

The service control manager may manage selection and control services. For example if a user selects live broadcasting such as a conventional broadcasting service the service control manager may select and control the service using Internet Group Management Protocol IGMP or Real Time Streaming Protocol RTSP . If the user selects Video on Demand VoD the service control manager may select and control the service. RTSP supports trick mode for real time streaming. Further the service control manager may initialize and manage a session through an IP Multimedia Control IMC gateway using IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS and Session Initiation Protocol SIP . The protocols disclosed herein are given by way of example and other protocols may be applicable in other embodiments.

The metadata manager may manage metadata related to services and store the metadata in the SI metadata DB . The SI metadata DB may store the SI decoded by the PSI PSIP and or SI decoder the metadata managed by the metadata manager and the information required to select an SP received from the service discovery manager . The SI metadata DB may store setup data for the system. The SI metadata DB may be constructed in a Non Volatile RAM NVRAM or a flash memory. Moreover an IMS gateway is a gateway equipped with functions needed to access IMS based IPTV services.

The tuner selects a Radio Frequency RF broadcast signal corresponding to a channel selected by a user from among a plurality of RF broadcast signals received through an antenna. The tuner may downconverts the selected RF broadcast signal into a digital Intermediate Frequency IF signal or an analog baseband A V signal.

More specifically if the selected RF broadcast signal is a digital broadcast signal the tuner downconverts the selected RF broadcast signal into a digital IF signal DIF. On the other hand if the selected RF broadcast signal is an analog broadcast signal the tuner downconverts the selected RF broadcast signal into an analog baseband A V signal CVBS SIF. That is the tuner may be a hybrid tuner capable of processing not only digital broadcast signals but also analog broadcast signals. The analog baseband A V signal CVBS SIF may be directly input to the controller .

The tuner may be capable of receiving RF broadcast signals from an Advanced Television Systems Committee ATSC single carrier system or from a Digital Video Broadcasting DVB multi carrier system.

The tuner may sequentially select a number of RF broadcast signals corresponding to all broadcast channels previously stored in the image display apparatus by a channel add function from a plurality of RF signals received through the antenna and may downconvert the selected RF broadcast signals into IF signals or baseband A V signals.

The broadcast signal may be input through the external device interface or network interface in addition to the tuner . In one embodiment the image display apparatus may not include the tuner.

The demodulator receives the digital IF signal DIF from the tuner and demodulates the digital IF signal DIF. For example if the digital IF signal DIF is an ATSC signal the demodulator may perform 8 Vestigal SideBand VSB demodulation on the digital IF signal DIF. The demodulator may also perform channel decoding. For channel decoding the demodulator may include a Trellis decoder not shown a de interleaver not shown and a Reed Solomon decoder not shown so as to perform Trellis decoding de interleaving and Reed Solomon decoding.

For example if the digital IF signal DIF is a DVB signal the demodulator performs Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access COFDMA demodulation upon the digital IF signal DIF. The demodulator may also perform channel decoding. For channel decoding the demodulator may include a convolution decoder a de interleaver and or a Reed Solomon decoder so as to perform convolution decoding de interleaving and or Reed Solomon decoding respectively.

The demodulator may perform demodulation and channel decoding on the digital IF signal DIF thereby obtaining a stream signal TS. The stream signal TS may be a signal in which a video signal an audio signal and a data signal are multiplexed. For example the stream signal TS may be an MPEG 2 TS in which an MPEG 2 video signal and a Dolby AC 3 audio signal are multiplexed. An MPEG 2 TS may include a 4 byte header and a 184 byte payload. In order to properly handle not only ATSC signals but also DVB signals the demodulator may include an ATSC demodulator and a DVB demodulator.

The stream signal TS may be input to the controller and thus subjected to demultiplexing and A V signal processing. The processed video and audio signals are output to the display and the audio output circuit respectively.

As the CHANNEL BROWSER card object and the TV Guide card object are displayed on the home screen the RESERVATION REC card object may now be partially displayed as a first card object as shown in . Among the displayed card objects the first card object of may be placed at the rightmost position. In other words the first card object may now be the leftmost card object in the hidden area .

In certain embodiments a selection of the partially displayed first card object may result in replacing only one displayed card object with a new card object rather than replacing all displayed card objects with new hidden card objects. For example referring to a selection of the partially displayed CHANNEL BROWSER card object may result in sliding this card object to an area on the display occupied by the APP STORE card object and sliding the NETCAST card object off the screen to the hidden area.

Moreover the NETCAST card object which was replaced by the CHANNEL BROWSER card object may be partially displayed at the left side of the APP STORE card object to indicate presence of available card objects. In this case the partially displayed card object on the left side may be displayed between the BROADCAST card object and the leftmost card object. In other words hidden card objects may be partially displayed on the left side as well as the right side of the displayed card objects to indicate presence of additional card objects on each respective side.

The partially displayed card objects may be further distinguished from the active card objects by distinguishing a color tint brightness shading fading or another appropriate characteristic to further distinguish the partially displayed card objects. For example the image of the partially displayed card objects may be faded such that the partially displayed card objects are less noticeable. Other graphic effects may be provided such as gradually fading the partially displayed card object towards the edge of the display to further distinguish these card objects while minimizing their potential distraction to a user.

Moreover similar methods may be used to identify hidden objects e.g. icons within a card object. For example the CHANNEL BROWSER card object as shown in may include additional hidden objects and which may be partially displayed on the bottom of the card object . Accordingly the user may readily recognize the presence of additional hidden thumbnail images and view them by scrolling up the CHANNEL BROWSER card object using the remote controller . Alternatively the partially displayed object or may be selected to fully display the partially displayed object or as well as other hidden thumbnails without manually scrolling to view the hidden thumbnails.

For example when the partially displayed object or is selected e.g. using the remote controller all displayed thumbnails may be replaced with new thumbnails e.g. hidden thumbnails . Here a selection of the partially displayed objects or may be similar to a selection of a page up down button. In certain embodiments the selection of the partially displayed object or may cause the thumbnails to shift by one row. Here the partially displayed objects or may be used similar to a scroll button. Moreover when changing the displayed thumbnails the displayed thumbnails may be scrolled to slide across the display or may be changed instantly without the graphic effects.

Indicator objects in this embodiment may also indicate which of the plurality of card objects are currently being displayed on the home screen . For example in six card objects may be available excluding the BROADCAST card object . The six card objects may be represented by six corresponding dots of the indicator object positioned below the two displayed card objects . The six dots of the indicator object may be displayed according to a relative order of the available card objects such that a relative position of the displayed card objects may be determined based on the dots.

For example the first dot may corresponds to the first card object NETCAST and may be displayed at a far left position among the six dots. The third dot may correspond to the third card object CHANNEL BROWSER and may be displayed at the third position from the left among the six dots etc. Because the dots which correspond to the displayed card objects CHANNEL BROWSER card object and the TV GUIDE card object may be highlighted white dots a relative position of the displayed card objects among the all available card objects may be determined through the indicator objects e.g. CHANNEL BROWSER card object is the third card object .
