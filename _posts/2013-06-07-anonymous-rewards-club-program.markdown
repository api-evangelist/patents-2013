A mobile communication service provider aka phone carrier of the customer such as VERIZON AT T SPRINT T MOBILE and the like mobile communication service providers provide the communication network for communication to the data capable communication device of the customer.

As shown in a member of an anonymous loyalty program for a casino plays a slot machine. The member is only known by the number of his mobile communication device. In the member wins at the slots. In FIG. B the member confirms on his mobile communication device that he has been credited rewards points for his time spent at the slot machine.

As shown in a member of an anonymous loyalty program redeems his rewards points for an item of value. In this case the item of value is two tickets to a show. The member is able to redeem his points by using the number associated with his mobile communication device.

As shown in a mobile communication device comprises a loyalty app which has been uploaded to the mobile communication device to reside in a memory of the mobile communication device . The loyalty app has an ID generator engine for generating an identification code for use with the anonymous loyalty program. In one preferred method the identification is generated based on a UDID number from the mobile communication device and a number associated with the loyalty app . In this manner a unique identification code is generated for use by the anonymous patron in participating in the anonymous loyalty program. The identification code is transmitted to a rewards server over a network which establishes an account associated with the identification code in a CRM database of a loyalty server.

On an IPHONE device from Apple Inc. the UDID or Unique Device Identifier is a combination of forty numbers and letters and is set by Apple and stays with the device forever.

On an ANDROID based system one that uses Google Inc. s ANDROID operating system the ID is set by Google and created when a user first boots up the device. The ID remains the same unless the user does a factory reset of the phone which deletes the phone s data and settings.

Those skilled in the pertinent art will recognize other identifications e.g. MEID associated with mobile communication devices which can be used to generate an identification for use by anonymous patron in participating in the anonymous loyalty program.

The identification code for the anonymous loyalty program generated is utilized to collect rewards points and to redeem rewards point from the anonymous loyalty program.

In one embodiment the participating loyalty site has a QRC code that is scanned by a QRC reader associated with a loyalty program app on the mobile communication device of the anonymous patron of the anonymous loyalty program. This QRC code preferably comprises a code associated with the participating loyalty site and this data along with the identification code of the anonymous patron is transmitted to a rewards server which eventually transmits the data to a CRM database at a loyalty server in order to allocate rewards points for the anonymous patron in an account associated with the identification code for expending resources at the participating loyalty site.

In another embodiment the participating loyalty site has a receiver means for receiving the identification code from the mobile communication device of the anonymous patron. The transfer of the identification code from the mobile communication device to the receiver may be by means of BLUETOOTH transmission RFID a QRC code on the display of the mobile communication device which comprises the identification code and which is scanned by the receiver of the participating loyalty site a SMS text typed in by the patron or by other known means. The participating loyalty site then sends the information to a rewards server in order to allocate rewards points for the anonymous patron in an account associated with the identification code for expending resources at the participating loyalty site.

In redeeming rewards points a similar process is followed wherein the identification code is provided to a participating loyalty site to acquire goods or services using rewards points.

In this manner patron of the anonymous loyalty program remains anonymous while participating in the rewards program.

Further anonymous patron s value to the anonymous loyalty program is based on the expenditures of the patron at participating loyalty sites. Additionally in the case of services or goods that may be culturally unacceptable the patron knows that the anonymous loyalty program does not maintain personal information and thus the anonymous patron may expend greater resources time and money than if the identity of the patron was known.

As shown in a member accesses an anonymous loyalty program mobile application on his mobile communication device . The mobile application is preferably an application downloaded from the loyalty program site through a mobile browser on the mobile communication device . As shown in the anonymous loyalty program mobile application preferably includes a QRC scanner function or other barcode scanner function in order to scan QR codes or barcodes from participating retailers in the anonymous loyalty program. The scanning function is used to redeem points for rewards such as tickets as shown in . This is all accomplished without the identity of the member being known by the anonymous loyalty program. Thus the member can acquire points and redeem points without his or her identity or his or her phone number being known by the anonymous loyalty program. Thus when the member decides to terminate his or her relationship with the anonymous loyalty program the member does not need to worry about information being retained by the anonymous loyalty program.

As shown in an anonymous member uses the anonymous loyalty program mobile application on his mobile communication device to redeem points for tickets at a facility of a participating retailer in the anonymous loyalty program. A message containing a message identification the member s identification for anonymous loyalty program the points used and the vendor s identification. The message is preferably sent over a communication network to a communication network server and then sent over the internet to a rewards server . The rewards server communicates over the internet with the loyalty site to confirm the redemption of tickets by the member . The rewards server also communicates with the loyalty program server at the enterprise site to adjust the member s account in the CRM database . Sample accounts maintained for members at the CRM database are shown in . The accounts only have an anonymous identification code associated with the account number. As discussed the anonymous identification code is the only relationship the member has with the anonymous loyalty program. Once the member terminates his or her membership in the anonymous loyalty program the account is terminated and the information is destroyed. However the ex member does not need to worry about information being retained since the ex member provided very little information to the anonymous loyalty program. Most importantly the ex member never had to disclose his or her phone number even though the ex member was able to use his or her mobile communication device for all of the transactions for the anonymous loyalty program.

As shown in a typical mobile communication device includes an accelerometer a head phone a microphone a speaker a GPS chipset a Bluetooth component a WiFi component a 3G 4G component a BaseBand Processor for radio control an applications processor a JTAG debugger a SDRAM memory a Flash memory SIM card LCD display a camera a power management circuit and a battery or power source .
