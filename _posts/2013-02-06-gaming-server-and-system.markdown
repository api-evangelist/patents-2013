This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 021 503 filed Feb. 4 2011 which is a national stage of PCT AU2009 001015 filed Aug. 7 2009 and claims the benefit of Australian Provisional Patent Application No. 2008904067 filed on Aug. 8 2008 Australian Provisional Patent Application No. 2008904616 filed Sep. 5 2008 Australian Patent Application No. 2010200417 filed Feb. 5 2010 which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates generally to entertainment and in particular to a gaming server and system.

Games of chance skill and entertainment exist in many different formats and are played using a variety of different gaming platforms. Such platforms can include for example cards board games playing fields and computing devices.

It is desirable for a game to attract a player and retain the attention of the player throughout the duration of the game.

It is an object of the present invention to overcome substantially or at least ameliorate one or more disadvantages of existing arrangements.

Described herein are a gaming system method computer server and computer program product that utilise a first gaming table and a predefined number of tokens. The gaming table includes a number of cells that correspond to the number of tokens and each token has an associated value. The tokens are stored in the cells of the gaming table with one token in each cell until all of the cells are populated. A player then selects a cell of the gaming table to reveal the token stored therein. The player continues to select cells of the gaming table to reveal the tokens stored therein until all of the tokens have been revealed. The gaming system method and computer program product of the present disclosure compute a score for a player by utilizing the values associated with the tokens based on an order in which the tokens were revealed.

In one implementation the values associated with consecutively revealed tokens are utilized to determine a relative value for each pair of revealed tokens. The relative values for all of the pairs of revealed tokens are summed to obtain a total score for that player. Thus the gaming system method and computer program product of this embodiment compute a score for a player based on the relative difference between values associated with consecutively selected tokens. The gaming system method and computer program product may optionally include a starting value to compute an initial score based on a relative difference between the starting value and a first revealed token. The gaming system method and computer program product may optionally include a finishing value to compute a finishing score based on a relative difference between the finishing value and a final revealed token. The gaming system method and computer program product may optionally both a starting value and a finishing value.

In another implementation a predefined ordered sequence of values is utilized to determine a score for the player in conjunction with the order in which the tokens were revealed. The value of each token is compared to a value in the predefined ordered sequence of values corresponding to the order in which that token was revealed to determine a score associated with each revealed token. In one embodiment the predefined ordered sequence of values corresponds to a number of a turn in which a token is revealed. In another embodiment the predefined ordered sequence of values is predefined by a competing player a gaming administrator or operator or a random number generator.

In one implementation the gaming system method and computer program product of the present disclosure involve game play between two players. Each player populates a gaming table with a set of tokens wherein the other player is unable to witness how the opposing player has populated their respective gaming table. Thus a first player populates a first gaming table with a first set of tokens and a second player populates a second gaming table with a second set of tokens. The first player reveals the second set of tokens stored in the gaming table of the second player by iteratively selecting cells of the second gaming table. Similarly the second player reveals the first set of tokens stored in the first gaming table by iteratively selecting cells of the first gaming table.

The selection of cells by the first player and the second player may occur in an interleaved manner with the first player and second player taking turns to select a cell from the gaming table of the other player.

These and other objects and features of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims or may be learned by the practice of the invention as set forth hereinafter.

Where reference is made in any one or more of the accompanying drawings to steps and or features that have the same reference numerals those steps and or features have for the purposes of this description the same function s or operation s unless the contrary intention appears.

Disclosed herein is a gaming method and system. According to one embodiment a plurality of predefined tokens is provided wherein each token is associated with a value. A gaming table with a corresponding number of gaming cells is also provided wherein each cell is associated with a unique cell identifier. Each gaming cell is capable of storing one of the tokens.

The gaming table represents an area on which the game is to be played and can be implemented using for example a physical table a portion of real estate on a display of an electronic device such as a display screen of a mobile phone handset or computing device or an area of a proprietary gaming and wagering terminal. Other physical and virtual implementations can equally be practised without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.

In one mode of play each of the tokens is allocated to a corresponding one of the gaming cells and stored therein. The tokens are not initially revealed to a player. The player utilises the cell identifiers to select one of the gaming cells and the corresponding token stored therein is revealed. The player then selects a second gaming cell to reveal the token stored in the second gaming cell. The game continues until the player has selected all of the gaming cells and all of the tokens have been revealed.

As each token has an associated value one embodiment determines relative differences between values associated with consecutively selected tokens by calculating an absolute value between successively revealed tokens. The sum of the absolute values is the score awarded to the player for that game the lower the score the better.

In one embodiment a predefined starting value is provided to enable an initial score to be determined based on a value of the first selected token. The initial score is the absolute value between the starting value and the value of the first selected token. The initial score is included in the sum of the absolute values to determine the score awarded to the player. In a further embodiment a predefined finishing value is provided to enable a finishing score to be determined based on a value of the final selected token. The finishing score is the absolute value between the finishing value and the value of the final selected token. The finishing score is included in the sum of the absolute values to determine the score awarded to the player. In another embodiment a starting value and a finishing value are provided to enable an initial score and a finishing score to be determined in the manner described above. Each of the initial score and the finishing score is included in the sum of the absolute values to determine the score awarded to the player.

An alternative embodiment utilises a predefined ordered sequence of values to determine the score based on the sequence in which the tokens were revealed. The method determines a relative difference between values associated with the selected tokens and corresponding values in the predefined ordered sequence of values. The sum of the relative differences is the score awarded to the player for that game the lower the score the better. In one embodiment the predefined ordered sequence of values is a set of numbered turns. In another embodiment the predefined ordered sequence of values is assigned by a random number generator a competing player a game administrator or other means. In a further embodiment the predefined ordered sequence of values corresponds to a layout of a gaming table.

In one embodiment the tokens are allocated to the gaming cells by a competitor of the player or a game controller. The game controller can be for example another person or a program executing on a computing device.

In one embodiment in which the tokens are allocated to the gaming cells by a game controller thus populating the gaming table with the tokens a first player and a second player provide a first and second sequence of identifiers respectively corresponding to cells of the gaming table. The gaming method determines a first sequence of tokens stored in the gaming table by utilising the first sequence of identifiers. Similarly the gaming method determines a second sequence of tokens stored in the gaming table by utilising the second sequence of identifiers. Determining the first and second sequences may be readily performed as the identifiers in the first and second sequences of identifiers correspond directly to cells of the gaming table.

The gaming method determines a first score for the first player based on relative differences between values associated with consecutive tokens in the first sequence of tokens and determines a second score for the second player based on relative differences between values associated with consecutive tokens in the second sequence of tokens. The gaming method then determines a winner based on the first score and the second score. Any number of players can compete in this embodiment by each providing a sequence of identifiers corresponding to cells of the gaming table. A score is determined for each player as described above and then a winner is determined.

In another embodiment an interactive gaming method and system are provided to facilitate the playing of a game between two players. An instance of a game includes three main phases setup attack and scoring . During the setup phase each player populates a gaming table with a sequence of tokens. Thus a first player and a second player are provided with corresponding first and second gaming tables. Each gaming table includes a number of gaming cells. A first set of tokens is allocated to the first player and a second set of tokens is allocated to the second player. The first and second sets of tokens are identical and each token in the respective sets is associated with a value. The first player selects a gaming cell on the first gaming table for each one of the tokens in the first set of tokens. Similarly the second player selects a gaming cell on the second gaming table for each one of the tokens in the second set of tokens. The first gaming table is hidden from the second player and the second gaming table is hidden from the first player while the tokens are being placed.

Once each of the first and second players has populated their respective first and second gaming tables with the respective first and second sets of tokens the game enters the attack phase. During the attack phase the first player and the second player take turns to select a gaming cell from the playing table of the other player. The gaming cells are selected by utilising unique identifiers associated with each of the cells. When a cell is selected the token stored therein is revealed to the other player.

The values associated with the predefined tokens form a sequence. It is desirable for a player to reveal tokens in an order that corresponds to the sequence of the values associated with the tokens or an inversion thereof . In one embodiment the scoring is dependent on the absolute values between successively revealed tokens and thus the lowest score is achievable by revealing the tokens in the same order as defined by the values associated with the tokens or in reverse . Calculating absolute values between successively revealed tokens provides a score based on relative differences between values associated with consecutively selected tokens.

Once all of the gaming cells for the first and second gaming tables have been selected and all of the tokens from the first and second sets of tokens have consequently been revealed the game passes to the scoring phase. The scoring phase calculates the absolute values between the tokens in the order in which the tokens were revealed and then the absolute values are added to provide a total. The player with the lower total is the winner. If the totals are the same it is a draw.

The tokens can be numbers icons pictures or any graphical symbol. The tokens are arranged in a sequential order by virtue of the values associated with the tokens. It is desirable to identify the tokens in the same sequential order or the reverse thereof to minimise the score.

In an alternative embodiment the attack phase and the scoring phase occur in parallel such that one or more interim scores are provided to the players during the attack phase. In one implementation the attack phase and the scoring phase are interleaved to provide each player with a progress score after each token has been revealed. Such an embodiment provides the players with immediate feedback relating to their progress in the game.

In one implementation the players are informed only of their respective score. In another implementation the scores of the first and second players are provided to each of the first and second players and thus both first and second players will have an indication of their performance relative to the other player and thus will have an indication of their relative chances of success.

A further embodiment provides information to the players at one or more intervals during play of the game. The information is based on the sequence of tokens chosen to that time and may include for example one or more of a player s current score a maximum possible score for that player based on the remaining tokens a minimum possible score for that player based on the remaining tokens a range of possible scores for that player based on the remaining tokens an opponent s score a maximum possible score for the opponent based on the remaining tokens a minimum possible score for the opponent based on the remaining tokens a range of possible scores for the opponent based on the remaining tokens a probability of the player winning based on the current position of the game and a probability of the opponent winning based on the current position of the game. The players can then utilise the information to make decisions relating to further bets and stakes that may be wagered on the game.

One embodiment of the present disclosure provides each of first and second players with a gaming table in the form of a 3 3 grid upon which the first and second players have to place the numbers 1 one through to 9 nine in any cell within the gaming table without the other player knowing where they have placed their numbers on their gaming table. Once a player has completed placing the numbers on the gaming table that player must wait until their opponent has also setup their gaming table. Once both players have prepared their respective gaming tables placed the numbers 1 through to 9 within each cell in the game the game is ready to begin.

One player makes a first guess at identifying a number on the opposing player s gaming table. The player selects a cell using a unique identifier associated with the cell and the opponent reveals what number the opponent had placed in the selected cell. The player will then record the revealed number on his score sheet. As there are 9 numbers stored in the 9 cells of the 3 3 grid of the gaming table each player will have 9 attacking attempts to identify where the numbers are located on their competitor s gaming table. The attacking attempts and their order define an attack sequence .

The idea of one embodiment of the game is that the opposing player will attempt to guess where the player has placed their numbers and with each attempt identify a sequence. The goal of the game is to guess where each number is and with every attempt guess a low scoring sequence. The total score is determined by determining relative differences between values associated with consecutively selected first tokens and then adding each of the absolute differences between each score sequence. In this particular example the lowest scoring sequences are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. The player with the lowest score wins the game. The lowest possible score for this embodiment is 8.

For example if the first player selects the cells in the order in which those cells contain the numbers 1 to 9 the revealed sequence is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. The scoring is set out below 

Draws arising during the play of any one of the gaming embodiments described herein can be handled in many different ways. For example another complete or partial game can be played the prize can be split or a bonus round can be instigated. Such a bonus round may include for example 

Each player must select a colour from a colour range. Each player must then guess what the other player has selected. The player that guesses correctly in a single iteration of the BLACK RED round wins the game.

Each player must select a number from a predefined number range. The player who guesses the other player s number in a round of pick the number wins. If both players guess the respective number in the first round then another round of Pick the number must be played.

Each player must select a number from a predefined number range. Each opponent has to guess what number their opponent picked. The player that guesses the number which is the closest in value to the other participant s chosen number wins.

A winner is identified as the player whose total score was lower to the other player in a prior score sequence before the draw occurred. The prior score sequence can include all scores determined before the draw occurred or any subset thereof.

A winner is identified as the player who scored the lowest score in a previous score sequence s . The previous score sequence can include a score derived from a most recent pair of tokens or a score derived from any sequence of revealed tokens before the draw occurred.

The player who revealed the lowest number s first is determined as the winner the lowest number corresponding to the lowest value associated with one of the tokens.

The player who revealed the highest number s first is determined as the winner the highest number corresponding to the highest value associated with one of the tokens.

Other embodiments utilise a gaming table having a 2 2 grid of cells with a sequence of tokens from 1 to 4 a gaming table having a 4 4 grid of cells with a sequence of tokens from 1 to 16 a gaming table having a 5 5 grid of cells with a sequence of tokens from 1 to 25 and so forth. Yet other embodiments utilise gaming tables with cells not arranged in a grid formation. For example the cells can be placed in one or more lines the cells can be arranged to form a picture or geometric representation or the cells can be placed randomly within the gaming table. As long as the cells are associated with unique identifiers any number of cells can be utilised in any desired arrangement.

The gaming process commences at a Begin step and progresses to step in which the first and second players register to play an instance of the game. The actual step of registration will depend on the platform on which the game is being played. In a board game environment registration may include collecting tokens and a gaming table. In a mobile telephone environment selecting a gaming application on a mobile handset may register the user with a remote gaming server via a communications network. Optionally depending on the application a user may be required to transfer personal information. In an ad hoc wireless network environment such as Bluetooth the establishment of an ad hoc wireless connection may constitute the registration. In an online computing environment registration may include the steps of browsing a website and providing personal information.

Control passes to step in which the first and second players set up a respective gaming table by placing each of the tokens 1 to 9 in a cell of the 3 3 grid. The aim of the game is to identify the locations of a competing player s sequence of numbers on a corresponding gaming table.

In step the first player attacks by selecting a first cell in the 3 3 grid of the gaming table of the second player. The first player is free to choose any cell and selects the cell by using unique identifiers associated with each of the cells. In one embodiment the columns of the 3 3 grid of the gaming table are allocated A B C respectively and the rows 1 2 3 respectively as identifiers. Thus the top left cell is designated A and the bottom right cell is designated C. The token stored in the selected cell is then revealed to the first player.

Control passes to step and the second player attacks by selecting a cell of the gaming table of the first player. The token stored in the selected cell is then revealed to the second player. Control passes to decision step which determines whether the game has completed. If the game has not completed No control returns to step and the first player attacks again. However if at step the game has completed Yes control passes to step . Step determines a winner based on scores derived during the gaming process. Values associated with each token are utilised to determine a score for the sequence in which the tokens were revealed by each of the first player and the second player. Control then passes to step and the process terminates.

As described above it is possible for the attack phase and the scoring phase to run in parallel. In such an embodiment scores are calculated after each token is revealed by an attacking move and thus the winner is readily determined once all tokens have been revealed.

The example of will now be described in greater detail with reference to and . A finite sequence of tokens 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 is to be utilised by each of the first player and the second player. As described above with reference to the gaming table for this example includes 9 cells arranged in a 3 3 grid. shows a gaming system with a gaming table with columns denoted A B and C and rows denoted 1 2 and 3 . The gaming system also includes an array of the sequence of tokens 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 .

In this example the gaming table of represents the second gaming table. Arrows from the array to the gaming table indicate the manner in which the second player has populated the gaming table in this example. Thus cell A contains 2 cell B contains 8 cell C contains 6 cell A contains 7 cell B contains 1 cell C contains 9 cell A contains 4 cell B contains 3 and cell C contains 5 .

Once the first player and second player have prepared their respective first and second gaming tables control passes from step to in which the first player makes a first attacking attempt by choosing a cell on the grid of the second playing table. In step the token placed in the selected cell is revealed to the first player. If the first player selects cell A the token 7 is revealed to the first player. For scoring purposes 7 is placed in the first cell of the first column of . In this example the tokens and their associated values are the same. In alternative embodiments the value associated with the revealed token is utilised for scoring purposes.

Control passes to step for the first attempt of the second player. The second player chooses a cell on the grid of the first playing table and control passes to step of in which the token placed in the selected cell is revealed to the second player.

Control passes from step to in which the first player makes a second attacking attempt by choosing a second cell on the grid of the second playing table. In step the token placed in the selected cell is revealed to the first player. The first player knows that the first token revealed was 7 and that the smallest score will be achieved by selecting the cell in which the second player placed either the 6 or the 8 as the absolute difference between 7 and 6 is 1 and the absolute difference between 7 and 8 is 1.

If the first player selects cell C the token 6 is revealed to the first player. The token 6 is placed in the second cell of the first column of . Control passes to step which determines a first score for the first player by calculating the absolute value of the difference between the values associated with the tokens revealed by the first and second attempts of the first player. The first score is the relative difference between the values associated with the tokens revealed by the first and second attempts of the first player. In this example the first and second attempts revealed tokens 7 and 6 which have an absolute difference of 1. Thus the first score of the first player is 1. This first score is entered in the first cell of the second column of .

Control passes to step for the second attempt of the second player. The second player chooses a second cell on the grid of the first playing table and control passes to step in which the token placed in the selected cell is revealed to the second player. Control then passes to step to determine a first score of the second player.

Control passes from step to of in which the first player makes a third attacking attempt by choosing a third cell on the grid of the second playing table. In step the token placed in the selected cell is revealed to the first player. The first player knows that the most recently revealed token was 6 and that the smallest score will be achieved by selecting the cell in which the second player placed the 5 as the absolute difference between 7 and 6 is 1. Token 7 was selected in the first attacking attempt.

If the first player selects cell B the token 3 is revealed to the first player. The token 3 is placed in the third cell of the first column of . Control passes to step which determines a second score for the first player by calculating the absolute value of the difference between the values associated with the tokens revealed by the second and third attempts of the first player. In this example the second and third attempts revealed tokens 6 and 3 which have an absolute difference of 3. Thus the second score of the first player is 3. This second score is entered in the second cell of the second column of .

Control passes to step for the third attempt of the second player. The second player chooses a third cell on the grid of the first playing table and control passes to step in which the token placed in the selected cell is revealed to the second player.

If the first player selects cell C the token 5 is revealed to the first player. The token 5 is placed in the sixth cell of the first column of . Control passes to step which determines a fifth score for the first player by calculating the absolute value of the difference between the values associated with the tokens revealed by the fifth and sixth attempts of the first player. In this example the fifth and sixth attempts revealed tokens 2 and 5 which have an absolute difference of 3. Thus the fifth score of the first player is 3. This fifth score is entered in the fifth cell of the second column of .

Control passes to step for the sixth attempt of the second player. The second player chooses a sixth cell on the grid of the first playing table and control passes to step in which the token placed in the selected cell is revealed to the second player. Control then passes to step to determine a fifth score of the second player.

Control passes from step to of in which the first player makes a seventh attacking attempt by choosing a seventh cell on the grid of the second playing table. In step the token placed in the selected cell is revealed to the first player. The first player knows that the most recently revealed token was 5 and that the smallest score will be achieved by selecting the cell in which the second player placed the 4 .

If the first player selects cell B the token 8 is revealed to the first player. The token 8 is placed in the seventh cell of the first column of . Control passes to step which determines a sixth score for the first player by calculating the absolute value of the difference between the values associated with the tokens revealed by the sixth and seventh attempts of the first player. In this example the sixth and seventh attempts revealed tokens 5 and 8 which have an absolute difference of 3. Thus the sixth score of the first player is 3. This sixth score is entered in the sixth cell of the second column of .

Control passes to step for the seventh attempt of the second player. The second player chooses a seventh cell on the grid of the first playing table and control passes to step in which the token placed in the selected cell is revealed to the second player. Control then passes to step to determine a first score of the second player.

Control passes from step to in which the first player makes an eighth attacking attempt by choosing an eighth cell on the grid of the second playing table. In step the token placed in the selected cell is revealed to the first player. The first player knows that the most recently revealed token was 8 and that the remaining tokens are 1 and 4. Thus the smallest score for this attempt will be achieved by selecting the cell in which the second player placed the 4 .

If the first player selects cell A the token 4 is revealed to the first player. The token 4 is placed in the second cell of the first column of . Control passes to step of which determines a seventh score for the first player by calculating the absolute value of the difference between the values associated with the tokens revealed by the sixth and seventh attempts of the first player. In this example the sixth and seventh attempts revealed tokens 8 and 4 which have an absolute difference of 4. Thus the seventh score of the first player is 4.

Control passes from step to step of . Step calculates a total score for the first player by adding up the first score 1 the second score 3 the third score 6 the fourth score 7 the fifth score 3 the sixth score 3 the seventh score 4 and the eighth score 3 to produce a total of 30. The first score 1 the second score 3 the third score 6 the fourth score 7 the fifth score 3 the sixth score 3 the seventh score 4 and the eighth score 3 represent a first set of absolute values for the sequence of revealed tokens for the first player. Thus the sum of the relative differences between the values associated with consecutively selected tokens provides the total score for the first player. Control passes to step which calculates a total score for the second player in a manner similar to that described with reference to step . It will be appreciated that the scores of the first and second player can equally be determined in any order or in parallel.

The scoring sheet shows a first column consisting of 9 cells into which tokens revealed during game play can be placed. The scoring sheet also shows a second column next to the first column. The second column consists of 10 cells for storing intermediate scores determined from the tokens stored in the adjacent cells of the first column.

In the example of a sequence of tokens is revealed in the order 7 6 3 9 2 5 8 4 1. The method determines a relative difference between the starting value 1 and the value of the first token 7 to produce a first score or initial score of 1 7 6. In contrast to the embodiment and scoring sheet of a first score is produced in response to the value of the first revealed token by determining the relative difference between the starting value and the value of the first revealed token. The player does not need to wait for the second token to be revealed before receiving a first score. The method then determines a relative difference between the value of the first token 7 and the value of the second token 6 to produce a second score 7 6 1.

The method iterates to produce a series of scores based on the relative differences between consecutively revealed tokens. Accordingly the method determines a relative difference between the value of the second token 6 and the value of the third token 3 to produce a third score 6 3 3. The method determines a relative difference between the value of the third token 3 and the value of the fourth token 9 to produce a fourth score 3 9 6.

The method determines a relative difference between the value of the seventh token 8 and the value of the eighth token 4 to produce an eighth score 8 4 4. The method determines a relative difference between the value of the eighth token 4 and the value of the ninth token 1 to produce a ninth score 4 1 3. The method then determines a relative difference between the value of the ninth token 1 and the value of the finishing value 9 to produce a tenth score or finishing score of 1 9 8. The total score is the sum of the first to tenth scores 6 1 3 6 7 3 3 4 3 8 44.

The scoring sheet shows a first column consisting of 9 cells into which tokens revealed during game play can be placed. The scoring sheet also shows a second column next to the first column.

Returning to having determined the total scores for the first and second players control passes to a decision step which determines whether the total score of the first player is not equal to the total score of the second player. If the scores are equal No control passes to step in which the first and second player play a draw round . If the total scores of the first and second players are not equal Yes control passes from step to decision step which determines whether the total score of the first player is less than the total score of the second player. If the total score of the first player is less than the total score of the second player Yes control passes to step which allocates the first player as the winner. Control passes to step which awards a prize and the method terminates at step . However if at step the total score of the first player is not less than the total score of the second player No control passes to step which allocates the second player as the winner. Control then passes to step .

The draw round of step can be implemented in many different ways. For example the first and second players can play another game or a subset thereof. Alternatively the first and second players can each pick a number from a predefined range of numbers with the winner being the player who selected a higher or lower number. As described above a draw can also be settled using BLACK RED pick the number Closest guess Draw can be settled based on the prior performance of players in the game such as the player whose total score was lower to the other player in a prior score sequence before the draw occurred or the player who scored the lowest score in the previous score sequence s or the player who discover the lowest or highest number s first during the game. In a further alternative a winner is allocated by a random number generator executing on a processor of a computing device.

Control passes to decision step which determines whether the player has populated the gaming table. If the player has not populated the gaming table No control passes to which presents the updated table to the player and returns control to step to continue populating the gaming table. However if that decision step the player has populated the gaming table Yes control passes to step which presents the player s completed gaming table. Control passes to step which determines whether an opponent has populated a corresponding gaming table. If no control returns to in which the player s own completed gaming table is again presented. Control again returns to decision step and once the opponent has populated their gaming table Yes control passes to step of which presents the opponent s table with unrevealed numbers masked to the first player.

Step asks the first player to pick a cell on the table of the opponent and control passes to decision step . Step determines whether each player has attacked every cell on their opponent s gaming table. If Yes control passes to a further decision step . However if each player has not attacked every cell on their opponent s gaming table No control returns to step .

Decision step determines whether a winner has been identified. If No control passes to step to play a draw round and then control returns to decision step . If a winner has been determined at step Yes control passes to step which announces a winner and assigns a prize. Control passes to step and the process terminates.

One embodiment of the present disclosure allows a player to re arrange during play of the game one or more of the tokens that are yet to be revealed among the cells that are yet to be selected by a competing player. Thus a player that is about to have a token revealed from his gaming table is allowed to re allocate a predefined number of the remaining tokens that are yet to be revealed in the cells that are yet to be selected by a competing player. The number of tokens that can be re allocated can vary from zero to all of the remaining tokens depending on the particular application.

This variant of the game provides an extra level of entertainment and skill as the players try to identify a search pattern being employed by an opponent. For example if the player believes that the opponent is simply traversing a grid of a gaming table from left to right and top to bottom the player can reorder the remaining tokens to produce a sequence that will yield a poor score for the opponent.

A further embodiment of the present disclosure allows a player to place a bet or stake associated with an instance of the game. The stake may simply comprise an entry fee for playing the game. In one embodiment a player is able to increase the stake or bet during the game play. In one implementation a player is able to change the stake or bet on each attacking iteration. This embodiment allows a player to increase a stake or bet if the player progressively reveals a sequence of consecutive tokens thus yielding a high degree of confidence in obtaining a low winning score. The players may be able to agree mutually to increase their wager amounts during these rounds. The bets or stakes can be real money or credits managed by a third party. Alternatively the bets or stakes can be virtual money or credits.

As described above various embodiments of the gaming method in accordance with the present disclosure can be implemented in many ways including i standalone with a single player against a competitor or a single competitor against a game controller and ii peer to peer with two players competing directly against each other. The objective in each implementation is for a player to obtain the lowest score. Thus in standalone mode the player competes against a database of known low scores and in the peer to peer mode the player competes against the score of the opponent. In another embodiment the objective of the game is to obtain the highest number of matches of token pairs.

A number of contestants can be organised in many ways to play a series of games to identify an overall winner. In one implementation a series of peer to peer games are played among the contestants in a knockout format where one contestant is eliminated from each game until an ultimate winner is determined. Thus a group of 32 contestants will require 16 initial peer to peer matches. The winners of those matches will play a second round of 8 matches with the winners of those matches playing a further 4 matches. The winners of the round of 4 matches will play the semi finals and the winners of the semi finals will play the final match to determine the ultimate winner. Such playoff arrangements can be enhanced by seeding contestants and utilising byes to fill the playoff roster as commonly utilised in sporting competitions.

An alternative implementation utilises a round robin tournament wherein each participant plays every other participant an equal number of times. The participant with the lowest cumulative score wins the entire tournament.

A further implementation provides a tournament beginning with a round robin component to identify a subset of the contestants. The subset of contestants then compete in playoffs and then ultimately compete in a grand final peer to peer contest.

Different embodiments of the gaming method and system of the present disclosure utilise different prize schemes. In one implementation the score itself is the prize and no further benefit is awarded to the player. Such a prize is utilised in a computing device for example in which the player sequentially guesses the locations of the tokens of a predefined sequence. A score is determined based on the values associated with the tokens and in light of the sequence in which the player guessed the respective tokens. One implementation of such a computing device includes a database of lowest scores so that a player can compare himself to other players and or his earlier attempts.

A further embodiment is associated with a prize pool. Each player pays a fee upon registration. A portion of the prize pool is then paid to the winner. The prize pool can optionally include prizes for 2nd 3rd and even subsequent places. The specific prizes awarded will depend on each particular implementation.

One embodiment of a gaming method and system in accordance with the present disclosure provides a gaming table in the form of a board having printed thereon a number of cells. Each of the cells is associated with a unique identifier so that each cell can be readily referenced by an opposing player. The unique identifiers can be grid references such as A to C for the 3 3 grid embodiment described above. Alternatively any other unique identifiers such as numbers letters colours or a combination thereof can equally be utilised. The number of cells is equal to the number of tokens that is to be placed on the gaming table each token is placed on a cell during play of the game as described above.

Each gaming table is associated with a corresponding set of tokens with each token having an associated value. One embodiment of the gaming table provides a scoring area such as that shown in . Alternative scoring tables and wheels can equally be utilised. A further embodiment provides a player with a first gaming table showing where the player has placed his tokens and a second gaming table that the player completes as the tokens from the opposing player s table are revealed.

One embodiment utilises a computing device to allow a player to compete either against the computing device itself or with a second player coupled to the same computing device. The second player can be coupled directly to the computing device or alternatively the second player can be coupled to the computing device via a communications network such as the Internet or via an ad hoc wireless link such as provided by Bluetooth. In a single player mode an application executing on a processor in the computing device populates a gaming table with a set of tokens. The gaming table is presented to the player via a display means with all of the cells initially covered. As the player selects cells the selected cells are each in turn uncovered to reveal the tokens located therein. The computing device records the sequence in which the player selects the cells to be revealed and the tokens that are revealed at each turn to determine a score. Visual and audio feedback are readily provided via the display means and speakers.

The computing device can be implemented by for example but is not limited to a portable handheld gaming computer a personal digital assistant PDA a dedicated gaming machine a mobile telephone handset a laptop computer a desktop computer or a proprietary gaming and or wagering terminal. The player can provide input in many ways including using a QWERTY keypad a numeric keypad a touchscreen a joystick a scratch pad a stylus or any combination thereof.

The method of gaming may alternatively be implemented in dedicated hardware such as one or more integrated circuits performing the functions or sub functions of registration populating a gaming table playing and scoring. Such dedicated hardware may include graphic processors digital signal processors or one or more microprocessors and associated memories.

In one implementation the gaming system utilises a mobile telephone handset. The game is presented as an application running on the handset as a standalone application or alternatively over a communications network from a remote server to the mobile telephone handset. For example the game can be implemented as a JAVA based game interactive video voice response service and or 3rd party gaming systems.

An embodiment of the gaming method and system implemented on a mobile telephone handset is constrained by the capabilities of an available network provider and capabilities of a user s mobile handset. In one embodiment a player utilises a mobile telephone handset to access a gaming server via a communications network.

Some of the device game experiences require interconnectivity with one or more third party systems between the gaming server and the mobile telephone handset. In one implementation third party systems provide an integration service between the mobile telephone handset and its associated capabilities and the gaming server. Accordingly the embodiment shown in includes a third party system located between the mobile network and the gaming server . Similarly a third party system is located between the mobile network and the gaming server .

The gaming server includes a first player service module which acts as an interface for exchanging data with the first mobile browser . The first player service module is coupled to a game application . The gaming server in the embodiment shown includes a second player service module for exchanging data with the second mobile browser . The second player service module is also coupled to the game application . Coupled to the game application is a storage means . In the embodiment shown in the storage means includes a player database a prize database and a game database .

The gaming application also facilitates the exchange of data between the player service and the associated databases.

The use of a 3 3 gaming table can be easily represented on a mobile telephone handset interface and the phone keys 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 are also in a 3 3 grid which can be utilised to receive input from the user in an efficient manner. For example during player setup a player can readily utilise the keypad to select a cell to locate a token perhaps in response to a prompt from the game application such as Where in the game table do you want to place the number x Use your keypad to confirm . The keypad can also be readily utilised during the attack mode to select a cell to be revealed. For example the game application can ask Where on the game table do you do you think the next best sequence number is Use your keypad to guess. 

Mobile communication devices with touchscreens enable a user to use their touch to determine directly the interaction between the device and themselves. Consequently the user can thus place tokens in cells and select cells to be revealed simply by touching the appropriate portion of screen real estate at the relevant time.

One implementation of the gaming server provides a player service that facilitates the provision of a game in accordance with the present disclosure over multiple platforms. Such platforms include different mobile telephone handsets and communication carrier capabilities. Examples of the connectivity provide by the player service include but are not limited to 

In one implementation the mobile telephone handset utilises Unstructured Supplementary Services Data USSD for transmitting information from the mobile browser to the gaming server via a Global System for Mobiles GSM mobile telephony network. A USSD Gateway routes USSD messages from the signaling network to service applications and back. USSD is a session based protocol unlike Short Message Service SMS and Multimedia Messaging Service MMS and thus a USSD session needs to be allocated to each and every interaction. USSD sessions are able to connect users directly to a gaming application executing on the gaming server .

As described above the game is adaptable to be played in a computing device. In one implementation the game is played in a manner similar to that described above with respect to mobile telephone handsets except in this implementation the browser is a web based HTML browser.

Proprietary third party gaming systems will also be integrated via published APIs and supporting SDKs. This will allow extension of the gaming experience across proprietary platforms. For example proprietary platforms may be provided by wagering agencies and betting providers. Such a 3rd party gaming system may provide for example a gaming terminal that includes the functionality of the remote computing device of and the 3rd party system of in an integrated device.

The gaming terminal provides a player with a dedicated gaming terminal for playing a game in accordance with the present disclosure. The gaming terminal includes a display and a user interface . The user interface receives commands from a player and can be implemented for example using keys a touch screen a computer mouse a pointing device a trackball a scratchpad or any combination thereof. In the embodiment shown the gaming terminal also includes optional screens that provide a player of the gaming terminal with privacy from other players. The screens also shield the player of the gaming terminal from external distractions resulting in a better gaming experience.

An exploded view of the user interface includes one or more function keys and a numeric keypad . The display shows a gaming table in accordance with the present disclosure. In this arrangement the gaming table is a 3 3 grid. As described above the gaming table can take any shape or form that allows each cell of the gaming table to be associated with a unique identifier.

The server executes a computer implemented gaming method in accordance with the present disclosure. In one arrangement the server corresponds to the gaming server from . The server exchanges data with the gaming terminal to deliver a gaming experience to the player of the gaming terminal . The server can be coupled to the gaming terminal via a communications network a dedicated transmission line a wireless communications link a wired communication link or other suitable transmission means. The server controls user registration prize pools and game interaction.

The player utilises the user interface to select a cell of the gaming table and thus reveal a token stored therein. In one arrangement the player selects another cell thus revealing another token and repeats the process until all of the cells have been selected and all of the tokens stored in the gaming table have been revealed. In another arrangement the player enters an attack sequence which provides a sequence of cells of the gaming table in the order in which tokens stored in those cells are to be revealed. Depending on the particular game the sequence may include all of the cells of the gaming table. In an alternative arrangement the player provides a first sequence that includes a predefined number of cells of the gaming table and the player is able to provide a subsequent sequence of cells to be revealed in response to values associated with the tokens revealed when the first sequence is applied to the gaming table. In one arrangement the player can modify a wager when entering the subsequent sequence.

The player also utilises the user interface to populate one or more gaming tables with a set of tokens wherein the populated gaming table is used to compete against another player. Interaction between competing players is controlled by a game controller executing on the server .

The gaming system of also shows a second gaming terminal that is coupled to the server . The server can be coupled to the second gaming terminal via a communications network a dedicated transmission line a wireless communications link a wired communication link or other suitable transmission means.

The second gaming terminal provides a user interface in the form of a touch screen . In this example the touch screen includes a plurality of gaming tables . In the example shown each of the gaming tables is a 4 4 grid. The touch screen also includes one or more function keys and a numeric keypad . The player can utilise the function keys and the numeric keypad to populate one or more of the gaming tables and to select cells of one or more of the gaming tables that are to be revealed. The player can also utilise the function keys and the numeric keypad to enter an attack sequence which provides a sequence of cells of the respective gaming table in the order in which tokens stored in those cells are to be revealed.

In one arrangement a player of the gaming terminal is able to compete against a player of the second gaming terminal or any other player of a gaming terminal coupled to the server . The server controls exchange of data among the gaming terminals to allow players to compete against each other.

According to a further embodiment of the present disclosure a player preselects a gaming table and an attack sequence by populating cells of a gaming table with tokens and providing a sequence of attacking moves before a game commences. Such an embodiment allows a player to submit a populated gaming table and a sequence of attacking moves within a time before a game commences. The time can be a time defined by a computer on which the game is being played for example or can be the time up until the game is initiated such as by pressing a Start button. In an alternative embodiment the time is a scheduled date and time.

Preselecting a gaming table and an attack sequence allows a game to be played at a later time without the player necessarily being available at the time the game is actually played. In an online implementation of a gaming system in accordance with the present disclosure a player is able to preselect a gaming table and an attack sequence when coupled to a game application such as the game application of and then compete in a game executed by the game application at a later time even if the player is offline and no longer connected to the game application at the time the game is executed.

In one embodiment a player preselects an attacking sequence that is less than the required number of attacking moves required to complete a game. For example the game described above with reference to requires an attacking sequence of 9 moves. In this example the player preselects a gaming table and an initial attacking sequence of less than 9 moves. The preselected gaming table and the initial attacking sequence are utilised for an initial phase of the match against a competing player who has also preselected a gaming table and an initial attacking sequence. In one implementation once the initial phase is complete the player then selects further attacking moves in response to the competing player s moves as described above with reference to steps and of .

In an alternative implementation the player selects one or more successive attacking sequences that are less than or equal to the remaining number of moves required to complete the game. In a further implementation a combination of attacking sequences and attacking moves are utilised. For example the game described above with reference to can be implemented with a player required to provide an initial attacking sequence of 3 moves a second attacking sequence of 2 moves and then 4 final moves in response to attacking moves of a competing player.

Any combination of attacking sequences and attacking moves can be implemented depending on the particular application. For example one implementation applies different rules to competing players for the attacking sequences and moves that are to be preselected. This can be utilised for example to provide a form of handicapping. A novice player may be allowed to choose each attacking move during game play for example thus allowing the player to respond to any pattern that might be identified from revealed tokens. However an expert player may be required to preselect an entire attacking sequence for a game thus preventing the expert player from responding to any pattern that might be identified from revealed tokens during game play.

In one embodiment the player plays in a single player mode against an application executing on a processor in a computing device. The player preselects a gaming table and an attack sequence. The application populates a second gaming table for example by using a random number generator and generates a corresponding attack sequence to utilise against the player. The game then commences in the manner described above to determine a winner.

In an alternative embodiment a plurality of competing players preselect respective gaming tables and attack sequences. In one implementation a tournament is arranged for the competing players and the preselected gaming tables and attack sequences are utilised to determine a winner. The tournament can include for example a series of peer to peer matches in which a single player competes directly against another single player with players being eliminated after each match. Alternatively the tournament can include for example a round robin tournament in which each player plays every other player an equal number of times. The tournament can also include a combination of peer to peer matches and round robin matches.

The tournament can also include for example a master gaming board and master attack sequence wherein each of the preselected gaming tables and attack sequences of the competing players is utilised in a peer to peer match against the master gaming board and master attack sequence to identify a winner. In one implementation the master gaming board and master attack sequence are populated by a game application by using a random number generator.

As described above a number of methods are available for resolving a drawn match including for example i splitting the prize ii playing another game or a subset thereof iii picking a number from a predefined range of numbers with the winner being the player who selected a higher or lower number iv BLACK RED v pick the number vi Closest guess vii Best Last Play viii Best Player viii Lowest Number First or ix Highest Number First .

A further method for determining a winner in the case of a drawn match is to assign one of the tokens or a plurality of the tokens that are utilised for populating the gaming table as a draw breaking token . For example one implementation of the method described above with reference to assigns the token with an associated value of 8 as the draw breaking token. The winner is the player who first found the draw breaking token during play of the game. When a plurality of tokens are used as the draw breaking token the winner is the player who first revealed all of the draw breaking tokens during play of the game.

Alternatively a further game is played wherein each player allocates a game breaking token to a cell of a draw gaming table. The game breaking token in this embodiment can also be one of the tokens utilised for populating the gaming table from the initial game or alternatively the game breaking token can be a new token. The draw gaming table can be the same as the gaming table on which the drawn game was played or can be different from the gaming table on which the drawn game was played. When the draw gaming table is the same as the gaming table and the draw breaking token is preselected i.e. the location of the draw breaking token is selected by the player s before the initial game is played the sequence of attacking moves from the initial drawn match can be applied to the respective draw gaming tables to identify the location of the draw breaking tokens and thus determine a winner. Alternatively a further sequence of preselected attacking moves is applied to the respective draw gaming tables.

In a peer to peer game in which the draw breaking token has not been preselected the players involved in the drawn match place a respective game breaking token in a cell of their respective draw gaming tables and then take turns to select a cell of the drawn gaming table of the other player in an attempt to identify the game breaking token. The player that identifies the game breaking token of the other player in fewer moves is the winner. In one implementation each player preselects a location of the draw breaking token before play of the initial game commences. In an alternative implementation each player provides a preselected draw sequence of attacking moves to be utilised for identifying the location of the draw breaking token. The placing by the players of the draw breaking token and any preselection of a draw sequence of attacking moves can be required before the initial game commences or can occur in response to the draw or a combination thereof.

In a further preselection embodiment a player provides a preselected draw round selection . The draw round selection is utilised to determine a winner in the case in which a preceding game results in a draw. The actual nature of a draw round selection chosen by a player is dependent on the manner of resolution that is in effect for that particular gaming implementation.

For example for an implementation that utilises the BLACK RED method a player selects a draw round selection of either BLACK or RED. Similarly for an implementation that utilises the play another game method a player provides another populated gaming table for use in resolving a draw. In one implementation the player also provides a preselected draw attack sequence. In an alternative implementation the original attack sequence is used in conjunction with the populated gaming table that was provided for use in resolving the draw.

Depending on the particular implementation a player may be required to preselect a gaming table an attack sequence a draw round selection or any combination thereof.

As described above the player populates the gaming table by allocating each of the tokens to a corresponding cell of the gaming table . In the preselection implementation the player also selects an attack sequence before the game commences and the attack sequence is stored in the array . Thus the sequence of attacking moves is preselected and individual attacking moves are not made in response to an attack from a competing player.

The preselection interface also includes a draw round selection table . In this implementation a draw is resolved by using the method described above in which a draw breaking token is placed in a draw gaming table . In the example of the draw gaming table corresponds to the gaming table . The player preselects the draw breaking token by placing the draw breaking token in a single cell of the draw gaming table . In this particular example the predefined tokens and gaming table correspond to the example of and token 8 is assigned to be the draw breaking token. As can be seen from the draw breaking table the player has preselected cell B as the location of the draw breaking token.

The preselected attack sequence stored in the array and utilised in the initial drawn game is utilised in conjunction with the draw round selection table and a corresponding attack sequence and draw round selection table from a competing player to identify a winner. The winner is the player that identifies the draw breaking token of the competing player in fewer moves.

In the scenario in which the gaming table and the draw breaking table are the same and the draw breaking token is one of the tokens for populating the gaming table a single gaming table can be utilised with the location of the draw breaking token preselected by identifying a cell of the gaming table. For example with reference to a player can preselect the gaming table by populating the cells with tokens from 1 to 9 and then select any one of those cells for the draw breaking token.

In an alternative implementation the attack sequence stored in the array is displayed in a format corresponding to the layout of the gaming table.

The preselection interface also includes a draw round selection table . In this implementation a draw is resolved by playing a new game. In the example of the draw gaming table corresponds to the gaming table . The player preselects the draw breaking table by populating the table with a set of predefined draw breaking tokens. In one implementation the draw breaking tokens correspond to the tokens utilised in the gaming table . In an alternative implementation the draw breaking tokens are different from the tokens utilised in the gaming table . For example in one implementation larger values are associated with the draw breaking tokens in order to create larger scores which in turn reduces the chance of a further draw and thus provides a greater chance of identifying a winner. In this particular example the preselected attack sequence stored in the array is applied to a draw gaming table of the competing player and an attack sequence utilised by the competing player during the drawn match is applied to the draw gaming table to identify a winner.

As described above the player populates the gaming table by allocating each of the tokens to a corresponding cell of the gaming table . In the preselection implementation the player also selects an attack sequence before the game commences and the attack sequence is stored in the array . Thus the sequence of attacking moves is preselected and individual attacking moves are not made in response to an attack from a competing player.

As indicated above in this embodiment a draw is resolved by playing a new game with a new attack sequence. Accordingly the preselection interface also includes a draw round selection table and a draw attack sequence array . The player preselects the draw breaking table by populating the draw breaking table with a set of draw breaking tokens. In one implementation the set of draw breaking tokens is equal to the number of cells on the draw breaking table . In an alternative implementation a single draw breaking token is placed in the draw breaking table .

The player preselects the draw attack sequence array by providing a sequence of attacking moves to be utilised in the event that a draw occurs from the initial game. In the example of the gaming table and the draw breaking table are the same shape and configuration with the same number of cells. However the gaming table and the draw breaking table can equally be different from each other. In the event that the initial game is a draw the draw attack sequence stored in the draw attack sequence array is applied to a draw gaming table of a competing player and a draw attack sequence preselected by the competing player is applied to the draw gaming table to identify a winner. In the case in which a single draw breaking token is utilised the winner is the player whose attacking sequence identifies the draw breaking token of the competing player in fewer moves.

An example of multiple players playing a preselected game will now be described with reference to . In this example a first player and a second player register to play a game by purchasing first and second tickets respectively. The first and second tickets provide the respective first and second players with a chance to win a portion of a prize controlled by a game administrator. In this particular example the game administrator controls the gaming server and the first and second players are registered in the game database upon purchase of the respective first and second tickets.

In one implementation the purchase of a ticket involves the preselection of a gaming table and an attack sequence. The preselection of the gaming table and attack sequence are completed by the player purchasing the ticket. In an alternative implementation the player can optionally select to have a preselected gaming table and attack sequence provided by the game administrator. Depending on the particular implementation a ticket can be associated with a single gaming table and attack sequence or multiple gaming tables and corresponding attack sequences. Pricing may vary depending on the number of gaming tables associated with each ticket.

In the example of the first player utilises the mobile browser to interact with the gaming server to purchase the first ticket. Similarly the second player utilises the mobile browser to interact with the gaming server to purchase the second ticket. In an alternative implementation a player purchases a ticket from a retail outlet not shown or other computing device not shown that interacts with the gaming server .

Each player that is registered with the gaming server before a predefined deadline has a chance of sharing a portion of a prize pool. In one implementation the gaming server provides a master gaming board and master attack sequence and each preselected gaming table and attack sequence competes against the master gaming board and master attack sequence to identify one or more winners based on the resulting scores. For example all players that attain a score greater than or equal to a predetermined threshold may enter a subsequent stage of the game. In one particular implementation the identified winners then compete against one another in a tournament to identify an ultimate winner. As described above the tournament may include round robin matches peer to peer matches or a combination thereof. In one embodiment the identified winners utilise the same preselected gaming table and attack sequences in the tournament against one another. The tickets can optionally include a draw resolution selection to assist in allocating prizes among players.

In a further embodiment a first player preselects a first gaming table and a first attack sequence by populating cells of the first gaming table with tokens and providing a first attack sequence of attacking moves. The first player submits a request via a gaming server to a second player to compete against each other. The first player also submits the populated first gaming table and the first attack sequence to the gaming server. In one implementation the first gaming table and the first attack sequence are provided to the gaming server in the form of a unitary computer file multiple computer files an SMS message or any combination thereof. Other implementations may equally be practised without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

The second player receives the request which may be as soon as the request is sent or at any later time such as when the second player next logs on to a website coupled to the gaming server. When the second player accepts the request the second player populates a second gaming table with tokens and provides a second sequence of attacking moves. The second player submits the second gaming table and the second attack sequence to the gaming server and the game is then initiated with a winner being determined almost instantaneously. Thus the second player receives a result shortly after accepting the request and providing the second gaming table and second attack sequence. This may be minutes hours days or even months after the request from the first player. The first player is then notified of the result. Such notification may occur for example via e mail SMS Facebook wall MySpace or via an application residing on the gaming server.

In an alternative implementation the first and second players each provide an attack sequence and the gaming server populates a single gaming table. The attack sequences provided by the first and second players are applied to the gaming table and a winner is subsequently determined.

The present disclosure provides a method of gaming utilising a first gaming table and a predefined number of first tokens. The first gaming table includes a plurality of cells corresponding to the number of first tokens and each cell of the first gaming table is associated with a unique identifier. This enables a player to readily identify a cell to be populated or selected. Each of the first tokens has an associated value. In one embodiment relative differences between consecutively revealed tokens are utilised to compute a score for the player. This score can be computed at the end of a game or interim scores can be displayed during game play.

The method includes the step of populating the first gaming table by storing each of the first tokens in one of the cells of the first gaming table. Population of the cells can be performed by a game controller. Alternatively the cells of the first gaming table are populated in response to commands from a competing player.

The first player provides selection commands to select one of the cells of the first gaming table to reveal one of the first tokens stored therein. The first player provides further selection commands until each of the first tokens has been revealed. The first player can provide each selection command individually with a first token revealed before a further selection command is provided. Alternatively the first player provides a sequence of selection commands in which first tokens corresponding to cells identified in the sequence of selection commands are revealed. The sequence of selection commands can correspond to the number of first tokens or any subset thereof.

The method utilises the values associated with the first tokens to determine a score for the first player based on an order in which the first tokens were revealed. Utilising the values to determine the score can be based on relative differences between values associated with consecutively selected first tokens. Alternatively a predefined ordered sequence of values can be used to determine the score by comparing values associated with the selected tokens to corresponding values in the predefined ordered sequence of values. Thus the order in which the first tokens are revealed has a direct impact on the score for the first player.

In the example in which the cells of the first gaming table are populated in response to commands from a competing player the first player can seek to improve his or her score by attempting to identify patterns of behaviour relating to the competing player. This may be based for example on information relating to gaming tables previously populated by the competing player. Such information may be collected by the first player or may be provided in varying levels of detail by a system implementing a method in accordance with the present disclosure.

It is apparent from the above that the arrangements described are applicable to the computer telecommunications and gaming industries.

The foregoing describes only some embodiments of the present invention and modifications and or changes can be made thereto without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention the embodiments being illustrative and not restrictive.

In the context of this specification the word comprising means including principally but not necessarily solely or having or including and not consisting only of . Variations of the word comprising such as comprise and comprises have correspondingly varied meanings

The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is therefore indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.
