The present invention relates generally to a networked system of computer nodes and more particularly to the management of computer nodes within the system.

Computer nodes such as consumer and enterprise computer equipment have many different operational techniques for identifying faults and performing remedial actions. Some computer nodes are configured to communicate information identifying operational conditions e.g. such as a fault to an administrator person through a user interface and or to an administrator computer node through an application programming interface and to request instructions therefrom as to responsive actions e.g. remedial actions that can be taken to overcome the fault .

These communications are directed to only a particular administrator person and or administrator computer node that has been previously defined through operational settings within the computer node. However limiting these communications in this manner can hinder the ability of the computer node to obtain accurate and timely analysis of the operational condition and responsive actions thereto.

Some embodiments disclosed herein are directed to a computer node that communicates a report message containing information to a social media server to cause publishing of the information through the social media server to other computer nodes tracking publishing on the social media server by the computer node. The computer node receives a response message from one of the other computer nodes through the social media server and operates based on the response message.

In some further embodiments the computer node communicates the report message through posting or web feed to the social media server with an identifier that is tracked by the other computer nodes. The computer node may select based on content of the report message the identifier from among a plurality of defined identifiers that identify different groupings of messages published by the social media server which can be separately tracked by the other computer nodes. The report message may contain information that indicates a possible operational fault associated with the computer node or a device monitored by the computer node and one or more of the other computer nodes can analyze the possible operational fault and provide associated analysis to the computer node through the response message published through the social media server.

Some other embodiments are directed to a computer node that communicates with a social media server to track information published on the social media server by report messages from a plurality of other computer nodes. The computer node generates a response message based on the information published on the social media server by one of the other computer nodes and communicates the response message to the social media server to cause publishing of content of the response message through the social media server to the other computer nodes.

In some further embodiments the computer node tracks information posted or web fed from the social media server having an identifier that is tracked by the computer node. The computer node may determine an operational condition of one of the other computer nodes based on the information and select the identifier from among a plurality of defined identifiers that identify different groupings of messages published by the social media server which can be separately tracked by the other computer nodes based on the operational condition. The computer node may detect a possible operational fault of the other computer node based on the information generate analysis information relating to the possible operational fault and communicate the response message containing the analysis information to the one of the other computer nodes.

It is noted that aspects described with respect to one embodiment may be incorporated in different embodiments although not specifically described relative thereto. That is all embodiments and or features of any embodiments can be combined in any way and or combination. Moreover computer nodes systems methods and or computer program products according to embodiments will be or become apparent to one with skill in the art upon review of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional computer nodes systems methods and or computer program products be included within this description and protected by the accompanying claims.

Various embodiments will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. Other embodiments may take many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.

Various embodiments described herein may arise from deficiencies that have been identified in the context of how computer nodes within systems identify potential faults assess the potential faults and perform remedial actions. However the embodiments disclosed herein are not limited to that context.

In accordance with some embodiments disclosed herein a computer node communicates report messages that identify operational conditions or other status to other computer nodes through one or more social media servers who are tracking publishing on the social media server by the computer node. The computer node then receives feedback via response messages from the other computer nodes through the one or more social media servers. The computer node uses the feedback to control its operation. Such communication from the computer node to the social media servers are not addressed to one particular computer node but instead are received by all computer nodes who have registered with the social media server to track such postings or web feeds. In this manner a computer node can seek assistance from a social media community of other computer nodes who are not necessarily known or otherwise identified beforehand by the computer node and who can leverage their collective knowledge base to provide desired analytical assistance to the computer node.

The computer node communicates with one or more social media servers via a data network e.g. public private local area network wide area network etc. . The social media server may be but is not limited to a social network server e.g. Facebook a blog network server e.g. Tumbler server providing Web2.0 Properties Networks etc. a micro blog network server e.g. Twitter or another social media server . The social media server receives messages containing information from the computer node and publishes the information to other computer nodes who have registered with the social media server to track publishing of information on the social media server by the computer node . The computer node and or one or more of the other computer nodes may include but are not limited to a processing system an application server a database server and or an analytics engine which may be within a distributed cloud computing environment and or may be a user equipment node e.g. smart phone tablet computer laptop computer desktop computer .

The computer node can communicate the information through a message posting and or through a web feed messages e.g. Really Simple Syndication RSS to the social media server . The other computer nodes can register with the social media server to track publishing of information using conventional approaches directed to tracking publications identified as being from a particular person particular device and or being associated with a particular subject e.g. tracking Facebook friends postings Twitter message postings etc. . The social media server can publish the information by allowing the other computer nodes to read fetch the information from the social media server and or by delivering e.g. pushing the information to the other computer nodes . The other computer nodes can communicate with the social media server through a data network which may be separate from or part of the data network

The other computer nodes or users that operate the computer nodes can analyze the published information and communicate response messages to the computer node . The computer node can control its operation based on the response messages.

The software can include applications and an operating system . The operating system can manage operation of the computer node and execution of the applications including managing resource utilization e.g. processor utilization memory allocation utilization network communication allocation utilization peripheral device allocation utilization etc. . A message reporting and analysis layer which may be at least partially incorporated into the operating system can operate to monitor system operation to detect occurrence of conditions that are to be reported in messages to the social media server that are indicative of faults and to carryout remedial operations to attempt to eliminate faults. Communication with the social media server may occur through a social media interface application which may operate to register the computer node for publishing information tracking information published by others etc.

The computer node can operate to determine block an operational condition of the computer node or a device monitored by the computer node . A monitored device may include but is not limited to an environmental sensor a personal monitoring sensor e.g. heart rate monitor blood pressure monitor speed sensor location sensor etc. a machine an operational analysis software layer on a computer device or another computer node. Operational conditions may be monitored according to one or more defined rules. The computer node generates information indicative of the operational condition and communicates block the report message containing the information to the social media server to cause publishing of the information to the other computer nodes which are tracking such publishing. The report message may contain a text string informational description of the determined operational condition a picture e.g. graph of operational state values a movie e.g. animated graph video from a video camera etc. or any other format that can be communicated to the social media server for publication to the other computer nodes .

In one embodiment the information included in the report message sent by the computer node to the social media server for publication indicates at least one of an error arising while processing an application on the computer node a protected memory space access violation by an application while being processed on the computer node an available memory space of the computer node that is usable to process an application not satisfying a defined threshold an available communication bandwidth of the computer node that is usable by an application not satisfying a defined threshold and an available processing bandwidth of the computer node that is used to process an application not satisfying a defined threshold.

The computer node may communicate block the report message based on the operational condition satisfying a defined rule. For example when determining block the operational condition the computer node may detect a possible operational fault e.g. application processing errors protected memory space access violations insufficient available resources etc. of the computer node or the monitored device and responsive thereto communicate block the report message to publish the information indicative of the possible operational fault through the social media server to the other computer nodes .

The computer node can communicate block the report message by posting to the social media server the information with an identifier e.g. Twitter tag Facebook member identifier etc. that is tracked by the other computer nodes . Alternatively or additionally the computer node can communicate block the report message to the social media server as a web feed such as a Really Simple Syndication RSS feed containing the information with an identifier that is tracked by the other computer nodes . For example the computer node can communicate fault status information for posting on a Twitter social media server and can cause these posts to be grouped together for consumption by the other computers nodes by topic or type by use of hashtags words or phrases prefixed with a sign.

The computer node may select the identifier from among a plurality of defined identifiers that identify different groupings of messages published by the social media server which can be separately tracked by the other computer nodes and may select an identifier which identifies different groupings of web feeds maintained by the social media server which can be separately tracked by the other computer nodes . The identifier may be selected based on the determined operational condition. For example when the operational condition is indicative of a possible operational fault the computer node may select an identifier that targets other computer nodes or users of such computer nodes that track and provide assistance with assessment of faults and recommendation of remedial actions.

The social media server publishes block the information by for example posting the information and or providing a web feed of the information to the other computer nodes that are tracking the associated identifier. As explained above the report message generated by the computer node may contain a text string informational description of the operational condition determined by the computer node . The social media server may publish the text string informational description. The publishing may include posting via a blog network server e.g. post on blog via Tumbler server providing Web2.0 Properties Networks etc. via a micro blog network server e.g. tweet via Twitter via a social network server e.g. post on a Facebook user wall or via another social media server .

The other computer nodes have earlier registered with the social media server to track certain identifiers e.g. registered to follow Twitter tag subject matter and then operate to track block the identifier associated with the posted and or web fed information regarding the operational condition. One or more users may operate the computer nodes to analyze block the posted and or web fed operational information and can communicate block a response message containing analysis information of or other response to the operational information through the computer nodes for posting and or web feed back to the social media server . Alternatively or additionally one or more of the computer nodes may analyze block the posted and or web fed operational data and communicate block a response message containing analysis information or other response to the operational information through the computer nodes for posting and or web feed back to the social media server .

In one example the other computer nodes analyze block the posted web fed operational information to for example confirm occurrence of a fault and identify candidate causes of the fault and may further identify proposed remedial actions to be taken by the computer node . One or more of the computer nodes may communicate block a response message through a message posting and or through a web feed format e.g. RSS to the social media server for publication to the computer node .

The analysis information generated by the responding one or more computer nodes may indicate a remedial action for the computer node to take to remedy at least one of an error associated with the computer node processing an application a protected memory space access violation by an application being processed by the computer node an available memory space of the computer node that is usable to process an application not satisfying a defined threshold an available communication bandwidth of the computer node that is usable by an application not satisfying a defined threshold and an available processing bandwidth of the computer node that is used to process an application not satisfying a defined threshold.

The responding one or more computer nodes may select based on the operational condition an identifier from among a plurality of defined identifiers that identify different groupings of messages published by the social media server which can be separately tracked by the computer node . The responding one or more computer nodes can then include the selected identifier in the response message communicated block to the social media server for publication block .

In this manner the responding one or more computer nodes can direct the response message back to the computer node with the identifier selected to cause the computer node to determine that the response message has been provided responsive to the earlier communicated report message block . The responding one or more computer nodes can alternatively or additionally redirect e.g. using conventional Twitter social media communication operations such as reposting a message from Twitter using RT in the message and sharing it with other computer nodes following same the response message to other ones of the computer nodes which are tracking the identifier selected to solicit their assistance with analysis of the operational condition reported from the computer node . These other ones of the computer nodes can then respond back through the social media server with an identifier that is tracked by the computer node and or respond back through another computer node for relay to the computer node via the social media server .

The social media server publishes block content of the response message received in the response message from the other computer nodes by for example posting the content of the response message and or providing a web feed of the content of the response message to the computer node which receives the content of the response message by tracking block the associated identifier of the posted content. The computer node may operate to identify one of the informational postings by one or more of the other computer nodes as being responsive to the report message block . The computer node operates block based on the content of the response message.

The computer node may select an action among a plurality of defined actions based on the one of the informational postings block identified as being responsive to the report message block and perform the action selected among the plurality of defined actions.

Example operations of the computer node that may be controlled based on content of the response message can include but are not limited to selecting among defined remedial actions for correcting an operational fault and performing the selected remedial action to attempt to reduce or eliminate the operational fault and or compensate for operational effects of the operational fault. In this manner the computer node can detect operational conditions that are indicative of a possible operational fault during operation of the computer node or operation of another device being monitored by the computer node publish information characterizing the operational conditions through the social media server to allow the other computer nodes and or users to analyze and publish suggested remedial actions that the computer node can receive and used to reduce eliminate or compensate for the operational fault.

Through these operation the computer node can leverage the collective knowledgebase of a community of other computer nodes and or users who have a shared social media connection e.g. a community of the same brand or model of computer systems hardware components operating systems software applications person s having similar responsibilities e.g. information technology within companies etc. to assess and provide assistance to one another with fault identification and remedial action resource planning and or any other operations of the computer system .

Another computer node tracks operational information from the social media server that is sourced from one or more of the computer nodes . The computer node displays a graph that is posted as a picture pic.twitter.com graph with a tracking identifier being followed and or the computer node generates the graph based on information received via a web feed having the tracking identifier. The computer node also displays a textual report indicating that the average memory usage on server1 over the past 60 minutes is 8 .

A smart watch i.e. another type of computer node tracks information posted by one or more of the computer nodes and displays information indicating that name load has a CPU utilization of 95 communication utilization of 92 disk input output I O utilization of 88 and has experienced a memory access protection error in application app1 . The high CPU communication and disk I O utilization coupled with the memory access protection error in application app1 may be analyzed by an application on the smart watch or a user thereof as being indicative of a fault with application app1 executed by the computer node and may post a response message through the social media server containing a remedial action for the computer node to for example terminate application app1 reduce execution priority of application app1 etc.
