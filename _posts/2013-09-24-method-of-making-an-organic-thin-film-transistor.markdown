The amplitude of the function generator or audio amplifier was adjusted so the rms voltage across the speaker terminals 4 ohm 5 inch read 45.0 mV. The apparatus was turned on to initiate vibrations and vibrations were continued for 20 hours. The substrate comprising the deposited organic thin film was removed and placed in a vacuum oven to remove any remaining solvent.

A Comparative organic thin film transistor was also prepared in accordance with the foregoing procedure the difference being that the diF TES ADT solution was not subjected to vibration during the drying process.

The electrical properties of the Vibrationally assisted and Comparative organic thin film transistors made as described above were measured using a commercially available probe station and an Agilent 4155 C semiconductor parameter analyzer. illustrates current voltage characteristics of the Vibrationally assisted organic thin film transistor in the saturation regime. The left y axis corresponding to the left curve illustrates log I versus V. The right y axis corresponding to the right curve illustrates the square root of Iversus V. The device of exhibited a of 3 cm V s a Vof 0.7 V an S of 0.43 V dec Nof 6.8Ecm eVand an on off ratio of about 10. Further illustrates current voltage characteristics of the Comparative organic thin film transistor dashed line relative to the Vibrationally assisted organic thin film transistor solid line . SAC in refers to solvent assisted crystallization of the diF TES ADT while VAC refers to vibration assisted crystallization of the diF TES ADT. The Comparative device demonstrated inferior characteristics including a of 0.9 cm V s a Vof 11 V an S of 1.0 V dec and Nof 1.8E.

Organic thin film transistors employing various vibrationally assisted drop cast organic thin films were produced in accordance with the procedure of Example 1. Table VII provides the identities of the small molecule semiconductors of the vibrationally assisted drop cast organic thin films and the resulting current voltage characteristics of the organic thin film transistors constructed therefrom.

Various embodiments of the invention have been described in fulfillment of the various objectives of the invention. It should be recognized that these embodiments are merely illustrative of the principles of the present invention. Numerous modifications and adaptations thereof will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
