The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 052 226 filed Mar. 21 2011.

Passcodes may be used in many situations where a user needs to be authenticated. Situations requiring authentication may include the ability to access or use a computer mobile phone PDA or any other device. They may also enable access to a physical location or allow use of a credit debit card or similar instrument. Passcodes are typically alpha numeric strings or sequences entered on a keyboard.

Eye tracking technology can be used to select objects on a screen. The eye tracking system tracks the gaze of a user and determines which object the user is looking at.

The present application proposes a method for authenticating a user of a computing device in which a determination is made of where the user s gaze is directed from an image that is captured in response to a trigger signal such as the activation of a single input interface such as a button. In general a plurality of objects is displayed on a display screen. The plurality of objects includes at least objects that make up a sequence of objects pre selected as the user s passcode. A determination of which object is in the direction of the user s gaze is made from the photograph and whether or not the gaze is on the correct object in the sequence of the passcode. This is repeated for each object in the sequence of the passcode.

The methods disclosed make third party determination of a user s passcode by shoulder surfing or other means difficult. Typically if the observer can see the user s eyes the observer can not see the display at which the user is gazing. Likewise if the observer can see the display they likely can not see the user s eyes.

Embodiments of the present application are not limited to any particular operating system mobile device architecture server architecture or computer programming language.

Reference is first made to which shows in block diagram form a communication system in which example embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied. The communication system comprises a number of mobile communication devices mobile devices which may be connected to the remainder of system in any of several different ways. Accordingly several instances of mobile communication devices are depicted in employing different example ways of connecting to system . Mobile communication devices are connected to a wireless communication network which may comprise one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network WWAN and a Wireless Local Area Network WLAN or other suitable network arrangements. In some embodiments the mobile communication devices are configured to communicate over both the WWAN and WLAN and to roam between these networks. In some embodiments the wireless network may comprise multiple WWANs and WLANs .

The WWAN may be implemented as any suitable wireless access network technology. By way of example but not limitation the WWAN may be implemented as a wireless network that includes a number of transceiver base stations one of which is shown in where each of the base stations provides wireless Radio Frequency RF coverage to a corresponding area or cell.

Although WWAN is described as a Wide Area network that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks WMAN and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.

The WWAN may further comprise a wireless network gateway which connects the mobile communication devices to transport facilities and through the transport facilities to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities may include one or more private networks or lines the public internet a virtual private network or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system may be operated for example by an organization or enterprise such as a corporation university or governmental department which allows access to a network such as an internal or enterprise network and its resources or the wireless connector system may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some embodiments the network may be realised using the internet rather than an internal or enterprise network.

The wireless network gateway provides an interface between the wireless connector system and the WWAN which facilitates communication between the mobile communication devices and other devices not shown connected directly or indirectly to the WWAN . Accordingly communications sent via the mobile communication devices are transported via the WWAN and the wireless network gateway through transport facilities to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system are received by the wireless network gateway and transported via the WWAN to the mobile communication devices .

The WLAN comprises a wireless network which in some embodiments conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards sometimes referred to as Wi Fi such as for example the IEEE 802.11a 802.11b and or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN in other embodiments such as for example IEEE 802.11n IEEE 802.16e also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or WiMAX or IEEE 802.20 also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access . The WLAN includes one or more wireless RF Access Points AP one of which is shown in that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.

The WLAN may be a personal network of the user an enterprise network or a hotspot offered by an internet service provider ISP a mobile network provider or a property owner in a public or semi public area for example. The access points are connected to an access point AP interface which may connect to the wireless connector system directly for example if the access point is part of an enterprise WLAN in which the wireless connector system resides or indirectly via the transport facilities if the access point is a personal Wi Fi network or Wi Fi hotspot in which case a mechanism for securely connecting to the wireless connector system such as a virtual private network VPN may be appropriate . The AP interface provides translation and routing services between the access points and the wireless connector system to facilitate communication directly or indirectly with the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system may be implemented as one or more servers and is typically located behind a firewall . The wireless connector system manages communications including email messages to and from a set of managed mobile communication devices . The wireless connector system also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and mobile communication devices which may connect to the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system allows the mobile communication devices to access the network and connected resources and services such as a messaging server for example a Microsoft Exchange IBM Lotus Domino or Novell GroupWise email messaging server having a global address book and optionally other servers . The other servers may comprise a content server for providing content such as internet content or content from an organization s internal servers to the mobile communication devices in the wireless network and an application server for implementing server based applications.

The global address book comprises electronic contact records generated and maintained by an IT information technology administrator of the network . Typically the global address book is maintained exclusively by the messaging server and there is no local copy on the mobile device . In addition the global address book typically comprises contact records for all users of the respective network e.g. enterprise . The contact records in the global address book may be one or more of individual contact records or user records or a group address or distribution list which lists multiple individual users .

The wireless connector system typically provides a secure exchange of data e.g. email messages personal information manager PIM data and IM data with the mobile communication devices . In some embodiments communications between the wireless connector system and the mobile communication devices are encrypted. In some embodiments communications are encrypted using a symmetric encryption key implemented using Advanced Encryption Standard AES or Triple Data Encryption Standard Triple DES encryption. Private encryption keys are generated in a secure two way authenticated environment and are used for both encryption and decryption of data.

The wireless network gateway is adapted to send data packets received from the mobile device over the WWAN to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the messaging server content server or application servers . Conversely the wireless connector system sends data packets received for example from the messaging server or other server to the wireless network gateway which then transmit the data packets to the destination mobile device . The AP interfaces of the WLAN provide similar sending functions between the mobile device the wireless connector system and network connection point such as the messaging server content server and application server .

The network may comprise a private local area network metropolitan area network wide area network the public internet or combinations thereof and may include virtual networks constructed using any of these alone or in combination.

The short range wireless communication interface may be a personal area network PAN interface. A personal area network is a wireless point to point connection meaning no physical cables are required to connect the two end points.

It will be appreciated that the above described communication system is provided for the purpose of illustration only and that the above described communication system comprises one possible communication network configuration of a multitude of possible configurations for use with the mobile communication devices . The teachings of the present disclosure may be employed in connection with any other type of network and associated devices that are effective in implementing or facilitating wireless communication. Suitable variations of the communication system will be understood to a person of skill in the art and are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.

Reference is now made to which illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the mobile device in which example embodiments described in the present disclosure can be applied.

The mobile device includes a rigid case not shown housing the components of the device . The internal components of the device are constructed on a printed circuit board PCB . The mobile device includes a controller comprising at least one processor such as a microprocessor which controls the overall operation of the device . The processor interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem sometimes referred to as a radio layer for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network to perform communication functions. The processor interacts with additional device subsystems including a display screen such as a liquid crystal display LCD screen input devices such as a keyboard and control buttons flash memory random access memory RAM read only memory ROM auxiliary input output I O subsystems data port such as serial data port such as a Universal Serial Bus USB data port speaker microphone short range communication subsystem and other device subsystems generally designated as .

The mobile device may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of the wireless network within its geographic coverage area. The mobile device may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna through the wireless network are input to the receiver which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification frequency down conversion filtering channel selection etc. as well as analog to digital A D conversion. A D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner signals to be transmitted are processed including modulation and encoding for example by the DSP . These DSP processed signals are output to the transmitter for digital to analog D A conversion frequency up conversion filtering amplification and transmission to the wireless network via the antenna . The DSP not only processes communication signals but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver and the transmitter may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .

Each of the software applications may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements e.g. text fields input fields icons etc. in the user interface i.e. the display screen according to the application.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory this is merely one example and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.

In some embodiments the auxiliary I O subsystems may comprise an external communication link or interface for example an Ethernet connection. The mobile device may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks for example a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed OFDM network or a GPS Global Positioning System subsystem comprising a GPS receiver or transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network not shown . The auxiliary I O subsystems may comprise a pointing or navigational input device such as a touchpad a clickable trackball or scroll wheel or thumbwheel or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the device such as receipt of an electronic message or incoming phone call or for other purposes such as haptic feedback touch feedback .

In some embodiments the mobile device also includes a removable memory card or module typically comprising flash memory and a memory card interface . Network access is typically associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile device via the memory card which may be a Subscriber Identity Module SIM card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory card is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface of the mobile device in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .

The mobile device also stores other data in an erasable persistent memory which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various embodiments the data includes service data comprising information required by the mobile device to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data may also include user application data such as email messages address book and contact information calendar and schedule information notepad documents image files and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile device by its user and other data. The data stored in the persistent memory e.g. flash memory of the mobile device may be organized at least partially into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example email messages contact records and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.

The mobile device also includes a battery as a power source which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged for example through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile device and the battery interface provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface is coupled to a regulator not shown which provides power V to the circuitry of the mobile device .

The short range communication subsystem is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile device and different systems or devices which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example the subsystem may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices.

A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations including data and voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile device during or after manufacture. Additional applications and or upgrades to the operating system or software applications may also be loaded onto the mobile device through the wireless network the auxiliary I O subsystem the serial port the short range communication subsystem or other suitable subsystem . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed for example written into the program memory i.e. the flash memory or written into and executed from the RAM for execution by the processor at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile device and may provide enhanced on device functions communication related functions or both. For example secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile device .

The mobile device may provide two principal modes of communication a data communication mode and a voice communication mode. In the data communication mode a received data signal such as a text message an email message or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem and input to the processor for further processing. For example a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the display . A user of the mobile device may also compose data items such as email messages for example using the input devices in conjunction with the display screen . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem over the wireless network .

In the voice communication mode the mobile device provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar except that the received signals are output to the speaker and signals for transmission are generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software firmware i.e. the phone application and hardware i.e. the microphone the speaker and input devices . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem may also be implemented on the mobile device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker the display screen may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party duration of a voice call or other voice call related information.

The phone application can be split into multiple applications or sub modules for example one or more user phone modules and a call control module. The user phone modules provide a variety of telephony features through a user interface while the call control module provides access to common telephony functions desired by the user phone modules such that telephony requests from phone modules can be coordinated and so that the user phone modules do not need to each provide instructions understood by the wireless communications subsystem . The call control function typically makes telephony features available to user phone modules through an application programming interface API . It is to be recognized that all or part of the phone application features or functions could be provided through the operating system or otherwise distributed in the device while continuing to fall within the term phone application .

Referring now to an exemplary computer readable media will be described. The computer readable media have computer readable instructions stored thereon that when implemented cause a processor to execute any one of the methods described herein. For the purposes of the application computer readable media comprise any tangible computer storage such as but not limited to flash memory read only memory CD DVD and memory sticks. Authentication module described above with reference to is an exemplary implementation of computer readable media . However it is to be understood that the computer readable media is not limited to use on mobile devices such as mobile device described above. Non limiting examples of the processor include a CPU central processing unit on a personal computer laptop computer tablet device personal digital assistant PDA mobile telephone smart phone bank machine and digital authentication system for entry to rooms or buildings or control system. Any device with a processor a display and a user interface enabling a user to move images on the display could feasibly make use of the computer readable media to authenticate users.

At action the method starts with displaying a plurality of objects on a display screen the plurality of objects comprising objects that have been pre selected as part of a passcode the passcode comprising a sequence of the pre selected objects. In some embodiments the passcode sequence is not ordered. In other words the sequence may comprise a plurality of objects and to authenticate the user must select a threshold number of the objects in any order. In other embodiments the sequence is in a pre selected order that must be maintained in the selection process in order to authenticate. The plurality of objects in some embodiments comprises objects not in the passcode as well as the objects that are part of the passcode. Non limiting examples of the objects include digits alphanumeric characters and graphical elements. By way of example is a display where the objects are the digits 1 through 9 displayed in a random order at eight cardinal directions and at the center of the display. is a display where the objects are graphical elements. In this particular example the graphical elements are smiley faces with different facial expressions. Other possibilities for graphical elements include but are not limited to objects of different geometric shapes and objects of different colours. It is to be understood that any number of objects can be used as well as any combination of types of objects. For example smiley faces and digits can be displayed at the same time. In another non limiting embodiment the objects include animations. In some embodiments the objects are displayed as moving around the display screen. In embodiments where the objects are moving the speed of movement is determined by how quickly and accurately the direction of gaze can be determined. Factors in deciding how many objects to display include the size of the display and the precision which a direction of gaze can be determined. The sequence of the passcode is pre selected. It is to be understood that the sequence can be of any length. One factor to consider in deciding how long to make the passcode are the length of time the authentication will take. Another factor to consider is the desired level of security. A longer passcode will provide a higher level of security than a shorter passcode. It is also to be understood that the passcode may include more than one occurrence of the same object.

The method then continues with actions to which are repeated for each object of the sequence of the passcode. At action a trigger signal is received. In some embodiments the trigger signal is an input for taking a photograph received from an input interface. In some embodiments the input is the result of activation of the input interface such as but not limited to a button on a keyboard a button on a touch screen a function key a designated area of a touch screen and a touch pad. In some embodiments a gesture such as but not limited to a tapping on the device is the input. The tapping could be registered by the device s accelerometer. In some embodiments the input is a finger gesture on the touchscreen. Triggering an image sensor to capture an image could also be done from a device accessory that is connected for example through a short range wireless protocol e.g. Bluetooth with the device. For example in the case where the device such as a tablet is sitting upright in a docking station pressing a button on the accessory could trigger the camera. This would reduce the need to reach for or touch the electronic device during authentication. In some embodiments the trigger signal is generated at a set time. In some embodiments for example a trigger signal can be generated at set intervals after the authentication process is initiated. For example a user can initiate authentication by pressing a button and an image can be captured for each object of the sequence at a set interval such as but not limited to 1 or 2 seconds. In some embodiments the trigger signal is generated at a user trained rate. For example in setting up the passcode the user can train to shift their gaze from one object to another and hold still until the image is taken.

In response to the trigger signal at action an image sensor is caused to capture an image. In some embodiments the image sensor is a camera. In some embodiments the image is a photograph. In some embodiments the image is captured in a direction opposing the display screen. In some embodiments the image sensor is part of the computing device. In other embodiments the image sensor is a peripheral device controlled by the processor executing the method. In some embodiments the image is not displayed. This provides extra security in that an observer standing behind the user is not provided with an opportunity to see both the user s face in the image and the objects displayed on the display. In other embodiments a copy of the image is displayed on a display. The copy could be displayed on the same display as the plurality of objects or a separate display. This permits the user to know if a good quality image that is with the user s face centered within the photograph and in focus has been taken. In other embodiments a preview of the image is displayed so that the user can position himself or herself prior to activating the input interface. In some embodiments a single photograph or image is taken per activation of the input interface. In other embodiments the image sensor captures a short sequence of images when the input interface is activated. While this might require slightly more computational power and therefore more computational time and electrical power it has the potential to make the authentication process more reliable and robust to errors caused by such things as eye saccades.

At action the photograph is analysed to determine a direction of gaze. In some embodiments this includes determining if there is a pair of eyes in the image. In some embodiments this includes determining if there is a face in the image. This can be accomplished using any one of a number of pattern recognition methods available. In some embodiments the method further comprises comparing a face of at least one of the images to images of faces of pre authorized users and only indicating positive authentication if the face matches the face of an authorized user. In some embodiments the face in the image must match a face in an image stored for the user attempting authentication. Existing facial recognition methods can be used to perform the comparison. In some embodiments if the face in the image does not match the face of a pre authorised user the authentication method is ceased.

In some embodiments this determination of direction of gaze is based on existing eye tracking algorithms such as those used by Tobii Technology and by Takashi Nagamatsu Michiya Yamamoto and Hiroshi Sato in their Mobigaze interface. However in the present disclosure the direction of gaze is determined from the image captured. It is not required to track eye movement prior to capturing the image which would have required that the image sensor to be on continuously. In the method proposed the image sensor only needs to be turned on for the capture of the image which uses less power than eye tracking methods that monitor eye movement on a continuous basis over a period of time. Furthermore less processing is required to analyse the image than to capture and analyse the data required to track continuous eye movement. In some embodiments one eye is analysed to determine direction of gaze. In other embodiments two eyes are analysed to determine direction of gaze. In some embodiments head tilt is used to determine direction of gaze. In some embodiments a combination of analysing one or two eyes and head tilt are used. In some embodiments the direction of gaze can differ from the direction of the head in the image.

Alternatively the image can be analysed to determine if there is a face in the image and if there is a face in the image the direction of gaze of eyes on the face is determined.

In some embodiments the image is compared to template images previously captured of the user s face. For example there can be a template image stored for each position on the display in which the objects are positioned in implementing the method. An example of creating an open eye template is discussed in Emiliano Miluzzon Tianyu Wang Andrew T. Campbell. Eye Phone Activating Mobile Phones With Your Eyes. In 2010 Aug. 30 2010 New Delhi India.

In some embodiments direction of head tilt is used to aid in the determination of direction of gaze. For example if the head in the image is tilted to the user s right this can be an indication that an object on the left hand side of the display is intended to be selected. Likewise if the head in the image is tilted upwards an object at the top of the display is likely intended to be selected.

At action the object on the display screen that corresponds to the direction of gaze is determined. It is to be understood that corresponds to does not have to be an exact match of the direction of gaze to the object on the display. In some embodiments a margin of error is permissible and a direction of gaze within a zone or area of the object will be interpreted as corresponding to the object. Then at action a determination is made as to whether the object that corresponds to the direction of the gaze matches the object in the sequence.

After the images have been analysed for all objects of the sequence at action a determination is made as to whether a threshold number of matches has been exceeded and if the threshold has been exceeded indicating positive authentication. Non limiting examples of indicating positive authentication include providing a visual indicator providing an audible indicator and allowing user access. The threshold can be set to be all of the sequence or a number less than all of the sequence. In some cases less than all of the sequence is set as the threshold to allow for some inaccuracies. For example one or more images taken may be out of focus or the user may be in a position in the image that does not allow for the determination of gaze. In a non limiting example if the sequence has a length of five authentication may require only three matches.

In some embodiments an input is received indicated that an image has been captured for each object of the sequence. For example a specific button could be pressed or a button used to generate the trigger signal can be pressed twice. In other embodiments the action takes place after a preset number of image captures. For example in some embodiments the passcode comprises a preset number of objects such as 3 or 4.

Another way to allow for inaccuracies is to keep updating a running probability that the user is entering the right login sequence. At the end of the login sequence the user is granted access if this probability is higher than a pre defined threshold. As an example consider the login case described in below where the correct passcode is 5 2 7 . First the user is gazing at digit 5 when pressing the button. For each digit presented on the screen the system can assign a probability that the digit is being selected by the user. In this case after running its eye tracking algorithm it might assign a probability of 0.7 to digit 5 0.2 to digit 2 0.1 to digit 1 and 0 to all remaining digits notice that overall the probabilities add to 1 . The process continues with the selection of the next digit passcode. For this second step the user is gazing at digit 2. Again probabilities are assigned to each digit on the screen say 0.8 to digit 2 and 0.2 to digit 6 . At this stage from the system s perspective the probability that the user was looking at the correct 5 2 sequence is therefore 0.7 0.8 0.56. The system keeps updating this probability count for each digit of the passcode and can then compare it to a pre defined threshold at the end of the process.

In some embodiments if the threshold of matches is not met the method further comprises indicating that authentication failed. The indication that authentication failed in some embodiments is an audio signal. In some embodiments the indication that authentication failed is a visual output on the display. In some embodiments if authentication failed the method starts over. In some embodiments after a set number of failed authentication attempts a user is locked out and not permitted to attempt authentication again. In some embodiments the user is locked out until an administrator overrides the lock out. In other embodiments the lock out is for a set time period.

In some embodiments the method further comprises timing the authentication attempt. If positive authentication is not indicated within a time limit the method proceeds to indicating that authentication failed.

In some embodiments if authentication fails the computing device requires the user to enter an alpha numeric password in a subsequent authentication attempt.

In some embodiments the plurality of objects is displayed in a different order after each determination of whether the direction of the gaze corresponds to the object of the sequence. In other words the objects are shuffled between each image.

In some embodiments the plurality of objects is displayed in a random order. Thus the user will not know prior to starting the authentication process where the first object of the sequence will appear on the display. This will make it more difficult for an observer to determine the passcode by observing the user s eyes alone. Even if the observer can determine that the user was looking up when the input interface was activated the observer will not know what objects appear at the top of the display because the location varies with each authentication attempt.

In some embodiments the method further comprises tracking relative position of the computing device after the image sensor captures the image and collecting position related data. In some embodiments the position related data is used to determine change in position of the computing device from the image to a subsequent image. If there is a presumption that the user remained relatively still this information about the relative position or orientation of the computing device can be useful in determining differences between the face in the images. In this manner the analysis of subsequent images can require less processing than the analysis of the first image in the authentication process as only the differences need to be processed. Over an amount of time that is comparable to a realistic time lapse between two consecutive button presses of the login process for example 2 to 3 seconds an accelerometer can be quite good at tracking relative motion of the device. This means that embodiments of the system and method described herein can build a fairly reliable model of how much the original image that is captured will change over the period of time between two button presses. This information is valuable when computing speed is of the essence. For instance having identified the location of the user s eyes in the first image the system can focus on a subregion of the second image where it would expect to find the user s eyes based on their position in the original image and on how much the device has moved.

One way to track relative position is to use an accelerometer on the computing device. This is useful with mobile devices. Data collected from the accelerometer can be used to determine if the direction and distance the mobile device changed between images. Likewise a digital compass can be used to track relative position. A digital compass generally comprises a magnetometer and an accelerometer.

As mentioned above the analysis of the image to determine the direction of gaze is based in some embodiments on existing eye tracking techniques. One such technique is Pupil Centre Corneal Reflection PCCR which is used by Tobii Technology. In this technique a light source illuminates the eye causing reflections off the cornea and the pupil which are captured by a camera along with an image of the eye. Thus in some embodiments of the methods disclosed herein analysing the images using a technique based on PCCR the image sensor includes a light source such as but not limited to an infrared light or near infrared source and a flash. Image processing algorithms are used to calculate the position of the eye and point of gaze based on the image of the eye and the reflection pattern the position of the light source relative to the eye and the position of the object upon which the eye is looking.

An example of authenticating for a login sequence with a passcode of 5 2 7 will now be described with reference to . Images of a computing device and images taken of the user for each digit of the login sequence are shown. The computing device of this example is a mobile computing device with a front facing camera a light source a display and a push button . Non limiting examples of the push button are a mechanical button a touch pad a touch sensitive area of a touch screen and a touch sensitive area of the display . In the image at the left of the figure 5 is displayed at the top left corner of the display. Eight other digits are randomly displayed so that there are three columns and three rows of digits displayed. In the corresponding image the user s gaze is to the top right indicating selection of the digit at the top left corner of the display. Therefore a match for the first digit of the sequence is determined. In the middle image of the computing device the digit 2 is displayed in the center row of the right hand column of the display. In the corresponding image the direction of the use s gaze is to the left indicating selection of the digit located in the center row of the right hand column. Therefore a match for the second digit of the sequence is determined. In the image of the computing device at the right hand side of the digit 7 is located at the top right corner of the display . In the corresponding image the direction of the user s gaze is to the top left indicating selection of the digit located at the top right corner. Therefore a match for the third digit of the sequence is determined. Because there were matches for all three digits of the sequence positive authentication is achieved. For illustrative purposes arrows are shown on the images to show the direction of gaze. It is to be understood that such arrows are not necessary in implementation.
