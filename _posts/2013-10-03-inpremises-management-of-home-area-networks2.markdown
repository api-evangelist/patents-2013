This disclosure relates generally to networking and more particularly relates to in premises management of home area networks.

A home area network may be used to communicate data between devices that consume resources in a home or other dwelling e.g. electricity and devices that monitor and or manage the consumption of resources. Utility companies and other resource providers may use home area networks to monitor consumption of the resources by consumers. Using home area networks to monitor consumption of the resources by consumers in a home may allow a utility company or other resource provider to identify distribution issues and other problems.

Home area networks may be provided by transceiver devices included in intelligent metering devices. Connectivity from a metering device to a monitored building may be established by physically attaching the metering device to the monitored building. Physically attaching the metering device to a building or other structure may provide sufficient range and connectivity for deployment environments such as single dwelling homes. In some deployment environments such as apartment buildings or other multi dwelling units a metering device may be installed at a first location such as a corner of the building that is remote from a second location being monitored by the metering device such as an apartment in a multi dwelling unit . The distance between the metering device and the home area network may present problems in establishing connectivity from the home area network to the metering device.

It is desirable to provide a simplified communication infrastructure for communicating data between a home area network and a metering device.

Systems and methods are disclosed for providing in premises management of home area networks. In some aspects a management device configured for managing a home area network is provided. The management device can include a network interface device a processor in communication with the network interface device and a transceiver device in communication with the processor. The network interface device can establish a paired communication link with a computing device that is in communication with a head end system via a data network. The processor can receive a command originating from the head end system. The command can be communicated to the management device from the computing device via the paired communication link. The processor can identify a terminal device of the home area network that can perform a function in response to the command. The processor can generate a message for the terminal device including the command. The transceiver device can transmit the message from the processor to the terminal device via a wireless communication link of the home area network.

These illustrative aspects and features are mentioned not to limit or define the invention but to provide examples to aid understanding of the inventive concepts disclosed in this application. Other aspects advantages and features of the present invention will become apparent after review of the entire application.

Referring now to the drawings is a network diagram illustrating an example HAN that can be managed using a HAN module integrated with a utility meter .

The HAN can service a structure . A non limiting example of the structure is a unit of a multi dwelling unit. A multi dwelling unit can include multiple apartments or other geographical areas used as dwellings. The utility meter can be attached to or otherwise installed in the structure . Multiple utility meters can monitor respective structures that are units of a multi dwelling unit and that include respective HANs . In a non limiting example a structure such as a multi dwelling unit can include a control room having multiple utility meters installed in a rack. Each utility meter can monitor a respective dwelling in a multi dwelling unit.

The utility meter can include the HAN module and an application processor . The application processor can access or include a memory device that stores program code executable by the application processor . The application processor can communicate data that is received via the HAN to a head end system via a suitable data network.

The HAN module can communicate with the application processor via a serial link . For example the application processor may obtain data from a memory device of the utility meter and provide the data to the HAN module at regular intervals such as every 30 seconds. The HAN module can communicate data between the application processor and the structure that is monitored by the utility meter .

The HAN module can establish and or manage the HAN used for communication between the utility meter and terminal devices . The HAN can include RF links or other suitable wireless communication links between the HAN module and the terminal devices . The HAN module can provide data received from the terminal devices via the RF links to the application processor via the serial link .
