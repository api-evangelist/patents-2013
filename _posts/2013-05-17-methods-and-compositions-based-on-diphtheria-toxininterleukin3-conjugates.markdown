The present invention provides methods for targeting interleukin 3 receptor expressing cells and in particular inhibiting the growth of such cells by using a diphtheria toxin human interleukin 3 conjugate DT IL3 that is toxic to cells expressing the interleukin 3 receptor. In preferred embodiments the DT IL3 conjugate is a recombinant construct wherein DNA encoding IL 3 is inserted in place of the receptor binding domain of the diphtheria toxin the catalytic and translocation regions of the diphtheria toxin remaining intact that when translated produces a protein comprising amino acids 1 388 of diphtheria toxin fused via a peptide linker to full length human interleukin 3. In certain embodiments the methods of the present invention relate to the administration of a DT IL3 conjugate to inhibit the growth of cancer cells and or cancer stem cells in humans which cells express one or more subunits of the interleukin 3 receptor. Exemplary cells include the cancer cells and cancer stem cells of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. In other embodiments the methods of the present invention relate to ex vivo purging of bone marrow or peripheral blood to remove cells that express one or more subunits of the interleukin 3 receptor such that the purged bone marrow or peripheral blood is suitable e.g. for autologous stem cell transplantation back into the patient to restore hematopoietic function e.g. as may be required following high dose chemotherapy for cancer .

Cancer is one of the most significant health conditions. The American Cancer Society s 2003 predicts over 1.3 million Americans will receive a cancer diagnosis this year. In the United States cancer is second only to heart disease in mortality accounting for one of four deaths. In 2002 the National Institutes of Health estimated total costs of cancer totaled 171.6 billion with 61 billion in direct expenditures. The incidence of cancer is widely expected to increase as the US population ages further augmenting the impact of this condition. The current treatment regimens for cancer established in the 1970s and 1980s have not changed dramatically. These treatments which include chemotherapy radiation and other modalities including newer targeted therapies have shown limited overall survival benefit when utilized in most advanced stage common cancers since among other things these therapies primarily target tumor bulk.

More specifically conventional cancer diagnosis and therapies to date have attempted to selectively detect and eradicate neoplastic cells that are largely fast growing i.e. cells that form the tumor bulk . Standard oncology regimens have often been largely designed to administer the highest dose of irradiation or a chemotherapeutic agent without undue toxicity i.e. often referred to as the maximum tolerated dose MTD or no observed adverse effect level NOAEL . Many conventional cancer chemotherapies e.g. alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide antimetabolites such as 5 Fluorouracil and plant alkaloids such as vincristine and conventional irradiation therapies exert their toxic effects on cancer cells largely by interfering with cellular mechanisms involved in cell growth and DNA replication. Chemotherapy protocols also often involve administration of a combination of chemotherapeutic agents in an attempt to increase the efficacy of treatment. Despite the availability of a large variety of chemotherapeutic agents these therapies have many drawbacks see e.g. Stockdale 1998 Principles Of Cancer Patient Management in Scientific American Medicine vol. 3 Rubenstein and Federman eds. ch. 12 sect. X . For example chemotherapeutic agents are notoriously toxic due to non specific side effects on fast growing cells whether normal or malignant e.g. chemotherapeutic agents cause significant and often dangerous side effects including bone marrow depression immunosuppression and gastrointestinal distress etc.

Other types of traditional cancer therapies include surgery hormonal therapy immunotherapy anti angiogenesis therapy targeted therapy e.g. therapy directed to a cancer target such as Gleevec and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors Velcade Sutent et al. and radiation treatment to eradicate neoplastic cells in a patient see e.g. Stockdale 1998 Principles of Cancer Patient Management in Scientific American Medicine vol. 3 Rubenstein and Federman eds. ch. 12 sect. IV . All of these approaches can pose significant drawbacks for the patient including a lack of efficacy in terms of long term outcome e.g. due to failure to target cancer stem cells and toxicity e.g. due to non specific effects on normal tissues . Accordingly new therapies for improving the long term prospect of cancer patients are needed.

Cancer stem cells comprise a unique subpopulation often 0.1 10 or so of a tumor that relative to the remaining 90 or so of the tumor i.e. the tumor bulk are more tumorigenic relatively more slow growing or quiescent and often relatively more chemoresistant than the tumor bulk. Given that conventional therapies and regimens have in large part been designed to attack rapidly proliferating cells i.e. those cancer cells that comprise the tumor bulk cancer stem cells which are often slow growing may be relatively more resistant than faster growing tumor bulk to conventional therapies and regimens. Cancer stem cells can express other features which make them relatively chemoresistant such as multi drug resistance and anti apoptotic pathways. The aforementioned would constitute a key reason for the failure of standard oncology treatment regimens to ensure long term benefit in most patients with advanced stage cancers i.e. the failure to adequately target and eradicate cancer stem cells. In some instances a cancer stem cell s is the founder cell of a tumor i.e. it is the progenitor of the cancer cells that comprise the tumor bulk .

Cancer stem cells have been identified in a large variety of cancer types. For instance Bonnet et al. using flow cytometry were able to isolate the leukemia cells bearing the specific phenotype CD34 CD38 and subsequently demonstrate that it is these cells comprising 

Cox et al. identified small subfractions of human acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL cells which had the phenotypes CD34 CD10and CD34 CD19 and were capable of engrafting ALL tumors in immunocompromised mice i.e. the cancer stem cells. In contrast no engraftment of the mice was observed using the ALL bulk despite in some cases injecting 10 fold more cells. See Cox et al. Characterization of acute lymphoblastic leukemia progenitor cells 104 19 2919 2925 2004 .

Multiple myeloma was found to contain small subpopulations of cells that were CD138 and relative to the large bulk population of CD138 myeloma cells had greater clonogenic and tumorigenic potential. See Matsui et al. Characterization of clonogenic multiple myeloma cells 103 6 2332. The authors concluded that the CD138 subpopulation of multiple myeloma was the cancer stem cell population.

Kondo et al. isolated a small population of cells from a C6 glioma cell line which was identified as the cancer stem cell population by virtue of its ability to self renew and recapitulate gliomas in immunocompromised mice. See Kondo et al. Persistence of a small population of cancer stem like cells in the C6 glioma cell line 101 781 786 2004 . In this study Kondo et al. determined that cancer cell lines contain a population of cancer stem cells that confer the ability of the line to engraft immunodeficient mice.

Breast cancers were shown to contain a small population of cells with stem cell characteristics bearing surface markers CD44 CD24 . See Al Hajj et al. Prospective identification of tumorigenic breast cancer cells 100 3983 3988 2003 . As few as 200 of these cells corresponding to 1 10 of the total tumor cell population are able to form tumors in NOD SCID mice. In contrast implantation of 20 000 cells that lacked this phenotype i.e. the tumor bulk was unable to re grow the tumor.

A subpopulation of cells derived from human prostate tumors was found to self renew and to recapitulate the phenotype of the prostate tumor from which they were derived thereby constituting the prostate cancer stem cell population. See Collins et al. Prospective Identification of Tumorigenic Prostate Cancer Stem Cells 65 23 10946 10951 2005 .

Fang et al. isolated a subpopulation of cells from melanoma with cancer stem cell properties. In particular this subpopulation of cells could differentiate and self renew. In culture the subpopulation formed spheres whereas the more differentiated cell fraction from the lesions were more adherent. Moreover the subpopulation containing sphere like cells were more tumorigenic than the adherent cells when grafted into mice. See Fang et al. A Tumorigenic Subpopulation with Stem Cell Properties in Melanomas 65 20 9328 9337 2005 .

Singh et al. identified brain tumor stem cells. When isolated and transplanted into nude mice the CD133 cancer stem cells unlike the CD133 tumor bulk cells form tumors that can then be serially transplanted. See Singh et al. Identification of human brain tumor initiating cells 432 396 401 2004 Singh et al. Cancer stem cells in nervous system tumors 23 7267 7273 2004 Singh et al. Identification of a cancer stem cell in human brain tumors 63 5821 5828 2003 .

Since conventional cancer therapies target rapidly proliferating cells i.e. cells that form the tumor bulk these treatments are believed to be relatively ineffective at targeting and impairing cancer stem cells. In fact cancer stem cells including leukemia stem cells have indeed been shown to be relatively resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic therapies e.g. Ara C daunorubicin as well as newer targeted therapies e.g. Gleevec Velcade . Examples of cancer stem cells from various tumors that are resistant to chemotherapy and the mechanism by which they are resistant are described in Table 1 below.

Approximately forty thousand patients per year develop acute myeloid leukemia AML in the U.S. Canada and Europe. See e.g. Jamal et al. 56 106 130 2006 . AML is the most common leukemia in adults and the second most common leukemia in children. The prolonged hospitalizations associated with treatment and complications represent a significant share of health care costs in these regions. Further even with combination induction and consolidation chemotherapy most patients ultimately relapse and die from their disease or complications of treatment. See e.g. Brune et al. Improved leukemia free survival after post consolidation immunotherapy with histamine dihydrochloride and interleukin 2 in acute myeloid leukemia results of a randomized phase III trial 108 1 88 96 2006 . Novel therapies are urgently needed. Selective targeting of AML cells stem cells may provide a safe and more effective therapy.

There are approximately 20 000 new cases of myelodysplastic syndrome MDS each year in the U.S. Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes typically have low blood cell counts in at least one or more of red blood cells white blood cells and platelets. Upon examination the bone marrow usually is found to be dysplastic or hyperplastic meaning there are too many poorly functioning blood stem cells in the marrow. A small percentage of MDS patients have hypoplastic bone marrow meaning there are too few blood stem cells in the marrow which make the disease look similar to aplastic anemia. Nearly half of people with MDS have no symptoms at time of diagnosis. When signs and symptoms do occur they can include anemia weakness fatigue headache bruising increased bleeding rash fevers mouth sores and lingering illness. MDS occurs at an increasing frequency in older people but it can occur in children too. In less than a third of patients MDS progresses over time to become acute leukemia. The average age of diagnosis is 70 years old. Treatments for MDS may vary considerably depending on the type of MDS the history of the patient and the age and ability to tolerate certain treatment regimens. Treatment options include supportive care chemotherapy related agents and stem cell transplantation which is typically used only in patients under 50 . However the remission rate for existing treatments in relatively low and new therapies are needed.

Interleukin 3 IL 3 is a cytokine that supports the proliferation and differentiation of multi potential and committed myeloid and lymphoid progenitors. See e.g. Nitsche et al. Interleukin 3 promotes proliferation and differentiation of human hematopoietic stem cells but reduces their repopulation potential in NOD SCID mice 21 236 244 2003 . Human interleukin 3 mediates its effects by binding to human IL 3 receptor which is a hetrodimeric structure and consists of an IL 3 binding subunit and a subunit. The subunit is essential for ligand binding and confers specificity on the receptor. The subunit is also shared by the granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor GM CSF and IL 5 receptors and is required for high affinity ligand binding and signal transduction. Binding of IL 3 induces the heterodimerization of the and receptor subunits. The IL 3 receptor is over expressed relative to certain normal hematopoietic cells on multiple hematological cancers including AML B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia B ALL hairy cell leukemia Hodgkin s disease and certain aggressive non Hodgkin s lymphomas Munoz.

Diphtheria toxin DT is a 535 amino acid protein with three domains consisting of a catalytic domain amino acids 1 186 connected by an arginine rich disulfide loop to a translocation domain amino acids 187 388 and a cell binding domain amino acids 389 535 . See e.g. Choe et al. The crystal structure of diphtheria toxin 357 216 222 1992 . Native DT binds to heparin binding epidermal growth factor precursor and CD9 on the cell surface undergoes clathrin dynamin and ATP dependent receptor mediated endocytosis and with endosome acidification by vesicular ATPase the DT translocation domain undergoes protonation of acidic residues and spontaneous insertion into the vesicular membrane to form 18 22 Angstrom channels. The catalytic domain unfolds and is cleaved by furin in the vesicle and then the C terminus of the catalytic domain transfers through the channel and binds to coatomer proteins specifically COP. Protein disulfide isomerase reduces the linkage of the catalytic domain with the remainder of DT and the peptide passes into the cytosol. Hsp90 assists in refolding. The DT fragment then ADP ribosylates elongation factor 2 leading to protein synthesis inactivation and cell death . See Ratts et al.

Recombinant protein toxin conjugates represent a novel class of oncology biological agents that specifically target receptors on the surfaces of cancer cells. These agents typically consist of a truncated toxin often including the catalytic and translocation but not cell binding domains fused to a cell selective ligand which directs the toxin to the intended target. One such technology involves the recombinant diphtheria toxin DT . DT is a 535 amino acid protein with three domains consisting of a catalytic domain amino acids 1 186 connected by an arginine rich disulfide loop to a translocation domain amino acids 187 388 and a cell binding domain amino acids 389 535 . See e.g. Choe et al. The crystal structure of diphtheria toxin 357 216 222 1992 .

A conserved motif in transmembrane helix 1 of diphtheria toxin mediates catalytic domain delivery to the cytosol 102 15635 15640 2005 . A number of recombinant DT conjugates utilizing a truncated form of DT have been expressed purified and tested in cell culture and selective cell toxicity has been shown. One such recombinant toxin is the DTIL 3 conjugate wherein the truncated DT maintains its catalytic and translocation but not its cell binding domain.

DTIL 3 was constructed by fusing the gene encoding the catalytic and translocation domains of DT amino acids 1 388 via a Met His linker with human IL 3. See e.g. Frankel et al. Diphtheria toxin fused to human interleukin 3 is toxic to blasts from patients with myeloid leukemias 14 576 585 2000 . DTIL 3 has been shown to be potently and selectively cytotoxic to IL 3R positive AML cell lines and primary leukemia cells derived from patients. See Frankel et al.

A diphtheria toxin interleukin 3 fusion protein is cytotoxic to primitive acute myeloid leukemia progenitors but spares normal progenitors 62 1730 1736 2002 . Additional studies found that high affinity variants of the DTIL 3 compound named DT388 IL3 K116W based on the mutation of a lysine at amino acid 116 to tryptophan and DT388IL3 125 133 based on a deletion of amino acids 125 133 in the IL3 domain had increased potency against leukemia cells See Hogge et al.

In one embodiment of the invention an IL 3 polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence which contains at least one conservative amino acid substitution but not more than 50 conservative amino acid substitutions even more preferably not more than 40 conservative amino acid substitutions still more preferably not more than 30 conservative amino acid substitutions and still even more preferably not more than 20 conservative amino acid substitutions relative to the native IL 3 amino acid sequence e.g. the native human IL 3 amino acid sequence which result in a silent change i.e. no change in activity. In another embodiment of the invention an IL 3 polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence which contains at least one conservative amino acid substitution but not more than 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 or 1 conservative amino acid substitutions relative to the native IL 3 amino acid sequence e.g. the native human IL 3 amino acid sequence which result in a silent change.

To improve or alter the characteristics of IL 3 polypeptides protein engineering may be employed. Recombinant DNA technology known to those skilled in the art can be used to create novel mutant proteins or muteins including single or multiple amino acid substitutions deletions additions or fusion proteins. Such modified polypeptides can show e.g. enhanced activity potency affinity and or increased stability. In addition these may be purified in higher yields and show better solubility than the corresponding natural polypeptide for example under certain purification and storage conditions. For instance for many proteins it is known in the art that one or more amino acids may be deleted from the N terminus or C terminus without substantial loss of biological function.

The conjugates of the present invention can be made by standard recombinant DNA techniques or by protein synthetic techniques e.g. by use of a peptide synthesizer. For example a nucleic acid molecule encoding a conjugate of the invention can be synthesized by conventional techniques including automated DNA synthesizers. Alternatively PCR amplification of gene fragments can be carried out using anchor primers which give rise to complementary overhangs between two consecutive gene fragments which can subsequently be annealed and reamplified to generate a chimeric gene sequence see e.g. Ausubel et al. eds. John Wiley Sons 1992 .

The nucleotide sequences encoding a conjugate of the invention IL 3 and diphtheria toxin sequences may be obtained from any information available to those of skill in the art i.e. from Genbank the literature or by routine cloning . The nucleotide sequence coding for a conjugate can be inserted into an appropriate expression vector i.e. a vector which contains the necessary elements for the transcription and translation of the inserted protein coding sequence. In some instances the diphtheria toxin sequence can be truncated in order to remove a specific domain such as the targeting domain. The techniques for modifying or truncating DNA are well known to those of skill in the art of molecular biology. Also the IL 3 and the diphtheria toxin sequences can be ligated in such a way as to generate a DNA sequence that when translating creates a polypeptide that is a compound of the invention. In preferred examples a linker sequence is introduced into the recombinant sequence that links the IL 3 sequence and the diphtheria toxin sequence. A variety of host vector systems may be utilized in the present invention to express the protein coding sequence. These include but are not limited to mammalian cell systems infected with virus e.g. vaccinia virus adenovirus etc. insect cell systems infected with virus e.g. baculovirus microorganisms such as yeast e.g. containing yeast vectors or bacteria such as transformed with bacteriophage DNA plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA.

In a specific embodiment the expression of a conjugate of the invention is regulated by a constitutive promoter. In another embodiment the expression is regulated by an inducible promoter. In another embodiment the expression is regulated by a tissue specific promoter.

In a specific embodiment a vector is used that comprises a promoter operably linked to a conjugate encoding nucleic acid one or more origins of replication and optionally one or more selectable markers e.g. an antibiotic resistance gene .

In mammalian host cells a number of viral based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector the polypeptide or fusion protein coding sequence may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription translation control complex e.g. the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non essential region of the viral genome e.g. region E1 or E3 will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the antibody molecule in infected hosts e.g. see Logan Shenk 1984 81 355 359 . Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted fusion protein coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements transcription terminators etc. see Bittner et al. 1987153 51 544 .

Expression vectors containing inserts of a gene encoding a conjugate can be identified by three general approaches a nucleic acid hybridization b presence or absence of marker gene functions and c expression of inserted sequences. In the first approach the presence of a gene encoding a conjugate in an expression vector can be detected by nucleic acid hybridization using probes comprising sequences that are homologous to an inserted gene encoding the conjugate. In the second approach the recombinant vector host system can be identified and selected based upon the presence or absence of certain marker gene functions e.g. thymidine kinase activity resistance to antibiotics transformation phenotype occlusion body formation in baculovirus etc. caused by the insertion of a nucleotide sequence encoding a conjugate in the vector. For example if the nucleotide sequence encoding the conjugate is inserted within the marker gene sequence of the vector recombinants containing the gene encoding the conjugate insert can be identified by the absence of the marker gene function. In the third approach recombinant expression vectors can be identified by assaying the gene product e.g. conjugate expressed by the recombinant. Such assays can be based for example on the physical or functional properties of the conjugate in in vitro assay systems e.g. binding to an antibody or the IL 3 receptor.

In addition a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Expression from certain promoters can be elevated in the presence of certain inducers thus expression of the genetically engineered fusion proteins or conjugates may be controlled. Furthermore different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the translational and post translational processing and modification e.g. glycosylation phosphorylation of proteins . Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the desired modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. For example expression in a bacterial system will produce an unglycosylated product and expression in yeast will produce a glycosylated product. Eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript glycosylation and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO VERY BHK HeLa COS MDCK 293 3T3 WI38 NS0 and in particular neuronal cell lines such as for example SK N AS SK N FI SK N DZ human neuroblastomas Sugimoto et al. 1984 73 51 57 SK N SH human neuroblastoma 1982 704 450 460 Daoy human cerebellar medulloblastoma He et al. 1992 52 1144 1148 DBTRG 05MG glioblastoma cells Kruse et al. 1992 In 28A 609 614 IMR 32 human neuroblastoma 1970 30 2110 2118 1321N1 human astrocytoma 1977 74 4816 MOG G CCM human astrocytoma 1984 49 269 U87MG human glioblastoma astrocytoma 1968 74 465 486 A172 human glioblastoma Olopade et al. 199252 2523 2529 C6 rat glioma cells Benda et al. 1968161 370 371 Neuro 2a mouse neuroblastoma 1970 65 129 136 NB41A3 mouse neuroblastoma 1962 48 1184 1190 SCP sheep choroid plexus Bolin et al. 199448 211 221 G355 5 PG 4 Cat normal astrocyte Haapala et al. 198553 827 833 Mpf ferret brain Trowbridge et al. 198218 952 960 and normal cell lines such as for example CTX TNA2 rat normal cortex brain Radany et al. 199289 6467 6471 such as for example CRL7030 and Hs578Bst. Furthermore different vector host expression systems may effect processing reactions to different extents.

For long term high yield production of recombinant conjugates stable expression is preferred. For example cell lines which stably express the conjugate of the invention may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements e.g. promoter enhancer sequences transcription terminators polyadenylation sites etc. and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1 2 days in an enriched medium and then are switched to a selective medium. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express a conjugate of the invention.

A number of selection systems may be used including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase Wigler et al. 197711 223 hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase Szybalska Szybalski 196248 2026 and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase Lowy et al. 198022 817 genes can be employed in tk hgprt or aprt cells respectively. Also antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for dhfr which confers resistance to methotrexate Wigler et al. 198077 3567 O Hare et al. 198178 1527 gpt which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid Mulligan Berg 198178 2072 neo which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G 418 Colberre Garapin et al. 1981150 1 and hygro which confers resistance to hygromycin Santerre et al. 198430 147 .

Once a conjugate of the invention has been produced by recombinant expression or by chemical synthesis it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of a protein for example by chromatography e.g. ion exchange affinity particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A and sizing column chromatography centrifugation differential solubility or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins.

In a preferred embodiment the conjugates of the invention are formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to animals particularly human beings. Typically the carriers or vehicles for intravenous administration are sterile isotonic aqueous buffer solutions. Where necessary the compositions can also include a solubilizing agent. Compositions for intravenous administration can optionally comprise a local anaesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection.

Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving complex are also suitable for orally administered compositions of the invention. In these later platforms fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving complex which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations.

The compositions can consist of gaseous dosage units e.g. it can be in the form of an aerosol. The term aerosol is used to denote a variety of systems ranging from those of colloidal nature to systems consisting of pressurized packages. Delivery can be by a liquefied or compressed gas or by a suitable pump system that dispenses the active ingredients. Aerosols of the compositions can be delivered in single phase bi phasic or tri phasic systems in order to deliver the composition. Delivery of the aerosol includes the necessary container activators valves subcontainers spacers and the like which together can form a kit. Preferred aerosols can be determined by one skilled in the art without undue experimentation.

While not being bound by any specific theory Applicants believe that by the administration of the prophylactically and or therapeutically effective regimens the cancer stem cell population of a cancer tumor is stabilized or reduced so as to limit or prevent the potential repopulation of the tumor.

In certain embodiments of these aspects the regimens comprise administering a prophylactically effective regimen and or a therapeutically effective regimen wherein the regimen results in a reduction in the cancer stem cell population in the patient. In one embodiment the patient undergoing the regimen is monitored to determine whether the regimen has resulted in a reduction in the cancer stem cell population in the patient.

Typically the monitoring of the amount of cancer stem cells is conducted by detecting the amount of cancer stem cells in a specimen extracted from the patient. Methods of detecting the amount of cancer stem cells in a specimen are described infra in Section 5.4. This monitoring step is typically performed at least 1 2 4 6 7 8 10 12 14 15 16 18 20 or 30 60 90 120 days 6 months 9 months 12 months or 12 months after the patient begins receiving the regimen.

In some embodiments the specimen may be a blood specimen wherein the amount of cancer stem cells per unit of volume e.g. 1 ml or other measured unit e.g. per unit field in the case of a histological analysis is quantitated. In certain embodiments the amount of cancer stem cells is determined as a portion e.g. a percentage of the cancer cells present in the blood specimen as a subset of the cancer cells present in the blood specimen or as a subset of a subset of the cancer cells present in the blood specimen. The amount of cancer stem cells in other embodiments can be determined as a percentage of the total blood cells.

In other embodiments the specimen extracted from the patient is a tissue specimen e.g. a biopsy extracted from suspected cancerous tissue where the amount of cancer stem cells can be measured for example on the basis of the amount of cancer stem cells per unit weight of the tissue. In certain embodiments the amount of cancer stem cells is determined as a portion e.g. a percentage of the cancer cells present in the tissue as a subset of the cancer cells present in the tissue or as a subset of a subset of the cancer cells present in the tissue.

The amount of cancer stem cells in the extracted specimen can be compared with the amount of cancer stem cells measured in reference samples to assess the efficacy of the regimen and the amelioration of the cancer under therapy. In one embodiment the reference sample is a specimen extracted from the patient undergoing therapy wherein the specimen is extracted from the patient at an earlier time point e.g. prior to receiving the regimen as a baseline reference sample or at an earlier time point while receiving the therapy . In another embodiment the reference sample is extracted from a healthy noncancer afflicted patient.

In other embodiments the amount of cancer stem cells in the extracted specimen can be compared with a predetermined reference range. In a specific embodiment the predetermined reference range is based on i the amount of cancer stem cells obtained from a population s of patients suffering from the same type of cancer as the patient undergoing the therapy or ii the amount of stem cells obtained from a population s of patients without cancer.

If the reduction in the amount of cancer stem cells is determined to be too small upon comparing the amount of cancer stem cells in the specimen extracted from the patient undergoing the regimen with the reference specimen then the medical practitioner has a number of options to adjust the regimen. For instance the medical practitioner can then increase either the dosage of the compound or composition of the invention administered the frequency of the administration the duration of administration or any combination thereof. In a specific embodiment after the determination is made a second effective amount of a compound or composition of the invention can be administered to the patient.

In certain embodiments if the reduction in the amount of cancer stem cells is determined to be acceptable upon comparing the amount of cancer stem cells in the sample obtained from the patient undergoing the therapeutic or prophylactic regimen with the reference sample then the medical practitioner may elect not to adjust the regimen. For instance the medical practitioner may elect not to increase either the dosage of the compound or composition of the invention being administered the frequency of the administration the duration of administration or any combination thereof. Further the medical practitioner may elect to add additional therapies or combine therapies.

In other embodiments the regimens comprise administering a prophylactically effective regimen and or a therapeutically effective regimen wherein the regimen results in a reduction in the amount of cancer cells in the patient. In one embodiment the patient undergoing the regimen is monitored to determine whether the regimen has resulted in a reduction in the amount of cancer cells in the patient.

Typically the monitoring of the amount of cancer cells is conducted by detecting the amount of cancer cells in a specimen extracted from the patient. Methods of detecting the amount of cancer cells in a specimen are described infra in Section 5.5. This monitoring step is typically performed at least 1 2 4 6 7 8 10 12 14 15 16 18 20 or 30 60 90 120 days 6 months 9 months 12 months or 12 months after the patient begins receiving the regimen.

In some embodiments the specimen may be a blood specimen wherein the amount of cancer cells per unit of volume e.g. 1 ml or other measured unit e.g. per unit field in the case of a histological analysis is quantitated. The cancer cell population in certain embodiments can be determined as a percentage of the total blood cells.

In some embodiments the sample obtained from the patient may be a bone marrow specimen wherein the amount of cancer cells per unit of volume e.g. 1 ml or other measured unit e.g. per unit field in the case of a histological analysis is quantitated. The cancer cell population in certain embodiments can be determined as a percentage of the total bone marrow cells.

In other embodiments the specimen extracted from the patient is a tissue specimen e.g. a biopsy extracted from suspected cancerous tissue where the amount of cancer cells can be measured for example on the basis of the amount of cancer cells per unit weight of the tissue. The amount of cancer cells can also be measured using immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry.

The amount of cancer cells in the extracted specimen can be compared with the amount of cancer cells measured in reference samples to assess the efficacy of the regimen and amelioration of the cancer under therapy. In one embodiment the reference sample is a specimen extracted from the patient undergoing therapy wherein the specimen from the patient is extracted at an earlier time point e.g. prior to receiving the regimen as a baseline reference sample or at an earlier time point while receiving the therapy . In another embodiment the reference sample is extracted from a healthy noncancer afflicted patient.

In other embodiments the cancer cell population in the extracted specimen can be compared with a predetermined reference range. In a specific embodiment the predetermined reference range is based on the amount of cancer cells obtained from a population s of patients suffering from the same type of cancer as the patient undergoing the therapy.

If the reduction in the cancer cell population is judged too small upon comparing the amount of cancer cells in the specimen extracted from the patients undergoing therapy with the reference specimen then the medical practitioner has a number of options to adjust the therapeutic regimen. For instance the medical practitioner can then either increase the dosage of the compound or composition of the invention administered the frequency of the administration the duration of administration or any combination thereof. In a specific embodiment after the determination is made a second effective amount of a compound or composition of the invention can be administered to the patient.

If the reduction in the cancer cell population is judged to be adequate upon comparing the amount of cancer cells in the specimen extracted from the patients undergoing therapy with the reference specimen then the medical practitioner may elect not to adjust the therapeutic regimen. For instance the medical practitioner may elect not to increase the dosage of the compound or composition of the invention administered the frequency of the administration the duration of administration or any combination thereof.

The above monitoring methods can also be used to monitor the amount of interleukin 3 receptor expressing cells where the disease or disorder is not a cancer i.e. in allergic disease or autoimmune disease.

In embodiments the medical practitioner may elect to measure the cancer population using in vivo imaging techniques. For example a ligand for a tumor marker can be conjugated to a radioisotope photon emitting compound or other signal emitting compound and then the ligand can be injected into the patient. The cancer cells can then be quantitated by measuring the signal generated when the ligand binds to the cancer cells in vivo.

In some embodiments the titer of anti DT antibodies in a patient is measured prior to administration of a conjugate of the invention. The pretreatment anti DT antibody titer may be considered in determining the eligibility of a patient to receive a conjugate of the invention or the prophylactically and or therapeutically effective regimen administered to the patient. For example a patient s anti DT antibody titer may suggest administering a conjugate of the invention at a particular dosage at a particular frequency and or for a certain period of time.

In some embodiments the prophylactically and or therapeutically effective regimen comprises administration of a conjugate of the invention in combination with one or more additional cancer therapeutics. See Section 5.3.2. Preferably the dosages of the one or more additional cancer therapeutics used in the combination therapy is lower than those which have been or are currently being used to prevent treat and or manage cancer. The recommended dosages of the one or more additional cancer therapeutics currently used for the prevention treatment and or management of cancer can be obtained from any reference in the art including but not limited to Hardman et al. eds. 10. Mc craw Hill New York 2001 Physician s Desk Reference 60ed. 2006 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The conjugate of the invention and the one or more additional cancer therapeutics can be administered separately simultaneously or sequentially. In various embodiments the compound of the invention and the additional cancer therapeutic are administered less than 5 minutes apart less than 30 minutes apart less than 1 hour apart at about 1 hour apart at about 1 to about 2 hours apart at about 2 hours to about 3 hours apart at about 3 hours to about 4 hours apart at about 4 hours to about 5 hours apart at about 5 hours to about 6 hours apart at about 6 hours to about 7 hours apart at about 7 hours to about 8 hours apart at about 8 hours to about 9 hours apart at about 9 hours to about 10 hours apart at about 10 hours to about 11 hours apart at about 11 hours to about 12 hours apart at about 12 hours to 18 hours apart 18 hours to 24 hours apart 24 hours to 36 hours apart 36 hours to 48 hours apart 48 hours to 52 hours apart 52 hours to 60 hours apart 60 hours to 72 hours apart 72 hours to 84 hours apart 84 hours to 96 hours apart or 96 hours to 120 hours part. In preferred embodiments two or more cancer therapeutics are administered within the same patient visit.

In certain embodiments the conjugate of the invention and the additional cancer therapeutic are cyclically administered. Cycling therapy involves the administration of one cancer therapeutic for a period of time followed by the administration of a second cancer therapeutic for a period of time and repeating this sequential administration i.e. the cycle in order to reduce the development of resistance to one or both of the cancer therapeutics to avoid or reduce the side effects of one or both of the cancer therapeutics and or to improve the efficacy of the therapies.

In a preferred embodiment the cancer therapeutics are administered concurrently to a subject in separate compositions. The combination cancer therapeutics of the invention may be administered to a subject by the same or different routes of administration.

In a specific embodiment cycling therapy involves the administration of a first cancer therapeutic for a period of time followed by the administration of a second cancer therapeutic for a period of time optionally followed by the administration of a third cancer therapeutic for a period of time and so forth and repeating this sequential administration i.e. the cycle in order to reduce the development of resistance to one of the cancer therapeutics to avoid or reduce the side effects of one of the cancer therapeutics and or to improve the efficacy of the cancer therapeutics.

When a conjugate of the invention and the additional cancer therapeutic are administered to a subject concurrently the term concurrently is not limited to the administration of the cancer therapeutics at exactly the same time but rather it is meant that they are administered to a subject in a sequence and within a time interval such that they can act together e.g. synergistically to provide an increased benefit than if they were administered otherwise . For example the cancer therapeutics may be administered at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in time however if not administered at the same time they should be administered sufficiently close in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic effect preferably in a synergistic fashion. The combination cancer therapeutics of the invention can be administered separately in any appropriate form and by any suitable route. When the components of the combination cancer therapeutics are not administered in the same pharmaceutical composition it is understood that they can be administered in any order to a subject in need thereof. For example a conjugate of the invention can be administered prior to e.g. 5 minutes 15 minutes 30 minutes 45 minutes 1 hour 2 hours 4 hours 6 hours 12 hours 24 hours 48 hours 72 hours 96 hours 1 week 2 weeks 3 weeks 4 weeks 5 weeks 6 weeks 8 weeks or 12 weeks before concomitantly with or subsequent to e.g. 5 minutes 15 minutes 30 minutes 45 minutes 1 hour 2 hours 4 hours 6 hours 12 hours 24 hours 48 hours 72 hours 96 hours 1 week 2 weeks 3 weeks 4 weeks 5 weeks 6 weeks 8 weeks or 12 weeks after the administration of the additional cancer therapeutic to a subject in need thereof.

In certain embodiments the disease or disorder is not a hematologic cancer. In other embodiments the disease or disorder is an allergic disease or disorder. In other embodiments the disease or disorder is an inflammatory disease or disorder. In another embodiment the disease or disorder is one characterized as affecting plasmacytoid dendritic cells e.g. dentritic cell cancers such as NK blastic leukemia and CD4CD56 dermatologic neoplasm . In certain embodiments the subjects have acute myelogenous leukemia AML . In certain other embodiments the subjects have myelodysplastic syndrome MDS . In other embodiments the subjects have chronic myelomonocytic leukemia CMML CML ALL hairy cell leukemia Hodgkin s disease or non Hodgkin s lymphoma.

The present invention encompasses methods for preventing treating managing and or ameliorating an inflammatory disorder or one or more symptoms thereof as an alternative to other conventional therapies. In specific embodiments the patient being managed or treated in accordance with the methods of the invention is refractory to other therapies or is susceptible to adverse reactions from such therapies. The patient may be a person with a suppressed immune system e.g. post operative patients chemotherapy patients and patients with immunodeficiency disease patients with broncho pulmonary dysplasia patients with congenital heart disease patients with cystic fibrosis patients with acquired or congenital heart disease and patients suffering from an infection a person with impaired renal or liver function the elderly children infants infants born prematurely persons with neuropsychiatric disorders or those who take psychotropic drugs persons with histories of seizures or persons on medication that would negatively interact with conventional agents used to prevent manage treat or ameliorate a viral respiratory infection or one or more symptoms thereof.

In an embodiment of the invention diseases that are characterized by plasmacytoid dendritic cells which cells demonstrate high expression of the alpha chain of the IL 3 receptor are targeted. Such diseases include but are not limited to HIV herpes CMV autoimmune diseases and cancers including but not limited to NK blastic lymphoma dendritic cell cancer including plasmacytoid dendritic cell cancer and dermatologic neoplasms.

In certain embodiments the invention provides a method of preventing treating managing and or ameliorating an autoimmune disorder or one or more symptoms thereof said method comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a dose of an effective amount of one or more pharmaceutical compositions of the invention wherein the cells involved in such disorders express the interleukin 3 receptor beta subunit. In autoimmune disorders the immune system triggers an immune response and the body s normally protective immune system causes damage to its own tissues by mistakenly attacking self. There are many different autoimmune disorders which affect the body in different ways. For example the brain is affected in individuals with multiple sclerosis the gut is affected in individuals with Crohn s disease and the synovium bone and cartilage of various joints are affected in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. As autoimmune disorders progress destruction of one or more types of body tissues abnormal growth of an organ or changes in organ function may result. The autoimmune disorder may affect only one organ or tissue type or may affect multiple organs and tissues. Organs and tissues commonly affected by autoimmune disorders include red blood cells blood vessels connective tissues endocrine glands e.g. the thyroid or pancreas muscles joints and skin.

Examples of autoimmune disorders that can be prevented treated managed and or ameliorated by the methods of the invention include but are not limited to adrenergic drug resistance alopecia greata ankylosing spondylitis antiphospholipid syndrome autoimmune Addison s disease autoimmune diseases of the adrenal gland allergic encephalomyelitis autoimmune hemolytic anemia autoimmune hepatitis autoimmune inflammatory eye disease autoimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia autoimmune neutropenia autoimmune oophoritis and orchitis autoimmune thrombocytopenia autoimmune thyroiditis Behcet s disease bullous pemphigoid cardiomyopathy cardiotomy syndrome celiac sprue dermatitis chronic active hepatitis chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome CFIDS chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy Churg Strauss syndrome cicatrical pemphigoid CREST syndrome cold agglutinin disease Crohn s disease dense deposit disease discoid lupus essential mixed cryoglobulinemia fibromyalgia fibromyositis glomerulonephritis e.g. IgA nephrophathy gluten sensitive enteropathy Goodpasture s syndrome Graves disease Guillain Barre hyperthyroidism i.e. Hashimoto s thyroiditis idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis idiopathic Addison s disease idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura ITP IgA neuropathy juvenile arthritis lichen planus lupus erythematosus M ni re s disease mixed connective tissue disease multiple sclerosis Myasthenia Gravis myocarditis type 1 or immune mediated diabetes mellitus neuritis other endocrine gland failure pemphigus vulgaris pernicious anemia polyarteritis nodosa polychrondritis Polyendocrinopathies polyglandular syndromes polymyalgia rheumatica polymyositis and dermatomyositis post MI primary agammaglobulinemia primary biliary cirrhosis psoriasis psoriatic arthritis Raynauld s phenomenon relapsing polychondritis Reiter s syndrome rheumatic heart disease rheumatoid arthritis sarcoidosis scleroderma Sj gren s syndrome stiff man syndrome systemic lupus erythematosus takayasu arteritis temporal arteritis giant cell arteritis ulcerative colitis urticaria uveitis Uveitis Opthalmia vasculitides such as dermatitis herpetiformis vasculitis vitiligo and Wegener s granulomatosis.

In certain embodiments the invention provides a method of preventing treating managing and or ameliorating one or more allergic diseases or allergies or one or more symptoms thereof wherein the cells involved in such diseases or allergies express the interleukin 3 receptor beta subunit said method comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a dose of an effective amount of one or more pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Immune mediated allergic hypersensitivity reactions are classified into four types I IV according to the underlying mechanisms leading to the manifestation of the allergic symptoms. Type I allergic reactions are immediate hypersensitivity reactions characterized by IgE mediated release of vasoactive substances such as histamine from mast cells and basophils. Over hours the mast cells and basophils release proinflammatory cytokines producing vasodilation increased capillary permeability glandular hypersecretion smooth muscle spasm and tissue infiltration with eosinophils and other inflammatory cells.

Type II allergic reactions are cytotoxic hypersensitivity reactions and involve IgG or IgM antibodies bound to cell surface antigens with subsequent complement fixation. Certain cytotoxic cells such as killer T cells or macrophages are activated bind to cells coated with IgG and destroy the target cells. Type II reactions may result in cytolysis or tissue damage.

Type III reactions are immune complex reactions resulting from deposits of circulating antigen antibody immune complexes in blood vessels or tissues. Acute inflammation results from the immune complex initiating a sequence of events that results in polymorphonuclear cell migration and release of lysosomal proteolytic enzymes and permeability factors in tissues.

Type IV reactions are delayed hypersensitivity reactions caused by sensitized T lymphocytes after contact with a specific antigen. Activated sensitized T lymphocytes cause immunologic injury by direct toxic effect or through release of lymphokines and other soluble substances. The activated T lymphocytes may also release cytokines that affect the activity of macrophages neutrophils and lymphoid killer cells.

Allergic reactions can be immediate late phase or chronic. Continuous or chronic exposure to an allergen can result in chronic allergic inflammation. Tissues of sites of chronic inflammation contain eosinophils and T cells that release mediators that can cause tissue damage increased inflammation and increased sensitivity.

Currently allergic reactions are treated with drugs such as antihistamines corticosteroids vasodilators bronchodilators leukotriene inhibitors and immunomodulators which attempt to alleviate the symptoms associated with the allergic reaction.

In some embodiments the amount of cancer stem cells in a subject is determined using a technique well known to one of skill in the art or described in Section 5.7 below.

In accordance with the invention cancer stem cells comprise a unique subpopulation often 0.1 10 or so of a tumor that in contrast to the remaining 90 or so of the tumor i.e. the tumor bulk are relatively more tumorigenic and relatively more slow growing or quiescent. Given that conventional therapies and regimens have in large part been designed to attack rapidly proliferating cells i.e. those cancer cells that comprise the tumor bulk slower growing cancer stem cells may be relatively more resistant than faster growing tumor bulk to conventional therapies and regimens. This would explain another reason for the failure of standard oncology treatment regimens to ensure long term benefit in most patients with advanced stage cancers. In a specific embodiment a cancer stem cell s is the founder cell of a tumor i.e. it is the progenitor of cancer cells . In some embodiments a cancer stem cell s has one two three or more or all of the following characteristics or properties i can harbor the ability to initiate a tumor and or to perpetuate tumor growth ii can be generally relatively less mutated than the bulk of a tumor e.g. due to slower growth and thus fewer DNA replication dependent errors improved DNA repair and or epigenetic non mutagenic changes contributing to their malignancy iii can have many features of a normal stem cell s e.g. similar cell surface antigen and or intracellular expression profile self renewal programs multi drug resistance an immature phenotype etc. characteristic of normal stem cells and may be derived from a normal stem cell s iv can be potentially responsive to its microenvironment e.g. the cancer stem cells may be capable of being induced to differentiate and or divide asymmetrically v can be the source of metastases vi can be slow growing or quiescent vii can be symmetrically dividing viii can be tumorigenic e.g. as determined by NOD SCID implantation experiments ix can be relatively resistant to traditional therapies i.e. chemoresistant and x can comprise a subpopulation of a tumor e.g. relative to the tumor bulk .

In other embodiments the amount of cancer stem cells in a sample from a subject is determined assessed using a technique described herein or well known to one of skill in the art.

The amount of sample to be collected will vary with the particular type of sample and method of determining the amount of cancer stem cells used and will be an amount sufficient to detect the cancer stem cells in the sample.

A sample of blood may be obtained from a patient having different developmental or disease stages. Blood may be drawn from a subject from any part of the body e.g. a finger a hand a wrist an arm a leg a foot an ankle a stomach and a neck using techniques known to one of skill in the art in particular methods of phlebotomy known in the art. In a specific embodiment venous blood is obtained from a subject and utilized in accordance with the methods of the invention. In another embodiment arterial blood is obtained and utilized in accordance with the methods of the invention. The composition of venous blood varies according to the metabolic needs of the area of the body it is servicing. In contrast the composition of arterial blood is consistent throughout the body. For routine blood tests venous blood is generally used.

The amount of blood collected will vary depending upon the site of collection the amount required for a method of the invention and the comfort of the subject. In some embodiments any amount of blood is collected that is sufficient to detect the amount or amount of cancer stem cells. In a specific embodiment 1 cc or more of blood is collected from a subject.

The amount of cancer stem cells in a sample can be expressed as the percentage of e.g. overall cells overall cancer cells or overall stem cells in the sample or quantitated relative to area e.g. cells per high power field or volume e.g. cells per ml or architecture e.g. cells per bone spicule in a bone marrow specimen .

In some embodiments the sample may be a blood sample bone marrow sample or a tissue tumor biopsy sample wherein the amount of cancer stem cells per unit of volume e.g. 1 ml or other measured unit e.g. per unit field in the case of a histological analysis is quantitated. In certain embodiments the cancer stem cell population is determined as a portion e.g. a percentage of the cancerous cells present in the blood or bone marrow or tissue tumor biopsy sample or as a subset of the cancerous cells present in the blood or bone marrow or tissue tumor biopsy sample. The cancer stem cell population in other embodiments can be determined as a portion e.g. percentage of the total cells. In yet other embodiments the cancer stem cell population is determined as a portion e.g. a percentage of the total stem cells present in the blood sample.

In other embodiments the sample from the patient is a tissue sample e.g. a biopsy from a subject with or suspected of having cancerous tissue where the amount of cancer stem cells can be measured for example by immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry or on the basis of the amount of cancer stem cells per unit area volume or weight of the tissue. In certain embodiments the cancer stem cell population is determined as a portion e.g. a percentage of the cancerous cells present in the tissue sample or as a subset of the cancerous cells present in the tissue sample. In yet other embodiments the cancerous stem cell population is determined as a portion e.g. a percentage of the overall cells or stem cells in the tissue sample.

The amount of cancer stem cells in a test sample can be compared with the amount of cancer stem cells in a reference sample s to assess the efficacy of the regimen. In one embodiment the reference sample is a sample obtained from the subject undergoing therapy at an earlier time point e.g. prior to receiving the regimen as a baseline reference sample or at an earlier time point while receiving the therapy . In this embodiment the therapy desirably results in a decrease in the amount of cancer stem cells in the test sample as compared with the reference sample. In another embodiment the reference sample is obtained from a healthy subject that has no detectable cancer or from a patient that is in remission for the same type of cancer. In this embodiment the therapy desirably results in the test sample having an equal amount of cancer stem cells or less than the amount of cancer stem cells than are detected in the reference sample.

In other embodiments the cancer stem cell population in a test sample can be compared with a predetermined reference range and or a previously detected amount of cancer stem cells determined for the subject to gauge the subject s response to the regimens described herein. In a specific embodiment a stabilization or reduction in the amount of cancer stem cells relative to a predetermined reference range and or earlier previously detected cancer stem cell amount determined for the subject indicates an improvement in the subject s prognosis or a positive response to the regimen whereas an increase relative to the predetermined reference range and or earlier cancer stem cell amount indicates the same or worse prognosis and or a failure to respond to the regimen. The cancer stem cell amount can be used in conjunction with other measures to assess the prognosis of the subject and or the efficacy of the regimen. In a specific embodiment the predetermined reference range is based on the amount of cancer stem cells obtained from a patient or population s of patients suffering from the same type of cancer as the patient undergoing the therapy.

Generally since stem cell antigens can be present on both cancer stem cells and normal stem cells a sample from the cancer afflicted patient will have a higher stem cell count than a sample from a healthy subject with no detectable cancer due to the presence of the cancer stem cells. The therapy will desirably result in a cancer stem cell count for the test sample e.g. the sample from the patient undergoing therapy that decreases and becomes increasingly closer to the stem cell count in a reference sample that is a sample from a healthy subject with no detectable cancer by a conventional method.

If the reduction in amount of cancer stem cells is determined to be inadequate upon comparing the amount of cancer stem cells in the sample from the subject undergoing the regimen with the reference sample then the medical practitioner has a number of possible options to adjust the regimen. For instance the medical practitioner can then increase either the dosage or intensity of the therapy administered the frequency of the administration the duration of administration combine the therapy with another therapy ies change the management altogether including halting therapy or any combination thereof.

In certain embodiments the dosage frequency and or duration of administration of a therapy is modified as a result of the change in the amount of cancer stem cells detected in or from the treated patient. For example if a subject receiving therapy for leukemia has a cancer stem cell measurement of 2.5 of his tumor prior to therapy and 5 after 6 weeks of therapy then the therapy or regimen may be altered or stopped because the increase in the percentage of cancer stem cells indicates that the therapy or regimen is not optimal. Alternatively if another subject with leukemia has a cancer stem cell measurement of 2.5 of his tumor prior to therapy and 1 after 6 weeks of therapy then the therapy or regimen may be continued because the decrease in the percentage of cancer stem cells indicates that the therapy or regimen is effective.

The amount of cancer stem cells can be monitored assessed using standard techniques known to one of skill in the art. Cancer stem cells can be monitored by e.g. obtaining a sample such as a tissue tumor sample blood sample or a bone marrow sample from a subject and detecting cancer stem cells in the sample. The amount of cancer stem cells in a sample which may be expressed as percentages of e.g. overall cells or overall cancer cells can be assessed by detecting the expression of antigens on cancer stem cells. Techniques known to those skilled in the art can be used for measuring these activities. Antigen expression can be assayed for example by immunoassays including but not limited to western blots immunohistochemistry radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays precipitin reactions gel diffusion precipitin reactions immunodiffusion assays agglutination assays complement fixation assays immunoradiometric assays fluorescent immunoassays immunofluorescence protein A immunoassays flow cytometry and FACS analysis. In such circumstances the amount of cancer stem cells in a test sample from a subject may be determined by comparing the results to the amount of stem cells in a reference sample e.g. a sample from a subject who has no detectable cancer or to a predetermined reference range or to the patient him herself at an earlier time point e.g. prior to or during therapy .

In a specific embodiment the cancer stem cell population in a sample from a patient is determined by flow cytometry. This method exploits the differential expression of certain surface markers on cancer stem cells relative to the bulk of the tumor. Labeled antibodies e.g. fluorescent antibodies can be used to react with the cells in the sample and the cells are subsequently sorted by FACS methods. In some embodiments a combination of cell surface markers are utilized in order to determine the amount of cancer stem cells in the sample. For example both positive and negative cell sorting may be used to assess the amount of cancer stem cells in the sample. Cancer stem cells for specific tumor types can be determined by assessing the expression of markers on cancer stem cells. In certain embodiments the tumors harbor cancer stem cells and their associated markers as set forth in Table 2 below which provides a non limiting list of cancer stem cell phenotypes associated with various types of cancer.

Additional cancer stem cell markers include but are not limited to CD123 CLL 1 combinations of SLAMs signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family receptors see Yilmaz et al. SLAM family markers are conserved among hematopoietic stem cells from old and reconstituted mice and markedly increase their purity 107 924 930 2006 such as CD150 CD244 and CD48 and those markers disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 004 528 to Bergstein in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 468 286 and in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2006 0083682 2007 0036800 2007 0036801 2007 0036802 2007 0041984 2007 0036803 and 2007 0036804 each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. See e.g. Table 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 6 004 528 and Tables 1 2 and 3 of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 468 286 and U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2006 0083682 2007 0036800 2007 0036801 2007 0036802 2007 0041984 2007 0036803 and 2007 0036804.

In a specific embodiment the cancer stem population in a sample e.g. a tissue sample such as a solid tumor biopsy is determined using immunohistochemistry techniques. This method exploits the differential expression of certain surface markers on cancer stem cells relative to the bulk of the tumor. Labeled antibodies e.g. fluorescent antibodies can be used to react with the cells in the sample and the tissue is subsequently stained. In some embodiments a combination of certain cell surface markers are utilized in order to determine the amount of cancer stem cells in the sample. Cancer stem cells for specific tumor types can be determined by assessing the expression of certain markers that are specific to cancer stem cells. In certain embodiments the tumors harbor cancer stem cells and their associated markers as set forth in Table 2 above.

Suitable cancer stem cell antigens may be identified i through publicly available information such as published and unpublished expression profiles including cell surface antigens of cancer stem cells of a particular tumor type or adult stem cells for a particular tissue type e.g. Table 2 and or ii by cloning cancer stem cells or adult stem cells of a particular tumor or tissue type respectively in order to determine their expression profiles and complement of cell surface antigens. Cloning of normal stem cells is a technique routinely employed in the art Uchida et al. Heterogeneity of hematopoeitic stem cells 5 177 184 1993 . In fact this same technique is used to identify normal stem cells and cancer stem cells. Moreover assumption that a proportion of normal stem cell gene products e.g. cell surface antigens will also be present on cancer stem cells derived from the same tissue type has proven an effective way to identify cancer stem cell gene products and cancer stem cells. For example knowledge that the normal hematopoietic stem cell was CD34 CD38 resulted in the determination that acute myeloid leukemia AML stem cells is similarly CD34 CD38 . This indeed was confirmed by standard stem cell cloning techniques See Bonnet et al. Human acute myeloid leukemia is organized as a hierarchy that originates from a primitive hematopoietic cell 3 730 737 1997 . Brain cancer stem cells were similarly isolated using a marker of normal brain stem cells in this case CD133 See Singh et al. Identification of human brain tumor initiating cells 432 7015 396 401 2004 .

In certain embodiments using flow cytometry of a sample the Hoechst dye protocol can be used to identify cancer stem cells in tumors. Briefly two Hoechst dyes of different colors typically red and blue are incubated with tumor cells. The cancer stem cells in comparison with bulk cancer cells over express dye efflux pumps on their surface that allow these cells to pump the dye back out of the cell. Bulk tumor cells largely have fewer of these pumps and are therefore relatively positive for the dye which can be detected by flow cytometry. Typically a gradient of dye positive dye vs. dye negative dye cells emerges when the entire population of cells is observed. Cancer stem cells are contained in the dyeor dye low dye population. For an example of the use of the Hoechst dye protocol to characterize a stem cell population see Goodell et al. A leukemic stem cell with intrinsic drug efflux pump capacity in acute myeloid leukemia 98 4 1166 1173 2001 and Kondo et al. Persistence of a small population of cancer stem like cells in the C6 glioma cell line 101 781 786 2004 . In this way flow cytometry could be used to measure cancer stem cell amount pre and post therapy to assess the change in cancer stem cell amount arising from a given therapy or regimen.

In other embodiments using flow cytometry of a sample the cells in the sample may be treated with a substrate for aldehyde dehydrogenase that becomes fluorescent when catalyzed by this enzyme. For instance the sample can be treated with BODIPY aminoacetaldehyde which is commercially available from StemCell Technologies Inc. as Aldefluor . Cancer stem cells express high levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase relative to bulk cancer cells and therefore become brightly fluorescent upon reaction with the substrate. The cancer stem cells which become fluorescent in this type of experiment can then be detected and counted using a standard flow cytometer. In this way flow cytometry could be used to measure cancer stem cell amount pre and post therapy to assess the change in cancer stem cell amount arising from a given therapy or regimen.

In other embodiments a sample e.g. a tumor or normal tissue sample blood sample or bone marrow sample obtained from the patient is cultured in in vitro systems to assess the cancer stem cell population. For example tumor samples can be cultured on soft agar and the amount of cancer stem cells can be correlated to the ability of the sample to generate colonies of cells that can be visually counted. Colony formation is considered a surrogate measure of stem cell content and thus can be used to quantitate the amount of cancer stem cells. For instance with hematological cancers colony forming assays include colony forming cell CFC assays long term culture initiating cell LTC IC assays and suspension culture initiating cell SC IC assays. In this way the colony forming or related a assay such as long term perpetuation passage of a cell line could be used to measure cancer stem cell amount pre and post therapy to assess the change in cancer stem cell amount arising from a given therapy or regimen.

In other embodiments sphere formation is measured to determine the amount of cancer stem cells in a sample e.g. cancer stem cells form three dimensional clusters of cells called spheres in appropriate media that is conducive to forming spheres. Spheres can be quantitated to provide a measure of cancer stem cells. See Singh et al. Identification of a Cancer Stem Cell from Human Brain Tumors 63 5821 5828 2003 . Secondary spheres can also be measured. Secondary spheres are generated when the spheres that form from the patient sample are broken apart and then allowed to reform. In this way the sphere forming assay could be used to measure cancer stem cell amount pre and post therapy to assess the change in cancer stem cell amount arising from a given therapy or regimen.

In other embodiments the amount of cancer stem cells in a sample can be determined with a cobblestone assay. Cancer stem cells from certain hematological cancers form cobblestone areas CAs when added to a culture containing a monolayer of bone marrow stromal cells. For instance the amount of cancer stem cells from a leukemia sample can be assessed by this technique. The tumor samples are added to the monolayer of bone marrow stromal cells. The leukemia cancer stem cells more so than the bulk leukemia cells have the ability to migrate under the stromal layer and seed the formation of a colony of cells which can be seen visually under phase contrast microscopy in approximately 10 14 days as CAs. The number of CAs in the culture is a reflection of the leukemia cancer stem cell content of the tumor sample and is considered a surrogate measure of the amount of stem cells capable of engrafting the bone marrow of immunodeficient mice. This assay can also be modified so that the CAs can be quantitated using biochemical labels of proliferating cells instead of manual counting in order to increase the throughput of the assay. See Chung et al. Enforced expression of an Flt3 internal tandem duplication in human CD34 cells confers properties of self renewal and enhanced erythropoiesis 105 1 77 84 2005 . In this way the cobblestone assay could be used to measure cancer stem cell amount pre and post therapy to assess the change in cancer stem cell amount arising from a given therapy or regimen.

In other embodiments a sample e.g. a tumor or normal tissue sample blood sample or bone marrow sample obtained from the patient is analyzed in in vivo systems to determine the cancer stem cell population. In certain embodiments for example in vivo engraftment is used to quantitate the amount of cancer stem cells in a sample. In vivo engraftment involves implantation of a human specimen with the readout being the formation of tumors in an animal such as in immunocompromised or immunodeficient mice such as NOD SCID mice . Typically the patient sample is cultured or manipulated in vitro and then injected into the mice. In these assays mice can be injected with a decreasing amount of cells from patient samples and the frequency of tumor formation can be plotted vs. the amount of cells injected to determine the amount of cancer stem cells in the sample. Alternatively the rate of growth of the resulting tumor can be measured with larger or more rapidly advancing tumors indicating a higher cancer stem cell amount in the patient sample. In this way an in vivo engraftment model assay could be used to measure cancer stem cell amount pre and post therapy to assess the change in cancer stem cell amount arising from a given therapy or regimen.

The amount of cancer stem cells in a specimen can be compared to a predetermined reference range and or an earlier amount of cancer stem cells previously determined for the subject either prior to or during therapy in order to gauge the subject s response to the treatment regimens described herein. In a specific embodiment a stabilization or reduction in the amount of cancer stem cells relative to a predetermined reference range and or earlier cancer stem cell amount previously determined for the subject either prior to or during therapy indicates that the therapy or regimen was effective and thus possibly an improvement in the subject s prognosis whereas an increase relative to the predetermined reference range and or cancer stem cell amount detected at an earlier time point indicates that the therapy or regimen was ineffective and thus possibly the same or a worsening in the subject s prognosis. The cancer stem cell amount can be used with other standard measures of cancer to assess the prognosis of the subject and or efficacy of the therapy or regimen such as response rate durability of response relapse free survival disease free survival progression free survival and overall survival. In certain embodiments the dosage frequency and or duration of administration of a therapy is modified as a result of the determination of the amount of cancer stem cells at various time points which may include prior to during and or following therapy.

The present invention also relates to methods for determining that a cancer therapy or regimen is effective at targeting and or impairing cancer stem cells by virtue of monitoring cancer stem cells over time and detecting a stabilization or decrease in the amount of cancer stem cells during and or following the course of the cancer therapy or regimen.

In a certain embodiment a therapy or regimen may be described or marketed as an anti cancer stem cell therapy or regimen based on the determination that a therapy or regimen is effective at targeting and or impairing cancer stem cells by virtue of having monitored or detected a stabilization or decrease in the amount of cancer stem cells during therapy.

As part of the prophylactically and or therapeutically effective regimens of the invention the amount of cancer cells alone or in combination with the amount of cancer stem cells can be monitored assessed using standard techniques known to one of skill in the art. In certain embodiments of the prophylactically and or therapeutically effective regimens of the invention the regimens result in a stabilization or reduction in the amount expressed e.g. as a percentage of cancer cells in the subject. In one embodiment the subject undergoing the regimen is monitored to determine whether the regimen has resulted in a stabilization or reduction in the amount expressed e.g. as a percentage of cancer cells in the subject.

In some embodiments the amount of cancer cells is assessed in a subject using techniques described herein or known to one of skill in the art. In other embodiments the amount of cancer cells is detected in a sample. Such samples include but are not limited to biological samples and samples derived from a biological sample. In certain embodiments in addition to the biological sample itself or in addition to material derived from the biological sample such as cells the sample used in the methods of this invention comprises added water salts glycerin glucose an antimicrobial agent paraffin a chemical stabilizing agent heparin an anticoagulant or a buffering agent. In certain embodiments the biological sample is blood serum urine bone marrow or interstitial fluid. In another embodiment the sample is a tissue sample. In a particular embodiment the tissue sample is breast colon lung liver ovarian pancreatic prostate renal bone or skin tissue. In a specific embodiment the tissue sample is a biopsy including a tumor biopsy. The amount of biological sample taken from the subject will vary according to the type of biological sample and the method of detection to be employed. In a particular embodiment the biological sample is blood serum or urine and the amount of blood serum or urine taken from the subject is 0.1 ml 0.5 ml 1 ml 5 ml 10 ml or more. In another embodiment the biological sample is a tissue and the amount of tissue taken from the subject is less than 10 milligrams less than 25 milligrams less than 50 milligrams less than 1 gram less than 5 grams less than 10 grams less than 50 grams or less than 100 grams.

In accordance with the methods of the invention a sample derived from a biological sample is one in which the biological sample has been subjected to one or more pretreatment steps prior to the detection and or measurement of the cancer cell population in the sample. In certain embodiments a biological fluid is pretreated by centrifugation filtration precipitation dialysis or chromatography or by a combination of such pretreatment steps. In other embodiments a tissue sample is pretreated by freezing chemical fixation paraffin embedding dehydration permeablization or homogenization followed by centrifugation filtration precipitation dialysis or chromatography or by a combination of such pretreatment steps. In certain embodiments the sample is pretreated by removing cells other than cancer cells from the sample or removing debris from the sample prior to the determination of the amount of cancer cells in the sample according to the methods of the invention.

The samples for use in the methods of this invention may be taken from any animal subject preferably mammal most preferably a human. The subject from which a sample is obtained and utilized in accordance with the methods of this invention includes without limitation an asymptomatic subject a subject manifesting or exhibiting 1 2 3 4 or more symptoms of cancer a subject clinically diagnosed as having cancer a subject predisposed to cancer a subject suspected of having cancer a subject undergoing therapy for cancer a subject that has been medically determined to be free of cancer e.g. following therapy for the cancer a subject that is managing cancer or a subject that has not been diagnosed with cancer.

In certain embodiments the amount of cancer cells is assessed in a subject or a sample from a subject at least 1 2 4 6 7 8 10 12 14 15 16 18 20 or 30 60 90 days 6 months 9 months 12 months or 12 months after the subject begins receiving the regimen. In certain embodiments the amount of cancer cells is assessed after a number of doses e.g. after 1 2 5 10 20 30 or more doses of a therapy . In other embodiments the amount of cancer cells is assessed after 2 weeks 1 month 2 months 1 year 2 years 3 years 4 years or more after receiving one or more therapies.

The amount of cancer cells in a sample can be expressed as the percentage of e.g. overall cells in the sample. In some embodiments the sample is a blood sample or bone marrow sample wherein the amount of cancer cells per unit of volume e.g. 1 ml or other measured unit e.g. per unit field in the case of a histological analysis is quantitated. The cancer cell population in certain embodiments can be determined as a percentage of the total blood cells.

In other embodiments the sample from the patient is a tissue sample e.g. a biopsy from a subject with or suspected or having cancerous tissue where the amount of cancer cells can be measured for example by immunohistochemistry or on the basis of the amount of cancer cells per unit weight of the tissue.

The amount of cancer cells in the test sample can be compared with the amount of cancer cells measured in a reference sample s to assess the efficacy of the regimen. In one embodiment the reference sample is a sample from the subject undergoing therapy at an earlier time point e.g. prior to receiving the regimen as a baseline reference sample or at an earlier time point while receiving the therapy . In this embodiment the therapy desirably results in a decrease in the amount of cancer cells in the test sample as compared with the reference sample. In another embodiment the reference sample is obtained from a healthy subject with no detectable cancer or from a patient that is in remission for the same type of cancer. In this embodiment the therapy desirably results in the test sample having an equal amount of cancer cells as detected in the reference sample e.g. no detectable cancer cells .

If the reduction in the amount of cancer cells is judged too small then the medical practitioner has a number of options to adjust the regimen. For instance the medical practitioner can then either increase the dosage of the therapy administered the frequency of the administration the duration of administration combine the therapy with another therapy ies halt the therapy or any combination thereof.

The amount of cancer cells can be monitored assessed using standard techniques known to one of skill in the art. Cancer cells can be monitored by e.g. obtaining a sample such as a tumor sample blood sample or bone marrow sample from a subject and detecting cancer cells in the sample. The amount of cancer cells in a sample which may be expressed as a percentage can be assessed by detecting the expression of antigens on cancer cells and or by detecting the proliferation of cancer cells. Techniques known to those skilled in the art can be used for measuring these activities. For example cellular proliferation can be assayed by 3H thymidine incorporation assays and trypan blue cell counts. Antigen expression can be assayed for example by immunoassays including but not limited to western blots immunohistochemistry radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays precipitin reactions gel diffusion precipitin reactions immunodiffusion assays agglutination assays complement fixation assays immunoradiometric assays fluorescent immunoassays protein A immunoassays flow cytometry fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS analysis and immunofluorescence.

The amount of cancer cells can be compared to a predetermined reference range and or an earlier amount of cancer cells determined for the subject to gauge the subject s response to the regimens described herein. In a specific embodiment a reduction in the amount of cancer cells relative to a predetermined reference range and or earlier cancer cell amount determined for the subject indicate an improvement in the subject s prognosis or response to a therapy whereas an increase relative to the predetermined reference range and or earlier cancer cell amount indicates the same or worse prognosis or failure to respond to a therapy. In certain embodiments the dosage frequency and or duration of administration of a therapy is modified as a result of the change in the amount of cancer cells.

In some embodiments the cancer cell population can be monitored assessed using gross measurements of the cancer cell population. For example in some embodiments the cancer cell population is determined using imaging methods such as computed tomography CT magnetic resonance imaging MRI ultrasound X ray imaging mammography radionuclide imaging PET scan or bone scans.

In embodiments of the invention comprising treatment of solid tumors the bulk size of the tumor may provide an estimate of the cancer cell population. A number of known methods can be used to assess the bulk size of the tumor. Non limiting examples of such methods include imaging methods e.g. computed tomography CT magnetic resonance imaging MRI PET scans ultrasound X ray imaging mammography bone scans and radioisotope imaging visual methods e.g. colonoscopy bronchoscopy endoscopy physical examination e.g. prostate examination breast examination lymph nodes examination abdominal examination general palpation blood tests e.g. prostate specific antigen PSA test carcinoembryonic antigen CEA test cancer antigen CA 125 test alpha fetoprotein AFP bone marrow analyses e.g. in cases of hematological malignancies histopathology cytology and flow cytometry.

In some embodiments the bulk tumor size can be measured by assessments based on the size of tumor lesions determined from imaging methods. In specific embodiments the assessments are performed in accordance with the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors RECIST Guidelines which are set forth in Therasse P. et al. New Guidelines to Evaluate the Response to Treatment in Solid Tumors 92 3 205 216 2000 . For instance in specific embodiments lesions in the subject that are representative of bulk tumor size are selected so that they are at least 20 mm in their longest diameter at baseline prior to treatment when conventional imaging techniques are used e.g. conventional CT scan MRI or X ray and lesions that are at least 10 mm in their longest diameter at baseline should be selected when spiral CT scanning is used.

As part of the prophylactically and or therapeutically effective regimens of the invention peripheral blood lymphocyte counts can be monitered assessed using standard techniques known to one of skill in the art. Peripheral blood lymphocyte counts in a subject can be determined by e.g. obtaining a sample of peripheral blood from said subject separating the lymphocytes from other components of peripheral blood such as plasma using e.g. Ficoll Hypaque Pharmacia gradient centrifugation and counting the lymphocytes using trypan blue. Peripheral blood T cell counts in a subject can be determined by e.g. separating the lymphocytes from other components of peripheral blood such as plasma using e.g. Ficoll Hypaque Pharmacia gradient centrifugation. Labeling the T cells with an antibody directed to a T cell antigen such as CD3 CD4 and CD8 which is conjugated to a FACS detectable agent such as FITC or phycoerythrin and measuring the amount of T cells by FACS. Further the effect on a particular subset of T cells e.g. CD2 CD4 CD8 CD45 CD45RO CD45RA or CD8 RA or NK cells can be determined using standard techniques known to one of skill in the art such as FACS.

The subject s absolute neutrophil count ANC can be monitored assessed using standard techniques known to one of skill in the art. In some embodiments the regimen includes monitoring the patient s ANC in order to avoid the risk of the patient developing neutropenia.

The ANC can be calculated from measurements of the total number of white blood cells WBC and the numbers of neutrophils and bands immature neutrophils . The ANC can be determined manually by trained medical technologists or by automated ANC results obtained from automated hematology analyzers.

The subject s platelet count PLT can be monitored assessed using standard techniques known to one of skill in the art. In some embodiments the regimen includes monitoring the patient s platelet count in order to avoid the risk of the patient developing thrombocytopenia or becoming blood transfusion dependent. Transfusions can be given as determined by the physician.

The subject s hemoglobin Hgb can be monitored assessed using standard techniques known to one of skill in the art. In some embodiments the regimen includes monitoring the patient s hemoglobin in order to avoid the risk of the patient developing anemia or becoming transfusion dependent. Transfusions or growth factors e.g. erythropoietin can be given as determined by the physician.

The compounds pharmaceutical compositions and regimens of the invention can be tested in vitro and or in vivo for their ability to reduce the amount of cancer cells and or cancer stem cells or inhibit their proliferation. The ability of a compound or a regimen of the invention to reduce the amount of cancer cells cancer stem cells and or immune cells e.g. lymphocytes or inhibit their proliferation can be assessed by detecting the expression of antigens on cancer cells cancer stem cells and or immune cells detecting the proliferation or viability of cancer cells cancer stem cells and immune cells detecting the effector function of cancer cells and cancer stem cells. Techniques known to those skilled in the art can be used for measuring these activities. For example cellular proliferation can be assayed by H thymidine incorporation assays and trypan blue cell counts. Antigen expression can be assayed for example by immunoassays including but not limited to competitive and non competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots immunohistochemistry radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays precipitin reactions gel diffusion precipitin reactions immunodiffusion assays agglutination assays complement fixation assays immunoradiometric assays fluorescent immunoassays protein A immunoassays and FACS analysis.

A compound pharmaceutical composition or regimen of the invention is preferably tested in vitro and then in vivo for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity prior to use in humans. For example assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific compound is indicated include cell culture assays in which a patient tissue sample e.g. a cancer cell or cancer stem cell is grown in culture and exposed to or otherwise contacted with a compound of the invention and the effect of such compound upon the tissue sample is observed. The tissue sample can be obtained by biopsy from the patient. This test allows the identification of the therapeutically most effective therapy e.g. prophylactic or therapeutic agent for each individual patient.

Determination of cell viability using the XTT assay In some cases CD34 cells are isolated from human cord blood using magnetic beads coated with anti CD34 antibody. Isolated cells are then counted and aliquoted into 96 well plates and then incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of cantharidin or norcantharidin. Cell viability is measured by the addition of the XTT colorimetric reagent. Viability is determined by the absorbance of treated cultures at approximately 450 500 nm compared to untreated cultures. In other cases the cells used in the assay may be a leukemia cell line such as MV4 11. The assay can also be used to determine the time course of cell killing by various compounds by performing the XTT assay on cultures that are incubated with the compounds for varying periods of time.

Cobblestone assay The cobblestone area forming cell CAFC assay exploits a reproducible visual end point for the quantitation of cancer stem cells. Leukemia samples are added to adherent cultures of stromal cells in some embodiments MS 5 stromal cells. The cancer stem cells in the culture will migrate below the MS 5 stromal cells and form a colony of cells called a cobblestone that can be visually quantitated. To test the effect of cantharidin or norcantharidin on the cancer stem cell population using this assay cells are first cultured in the presence of the drug. In some embodiments the cells are cultured for 16 hours. After this incubation the cells are added to the stromal cultures. A reduction in the cobblestone area formation in cultures that were treated with the drug compared to the untreated cells represents cancer stem cell activity for the drug.

In certain in vivo techniques an imaging agent or diagnostic moiety is used which binds to molecules on cancer cells or cancer stem cells e.g. cancer cell or cancer stem cell surface antigens. For instance a fluorescent tag radionuclide heavy metal or photon emitter is attached to an antibody including an antibody fragment that binds to a cancer stem cell surface antigen. Exemplary cancer stem cell surface antigens are listed above in Table 2. The medical practitioner can infuse the labeled antibody into the patient either prior to during or following treatment and then the practitioner can place the patient into a total body scanner developer which can detect the attached label e.g. fluorescent tag radionuclide heavy metal photon emitter . The scanner developer e.g. CT MRI or other scanner e.g. detector of fluorescent label that can detect the label records the presence amount quantity and bodily location of the bound antibody. In this manner the mapping and quantitation of tag e.g. fluorescence radioactivity etc. in patterns i.e. different from patterns of normal stem cells within a tissue within a tissue or tissues indicates the treatment efficacy within the patient s body when compared to a reference control such as the same patient at an earlier time point or a patient who has no detectable cancer. For example a large signal relative to a reference range or a prior treatment date or prior to treatment at a particular location indicates the presence of cancer stem cells. If this signal is increased relative to a prior date it suggests a worsening of the disease and failure of therapy or regimen. Alternatively a signal decrease indicates that therapy or regimen has been effective.

Similarly in some embodiments of the invention the efficacy of the therapeutic regimen in reducing the amount of cancer cells in animals including humans undergoing treatment can be evaluated using in vivo techniques. In one embodiment the medical practitioner performs the imaging technique with labeled molecule that specifically binds the surface of a cancer cell e.g. a cancer cell surface antigen. See Section 5.4 supra lists certain cancer cell surface antigens. In this manner the mapping and quantitation of tag e.g. fluorescence radioactivity in patterns within a tissue or tissues indicates the treatment efficacy within the body of the patient undergoing treatment.

In a specific embodiment the amount of cancer stem cells is detected in vivo in a subject according to a method comprising the steps of a administering to the subject an effective amount of a labeled cancer stem cell marker binding agent that specifically binds to a cell surface marker found on the cancer stem cells and b detecting the labeled agent in the subject following a time interval sufficient to allow the labeled agent to concentrate at sites in the subject where the cancer stem cell surface marker is expressed. In accordance with this embodiment the cancer stem cell surface marker binding agent is administered to the subject according to any suitable method in the art for example parenterally e.g. intraveneously or intraperitoneally. In accordance with this embodiment the effective amount of the agent is the amount which permits the detection of the agent in the subject. This amount will vary according to the particular subject the label used and the detection method employed. For example it is understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the amount of labeled agent needed to detect the agent in a subject using imaging. In the case of a radiolabeled agent for a human subject the amount of labeled agent administered is measured in terms of radioactivity for example from about 5 to 20 millicuries of Tc. The time interval following the administration of the labeled agent which is sufficient to allow the labeled agent to concentrate at sites in the subject where the cancer stem cell surface marker is expressed will vary depending on several factors for example the type of label used the mode of administration and the part of the subject s body that is imaged. In a particular embodiment the time interval that is sufficient is 6 to 48 hours 6 to 24 hours or 6 to 12 hours. In another embodiment the time interval is 5 to 20 days or 5 to 10 days. The presence of the labeled cancer stem cell surface marker binding agent can be detected in the subject using imaging means known in the art. In general the imaging means employed depend upon the type of label used. Skilled artisans will be able to determine the appropriate means for detecting a particular label. Methods and devices that may be used include but are not limited to computed tomography CT whole body scan such as position emission tomography PET magnetic resonance imaging MRI fluorescence chemiluminescence an imager which can detect and localize fluorescent label and sonography. In a specific embodiment the cancer stem cell surface marker binding agent is labeled with a radioisotope and is detected in the patient using a radiation responsive surgical instrument Thurston et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 441 050 . In another embodiment the cancer stem cell surface marker binding agent is labeled with a fluorescent compound and is detected in the patient using a fluorescence responsive scanning instrument. In another embodiment the cancer stem cell surface marker binding agent is labeled with a positron emitting metal and is detected in the patient using positron emission tomography. In yet another embodiment the cancer stem cell surface marker binding agent is labeled with a paramagnetic label and is detected in a patient using magnetic resonance imaging MRI .

Any in vitro or in vivo ex vivo assays known to those skilled in the art that can detect and or quantify cancer stem cells can be used to monitor cancer stem cells in order to evaluate the prophylactic and or therapeutic utility of a cancer therapy or regimen disclosed herein for cancer or one or more symptoms thereof or these assays can be used to assess the prognosis of a patient. The results of these assays then may be used to possibly maintain or alter the cancer therapy or regimen.

The toxicity and or efficacy of compounds pharmaceutical compositions and regimens of the invention can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals e.g. for determining the LD the dose lethal to 50 of the population and the ED the dose therapeutically effective in 50 of the population . The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD ED. Therapeutic regimens that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While therapeutic regimens that exhibit toxic side effects may be used care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such agents to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and thereby reduce side effects.

The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage of the therapies for use in humans. The dosage of such agents lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity to normal tissues. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any therapy used in the method of the invention the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC i.e. the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half maximal inhibition of symptoms as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels of compounds in plasma may be measured for example by high performance liquid chromatography.

Based on the results obtained by use of the pharmaceutical pack or kit i.e. whether the cancer stem cell amount has stabilized or decreased the medical practitioner administering the cancer therapy or regimen may choose to continue the therapy or regimen. Alternatively based on the result that the cancer stem cell amount has increased the medical practitioner may choose to continue alter or halt the therapy or regimen.

The following examples are illustrative and should not be viewed as limiting the scope of the present invention. Reasonable variations such as those that occur to a reasonable artisan can be made herein without departing from the scope of the present invention.

The following example describes the results of a clinical study in which a diphtheria toxin interleukin 3 conjugate was administered to patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia AML .

Patients were diagnosed with AML based on bone marrow biopsy and either relapsed disease or poor risk AML treatment related prior myelodysplastic syndrome MDS patient age 70 years or unfavorable cytogenetics and not candidate for allogeneic transplantation . Patients had to have a performance status 

Patients were admitted to the hospital given allopurinol normal saline moxifloxacin fluconazole vitamin K acetaminophen diphenhydramine and hydrocortisone and inter patient escalating doses of DT388IL 3 IV over 15 minutes on M W F for two weeks. Cohorts of at least 3 patients at each dose level were treated. Patients were monitored for toxicities using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events CTCAE version 3.0. Vital signs were measured frequently on the days of treatment. Careful input output was recorded daily. CBC CMP coagulation panel LDH uric acid and magnesium were tested daily. Blood was drawn for clinical pharmacology studies including pharmacokinetics and immune response. Bone marrow biopsies were repeated on day 15 30 60 and every three months until relapse. Responses were measured based on the revised recommendations of the international working group.

Forty nine AML patients have been screened and twenty seven patients treated Table 3 . The median age of treated patients was 59 years range 25 81 years . There were thirteen males and fourteen females. Disease was de novo in two first relapse in ten second relapse in seven and refractory in eight patients. Three patients had a history of MDS and one had a history of secondary AML. One patient each had previously received an autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant. Cytogenetics were unfavorable in ten intermediate in sixteen and not done in one. Seven patients were treated with 4 g kg eight patients were treated with 5.3 g kg eleven patients treated with 7.1 g kg and one patient treated with 9 g kg DTIL 3 Table 4 . Drug related toxicities were mild to moderate and transient including fever chills hypotension hypoxemia and hypoalbuminemia. Among twenty seven evaluable patients we have observed one on going CR of 6 months duration two partial remissions PRs lasting one and two months and three minimal responses with clearance of peripheral blasts and marrow blast cytoreductions of 89 90 and 93 lasting one to two months Table 5 and .

Toxicities to date on the clinical study have been mild to moderate. Fevers occurred but responded to acetaminophen and cooling methods. Hypotension and transient uremia responded to hydration. Hypoxemia and hypoalbuminemia reversed with albumin infusions and diuresis. No significant liver dysfunction has been seen. After the clinical study of DTGMCSF we established a preclinical model for the liver toxicity using DT fusion molecules with murine GMCSF and IL 3 DTmGMCSF and DTmIL 3 respectively. 27 Rats treated with DTmGMCSF but not DTmIL 3 showed Kupffer cell injury hepatocyte swelling and transaminasemia. The lack of IL 3 receptor on Kupffer cells appears to protect from liver damage. Monkey and clinical studies to date confirms that finding.

The above results clearly show that the diphtheria toxin interleukin 3 conjugate was selectively cytotoxic to leukemic cells relative to normal hematopoietic cells and produced clinical remissions in human patients.

Patients had to have AML based on bone marrow biopsy and either disease relapsed disease refractory disease or poor risk AML treatment related prior MDS patient age 70 years or unfavorable cytogenetics and not candidate for allogeneic transplantation . Patients had to have a performance status 

Patients received 15 minute infusions of DTIL 3 three times weekly for two weeks with interpatient dose escalation at doses of 4 12.5 m kg dose.

Seventy five AML patients have been screened to date and thirty six patients treated Table 6 . The median age of treated patients was 60 years range 25 81 years . There were twenty males and sixteen females. Disease was de novo AML in four first relapse AML in eleven second relapse AML in eight and refractory AML in twelve patients. One patient had MDS. Seven AML patients had a history of MDS and one had a history of secondary AML. One patient each had previously received an autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant. Cytogenetics were unfavorable in twelve including the MDS patient intermediate in twenty one and not done in three. Seven patients were treated with 4 mg kg eight patients were treated with 5.3 m kg twelve patients treated with 7.1 mg kg and eight patients treated with 9.4 g kg one patient treated with 12.5 g kg DTIL 3.

Drug related toxicities were mild to moderate and transient including fever chills hypotension vascular leak syndrome hypoxemia hypocalcemia transaminasemia and hypoalbuminemia Table 7 and . There is no correlation of dose level with toxicity incidence or grade.

Pretreatment antibody titers ranged from 0 to 4.3 g ml mean 2.3 g ml day 15 antibody titers were 0 to 600 g ml mean 92 g ml day 30 antibody titers were 1.1 to 306 g ml mean 81 g ml . Based on high antibody titers of 8 m ml all 25 samples were low pretreatment nine samples were low at day 15 and nine samples high at day 15 four samples were low at day 30 and ten samples high at day 30. Cmax did not correlate with response p 0.23 .

Among thirty six evaluable patients the following were observed one cytogenetic AML CR for 8 months two AML partial remissions PRs lasting one and three months three AML minimal responses with clearance of peripheral blasts and marrow blast cytoreductions of 89 90 and 93 lasting one to two months and one MDS partial remission lasting greater than one month with reduction of blasts from 10 to 2 and normalization of peripheral counts Table 8 and .
