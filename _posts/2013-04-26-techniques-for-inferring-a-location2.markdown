A social networking service is a computer or web based service that enables users to establish links or connections with persons for the purpose of sharing information with one another. Some social network services aim to enable friends and family to communicate and share with one another while others are specifically directed to business users with a goal of facilitating the establishment of professional networks and the sharing of business information. For purposes of the present disclosure the terms social network and social networking service are used in a broad sense and are meant to encompass services aimed at connecting friends and family often referred to simply as social networks as well as services that are specifically directed to enabling business people to connect and share business information also commonly referred to as social networks but sometimes referred to as business networks or professional networks .

In the following a detailed description of examples will be given with references to the drawings. It should be understood that various modifications to the examples may be made. In particular elements of one example may be combined and used in other examples to form new examples.

Many of the examples described herein are provided in the context of a social or business networking website or service. However the applicability of the inventive subject matter is not limited to a social or business networking service.

A social networking service is an online service platform or site that allows members of the service to build or reflect social networks or social relations among its members. Typically members of the social networking service construct profiles which may include personal information such as the member s name contact information employment information photographs personal messages status information links to web related content blogs and so on. Generally only a portion of a members profile may be viewed by the general public and or other members.

In order to build or reflect these social networks or social relations among members the social networking service allows members to identify and establish links or connections with other members. For instance in the context of a business networking service a type of social networking service a person may establish a link or connection with his or her business contacts including work colleagues clients customers personal contacts and so on. With a social networking service a person may establish links or connections with his or her friends family or business contacts. A connection is generally formed using an invitation process in which one member invites a second member to form a link. The second member then has the option of accepting or declining the invitation.

While a social networking service and a business networking service may be generally described in terms of typical use cases e.g. for personal and business networking respectively business networking services are commonly used for personal purposes e.g. connecting with friends classmates former classmates and the like as well as or instead of business networking purposes and personal social networking services are commonly used for business networking purposes as well as or in place of personal social networking purposes.

In general a connection or link represents or is otherwise associated with an information access privilege such that a first person who has established a connection with a second person is via the establishment of that connection authorizing the second person to view or access non publicly available portions of their profiles which may include communications they have authored e.g. blog posts messages wall postings or the like . Of course depending on the particular implementation of the business social networking service the nature and type of the information that may be shared as well as the granularity with which the access privileges may be defined to protect certain types of data may vary greatly.

Some social networking services may offer a subscription or following model instead of or in addition to the connection model. A subscription or following model is where one member follows another member without mutual agreement. Typically in this model the follower is notified of public messages and other communications posted by the member that is followed. An example of a social networking service that follows this model is Twitter a micro blogging service that allows members to follow other members without explicit permission.

While most social networking services allow members to self specify their home or work locations as part of their member profiles members are not always diligent in updating their member profiles to reflect changes in their home and work locations and many social networks do not presently have the ability to determine whether or not the location in the member profile is still accurate. As a result member interactions with the service that are tailored or specific to a location may not be relevant to members.

Disclosed in some examples are systems methods and machine readable mediums which enable a social networking service to infer geographic locations of a member by using transaction information the social networking service automatically learns about the member. These inferred locations may be used in a variety of ways by the social networking service. Examples include suggesting that the member update their profiles determining that the member is a traveler and providing personalization based upon that classification and detecting fraudulent login attempts.

A transaction may include any interaction or event between the member and the social networking service or between the member and another network based service that may provide an indication of a member s location. Information about each transaction may be collected and stored in a transaction record which may include a geographic location of the transaction timestamp of the transaction and type of transaction.

After a predetermined period of time or in some examples a predetermined number of records are collected the social networking service may retrieve the transaction records from storage. The social networking service may clean the transaction records using appropriate data cleaning techniques. The records may then be scored based in whole or in part upon how recent the transaction took place more recent transactions may be weighted more heavily e.g. a time decay algorithm is used to weight the contribution of any transaction or event based upon when it occurred . The social networking service may then cluster the transaction records so that transaction records with similar geographic locations are clustered together. For example locations within a predetermined geographical radius from each other or from a particular geographical location e.g. any transaction within 100 miles of San Francisco may be clustered together. Low scoring location clusters may be removed and the scores may be normalized to create a probability distribution for each location that indicates the probability that based upon the transaction records collected the member is in that geographic location. In some examples the probability distributions may be smoothed out such that even locations without an observed transaction have some small non zero probability that the member may be located there. These calculations may be repeated periodically by the social networking service to account for newly observed transactions and the social networking service may observe the location probabilities over time to determine changes in the probabilities. These changes may inform the social networking service about various location habits of the member. For example depending upon the nature of the probability distribution for a particular member the social networking service may determine that the member has likely moved is a traveler or that someone attempting to login to the member s account is logging in from a location that is not likely a location that the member would be in and therefore could be fraudulent.

While individual transactions may be representative of a member s instantaneous location e.g. an exact position of a member at a particular time the disclosed method may utilize those instantaneous locations to infer a non instantaneous location status of the member e.g. a general location where the member frequently locates in for example the member lives or works in a given location or locations and or travels frequently . Additionally while the transactions may be explicit indicators of location e.g. the transactions contain explicit geographic locations such as latitude and longitude coordinates or a particular geographic location the transactions may also be implicit indicators of location such that they contain information leading to a physical geographic location. For example an IP address associated with the social networking service may not in itself contain an explicit location but may be converted using a database or other method to a physical geographical location.

Turning now to a method of inferring a location according to some examples is shown. At the social networking service may collect information on transactions involving the member. Example transactions may include but are not limited to 

Information about the transaction may be stored in a data store as one or more transaction records. The information may be gathered based upon logs of a member s activity on the social networking service or based upon scraping other network based services or websites which may be explicitly or implicitly associated with the member. For example a member may inform the social networking service about a Twitter account that they own. The social networking service may scrape the Twitter account and use text analysis to determine Tweets that refer to particular locations. As another example a member may inform the social networking service about a Foursquare account they own. The social networking service may scrape the account for check ins at various locations. In addition to or instead of scraping the social networking service may utilize one or more application programming interfaces API of the other network based services in order to obtain this information. The social networking service may contact the other networking service over a computer network and request the information using the API. In some examples the member may provide the social networking service with authorization to contact the other networking service. For example the member may provide a username password or other credentials.

At this data may be periodically retrieved from storage or gathered if necessary for processing. At operation the transaction information may be cleaned before further processing. For example the social networking service may detect corporate IP addresses and virtual private networks and remove transactions with these addresses from consideration or reduce their weighting. This is because corporate IP addresses and IP addresses behind VPNs Virtual Private Networks are sometimes less reliable predictors of geographical location as the actual computing device utilizing the IP address may not be in close proximity to the actual physical location mapped to the IP address. In some examples the IP address may be determined to be a corporate IP address or VPN based upon a determination that multiple members of the social networking service all report on their member profiles that they work for the same company and all are using the same or similar IP address during working hours. This may enable the social networking service to estimate with a high degree of confidence that the given IP address belongs to a corporation or is behind a VPN. In some examples if auxiliary information regarding the physical location of the corporation s offices is available that information may be utilized instead of the IP address information i.e. instead of purging the transaction completely . Other cleaning methods including removing from consideration IP addresses that do not map to known locations e.g. the IP to geo lookup database does not contain geo lookups for these IPs. .

At operation the transactions may be scored. In some examples each recorded transaction may be assigned a base point value. This base point value may then be multiplied by a weighting factor selected such that more recent transactions end up with higher point totals than more distant transactions. Transactions occurring before a predetermined time period may be excluded altogether. For example each transaction may be given one point. The weighting factor may be calculated based upon subtracting the time elapsed since the transaction from a predetermined base value. Once the time elapsed exceeds the base value the transaction may be ignored. For example if a transaction happened 20 days ago and the predetermined value is 30 days then the weighting factor may be 10 and the transaction score may be 1 10 10.

In some examples each transaction may be awarded base point values based upon the type of transaction. For example a profile view of another member the reported or inferred location of the member whose profile is viewed may be used to infer the member s location may be worth 1 point which may then be multiplied by the time weighting factor but a connection request sent to that member may be worth 10 points which may then be multiplied by the time weighting factor . Assigning different base point values for different transaction types recognizes that different transactions have different predictive value on a member s location.

In some other examples the score may be calculated using various machine learning algorithms. For example a neural network with weightings for each transaction type and or based upon the transaction age applied to various input transactions in various stages of the neural network to produce a score for a particular location. In other examples the system may utilize a Bayesian classifier e.g. a na ve Bayesian classifier with weightings for each transaction type which may correspond to one or more posterior probabilities for the various signals. The training data used to train the various machine learning algorithms may come from past member transactions and manual associations between those transactions and member locations.

Turning now to once the scores are computed each transaction may be clustered with other transactions occurring at similar locations at operation . In some examples this clustering may be done based upon determining a center point and a radius for each cluster. Clusters may be based on a number of predetermined geographical areas territories or other subdivisions. For example a cluster for the city San Francisco may contain a center coordinate and a radius. Any transaction within the circle defined by the center coordinate and the radius may be clustered in the San Francisco cluster. In other examples clusters may be formed by comparing the transaction data to each other for example forming a predetermined number of clusters filled with the transactions that are nearest each other. In yet still other examples statistical clustering algorithms such as k means may be utilized.

Any degree of granularity may be utilized. For example locations in the same neighborhood in a city may be in the same cluster locations in the same city locations in the same county locations in the same state and the like. The level of granularity does not have to be constant across clusters. For example a large city such as New York may have clusters for each of the boroughs Manhattan The Bronx Brooklyn Queens and Staten Island but a smaller country may have a single cluster.

At operation the scores for all the transactions in each cluster may be summed to produce an aggregate score for each cluster. At operation low scoring clusters may be removed from further analysis. For example those clusters falling below a predetermined threshold score may be removed.

At operation the aggregated scores for the clusters may then be normalized such that they create a probability distribution which sums to one. This probability distribution indicates the probability that the particular member was at the particular location during the particular indicated timeframe. At operation the probabilities may be smoothed such that it produces a small non zero probability that the member is in every possible cluster. For example the smoothing may be performed by taking the centroids of clusters in the form of latitude and longitude and fitting a bi variate spatial model to the probabilities. The exact model may be determined by fitting a range of models and using a statistical information criterion to determine the best fitting one. A spatial smoothing model may be fit to each country or continent the member is observed in.

Turning now to at operation the social networking service may track these probability distributions over time to produce one or more inferences. For example at operation the social networking service may detect a change of home or work location. For example if the system detects for a predetermined time period that a high probability exists that the member is in a given location that is not listed as the member s home location the system may infer that the member has moved. Consequently the social networking service may suggest a profile update at . If the member does not have a home location in their member profiles the social networking service may suggest the member add the location as their home location.

Additionally at operation if the social networking service detects a wide range of unique locations reporting high probabilities e.g. probablitilies exceeding some predetermined threshold level for a predetermined threshold time period the system may deduce that the member is a traveler. At operation the social networking system may determine a scope of travel. For example the member may only travel within a particular region the member may travel the country or the member may travel the world. This determination may be based upon an average distance between different inferred locations that have high scores e.g. the larger distances may suggest international travel whereas shorter distances may suggest regional travel. Another technique for classifying the traveler may include determining whether the different inferred locations that have high scores are in different states regions countries continents or the like. At operation the member may be labeled or tagged with an indication that they are a traveler.

Once members are tagged as travelers the social networking service may recommend other members with similar travel habits to connect to or follow e.g. similar locations of travel companies with which they may be interested in following companies whose employees also have similar travel habits or companies which may offer services to travelers products they may be interested in buying that appeal to travelers jobs that may involve similar travel requirements or the like.

The social networking service may also utilize the location information to flag possible fraudulent login attempts. For example an imposter may try and access a member s account. A login attempt originating from a location that the system determines to be a low probability that the member based on the inferred location would be located in may be flagged as suspicious. Turning now to at operation a login attempt is detected. At operation the IP address may be geolocated using a database of locations corresponding to the IP address. At operation the probability of the user being in that location is compared to a particular predetermined threshold. If the probability is greater than a predetermined threshold the login is allowed. If the probability is less than the predetermined threshold at operation a fraud alert may be issued.

Users may include one or more members prospective members or other users of the social networking service . Users access social networking service using a computing device or system through a network . The network may be any means of enabling the social networking service to communicate data with users . Example networks may be or include portions of the Internet a Local Area Network LAN a Wide Area Network WAN wireless network such as a wireless network based upon an IEEE 802.11 family of standards a Metropolitan Area Network MAN a cellular network or the like. Computing devices used to access the social networking service may include desktop computers laptop computers tablet computers mobile devices e.g. smart phones or the like. The users may access the social networking service through a web page served by content server process or may access the social networking service through an application executing on the computing device that may communicate with the social networking service through one or more Application Programming Interfaces APIs .

Transaction collection module may collect transaction information related to transactions between the users and social networking service . For example when users access content server process over network the transaction collection module may collect the Internet Protocol IP Address of the users . The transaction collection module may utilize a look up table containing IP addresses and corresponding geographic locations. Transaction collection module may collect information on other transactions between the member and the social networking service such as connection requests invitation acceptance reading habits interaction with location specific ads and the like.

Transaction collection module may also collect information from other network services e.g. other networking service . For example members may inform the social networking service about other networking services that contain transaction information regarding the member. The transaction collection module may periodically contact those other network services to collect transaction information about these members. Transaction collection module may utilize an application programming interface API to obtain the transaction information from the other networking service or may scrape the website of the other network services. Web scraping is a software technique for extracting information from websites using such techniques as regular expression matching data mining algorithms Document Object Model DOM parsing HTML parsers and other algorithms. Transaction records reflecting transaction information collected about these transactions may be stored in storage for further processing.

Inferred locator module may utilize the transaction records collected by the transaction collection module stored in storage to infer geographic locations that the user may be located in. The inferred locator module may assign a predetermined number of points to each transaction which may all be the same or may be a different number of points based upon transaction type and may multiply these points by a weighting factor calculated by the inferred locator module which reduces the number of points for a transaction that is older. Each transaction record may then be clustered into similar locations and the scores of each transaction may be aggregated to form a composite score for each location. Locations below a predetermined threshold score may be ignored. The remaining scores may then be normalized and smoothed to create a probability distribution. The inferred locator module may recalculate location probabilities after a trigger event. A trigger event may include passage of a predetermined amount of time since the last location probabilities were calculated collection of a predetermined amount of transaction records about the member since the last probabilities were calculated collection of a predetermined transaction type or the like.

Location analysis module may look for patterns in the probability distributions over a predetermined time period. For example location analysis module may detect patterns indicating a member has moved. An example pattern indicating that the member has moved may be a consistently high probability that the member is in a location that is not the location they have as a home location in their member profiles. In other examples where the member does not have a home location in their member profiles the system may suggest that the user add a location scoring consistently high over a predetermined time period to their profile as their home location e.g. the system may prompt the member do you wish to add as your home location .

Location analysis module may also look for patterns indicating travel. This may manifest in probability distributions that show a plurality of different locations with greater than minimal probabilities over time. For example if the probability distribution calculated at time T is San Francisco 50 Chicago 30 Seattle 20 and at time T 1 the probability distribution is San Francisco 60 New York 20 Minneapolis 20 and time interval T 2 shows probabilities San Francisco 30 Omaha 30 Orlando 20 Portland 20 . The system may determine that based on the consistently high probability of San Francisco that the member lives in San Francisco. The system may suggest the member update their profile if they do not list San Francisco as their home. The system may also determine that based upon the high probabilities that the member was in Chicago Seattle New York Minneapolis Omaha Orlando and Portland that the member travels. Also based upon the fact that these are all cities within the same country as the member s home that the member is a national traveler.

The location analysis module may also determine the type of travel. For example the system may compare the member s home location to the locations the member travels to. If the member travels outside the member s home country they are an international traveler if they travel only within their home country they are a national traveler if they travel only within their home region e.g. Western U.S Central U.S. Eastern U.S. or the like they are a regional traveler. In other examples the system may determine the type of travel by utilizing an average distance between locations identified as having a more than minimal probability.

Location analysis module may cooperate with the content server process to provide customization based upon the categorization of the member as a traveler and even customization based upon the type of traveler. Location analysis module may also compare a location determined from an IP address used for a login attempt from a user to determine whether or not the login attempt is likely to be fraudulent.

Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components modules or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules e.g. code embodied on a machine readable medium or in a transmission signal or hardware modules. A hardware module is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments one or more computing devices e.g. a standalone client or server computing device or one or more hardware modules of a computing device e.g. a processor or a group of processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.

In various embodiments a hardware module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured e.g. as a special purpose processor such as a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC to perform certain operations. A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry e.g. as encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by cost and time considerations.

Accordingly the term hardware module should be understood to encompass a tangible entity be that an entity that is physically constructed permanently configured e.g. hardwired or temporarily configured e.g. programmed to operate in a certain manner and or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured e.g. programmed each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example where the hardware modules comprise a general purpose processor configured using software the general purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor for example to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.

Hardware modules can provide information to and receive information from other hardware modules. Accordingly the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses that connect the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such hardware modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .

The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed at least partially by one or more processors that are temporarily configured e.g. by software or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured such processors may constitute processor implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may in some example embodiments comprise processor implemented modules.

Similarly the methods described herein may be at least partially processor implemented. For example at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or processors or processor implemented modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments the processor or processors may be located in a single location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or as a server farm while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.

The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a cloud computing environment or as a software as a service SaaS . For example at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers as examples of machines including processors with these operations being accessible via a network e.g. the Internet and via one or more appropriate interfaces e.g. APIs .

Example embodiments may be implemented in digital electronic circuitry or in computer hardware firmware software or in combinations of them. Example embodiments may be implemented using a computer program product for example a computer program tangibly embodied in an information carrier for example in a machine readable medium for execution by or to control the operation of data processing apparatus for example a programmable processor a computer or multiple computers.

A computer program can be written in any form of programming language including compiled or interpreted languages and it can be deployed in any form including as a stand alone program or as a module subroutine or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.

In example embodiments operations may be performed by one or more programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. Method operations can also be performed by and apparatus of example embodiments may be implemented as special purpose logic circuitry e.g. a FPGA or an ASIC .

The computing device can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client server relationship to each other. In embodiments deploying a programmable computing system it will be appreciated that both hardware and software architectures require consideration. Specifically it will be appreciated that the choice of whether to implement certain functionality in permanently configured hardware e.g. an ASIC in temporarily configured hardware e.g. a combination of software and a programmable processor or a combination of permanently and temporarily configured hardware may be a design choice. Below are set out hardware e.g. machine and software architectures that may be deployed in various example embodiments.
