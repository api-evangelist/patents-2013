This application claims priority benefit to the Dec. 11 2012 filing date of co pending U.S. provisional patent application filed in the name of Sami Maassarani and entitled SEAT BACK HEADREST the entire contents of which are incorporated herein in its entirety.

In order to alleviate the neck strain associated with a person trying to sleep while seated in a seat such as a vehicle seat airplane seat train seat etc. and maintaining his or her head in a generally upright vertical position a variety of different headrests have been devised for supporting a portion of the user s head such as each cheek or in a fully face encircling manner.

Maintaining a sleeping person s head in a generally upright position while the person is sleeping in a seat is particularly desirable from a safety standpoint for small children who frequently fall asleep while riding in a vehicle airplane or train.

The various devised headrests are either designed as part of the vehicle head restraint or are portable and removably attachable to the seatback for deployment and use. However the previously devised headrests are either cumbersome or unsightly to deploy and attach to a seat back or do not have easily adjustable positions to enable use of the headrest with different sized individuals or with children as the children grow.

It would be desirable to provide a seat headrest which overcomes these difficulties and provides ease of attachment and ease of adjustability.

A headrest removably engageable with a seat back includes a seat back mounting member having a leg and opposed side portions extending from the leg adapted to encircle a seat back headrest and a cushion configured to engage one of a front and a side of a user s head. The ends of the side portions of the seat back mounting member and opposed ends of the cushion are configured for complimentary engagement. A support is carried on at least one or both of the side portions of the seat back mounting member and configured to engage the seat back to assist in supporting the headrest on the seat back.

The support can include a flat pad extending from the at least one of the side portions of the seat back mounting member.

The support can include two supports one support mounted on each of the side portions of the seatback mounting member.

The ends of the seatback mounting member and the opposed ends of the cushion can be telescopingly engageable. The telescoping engagement of the end portions of the seatback mounting member and the opposed ends of the cushion can include one of the ends of the side portions of the seat back mounting member and the opposed ends of the cushion having a complementary projection and recess.

Referring now to of the drawing there is depicted one aspect of a headrest usable on a seat . By way of example the seat may be any type of seat such as a vehicle seat an airplane seat a train seat a seat use in an office workspace or home or a portable child car seat. The seat has a seat back and a seat bottom . Depending upon the application the seat back may be rigidly fixed to the seat bottom such as a rear seat or may be pivotal from a more generally upright position shown in to an angled position over the seat bottom as in a front seat or a rear fold down seat.

For purposes of the following description the seat back includes a top edge opposed side edges and a front surface and an opposed new surface .

A vehicle seat back headrest may be integrally formed as part of an upper portion of the seat back extending as an integral part and defining a portion of the top edge of the seat back or as a separate attachment mountable by one or two slidable posts into apertures formed in the top edge of the seat back .

As shown in a portable seat back headrest is removably mountable on the seat back and encircles the seat back headrest . The headrest includes a seat back mounting member which may be formed of one or more pieces that are individually joined together into an integral unitary assembly and at least one cushion .

The cushion may be formed of a number of different soft compliant materials suitable for safely contacting a user s head particularly a child s head. For example foam or other soft compliant material such as SANOPRENE a thermo plastic elastomer may be molded extruded or otherwise formed in the shape of the cushion . Alternately a different and more rigid foam or other material such as self skinning foam may be used to form an inner core of the cushion which is then covered with an outer decorative softer more compliant layer of leather plastic fabric etc. which can be complimentary to the material used in vehicles airplanes train or home seats child car seats etc.

The cushion although shown as having a generally semi circular or U shape with two ends can also be constructed of two individual J shaped portions where one end of each J shaped portion connects to one end of the mounting member . The opposite ends of each J shaped cushion member may be disposed in close proximity to each other to substantially encircle the front portion of the head of the seat user or be slightly spaced apart. Alternately Velcro snaps or other releasable fasteners may releasibly join the outer ends of the J shaped cushions together. The use of individual J shaped cushions would enable for example only a single J shaped cushion employed as part of the headrest on either side of a user s head.

As shown in each end of the cushion has an interior opening extending for a distance into the interior of the cushion and sized to receive an end of the side portions of the mounting member in a releasable plug in or telescoping connection.

The cushion is illustrated as having a generally circular cross section. It will be understood that the cushion can have other cross sectional shapes such as oval polygonal including square rectangular etc. and combinations thereof.

The mounting member as shown in detail in is illustrated by example as being formed of an integral one piece member constructed of any moldable plastic rubber or other suitable material such as metal foam composite or combinations thereof. It will be understood that the mounting member may be constructed of multiple individual pieces or sections which are joined together by adhesive fasteners sonic welding etc. into a unitary structure.

The mounting member has generally U shape with first and second opposed side portions and serving the dual function of a cushion connector and a seat support. The side portions and are mirror images of each other. Each side portion and includes a linear portion extending between the end and opposite end . By example only each side portion and gradually transitions from a circular shape extending from a circular disc dividing the end from the linear portion and servicing as a connection limiter between the cushion and the mounting member to a rectangular cross section along the linear portion which then smoothly transitions into a turned seat back encircling member or central leg . The central leg can be any other shape such as circular oval polygonal etc.

In one aspect the cushion may have a circular cross section that can be hollow or solid. The end of the cushion may have a hollow interior for telescopingly receiving the end of the seat back mounting member in a slide a fit. The solid portion and hollow interior of the connection between the ends of the cushion and the ends of the seat back mounting member may also be reversed.

Alternately the end portion of each side portion and of the mounting member may have a gradually increasing tapered cylindrical shape extending from the end to create a press or friction fit when each end portion of the mounting member is inserted into the hollow end of the cushion .

In another aspect shown by example in the ends of the seat back mounting member have a generally M shape formed of first and second outer linear legs and which extend from a semi circular or arcuate upper portion . A center linear leg which may have a greater length than the length of the side legs and from the ends of the upper portion is disposed centrally or intermediately between the spaced legs and .

The recess in each end of the cushion has a complimentary shape formed of a slightly curved upper recess from which depend a pair of spaced outer recesses and having a length complimentary to the length of the side legs and and an intermediate or centrally disposed recess having a length from the upper leg substantially equal to the length of the intermediate central leg . This complimentary arrangement of the shape of the ends of the seat back mounting member and the recess in each end of the cushion allows for secure telescoping engagement of the ends of the cushion onto the ends of the seat back mounting member.

For rigidity a narrow cross section lip is formed along and extends along a lower edge and extends inwardly from the side portions and and the central leg of the seat back mounting member . The edge extends to the circular disc on the side portions and .

An inner flange is mounted along the lower edge of the encircling leg of the mounting member . The flange can slip underneath the vehicle seat back headrest when the seat back headrest is a separate component from the seat back to aid in stabilizing the mounting position of the headrest on the seat back .

Each side portion and of the mounting member includes a seat back support such as the support on the side section shown in . The supports include a horizontal portion extending from the lower edge on the side portions or which transitions into an angularly downward extending pad . As shown in the horizontal portion and the pad of each support are disposed and extend angularly inward from the generally linear side portions and and the end of the side portions and . As shown in the horizontal extending portions are configured to lie on the top edge of the seat back . The pads extend angularly downward from each horizontal extending portion to rest on the front surface of the seat back to support the headrest on the seat back .

A breakaway connector such as a pin not shown can be mounted through aligned apertures in each end of the cushion and complimentary apertures in the end portion of each side portions of the mounting member . The pin can be formed of plastic or other suitable material with a predetermined defined break strength so as to break at a predetermined force exerted on the cushion relative to the mounting member such as during a vehicle collision when the cushion is impacted by the user s head. The pin breaks thereby allowing the cushion to separate from the mounting member to minimize the potential for injury to the user s head.
