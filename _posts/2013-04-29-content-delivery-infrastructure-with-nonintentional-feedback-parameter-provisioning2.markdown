The present invention is related to allocating shared resources and more particularly to automatically adjusting resource allocation and automatic demand prediction in real time for highly interactive applications based on non intentional haptic feedback.

Typically provisioning and managing shared information technology IT and especially cloud infrastructure resources involves scheduling jobs according to deadlines allocating resources to scheduled jobs setting job priorities and predicting load and performance to maximize utilization. Job scheduling management is described for example by Feitelson Parallel job scheduling a status report 2005 and by Takefusa et al. A Study of Deadline Scheduling for Client Server Systems on the Computational Grid 2001.

In allocating resources and further in determining expected consolidation opportunities factors considered may include for example resource utilization application response time and energy consumption. Load estimates indicate the typical predicted user load which varies with actual use over time depending on how each user interacts with a respective application. Several well known load prediction techniques are available some of which consider user device interactions independent of whether allocation may be improved. Typically however service providers have monitored device requests on the provider server side to measure the degree of user interaction with cloud based applications. Utilization estimates project how many users are expected to utilize a particular service over time.

While these techniques may work well with stationary or for pseudo stationary clients client mobility can render these techniques ineffective. Mobile client devices typically run local applications that manage digital content consumption. State of the art mobile devices such as stand alone handheld multimedia players tablet computers personal digital assistants PDAs and smart phones have increasingly become major consumers of remotely stored and or streaming cloud content.

Thus there is a need for improved resource allocation strategies that consider feedback from mobile users and more particularly there is a need for capturing and using mobile user feedback for more accurately determining service usage tendencies and for more accurately determining when peak demand is likely to occur.

Another feature of the invention is resource allocation adjustment on the fly for highly interactive applications based on real time user responses 

Yet another feature of the invention is automatic resource allocation adjustment and demand prediction for highly interactive applications based on real time non intentional haptic feedback changing estimated expected mobile user average demand on the fly.

The present invention relates to a shared resource system method of managing shared resources and services and a computer program product therefor. Service provider computers e.g. cloud computers including a resource management system selectively make resource capacity available to networked client devices. Stored resource configuration parameters are collected from non intentional haptic input to mobile client devices. The resource management system provisions resources for mobile clients based on resource configuration parameters. Non intentional haptic input is provided as non intentional gesture feedback and evaluated to selectively update stored resource configuration parameters.

It is understood in advance that although this disclosure includes a detailed description on cloud computing implementation of the teachings recited herein are not limited to a cloud computing environment. Rather embodiments of the present invention are capable of being implemented in conjunction with any other type of computing environment now known or later developed and as further indicated hereinbelow.

Cloud computing is a model of service delivery for enabling convenient on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources e.g. networks network bandwidth servers processing memory storage applications virtual machines and services that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with a provider of the service. This cloud model may include at least five characteristics at least three service models and at least four deployment models.

On demand self service a cloud consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities such as server time and network storage as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with the service s provider.

Broad network access capabilities are available over a network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms e.g. mobile phones laptops and PDAs .

Resource pooling the provider s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi tenant model with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the consumer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction e.g. country state or datacenter .

Rapid elasticity capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned in some cases automatically to quickly scale out and rapidly released to quickly scale in. To the consumer the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any time.

Measured service cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service e.g. storage processing bandwidth and active user accounts . Resource usage can be monitored controlled and reported providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service. Moreover the present invention provides for client self monitoring for adjusting individual resource allocation and configuration on the fly for optimized resource allocation in real time and with operating costs and energy use minimized.

Software as a Service SaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider s applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a web browser e.g. web based e mail . The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network servers operating systems storage or even individual application capabilities with the possible exception of limited user specific application configuration settings.

Platform as a Service PaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer created or acquired applications created using programming languages and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including networks servers operating systems or storage but has control over the deployed applications and possibly application hosting environment configurations.

Infrastructure as a Service IaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing storage networks and other fundamental computing resources sometimes referred to as a hypervisor where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems storage deployed applications and possibly limited control of select networking components e.g. host firewalls .

Private cloud the cloud infrastructure is operated solely for an organization. It may be managed by the organization or a third party and may exist on premises or off premises.

Community cloud the cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns e.g. mission security requirements policy and compliance considerations . It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on premises or off premises.

Public cloud the cloud infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by an organization selling cloud services.

Hybrid cloud the cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds private community or public that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability e.g. cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds .

A cloud computing environment is service oriented with a focus on statelessness low coupling modularity and semantic interoperability. At the heart of cloud computing is an infrastructure comprising a network of interconnected nodes.

Referring now to a schematic of an example of a cloud computing node is shown. Cloud computing node is only one example of a suitable cloud computing node and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of embodiments of the invention described herein. Regardless cloud computing node is capable of being implemented and or performing any of the functionality set forth hereinabove.

In cloud computing node there is a computer system server which is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations. Examples of well known computing systems environments and or configurations that may be suitable for use with computer system server include but are not limited to personal computer systems server computer systems thin clients thick clients hand held or laptop devices multiprocessor systems microprocessor based systems set top boxes programmable consumer electronics network PCs minicomputer systems mainframe computer systems and distributed cloud computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices and the like.

Computer system server may be described in the general context of computer system executable instructions such as program modules being executed by a computer system. Generally program modules may include routines programs objects components logic data structures and so on that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Computer system server may be practiced in distributed cloud computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed cloud computing environment program modules may be located in both local and remote computer system storage media including memory storage devices.

As shown in computer system server in cloud computing node is shown in the form of a general purpose computing device. The components of computer system server may include but are not limited to one or more processors or processing units a system memory and a bus that couples various system components including system memory to processor .

Bus represents one or more of any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller a peripheral bus an accelerated graphics port and a processor or local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example and not limitation such architectures include Industry Standard Architecture ISA bus Micro Channel Architecture MCA bus Enhanced ISA EISA bus Video Electronics Standards Association VESA local bus and Peripheral Component Interconnects PCI bus.

Computer system server typically includes a variety of computer system readable media. Such media may be any available media that is accessible by computer system server and it includes both volatile and non volatile media removable and non removable media.

System memory can include computer system readable media in the form of volatile memory such as random access memory RAM and or cache memory . Computer system server may further include other removable non removable volatile non volatile computer system storage media. By way of example only storage system can be provided for reading from and writing to a non removable non volatile magnetic media not shown and typically called a hard drive . Although not shown a magnetic disk drive for reading from and writing to a removable non volatile magnetic disk e.g. a floppy disk and an optical disk drive for reading from or writing to a removable non volatile optical disk such as a CD ROM DVD ROM or other optical media can be provided. In such instances each can be connected to bus by one or more data media interfaces. As will be further depicted and described below memory may include at least one program product having a set e.g. at least one of program modules that are configured to carry out the functions of embodiments of the invention.

Each of the operating system one or more application programs other program modules and program data or some combination thereof may include an implementation of a networking environment. Program modules generally carry out the functions and or methodologies of embodiments of the invention as described herein.

Computer system server may also communicate with one or more external devices such as a keyboard a pointing device a display etc. one or more devices that enable a user to interact with computer system server and or any devices e.g. network card modem etc. that enable computer system server to communicate with one or more other computing devices. Such communication can occur via Input Output I O interfaces . Still yet computer system server can communicate with one or more networks such as a local area network LAN a general wide area network WAN and or a public network e.g. the Internet via network adapter . As depicted network adapter communicates with the other components of computer system server via bus . It should be understood that although not shown other hardware and or software components could be used in conjunction with computer system server . Examples include but are not limited to microcode device drivers redundant processing units external disk drive arrays RAID systems tape drives and data archival storage systems etc.

Referring now to illustrative cloud computing environment is depicted. As shown cloud computing environment comprises one or more cloud computing nodes with which local computing devices used by cloud consumers such as for example personal digital assistant PDA or cellular telephone A desktop computer B laptop computer C and or automobile computer system N may communicate. Nodes may communicate with one another. They may be grouped not shown physically or virtually in one or more networks such as Private Community Public or Hybrid clouds as described hereinabove or a combination thereof. This allows cloud computing environment to offer infrastructure platforms and or software as services for which a cloud consumer does not need to maintain resources on a local computing device. It is understood that the types of computing devices A N shown in are intended to be illustrative only and that computing nodes and cloud computing environment can communicate with any type of computerized device over any type of network and or network addressable connection e.g. using a web browser .

Referring now to a set of functional abstraction layers provided by cloud computing environment is shown. It should be understood in advance that the components layers and functions shown in are intended to be illustrative only and embodiments of the invention are not limited thereto. As depicted the following layers and corresponding functions are provided 

Hardware and software layer includes hardware and software components. Examples of hardware components include mainframes in one example IBM zSeries systems RISC Reduced Instruction Set Computer architecture based servers in one example IBM pSeries systems IBM xSeries systems IBM BladeCenter systems storage devices networks and networking components . Examples of software components include network application server software in one example IBM WebSphere application server software and database software in one example IBM DB2 database software. IBM zSeries pSeries xSeries BladeCenter WebSphere and DB2 are trademarks of International Business Machines Corporation registered in many jurisdictions worldwide .

Virtualization layer provides an abstraction layer from which the following examples of virtual entities may be provided virtual servers virtual storage virtual networks including virtual private networks virtual applications and operating systems and virtual clients.

In one example management layer may provide the functions described below. Resource provisioning provides dynamic procurement of computing resources and other resources that are utilized to perform tasks within the cloud computing environment. Metering and Pricing provide cost tracking as resources are utilized within the cloud computing environment and billing or invoicing for consumption of these resources. In one example these resources may comprise application software licenses. Security provides identity verification for cloud consumers and tasks as well as protection for data and other resources. User portal provides access to the cloud computing environment for consumers and system administrators. Service level management provides cloud computing resource allocation and management such that required service levels are met. Service Level Agreement SLA planning and fulfillment provide pre arrangement for and procurement of cloud computing resources for which a future requirement is anticipated in accordance with an SLA.

Workloads layer provides examples of functionality for which the cloud computing environment may be utilized. Examples of workloads and functions which may be provided from this layer include mapping and navigation software development and lifecycle management virtual classroom education delivery data analytics processing transaction processing and Mobile Desktop .

In this example the preferred hand held device e.g. a tablet computer or a smart phone such as cellular telephone A includes touch screen as an input and output peripheral I O . Embedded haptic technology includes one or more tactile sensors that measure forces exerted on the device user interface UI e.g. on touch screen and between touch screen and housing . The user interface is resident in internal device electronics e.g. in housing . The device consumes services hosted on cloud computers and communicates with management services from the management layer through Application Programming Interfaces APIs e.g. in user portal over a network e.g. wirelessly in this example.

In addition to sensing intentional user input haptic sensors sense non intentional input referred to herein as non intentional user feedback. The haptic interface receives and monitors incidental haptic input from the preferred hand held device in combination and coordination with haptic enabled cloud infrastructure. Non intentional user feedback data passes back through management services accessible via APIs where one or more shared systems determine the degree of user interaction and or infer user excitement experienced with a corresponding application or service.

Preferably two primary components or modules cooperate with the haptic enabled interface in sensing and interpreting non intentional user feedback a haptic app and a transparent cloud haptic application . The preferred haptic app is resident on the device . The haptic app may be installed in Mobile Desktop in cloud computing environment . Correspondingly the cloud haptic application is active in the cloud e.g. on one of the cloud computers . The cloud haptic application provides cloud services and receives and interprets non intentional input. The cloud haptic application further receives notifications indicating how the device user interacts with the resident haptic app .

Typically mobile applications or apps are considered as belonging to one of two categories highly interactive apps and limited interaction apps. A highly interactive app is an app that requires substantial user interaction e.g. by frequently touching a mobile device screen . This touching may include selecting objects dragging objects and moving the device e.g. rotating the device . For example a game or other app may require interaction using a touch screen accelerometers haptic sensors and tactile sensors. A limited interaction app requires very little sensor input e.g. web browsing. The present invention automatically adjusts resource demand prediction in real time changing estimated expected per user average demand on the fly based on historic increases in interaction over a past time horizon. App interaction type defines the degree of adjustment increase or reduction of resource demand for each user. Overall service resource prediction is iterative with a new iteration after each average user demand update.

So the haptic interface passes feeds back data from haptic sensors for tactilely sensing and measuring user force on the touch screen through the haptic app to the cloud haptic application . The cloud haptic application monitors haptic activity feedback data from sensors collecting and reporting non intentional haptic feedback to cloud managed resources where the feedback data may be stored e.g. in storage . The cloud haptic application may also interpret sense signals from sensors as response feedback for additional predictive resource allocation information.

Thus the preferred haptic interface and provisioned cloud services sense and interpret user originated physical interaction including for example gestures tactile manipulation surface contact zooming actions and tapping. The provisioned cloud services may classify haptic activities as utilization events and individually analyze feedback as a sequence of events and or collectively as events from a group of users. For example the group may be a community of students sharing IT infrastructure e.g. in a virtual classroom education delivery delivering digital educational content and educational applications.

In particular the preferred haptic interface haptic app and haptic application may monitor a group of users interacting with digital content material on touch screens collecting group feedback. Management layer may service haptic enabled mobile devices through special purpose modules or through typical normally provided modules that are modified for haptic feedback analysis. The analysis results provide demand prediction for determining resource provisioning parameters and monitoring utilization loads.

Metering and Pricing in for example may analyze how a user group interacts with running applications for a given resource allocation parameter set e.g. in storage based on collected non intentional feedback. So for example Metering and Pricing may estimate the probability of a peak load in near to middle range term receive and store information about user feedback from mobile devices and analyze the information to create and update user and group profiles and to identify application use trends.

Likewise SLA planning and fulfillment may include for example predicting demand based on current resource demand and feedback information determined by the feedback analyzer e.g. Metering and Pricing . Analyzing feedback predicts resource demands over a given time horizon from which SLA planning and fulfillment can recommend e.g. to system administrators parameter adjustments for resource provisioning to provide reports and for identifying parameters to adjust to cope with the service demands in delivering content to mobile devices. In addition preferably provisioning parameter information are tuned automatically for the number and characteristics of resources allocated to a given service. Service level management monitors the current resource utilization to determine past load prediction accuracy and corrects eventual mapping issues in mapping user gestures to load change characteristics.

A preferred mobile device may include a module responsible for collecting information about how a user interacts with active applications. The data from feedback sensor s quantify the level of force to the screen and or zoom in zoom out gestures. The haptic app provides collected haptic data to the cloud to facilitate efficiently hosting services and applications and delivering digital content and services to the preferred mobile device s .

A gesture evaluator evaluates feedback information for each mobile device to assess and select gesture sequences impacting resource consumption and system utilization. A group feedback evaluator collects individual feedback evaluation results for groups and evaluates the collections to assess how different group behaviors influence system load near or middle term. Then a parameter extractor extracts resource allocation parameters from feedback evaluation results. The resulting gesture feedback parameters are returned to the resource management system and stored for subsequent resource provisioning .

A load monitoring unit continually monitors actual load on provisioned resources. A demand predictor predicts resource demand for each hosted service . A gesture translation adjuster compares actual load from monitoring in real time against the predicted demand. If the real time demand matches predictions haptic data are correctly translated using gesture interpretation table . Otherwise one or more translation meanings need adjustment.

Group feedback evaluator combines group profiles from a group profile table and user profiles to produce a collective load table based on feedback information in gesture evaluation table . Thus the group profile table includes profile information for each group. The collective load table indicates how different group behaviors might influence system load in the near or middle range term.

Resource provisioning acts on previously made service resource allocations adjusting according to expected demand increases or decreases. As noted hereinabove load monitor continually monitors actual load on provisioned resources. Further monitored results are compared against predicted resource demand of each hosted service and compared. The comparison establishes whether to adjust gesture interpretation table meanings i.e. whether to correct adjust expected impact in identified demand need surges.

Thus the present invention uses non intentional user feedback to refine resource demand prediction. Estimating Information Technology IT resources demand may be done for example using time series analysis and Kalman filters. Series analysis is described for example by Box et al. Prentice Hall International Inc. 3rd edition 1994. Kalman filters are described for example by Kalman. A New Approach to Linear Filtering and Prediction Problems Vol. 82 Series D pp. 35 45 1960.

Accordingly application of the present invention improves resource allocation efficiency based on consideration of non intentional feedback in load prediction. Further the present invention pro actively recommends resource allocation adjustments on the fly for highly interactive applications in response to the non intentional feedback. Moreover the present invention automatically allocates and adjusts resources and demand prediction for highly interactive applications in real time based on non intentional haptic feedback changing estimated expected per user average demand on the fly.

While the invention has been described in terms of preferred embodiments those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. It is intended that all such variations and modifications fall within the scope of the appended claims. Examples and drawings are accordingly to be regarded as illustrative rather than restrictive.
