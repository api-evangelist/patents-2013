title: Fuze pull pin detent device
abstract: A grenade fuze assembly includes a fuze body and a striker lever fixed to the fuze body with a pull pin. A circular pull ring is attached to the pull pin. A detent device is disposed on a top portion of the fuze body and a top portion of the striker lever. The detent device includes four sides with a boss formed on an exterior of one of the four sides. The boss includes a curved slot for receiving and holding the pull ring. A pair of opposed locking tabs on opposite interior sides of the detent device engage the top portion of the fuze body. The detent device secures the pull ring to prevent accidental removal of the pull pin when the grenade is dropped and to prevent undesired noise cause by movement of the pull pin and pull ring.

When it explodes the time delay fragmentation anti personnel hand grenade launches hundreds of small metal fragments in every direction. These sorts of grenades are designed to be durable easy to use and easy to manufacture. The grenade firing mechanism is triggered by a spring loaded striker inside the grenade. Normally the striker is held in place by the striker lever on top of the grenade which is held in place by the pull pin. The pull pin has a pull ring attached at one end. In use a soldier grips the grenade so the striker lever is pushed up against the grenade body grips the pull ring and removes the pull pin and then tosses the grenade.

Retaining the pull pin in place is a concern with grenade fuzes. If the pull pin is inadvertently removed the grenade becomes armed. In the past soldiers would tape the pull ring to the grenade fuze in an attempt to enhance safety and to reduce noise caused by movement of the pull ring and pull pin. Removing the tape however sometimes inadvertently and undesirably removed the pull pin. To overcome this problem some grenades now include a confidence clip to support the pull ring. However the confidence clip is not a completely satisfactory solution. And the pull pin may still generate undesired noise when the grenade is moved even with the confidence clip.

A need exists for an apparatus that can be installed on existing grenades to prevent accidental removal of the pull pin when the grenade is dropped and to prevent undesired noise cause by movement of the pull pin and pull ring.

One aspect of the invention is a detent device for securely holding the pull ring of a grenade. The detent device includes a generally rectangular hollow body having four sides. A boss is formed on the exterior of one of the four sides. The boss includes a curved slot for receiving and holding the pull ring with a snap fit. The curved slot includes a narrowed opening. A pair of opposed locking tabs are formed on respective opposite interiors of two of the four sides of the detent device. The pair of opposed locking tabs provide a snap fit with the fuze body to thereby constrain translation of the detent device with respect to the fuze body along the longitudinal axis of the grenade fuze body. One of the four sides is an angled side that is angled with respect to a top surface of the detent device. One of the four sides opposite the angled side is normal to the top surface of the detent device.

Another aspect of the invention is a grenade fuze assembly including a fuze body with a longitudinal axis. A striker lever is fixed to the fuze body with a pull pin. A circular pull ring is attached to the pull pin. The pull ring is made of a wire with a circular cross section. A detent device is disposed on a top portion of the fuze body and a top portion of the striker lever. The detent device includes four sides. A boss is formed on an exterior of one of the four sides. The boss includes a curved slot for receiving and holding the pull ring. A pair of opposed locking tabs are formed on respective opposite interiors of two of the four sides of the detent device. The pair of opposed locking tabs engage the top portion of the fuze body.

The pull ring may include an overlapping portion having two coils of the wire. The curved slot may include a narrowed opening. The pull ring and the curved slot may form a snap fit. The opposed locking tabs may create a snap fit with the top portion of the fuze body.

Each locking tab may include a shoulder that engages an edge of the strike lever. The opposed locking tabs may constrain translation of the detent device with respect to the fuze body along the longitudinal axis.

One of the four sides of the detent device may be an angled side that is angled with respect to a top surface of the detent device to conform to a surface of the striker lever. One of the four sides opposite the angled side may be normal to the top surface of the detent device.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

As seen in detent device is a generally rectangular hollow body having four sides . Sides and are opposing sides and sides and are opposing sides. The exterior of side includes a boss formed thereon. Boss includes a curved slot for receiving and holding pull ring . Curved slot has a narrowed opening such that a small amount of force is needed to insert pull ring in slot and remove pull ring from slot . Thus as seen in pull ring is held in slot with a press friction or snap fit.

A pair of opposed locking tabs are formed on respective interiors of opposing sides of detent device . Tabs have a varying thickness that increases in the direction away from fuze body . In the thickness of tab increases in an upward direction. In because detent device is shown upside down the thickness of tab increases in a downward direction. Tabs may have a ramp profile. When detent device is pushed onto top portion of fuze body and top portion of strike lever a shoulder at the top of each tab engages a bottom edge of strike lever providing a press friction or snap fit. Only one shoulder can be seen in . Shoulders restrain translation of detent device with respect to fuze body along longitudinal axis A.

As best seen in side of detent device is angled to conform to the angle of surface of strike lever . Side that is opposite side may be normal to top surface of detent device .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
