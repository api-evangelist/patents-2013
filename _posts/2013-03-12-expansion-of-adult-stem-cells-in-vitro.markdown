As used herein stem cells for example hematopoietic stem cells refer to the term as it is generally understood in the art. For example stem cells for example hematopoietic stem cells regardless of their source are cells that are capable of dividing and renewing themselves for long periods are unspecialized undifferentiated and possess the ability to give rise to differentiate into specialized cell types for example they are progenitor or precursor cells for a variety of different specialized cell types . In certain instances herein stem cells for example hematopoietic stem cells described herein refer to long term stem cells for example hematopoietic stem cells .

The term long term when used in connection with stem cells for example hematopoietic stem cells refers to the ability of stem cells for example hematopoietic stem cells to renew themselves by dividing into the same non specialized cell type over long periods for example 1 month 2 months 3 months 4 months 6 months 8 months 9 months 12 months 2 years 3 years depending on the specific type of stem cell. In some embodiments stem cells for example hematopoietic stem cells are identified by the presence of the following cell surface markers c kit Sca 1 CD34low CD38 and or Thy1 low. In some embodiments human stem cells for example hematopoietic stem cells are identified by the presence of the following markers CD34 CD38low c kit low and or Thy1 . In some embodiments both human and murine stem cells for example hematopoietic stem cells lack cell lineage markers such as CD2 CD3 CD4 CD5 CD8 NK1.1 B220 Ter 119 and or Gr 1.

In some embodiments homologues analogues or fragments of polypeptides described herein include an amino acid sequence that is at least 40 to 100 identical for example at least 40 45 . 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 86 87 88 90 91 92 94 95 96 97 98 or any other percent from about 40 to about 100 identical to the polypeptide.

To determine the percent homology of two amino acid sequences or of two nucleic acids the sequences is aligned for optimal comparison purposes for example gaps are introduced in the sequence of a first amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment with a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence . The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions can then be compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent homology between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences identity of identical positions total of positions for example overlapping positions 100 . In some embodiments the two sequences are the same length.

To determine percent homology between two sequences the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul 1990 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87 2264 2268 modified as in Karlin and Altschul 1993 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 5873 5877 is used. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul et al. 1990 J. Mol. Biol. 215 403 410. BLAST nucleotide searches is performed with the NBLAST program score 100 wordlength 12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecules described or disclose herein. BLAST protein searches is performed with the XBLAST program score 50 wordlength 3. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes Gapped BLAST is utilized as described in Altschul et al. 1997 Nucleic Acids Res. 25 3389 3402. When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs the default parameters of the respective programs for example XBLAST and NBLAST are used. See the website of the National Center for Biotechnology Information for further details on the World Wide Web at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . Proteins suitable for use in the methods described herein also includes proteins having between 1 to 15 amino acid changes for example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 or 15 amino acid substitutions deletions or additions compared to the amino acid sequence of any protein described herein. In other embodiments the altered amino acid sequence is at least 75 identical for example 77 80 82 85 88 90 92 95 97 98 99 or 100 identical to the amino acid sequence of any protein inhibitor described herein. Such sequence variant proteins are suitable for the methods described herein as long as the altered amino acid sequence retains sufficient biological activity to be functional in the compositions and methods described herein. In certain instances conservative amino acid substitutions are utilized. Illustrative conservative substitution among amino acids are within each of the following groups 1 glycine alanine valine leucine and isoleucine 2 phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan 3 serine and threonine 4 aspartate and glutamate 5 glutamine and asparagine and 6 lysine arginine and histidine. The BLOSUM62 table is an amino acid substitution matrix derived from about 2 000 local multiple alignments of protein sequence segments representing highly conserved regions of more than 500 groups of related proteins Henikoff et al. 1992 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 10915 10919 . The BLOSUM62 substitution frequencies are used to define conservative amino acid substitutions that in some embodiments are introduced into the amino acid sequences described or disclosed herein. Although it is possible to design amino acid substitutions based solely upon chemical properties as discussed above the language conservative amino acid substitution preferably refers to a substitution represented by a BLOSUM62 value of greater than 1. For example an amino acid substitution is conservative if the substitution is characterized by a BLOSUM62 value of 0 1 2 or 3. According to this system preferred conservative amino acid substitutions are characterized by a BLOSUM62 value of at least 1 for example 1 2 or 3 while more preferred conservative amino acid substitutions are characterized by a BLOSUM62 value of at least 2 for example 2 or 3 .

As used herein the term nucleic acid refers to a nucleic acid that is engineered through the combination or insertion of one or more nucleic acids thereby combining sequences that would not normally occur together in nature. In some embodiments nucleic acids comprise inducers or enhancers. In some embodiments nucleic acids comprise restriction enzyme sites. In some embodiments nucleic acids encode polypeptides. In some embodiments nucleic acids comprise mutations.

As used herein the term transgene refers to the integration of a nucleic acid that encodes a polypeptide into the genomic DNA of an animal bacteria virus or cell.

As used herein over expression refers to a higher level of expression when compared to the endogenous level of expression of an identical polypeptide or protein within the same cell. In certain instances over expression refers to expression of a polypeptide. In some embodiments a higher level of expression comprises 2 to 200 higher. In some embodiments a higher level of expression comprises 2 fold to 1000 fold higher. In some embodiments a higher level of expression comprises 2 fold to 1000 fold higher. In some embodiments a higher level of expression comprises 2 fold to 10 000 fold higher. In some embodiments a higher level of expression comprises a detectable level of expression when compared to a previous undetectable level of expression. In some embodiments over expression refers to any detectable level of expression of an exogenous polypeptide or protein.

The terms polypeptide peptide and protein are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to naturally occurring amino acid polymers as well as amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residues is a non naturally occurring amino acid for example an amino acid analog. As used herein the terms encompass amino acid chains of any length including full length proteins wherein the amino acid residues are linked by covalent peptide bonds.

As used herein reference to an isolated protein or polypeptide in the present embodiments include full length proteins fusion proteins chimeric proteins or any fragment truncated form portion or homologue of such a protein. More specifically an isolated protein can be a protein including a polypeptide or peptide that has been removed from its natural milieu i.e. that has been subject to human manipulation and can include but is not limited to purified proteins partially purified proteins recombinantly produced proteins membrane bound proteins proteins complexed with lipids soluble proteins synthetically produced proteins and isolated proteins associated with other proteins. As such isolated does not reflect the extent to which the protein has been purified. Preferably an isolated protein is produced recombinantly.

Preferably an isolated nucleic acid molecule is produced using recombinant DNA technology for example polymerase chain reaction PCR amplification cloning or chemical synthesis. Isolated nucleic acid molecules include natural nucleic acid molecules and homologues thereof including but not limited to natural allelic variants and modified nucleic acid molecules in which nucleotides have been inserted deleted substituted and or inverted in such a manner that such modifications provide the desired effect for example provision of an inducible protooncogene as described herein .

A nucleic acid molecule homologue can be produced using a number of methods known to those skilled in the art see for example Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Labs Press 1989 . For example nucleic acid molecules can be modified using a variety of techniques including but not limited to classic mutagenesis techniques and recombinant DNA techniques such as site directed mutagenesis chemical treatment of a nucleic acid molecule to induce mutations restriction enzyme cleavage of a nucleic acid fragment ligation of nucleic acid fragments PCR amplification and or mutagenesis of selected regions of a nucleic acid sequence synthesis of oligonucleotide mixtures and ligation of mixture groups to build a mixture of nucleic acid molecules and combinations thereof. Nucleic acid molecule homologues can be selected from a mixture of modified nucleic acids by screening for the function of the protein encoded by the nucleic acid and or by hybridization with a wild type gene.

The minimum size of a nucleic acid molecule or polynucleotide is a size sufficient to encode a protein useful for embodiments provided herein such as a protein encoded by a protooncogene or functional portion thereof for example a portion that has the biological activity of the full length protein and that is sufficient for use in the method or an anti apoptotic protein or a functional portion thereof for example a portion that has the biological activity of the full length protein and that is sufficient for use in the method . Other nucleic acid molecules that may be useful can include nucleic acid molecules of a minimum size sufficient to form a probe or oligonucleotide primer that is capable of forming a stable hybrid with the complementary sequence of a nucleic acid molecule encoding the natural protein for example under moderate high or very high stringency conditions which is typically at least 5 nucleotides in length and preferably ranges from about 5 to about 50 or about 500 nucleotides or greater including any length in between in whole number increments i.e. 5 6 7 8 9 10 . . . 33 34 . . . 256 257 . . . 500 . There is no limit other than a practical limit on the maximal size of a nucleic acid molecule in that the nucleic acid molecule can include a sequence or sequences sufficient to be useful in any of the embodiments described herein.

As used herein stringent hybridization conditions refer to standard hybridization conditions under which nucleic acid molecules are used to identify similar nucleic acid molecules. Such standard conditions are disclosed for example in Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Labs Press 1989. Sambrook et al. ibid. is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety see specifically pages 9.31 9.62 . In addition formulae to calculate the appropriate hybridization and wash conditions to achieve hybridization permitting varying degrees of mismatch of nucleotides are disclosed for example in Meinkoth et al. 1984 Anal. Biochem. 138 267 284 Meinkoth et al. ibid. is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

More particularly moderate stringency hybridization and washing conditions as referred to herein refer to conditions which permit isolation of nucleic acid molecules having at least about 70 nucleic acid sequence identity with the nucleic acid molecule being used to probe in the hybridization reaction for example conditions permitting about 30 or less mismatch of nucleotides . High stringency hybridization and washing conditions as referred to herein refer to conditions which permit isolation of nucleic acid molecules having at least about 80 nucleic acid sequence identity with the nucleic acid molecule being used to probe in the hybridization reaction for example conditions permitting about 20 or less mismatch of nucleotides . Very high stringency hybridization and washing conditions as referred to herein refer to conditions which permit isolation of nucleic acid molecules having at least about 90 nucleic acid sequence identity with the nucleic acid molecule being used to probe in the hybridization reaction for example conditions permitting about 10 or less mismatch of nucleotides . As discussed above one of skill in the art can use the formulae in Meinkoth et al. ibid. to calculate the appropriate hybridization and wash conditions to achieve these particular levels of nucleotide mismatch. Such conditions will vary depending on whether DNA RNA or DNA DNA hybrids are being formed. Calculated melting temperatures for DNA DNA hybrids are 10 C. less than for DNA RNA hybrids. In particular embodiments stringent hybridization conditions for DNA DNA hybrids include hybridization at an ionic strength of 6 SSC 0.9 M Na at a temperature of between about 20 C. and about 35 C. lower stringency more preferably between about 28 C. and about 40 C. more stringent and even more preferably between about 35 C. and about 45 C. even more stringent with appropriate wash conditions. In particular embodiments stringent hybridization conditions for DNA RNA hybrids include hybridization at an ionic strength of 6 SSC 0.9 M Na at a temperature of between about 30 C. and about 45 C. more preferably between about 38 C. and about 50 C. and even more preferably between about 45 C. and about 55 C. with similarly stringent wash conditions. These values are based on calculations of a melting temperature for molecules larger than about 100 nucleotides 0 formamide and a G C content of about 40 . Alternatively Tcan be calculated empirically as set forth in Sambrook et al. supra pages 9.31 to 9.62. In general the wash conditions should be as stringent as possible and should be appropriate for the chosen hybridization conditions. For example hybridization conditions can include a combination of salt and temperature conditions that are approximately 20 25 C. below the calculated Tof a particular hybrid and wash conditions typically include a combination of salt and temperature conditions that are approximately 12 20 C. below the calculated Tof the particular hybrid. One example of hybridization conditions suitable for use with DNA DNA hybrids includes a 2 24 hour hybridization in 6 SSC 50 formamide at about 42 C. followed by washing steps that include one or more washes at room temperature in about 2 SSC followed by additional washes at higher temperatures and lower ionic strength for example at least one wash as about 37 C. in about 0.1 0.5 SSC followed by at least one wash at about 68 C. in about 0.1 0.5 SSC .

In some embodiments any amino acid sequence described herein including truncated forms fragments or portions and homologues of such sequences can be produced with from at least one and up to about 20 additional heterologous amino acids flanking each of the C and or N terminal end of the given amino acid sequence. The resulting protein or polypeptide can be referred to as consisting essentially of a given amino acid sequence. Heterologous amino acids are a sequence of amino acids that are not naturally found i.e. not found in nature in vivo flanking the given amino acid sequence or which would not be encoded by the nucleotides that flank the naturally occurring nucleic acid sequence encoding the given amino acid sequence as it occurs in the gene if such nucleotides in the naturally occurring sequence were translated using standard codon usage for the organism from which the given amino acid sequence is derived. Similarly the phrase consisting essentially of when used with reference to a nucleic acid sequence herein refers to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a given amino acid sequence that can be flanked by from at least one and up to as many as about 60 additional heterologous nucleotides at each of the 5 and or the 3 end of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the given amino acid sequence. The heterologous nucleotides are not naturally found i.e. not found in nature in vivo flanking the nucleic acid sequence encoding the given amino acid sequence as it occurs in the natural gene.

A recombinant vector also referred to generally as a recombinant nucleic acid molecule particularly when it contains a nucleic acid sequence of interest is an engineered for example artificially produced nucleic acid molecule that is used as a tool for manipulating a nucleic acid sequence of choice and for introducing such a nucleic acid sequence into a host cell. The recombinant vector is therefore suitable for use in cloning sequencing and or otherwise manipulating the nucleic acid sequence of choice such as by expressing and or delivering the nucleic acid sequence of choice into a host cell. Such a vector typically contains heterologous nucleic acid sequences for example nucleic acid sequences that are not naturally or usually found adjacent to a nucleic acid sequence to be cloned or delivered although the vector can also contain regulatory nucleic acid sequences for example promoters untranslated regions which are naturally found adjacent to nucleic acid molecules or which are useful for expression of the nucleic acid molecules discussed in detail below . A vector can be either RNA or DNA either prokaryotic or eukaryotic and typically is a plasmid or a viral vector. The vector can be maintained as an extrachromosomal element for example a plasmid or it can be integrated into the chromosome of a host cell. The entire vector can remain in place within a host cell or under certain conditions the plasmid DNA can be deleted leaving behind the nucleic acid molecule. Under other conditions the vector is designed to be excised removed from the genome of the host cell at a selected time described in more detail below . The integrated nucleic acid molecule can be under chromosomal promoter control under native or plasmid promoter control or under a combination of several promoter controls. Single or multiple copies of the nucleic acid molecule can be integrated into the chromosome. A recombinant vector can contain at least one selectable marker.

In some embodiments the stem cells can include any adult stem cells obtained from any source. In another embodiment stem cells can include embryonic stem cells. Stem cells can include but are not limited to hematopoietic stem cells mesenchymal stem cells including but not limited to lung mesenchymal stem cells bone marrow stromal cells neural stem cells epithelial stem cells including but not limited to lung epithelial stem cells breast epithelial stem cells vascular epithelial stem cells and intestinal epithelial stem cells intestinal stem cells cardiac myocyte progenitor stem cells skin stem cells including but not limited to epidermal stem cells and follicular stem cells hair follicle stem cells skeletal muscle stem cells osteoblastic precursor stem cells and liver stem cells.

Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to all of the types of blood cells including but not limited to red blood cells erythrocytes B lymphocytes T lymphocytes natural killer cells neutrophils basophils eosinophils monocytes macrophages and platelets.

Mesenchymal stem cells including bone marrow stromal cells give rise to a variety of cell types including but not limited to bone cells osteocytes cartilage cells chondrocytes fat cells adipocytes lung cells and other kinds of connective tissue cells such as those in tendons.

Neural stem cells in the brain give rise to its three major cell types nerve cells neurons and two categories of non neuronal cells astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.

Epithelial stem cells in the lining of various tissues give rise to several cell types that form the epithelium in tissues.

Skin stem cells occur in the basal layer of the epidermis and at the base of hair follicles. The epidermal stem cells give rise to keratinocytes which migrate to the surface of the skin and form a protective layer and the follicular stem cells can give rise to both the hair follicle and to the epidermis. Other sources of adult stem cells will be known to those of skill in the art.

The long term repopulating hematopoietic stem cell LT HSC population self renews in vivo and supports hematopoiesis for the lifetime of the individual. Long term HSCs are of importance in the context of bone marrow stem cell transplantation among others.

The function of hematopoietic stem cells HSCs in vivo is dependent on complex micro environmental signals that determine self renewal lineage commitment and differentiation. Attempts to expand HSC populations have been hampered by the inability to maintain pluripotency and to prevent differentiation while allowing self renewal Bernstein I.D. and Delaney C. 2012 .

The nature of the expanded cells varies among these different approaches yielding mixed results in xenochimaeric transplanted mouse studies and in the clinic Walasek M. A. et al. 2012 . Ann NY Acad Sci 1266 138 50 .

Obstacles in current stem cell therapies include difficulties obtaining sufficient numbers of needed cells and identification of allogeneically appropriate donors. Some embodiments described herein allow for the ability to generate large numbers of HSCs. The ability to transplant a pure and homogeneous population of stem cells also allows for reconstitution of irradiated hosts across allogeneic barriers.

In some embodiments a method for producing a population of conditionally immortalized adult stem cells protein transduced long term HSCs ptlt HSCs is provided. The method can comprise providing one or more adult stem cells with a an exogenously synthesized Myc polypeptide that promotes one or more of cell survival or proliferation and b an exogenously synthesized Bcl 2 domain polypeptide that inhibits apoptosis. In some embodiments the Myc polypeptide is provided to the one or more adult stem cells at intervals of at least about 72 hours. In some embodiments the Bcl 2 domain polypeptide is provided to the one or more adult stem cells at intervals of at least about 96 hours so as to produce a population of conditionally immortalized adult stem cells. The term exogenously synthesized denotes that the proteins are not synthesized within the cells that they are acting upon. In some embodiments the exogenously synthesized proteins are added to the cells in an isolated form for example buffer and just these proteins . In some embodiments the exogenously synthesized proteins are produced by a first population of cells separate from the stem cells.

Although not intending to be bound by theory the function of the proto oncogene encoded protein for example Myc polypeptide appears to prevent exit of HSCs from the cell cycle driving their continuous proliferation and inhibiting their differentiation. Signals provided by the cytokine cocktail including IL 3 IL 6 SCF and other cytokines maintain the HSC phenotype of proliferating ptlt HSC cells. The survival function provided by the anti apoptotic protein for example Bcl 2 domain polypeptide allows rescue of ptlt HSC cells from the apoptotic death that would normally follow withdrawal of the proto oncogene encoded protein function. This appears to allow the HSCs to regain their ability to use physiologically available survival signals in vivo. Thus in some embodiments the method can include driving proliferation and inhibiting differentiation and can comprise applying both Bcl 2 domain polypeptides and Myc polypeptides and subsequently withdrawing the Myc polypeptide or allowing its levels to decrease while keeping some amount of Bcl 2 present so that the cells survive the withdrawal of Myc allowing them to be subsequently differentiated.

While not intending to be bound by theory it appears that upon adoptive transfer of ptlt HSCs the anti apoptotic protein survival function allows cells to habituate to micro environmental signals provided by the bone marrow stem cell niche. In conditions of need such as radiation induced lymphopenia these signals may drive differentiation of ptlt HSCs to generate functional lymphoid cells and other differentiated blood cells. It is noted that no leukemias were observed in mice reconstituted with ptlt HSCs. Thus in some embodiments methods for generating such advantageous cells are provided herein.

In some embodiments the method can include stopping and or reducing the addition of Myc so that the amount of Myc in the media decreases over time. During this period of time in which the amount of Myc is decreasing one can continue to add Bcl 2 when appropriate to maintain an acceptable level of Bcl 2.

In some embodiment the Myc polypeptide is provided at intervals of at least about 72 hours. In some embodiments the Myc polypeptide can be provided more frequently for example every 24 32 40 48 56 or 64 hours.

In some embodiments the Myc polypeptide and or Bcl 2 domain polypeptide is administered no more frequently than one time each hour for example once every two hours once every three hours once every four hours once every five hours once every six hours once every seven hours once every eight hours once every nine hours once every 10 hours once every 11 hours once every 12 hours once every 13 hours once every 14 hours once every 15 hours once every 16 hours once every 17 hours once every 18 hours once every 19 hours once every 20 hours once every 21 hours once every 22 hours once every 23 hours or once every 24 hours. In some embodiments the Myc polypeptide and or Bcl 2 domain polypeptide is administered no more frequently than one time each day for example once every two days once every three days or once every four days. In some embodiments this can be achieved despite the short half life of traditional Myc polypeptides for example 36 minutes by using the various embodiments of the Myc polypeptide provided herein. In some embodiments despite the low frequency of administration of the Myc polypeptide the amount of Myc polypeptide administered at one time will be less than about 100 micrograms ml for example 50 100 micrograms ml or 20 micrograms ml or less. In such situations because of the extended half life the Myc can still be effective for one or more of the above noted periods of time without needing additional Myc polypeptide for example. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 12 16 24 or 48 hours without additional Myc polypeptide being required while still providing an effective level of Myc activity to the cells .

Eight weeks post transplant the mice were bled via the tail vein to assess reconstitution by flow cytometry using the following antibodies anti human CD3 hCD3 Biolegend Cat 300312 anti human CD19 hCD19 Biolegend Cat 302208 and anti human CD45 hCD45 Biolegend Cat 304028 .

Short term development of human CD45 expressing T and B cells in NSG chimaeric mice generated with 1 10unfractionated cord blood cells was observed. However the introduction of 1 10protein transduced long term ptlt HSC generated in vitro by culture with Tat Myc and Tat Bcl 2 for 14 days resulted in a higher frequency of human CD45 cells in xenochimaeric NSG mice. In addition human CD45 cells could be observed in the peripheral blood of the mice for up to 20 weeks post transplant . Human CD45 CD34 CD38lo HSCs were found in the bone marrow human CD45 CD3 and human CD45 CD19 lymphoid cells were found in the spleen and human CD45 CD3 lymphoid cells were found in the thymus of xenochimaeric mice.

Human CD45 CD19 cells from the spleens of xenochimaeric NSG mice were labeled with CFSE and were activated with monoclonal antibodies to human CD40 and IgM. The cells were analyzed at 72 hours by flow cytometry for dilution of CFSE. shows the proliferation profile of the human B cells that developed in vivo in xenochimaeric NSG mice.

Human CD45 CD34 CD38lo HSCs from the bone marrow of xenochimaeric NSG mice were used to seed in MethoCult Optimum. These cells gave rise to colonies in MethoCult plates and some of the colonies could still be observed following serial replating . The number of colonies in both instances was significantly higher for NSG mice reconstituted with human cord blood cells cultured for 14 days with Tat Myc and Tat Bcl 2 than for cells obtained from NSG mice reconstituted with fresh un manipulated human cord blood cells.

In addition a cohort of xenochimaeric mice engrafted with 106 cord blood cells previously expanded in vitro in a cocktail of cytokines supplemented with Tat Myc and Tat Bcl 2 black squares were assessed for myeloid and lymphoid cell differentiation. The CD45 positive population of bone marrow cells and spleen cells were analyzed for CD11b CD33 CD3 and CD19 expression. Both myeloid and lymphoid cell differentiation was observed in the bone marrow and spleen of these xenochimaeric mice.

G CSF mobilized cells were received in a 1 ml volume of elutriated blood from 5 patients who underwent G CSF mobilization for autologous HSC transplantation. All G CSF samples were de identified and no further identifying information was associated with the cells used for these studies. The cells were added drop wise to 10 ml of FCB media. The cells were washed twice in FCB media and treated with 5 g ml recombinant Tat Myc and 10 g ml recombinant Tat Bcl 2 in a 10 ml volume. Cells 5 10 were seeded in the G Rex 100 cell expansion device Wilson Wolf Manufacturing according to the manufacturer s recommendation.

The cells were expanded in media supplemented with cytokines plus Tat Myc and Tat Bcl2 14 days. The FACS profile of the expanded HSCs shows a distinct population of hCD45 CD34 CD38hi CD133 cells . The kinetics of cell expansion are illustrated in .

The expanded adult GCS F mobilized HSCs were then plated on MethoCult Optimum in order to characterize their differentiation potential in vitro. The four colony types normally observed in the media that supports myeloerythroid differentiation were obtained and some of these colony types were also observed upon serial replating.

The expanded adult HSCs were able to reconstitute sublethally irradiated NSG mice. shows a FACS analysis of the CD45 staining of bone marrow from NSG mice transplanted 12 weeks earlier with either 106 expanded G CSF and Tat Myc Tat Bcl 2 mobilized HSCs first panel or 5 10fresh un manipulated cord blood cells second panel .

The NSG xenochimaeric mice generated with G CSF mobilized cells cultured with Tat Myc and Tat Bcl 2 were euthanized and bone marrow spleen and thymus were collected for further analysis. The analysis of lymphoid organs from xenochimaeric NSG mice reconstituted with expanded adult HSCs showed that there were human CD45 CD34 CD38lo cells in the bone marrow first panel human CD45 CD3 lymphoid cells in the spleen second panel and thymus third panel of those mice. Together these data demonstrate that one can successfully expand the HSC population obtained from human G CSF mobilized adult blood.

A cohort of xenochimaeric mice engrafted with 10expanded G CSF mobilized cells expanded in vitro in a cocktail of cytokines supplemented with Tat Myc and Tat Bcl 2 black squares were assessed for myeloid and lymphoid cell differentiation. The CD45 positive population of bone marrow cells and spleen cells were analyzed for CD11b CD33 CD3 and CD19 expression. Both myeloid and lymphoid cell differentiation was observed in the bone marrow and spleen of these xenochimaeric mice. In addition the mature human B cells derived from the primary xenotranplant responded to stimulation of the antigen receptors in vitro as determined by CFSE dilution by flow cytometry . Similar observations were derived when mature human B cells that developed from the first serial transplant were activated in vitro with antibodies to IgM and CD40 .

Five Myc fusion proteins in addition to the Tat Myc fusion protein described in Example 1 were generated and purified using the same approach described there. The plasmids were made by PCR amplification of the coding region using a forward primer that contains an in frame N terminal PTD amino acid sequence and a reverse primer that removed the stop codon. The PCR product was then cloned into pET101 D Topo Invitrogen vector which includes a C terminal V5 epitope and 6 histidine purification tag. shows a diagrammatic representation of the Myc fusion proteins as compared with Tat Myc from Example 1. In each a protein transduction PTD is fused in frame before or after the Myc polypeptide.

Protein transduction domains included Tat EPTD and Vpr. EPTD is an optimized protein transduction domain YARAAARQARA SEQ ID NO 6 taken from Ho A. et al. Synthetic protein transduction domains enhanced transduction potential in vitro and in vivo. Cancer Res. 2001 61 474 477 . Vpr transduction domain was as identified by Taguchi T. et al. Nuclear trafficking of macromolecules by an oligopeptide derived from Vpr of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004 320 1 18 26 .

Myc was either the ORF of the polypeptide as described in Example 1 or of the 3AMyc sequence previously described by Huang Z. et al. Negative control of the Myc protein by the stress responsive kinase Pak 2. Mol Cell Biol 2004 24 4 1582 94 . The recombinant proteins also encoded a V5 peptide tag and a 6 His tag to facilitate detection and purification. .

The Myc fusion proteins described in Example 9 Tat Myc Tat 3AMyc EPTD Myc Vpr Myc and Myc Vpr were tested for Myc biological activity in an activated T cell viability assay . A spleen was harvested from a C57BL.6j Jackson mouse and mechanically dissociated through wire mess. The red blood cells were removed and the T cells were activated with 1 ug ml anti CD3 2c11 . The cells were plated into a 24 well cluster dish at 3 10 6 cells per well in 1 ml of media. 48 hrs later the live cells were captured on a Ficol cushion washed and plated in a 24 well cluster dishes at 1 1.5 10 6 cells per well. The PTD Myc proteins were titrated onto the T cells at 0.5 1 5 10 25 or 50 ug ml. 48 hrs after the PTD Myc protein treatment the cells were assessed for viability by flow cytometry forward side scatter . In the data presented are for the 25 ug ml protein treatment.

As shown in all the constructs tested except Tat 3AMyc resulted in greater T cell viability after 48 hours than the untreated control. However no construct resulted in greater T cell viability than Tat Myc described in Example 1.

In a similar experiment the activity of Tat Myc and Tat Bcl 2 at various concentrations is shown in Table 5 below. T cells from spleens of C57BL.6j Jackson mice are activated with 1 ug ml anti CD3 2c11 . Following activation 48 hours later the cells were washed were plated at about 1 1.5 10cells well and fusion proteins Tat Myc or Tat Bcl 2 at various concentrations 0.5 1 5 10 25 or 50 ug ml were added. After 48 hours the percent of live cells was determined by flow cytometry forward side scatter as shown in Table 5 below.

For both Tat Myc and Tat Bcl 2 and at all concentrations tested cell viability and or proliferation is increased as compared with cells incubated in the absence of either fusion protein.

In a separate experiment using the same methods provides the FACS data for the live gate for activated T cells treated with 50 ug ml of fusion proteins Tat Bcl 2 and Tat Myc are compared with control Tat Cre or no treatment . As shown both Tat Myc and Tat Bcl 2 treatments result in significantly improved T cell survival and or proliferation.

A variety of cytokine cocktails in base media were tested for their ability to support stem cell survival and or proliferation.

On Day 0 cord blood was overlayered on a Ficoll gradient to enrich for mononuclear cells and remove red cells. The cells were then washed and incubated in StemSpan media alone or with various cytokine combinations as shown in Table 6 below.

To generate cytokines 293FT cells were plated in 150 mm plates at 12 10cells per plate in D10 media DMEM 10 FBS 100 units per ml Penn Strep MEM NEAA Gibco 2 mM L glutamine Gibco . The cells were transfected with 30 g total DNA per plate consisting of 10 g pcDNA3.1 SCF 10 g pcDNA3.1 IL3 and 10 g pcDNA3.1 IL6 or 10 g pcDNA3.1 TPO 10 g pcDNA3.1 Flt3 L and 10 g pcDNA3.1 GM CSF using calcium phosphate. The following day the media was removed and replaced with 100 ml D10 media. Cells were incubated at 37 C. 5 COfor 4 5 days. The media was collected sterile filtered and frozen at 20 C. in 30 ml aliquots. Cytokines were added to the expansion media by adding 30 mls of conditioned media containing the three cytokines IL3 IL6 SCF and 30 mls of conditioned media containing TPO Flt3 L GM CSF per 500 ml bottle of media.

On days 4 7 10 13 16 and 19 samples were taken to determine the percent of CD34 cells by flow cytometry using standard techniques. Cytokines were not replenished after Day 0. As shown in Table 6 the combination of StemSpan media plus 11 3 11 6 TPO thrombopoeitin Flt3 L and GM CSF showed the best survival and proliferation to cells see for example Day 13 .

A variety of cytokine cocktails in base media with or without Tat fusion proteins TMTB were tested for their ability to support stem cell survival and or proliferation.

Cord blood was prepared on Ficol density gradient to remove the red blood cells. 20 000 nucleated cells were plated into wells of a 24 well dish. The cells were seeded in StemSpan containing Stem Cell Factor IL3 and IL6 S36 S36 plus 5 ug ml Tat Myc and 5 ug ml Tat Bcl2 TPO Stem Cell Fact Flt3 L IL3 and IL6 TSF36 TSF36 plus 5 ug ml Tat Myc and 5 ug ml Tat Bcl2 TPO Stem Cell Fact Flt3 L IL3 IL6 GM CSF TSF36G and TSF36G plus 5 ug ml Tat Myc and 5 ug ml Tat Bcl2. Media and Tat Fusion proteins were replaced every three days. The cells were assessed by flow cytometry for CD34 positive linage negative HSC on day 13.

As shown in TSF36G plus the fusion proteins provided the highest viability and proliferation. In other experiments this combination of cytokines plus fusion proteins was shown to produce cells that significantly outperformed cells produced from the cytokine cocktail without fusion proteins in colony forming assays and in vivo reconstitution of xenochimaeric mice .

For the in vivo reconstitution of xenochimaeric mice experiments cord blood cells were prepared on a Ficol gradient. The Buffy coat was removed and the cells were washed 3 times in PBS. Half of the cord blood cells were seeded in FCB fetal cord blood media consisting of Iscove s media Gibco supplemented with 10 human plasma 100 units per ml Penn Strep 30 ml of media containing SCF IL3 and IL6 and 30 mls of media containing TPO FLT3 L and GM CSF. The other half of the cells were seeded in FCB media including the additions noted above that was further supplemented with 5 g ml recombinant Tat Myc and 5 g ml recombinant Tat Bcl 2.

The cells were expanded for 11 days. On day 13 the cells were spun down and resuspended in 10 ml of fresh FCB media. The cells that were originally treated with Tat Myc and Tat Bcl2 were again treated with 5 g ml recombinant Tat Myc and 5 g ml recombinant Tat Bcl 2 for 1 hour at 37 degrees. Both populations of FCB cells were washed 3 in PBS for injection into mice.

The expanded cells were injected into NOD SCID gcmice NSG mice Jackson Laboratory that received 180 rads of radiation just prior to injection. The expanded cells were injected into NSG mice via the tail vein in 200 l PBS. Eight weeks post transplant the bone marrow BM spleen and thymus were assessed for human HSC reconstitution by flow cytometry . Cells from each tissue that had been pre treated with Tat Myc and Tat Bcl2 prior to transfusion showed a significant increase in human CD45 cells as compared with cells not pre treated with the fusion proteins.

3T3 cells were transduced with Tat Bcl2 for 1 hour followed by 3 PBS washes. Two hours post transduction the cells were Trypsanized counted and 5 10were harvested. The nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were isolated. 5 10cells were harvested every 24 hours for the next 5 days. Nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were prepared by lysing cells in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.6 10 mM NaCl 3 mM CaCl and 0.5 NP40. Nuclei were pelleted and the cytoplasmic containing supernatant fraction was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid TCA . Western blots were probed with anti V5 antibody Invitrogen and goat anti mouse IgG HRP Santa Cruz Biotechnology .

Tat Bcl2 was observed in the cytoplasmic fraction at 24 and 48 hours. The signal began to diminish by 72 hrs post transduction and was no longer observed at the 96 hour time point.

Plasmids expressing Tat Bcl2 Tat Bcl2 EPTD Bcl2 VPR Bcl2 VPR Bcl2 and VPR BclXL were created. pPTD Bcl2 V5 6 His Amp plasmids were generated by PCR amplification of a cDNA encoding human Bcl2 using a forward primer encoding an in frame PTD Tat EPTD or VPR protein transduction domain. The PCR products were cloned into pET101 D Topo Invitrogen vector. To generate the Bcl24 the unstructured loop A.A. 27 80 was removed from the BCL 2 coding sequence using a Quick Change site directed mutagenesis kit Stratagene 200521 5 . VPR BclXL was made in a similar fashion as the PTD Bcl2 described above but using the cDNA of human BclXL rather then Bcl2.
