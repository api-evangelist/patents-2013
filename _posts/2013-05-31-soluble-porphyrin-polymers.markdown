title: Soluble porphyrin polymers
abstract: 

are synthesized by the method shown in FIGS. A and B. The porphyrin polymers of Structure 1 are soluble in organic solvents such as 2-MeTHF and the like, and can be synthesized in bulk (i.e., in processes other than electropolymerization). These porphyrin polymers have long excited state lifetimes, making the material suitable as an organic semiconductor for organic electronic devices including transistors and memories, as well as solar cells, sensors, light-emitting devices, and other opto-electronic devices.

This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 654 463 filed on Jun. 1 2012 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This invention was made with government support under DE FG02 03ER15393 awarded by the Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in the invention.

This invention relates to chemical synthesis of conducting soluble solution processable porphyrin polymers.

One of the major applications of conducting polymers is as a component of an organic or bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cell for making electricity from sunlight. Organic solar cells generally include a layer of transparent indium tin oxide ITO on glass a layer of hole conducting polymer mixed with an organic or inorganic electron conducting phase and a third layer of a low work function metal such as aluminum. Light is absorbed by the polymer in the photovoltaic cell the resulting excitation then migrates to a phase boundary with the electron conducting phase and an electron is injected from the polymer. The electrons migrate to the metal through the electron conducting phase and holes migrate to the ITO via the polymer generating a photocurrent.

Conducting polymers for use in organic light emitting diodes OLEDs and organic conductors wires some of which may be electropolymerized have been reported. These polymers include for example polyacetylenes polyphenyleneethynylenes PPE polyphenylenevinylenes PPV polythiophenes and polyanilines. The structural variations of these polymers are typically changes in the organic substituent groups attached to the basic polymer backbone. The substituents can change the electrical properties of the polymer its processing and mechanical properties and its compatibility interfacing with other materials. Typically it is possible to write delocalized structures for these polymers that allow conductivity through the polymer backbone. Often some type of doping is required to achieve good conductivity.

Such organic photovoltaic cells have very low efficiencies i.e. less than about 5 due to incomplete conversion of excitons to charge separation recombination of electrons and holes within the organic layer or at the electrodes and a lack of efficient light absorption throughout the solar spectral range. The lack of electron acceptors covalently bonded to the polymer strands can lead to inefficient conversion of excitons to charge separation rapid charge recombination high concentrations of carriers at interface areas leading to increased recombination the need to prepare bicontinuous phases of polymer and fullerene or other electron carriers which adds to processing requirements and the need to use excessive amounts of the electron transport phase.

Films of porphyrin and porphyrin fullerene dyad conducting polymers have been prepared as films on electrodes by electropolymerization as described in Liddell et al. 2008 20 135 142 Gervaldo et al. 2010 9 890 900 and U.S. 2010 0065123 entitled Electrically Conducting Porphyrin and Porphyrin Fullerene Electropolymers all of which are incorporated herein by reference. However use of these materials is limited by the insolubility of the films on the electrodes.

As described herein solution bulk chemical synthesis of a class of conducting e.g. semiconducting soluble porphyrin polymers with long excited state lifetimes has been developed. This process yields a porphyrin polymer free or almost free of defects due to reverse linking of monomers and thus free or almost free of excited state quenching and charge carrier trapping caused by such defects. Accordingly the porphyrin polymer has long excited state lifetimes making the material suitable as an organic semiconductor for organic electronic devices including transistors and memories as well as solar cells sensors light emitting devices and other opto electronic devices. Unlike earlier polymers produced by electropolymerization these soluble polymers based on a porphyrin monomer designed for polymer solubility are solution processable suitable for spin coating and otherwise able to be handled and used as bulk materials.

Time resolved emission studies were carried out by the single photon timing method in 2 MeTHF. shows a decay associated spectrum DAS of emission from Structure 3 in 2 MeTHF with excitation at 420 nm 9.53 ns 1.06 . shows DAS of Structure 4 in 2 MeTHF with excitation at 520 nm. Two components with time constants of 104 ps and 5.72 ns 1.16 were observed. shows DAS of Structure 4 in cyclohexane excitation at 520 nm. Two components with time constants of 186 ps plot 110 and 7.21 ns plot 112 were observed. shows DAS of Structure 4 in decanol excitation at 520 nm. shows DAS of Structure 5 in 2 MeTHF excitation at 520 nm. shows DAS of Structure 1 n 5 in 2 MeTHF excitation at 420 nm. Roughly comparable DAS spectra were observed for Structure 4 and polymers of Structure 1 of various lengths. DAS similar to the above were obtained for Structure 5 with excitation at 450 nm where the unit without a meso nitrogen does not absorb. Thus none of the components appear to represent energy transfer.

Fluorescence anisotropy experiments were carried out on Structure 1 n 1 and on Structure 1 n 3 with 680 nm and 780 nm. shows Structure 1 n 1 and shows Structure 1 n 3. The results show a time constant for excitation hopping between porphyrins in the polymer chain of 210 ps.

Structure 1 is readily soluble in organic solvents known in the art due at least in part to the hexyl chains. The absorption spectrum is broad and extends to wavelengths longer than 700 nm. There is a weak electronic interaction between porphyrin moieties observed in absorption. The absorption and emission spectra of Structure 4 and the polymers of Structure 1 are solvent polarity dependent suggesting an excited state with charge transfer character. Photochemical properties of the polymers of Structure 1 are summarized in which shows a schematic diagram of transient states of polymers of Structure 1 and some of their interconversion pathways and time constants. The polymer of Structure 1 is represented as P P P. Excitation of Pis followed by very rapid energy transfer to P which is also formed by direct absorption. Pexists in several conformations. The initially formed excited states of Prelax through two or more short lived species 50 600 ps in 2 MeTHF likely involving different conformations about the C N bonds to the least energetic excited state. The Pstate is fluorescent and decays in 6 ns but can also undergo singlet energy transfer to yield P. . . Pwith a time constant of 210 ps. In some solvents additional excited state conformations are present.

Molecules similar to Structure 2 but lacking the bromine electropolymerize but electropolymerization can introduce defects such as Structure 6 shown in that act as excitation and charge traps. shows ITO bound Structure 7. shows normalized fluorescence decays of electropolymers on ITO including the polymer of Structure 6 on ITO bound Structure 7 plot 200 the polymer of Structure 6 on ITO plot 202 the polymer of Structure 6 on silane treated ITO plot 204 and Structure 7 bound to ITO via an aminopropylsiloxy group plot 206 . Polymers such as those shown in Structure 6 have very short excited state lifetimes as shown in . When the electrode surface is first derivatized with a porphyrin of Structure 7 formation of such traps cannot occur or do not occur widely. Electropolymeric films prepared in this way show much longer excited state lifetimes with charge transfer character and energy migration between porphyrins and thus are suitable for construction of solar cells or other devices.
