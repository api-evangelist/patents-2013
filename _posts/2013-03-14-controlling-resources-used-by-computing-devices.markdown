Electronic content provided via a network such as documents or applications may be used to enhance collaborative projects between multiple users or to provide electronic content to a widespread audience. For example video content and other multimedia presentations can be used to provide instructions augment lectures and otherwise enhance projects involving multiple participants.

Prior solutions for providing electronic content to multiple participants may involve providing computing devices for use by each participant that are fully controlled by a provider of the electronic content. For example passenger safety videos may be provided on an airplane via monitors connected to a video player via a wired network. Prior solutions for providing electronic content to multiple participants may alternatively rely on participants performing one or more voluntarily actions to obtain the electronic content. For example sharing content via a web meeting may require each participant in the web meeting to manually log into the meeting and access the desired content.

Systems and methods are desirable for temporarily controlling independently operated computing devices to provide electronic content to users of the computing devices.

In some embodiments a method performed by a management application is provided. The method involves determining that multiple computing devices are available for management. The method further involves determining that each of the computing devices is executing a respective instance of a client application. The client application can communicate with the management application and control at least one computing resource of each computing device. The method further involves configuring the computing resource of each computing device such that the computing device is restricted to accessing at least one common resource. The computing device is configured via communication between the management application and the respective instance of the client application.

In some embodiments a system is provided. The system includes at a processor a touch screen device communicatively coupled to the processor and a computer readable medium communicatively coupled to the processor. The processor can execute a management application embodied in the non transitory computer readable medium to perform operations. The operations include determining that each of multiple computing devices is executing a respective instance of a client application. The client application can communicate with the management application and can control at least one respective computing resource of the computing device. The operations also include selecting at least one of the computing devices based on at least one input received to the touch screen device. The operations also include configuring at least one respective computing resource of the managed computing device s such that the computing device s are restricted to accessing at least one resource managed by the management application.

Computer implemented systems and methods are disclosed for a management application controlling applications files and other resources being accessed executed or otherwise used at computing devices.

The following non limiting example is provided to help introduce the general subject matter of some embodiments. A college professor may present a lecture to a group of students having tablet computers that can access a network. As a prerequisite for the professor s course each student may be required to register his or her tablet computer with a mobile device management system. Registering a tablet computer with the mobile device management system can include installing a client application on the tablet computer that can communicate with a management application of the mobile device management system. The client application can take control of at least one resource of the tablet computer in response to commands from the management application.

In addition the management application may also accept new resources provided by the user of the computing device and previously provided resources modified by the user of the computing device as will be described.

The data store may include resource grouping identifiers resources and or other data. The resource grouping identifiers may represent unique identifiers for previously determined resource groupings and are used to determine which resources are served up to the user of the computing device as will be described. For example a resource grouping may relate to organizational groups organizational roles geographic locations and or any other type s of grouping s that require access to a type of resource. Each resource grouping identifier may be associated with a pairing of at least one of a plurality of approved credentials and at least one of a plurality of approved device identifiers . In some embodiments each combination of approved credentials and approved device identifiers may be associated with more than one of the resource grouping identifiers . Additionally the pairing of approved credentials and approved device identifiers may be associated with a user s organizational role and or capacity. For instance the pairing of approved credentials and the approved device identifiers may be predetermined by a technical services administrator or other administrative entity. In some embodiments the pairing of approved credentials and the approved device identifiers may be automatically associated with the resource grouping identifiers based at least upon a user s pay grade organizational level status within the organization and or any other organizational factor.

Each resource may be associated with a listing of approved resource grouping identifiers and at least one distribution rule. In some embodiments the listing of approved resource grouping identifiers includes resource grouping identifiers that regulate access to the respective resource. In some embodiments the listing of approved resource grouping identifiers may be predetermined by an administrator entity. For instance the administrator entity may specify which resource grouping identifiers are permitted access to the respective resource . Additionally or alternatively distribution rules may regulate how an entity having a combination of the appropriate credentials and device identifier may access the respective resource . For example in some embodiments the distribution rules may describe a required and or a permitted state that an accessing computing device may satisfy in order for the computing device to be permitted access to the resource .

Alternatively the resources and distribution rules may be stored on another data store accessible to the computing device and or other storage facility in data communication with the server system such as an internal email server a web based email server an internal file server a third party hosted file server a cloud based server or a cached local data store on the computing device .

A user or other entity operating a computing device may wish to access resources stored on the server system . In some embodiments the user may manipulate a graphical interface rendered by the client application to transmit a request for accessing at least one of the resources on the server system . For instance the user may provide credentials such as a unique user name a password biometric data and or other types of credentials to request access to the server system . The client application may transmit the request to the management application . In some embodiments the request may include the credentials provided by the user the device identifier that uniquely identifies the computing device and or any other relevant information.

The management application or another service provided by the server system receives the request and determines whether the user is authorized to access the resources from the computing device . For example the management application may determine that the user is authorized to access the resources from the computing device based on the credentials and the device identifier provided with the request .

Upon determining that the user is authorized to access the resources from the computing device the server system determines which of the resources to provide to the computing device . In some embodiments the management application determines which resources to provide based on resource grouping identifiers associated with each resource . For instance the management application may determine which resource grouping identifiers are associated with the pairing of credentials and the device identifier included in the request . In some embodiments the management application parses the listing of approved credentials and the listing of approved device identifiers of each resource grouping identifier to determine whether the respective resource grouping identifier is associated with both the credentials and the device identifier . The management application may identify a resource to provide to the computing device based on the determined resource grouping identifiers . In some embodiments the management application identifies at least one of the resources associated with each one of the determined resource grouping identifiers . In some embodiments the management application identifies a resource that is associated with the determined resource grouping identifiers . In some embodiments the management application identifies the resource if it is associated with a threshold number of the resource grouping identifiers . The management application may provide the identified resources to the user of the computing device .

In some embodiments the management application may additionally determine whether the computing device from which the user requested access to the resources complies with the distribution rules associated with each one of the identified resources . For example the management application may determine whether the device profile describing the state of the computing device complies with the distribution rules of each identified resource . As discussed above the device profile may include hardware specifications of the computing device software specifications of the computing device version information of various other components of the computing device and or any other information profiling the computing device . In some embodiments the management application may provide each identified resource to the user if the computing device complies with all of or at least a portion of the distribution rules associated with each of the identified resources . In some embodiments the management application may provide the identified resource s to the user if the computing device complies with at least a threshold number of the distribution rules associated with each of the identified resources .

Responsive to a determination that the computing device is in a state of compliance with the distribution rules the management application may be further executed to transmit the identified resources to the computing device . In some embodiments the management application may automatically transmit the identified resources to the computing device . In some embodiments the management application may make the identified resources available for download by the computing device based on a resource qualifier associated with the respective resource . For instance the resource qualifier may indicate the respective resource be made available for download to the computing device . In this example the user may transmit a request to the management application to download the respective resource .

In some embodiments the state of the computing device may have been modified between the time the management application makes the identified resource available for download and the time the management application receives the request to download the identified resource . For example the computing device may have switched connectivity from a secured network to an unsecured network . In this embodiment the management application may determine for a second time whether the computing device complies with the distribution rules. For example the request to download transmitted from the computing device may include an updated device profile . The management application may make the second determination of whether the computing device complies with the distribution rules based on the updated device profile . For instance the distribution rules may require that the computing device be connected to a secured network to gain access to the resource and the second determination of compliance may reveal that the computing device is connected to an unsecured network . Responsive to the second determination that the computing device complies with the distribution rules the management application provides the requested resource . In some embodiments the device profile may be periodically transmitted by the client application to the server system . In this embodiment each time the device profile is transmitted to the server system the management application may determine whether the updated computing device complies with the distribution rules using the updated device profile .

In some embodiments the management application may transmit distribution rules associated with each one of the identified resources to the computing device . For example the management application may transmit the distribution rules to the client application for determining whether the computing device complies with the distribution rules. In some embodiments the management application may not determine whether the computing device complies with the distribution rules of each of the identified resources and instead permits the client application to make this determination. For instance the client application may determine whether the computing device complies with the distribution rules associated with the received resource prior to rendering the received resource on the display device .

In some embodiments the management application may transmit the distribution rules to the computing device prior to transmitting the identified resources . The client application may determine whether the computing device complies with the distribution rules as described above. The client application may transmit an indication back to the management application of the compliance status. Responsive to receiving an indication from the computing device that the computing device complies with all and or a sufficient portion of the distribution rules associated with each respective resource the management application may transmit the appropriate identified resources to the computing device . Additionally the client application may store the distribution rules in a memory associated with the computing device such as the data store . Upon subsequent requests to access the identified resource the management application may wait to receive an indication from the client application that the computing device complies with the distribution rules associated with the requested resource to determine whether to transmit the requested resource . For example the client application may use the stored distribution rules received from a previous request to make the determination and transmit the request.

The management application may be further executed to log activity related to the resources for asset tracking purposes. For example the management application may log activities such as transmission of resources historical data related to the transmission of the resource data related to the rendering of the resources by the computing device data related to a storage location of the resources data related to communication with the computing device data related to resource qualifiers associated with the resources data related to computing device compliance with distribution rules data related to usage and availability of bandwidth and or any other data related to the resources .

In some embodiments the management application may periodically determine whether the transmitted resources have been modified on the computing device and synchronize the modified resource on the computing device with the unmodified resource on the server system . For instance the management application may determine whether the resource has been modified based on an edit date modified date and or an access date associated with the resource . In this embodiment the management application may periodically request to receive the relevant date from the client application . Upon receiving the relevant date the management application compares the relevant date from the computing device with the corresponding date on the server system and determines to synchronize the respective resources if the two relevant dates do not match. For instance the management application may employ a synchronization approach as is known in the art.
