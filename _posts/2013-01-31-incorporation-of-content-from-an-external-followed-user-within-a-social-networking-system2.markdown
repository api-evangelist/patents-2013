title: Incorporation of content from an external followed user within a social networking system
abstract: A following user follows a followed user on a third-party application. The followed user may additionally approve the inclusion of content posted by the followed user on the third-party application within an account of any following users on the social networking system. Subsequent postings by the followed user on the third-party application cause the third-party application to notify the social networking system of the posting. The social networking system in turn incorporates the posting of the followed user on the third-party application into a user interface that it displays to the following user.

The present invention generally relates to the field of electronic social networking systems and more particularly to integrating content posted by a user in a third party application within a social networking system.

Many users of a social networking system such as FACEBOOK also have an account on a third party application such as TWITTER FOURSQUARE PINTEREST or FLICKR. In many cases such users follow another user on the third party application i.e. have registered an interest in content or activity of the other user where the other user also has an account on the social networking system but is not a direct social connection of the user on the social networking system. For purposes of brevity the user that follows another user is hereinafter referred to as the following user and the user that is followed is hereinafter referred to as the followed user. For example a user of the social networking system may follow a celebrity on the third party application but not be a friend or other form of direct social connection with the celebrity on the social networking system.

In such cases the following users would often wish to see content provided by the followed users on the third party social networking system e.g. textual comments reviews posted links pictures or the like directly within the following users accounts on the social networking system. However the lack of a direct social connection between the following user and the followed user on the social networking system coupled with the fact that the information provided by the followed user is within the third party social networking system rather than the first social networking system typically means that the social networking system will not display such information to the following user.

In embodiments of the invention a following user follows a followed user on a third party application. The followed user may additionally approve the inclusion of content posted by the followed user on the third party application within an account of any following users on the social networking system. Subsequent postings by the followed user on the third party application cause the social networking system to obtain the postings e.g. by the third party application notifying the social networking system of the posting. The social networking system in turn incorporates the posting of the followed user on the third party application into a user interface that it displays to the following user.

In one embodiment the followed user specifies a user identifier of the followed user on the social networking system to the third party application e.g. when approving the sharing of the followed user s posted content with the social networking system. The social networking system may use the user identifier of the followed user to display the posted content in association with an identity of the followed user on the social networking system as opposed to the identity of the followed user on the third party application.

The figures depict embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following description that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.

The social networking system comprises an object store that stores information on various objects tracked by the social networking system . These objects may represent a variety of things with which a user may interact in the social networking system including without limitation the user or other users of the social networking system represented e.g. as a profile object for the user applications e.g. a game playable within the social networking system events e.g. a concert that users may attend groups to which users may belong e.g. a group devoted to alternative energy research pages e.g. pages constituting a particular person or organization s presence on the system such as pages about particular politicians car models or TV shows items of media e.g. pictures videos audio text or any other type of media content locations associated with a user e.g. San Jose Calif. USA and concepts or other terms e.g. an object corresponding to the concept alternative energy . The object store may further store objects representing other data routinely produced by users of the social networking system such as inbox messages status updates comments notes and postings. An object in the object store may represent an entity existing within the social networking system e.g. an application available on the social networking system a virtual entity that exists outside the domain of the social networking system e.g. a website or a real world entity e.g. a person a product or a show . User objects may represent an individual human person but also may represent other entities such as fictitious persons or concepts.

The object store may store all of the objects existing within the social networking system such as the code of an application or the image data associated with an image media item . Alternatively for virtual entities existing outside of the social networking system the object store may contain some form of pointer or reference to the entities such as the uniform resource locator URL of an external media item . Additionally the object store may also store metadata associated with the objects such as a name describing the object e.g. Al Gore for a person or page or Green Energy Group for a group an image representing the object e.g. a user profile picture or one or more tags assigned to the object by users e.g. the textual strings game crime and strategy for a strategy game application . Different types of objects may have different types of metadata such as a set of associated users for a group a media type e.g. video for a media item object and a unique user ID and name tokens e.g. separate first and last names Al and Gore for a user object .

In one embodiment the social networking system further comprises a graph information store that represents the objects of the object store as nodes that are linked together in a social graph. The graph information store thus comprises information about the relationships between or among the objects represented as the edges connecting the various object nodes. Various examples of edges in the social graph include an edge between two user objects representing that the users have a relationship in the social networking system e.g. are friends or have communicated viewed the other s profile or interacted in some way an edge between a user object and an application object representing that the user has used the application and an edge between a user object and a group object representing that the user belongs to the group and an edge between a user object and a page object representing that the user has viewed the page or expressly specified an affinity for the page e.g. Liked the page . Additionally an edge between a first user object and a second user object may specify that the first user is following the second user on a particular third party application . A user is considered a direct connection of another user in the social networking system if there is an edge between the two users in the social graph as opposed for example to there only being a series of edges that indirectly connect the users.

For example if one user establishes a relationship with another user in the social networking system the two users are each represented as a node and the edge between them represents the established relationship the two users are then said to be connected in the social network system. Continuing this example one of these users may send a message to the other user within the social networking system. This act of sending the message is another edge between those two nodes which can be stored and or tracked by the social networking system. The message itself may be treated as a node. In another example one user may tag another user in an image that is maintained by the social networking system. This tagging action may create edges between the users as well as an edge between each of the users and the image which is also a node. In yet another example if a user confirms attending an event the user and the event are nodes where the indication of whether or not the user will attend the event is the edge. In a still further example if a first user follows a second user within a third party application the social networking system is notified of this fact a unidirectional following edge may be created between from the first user to the second user within the graph information store . Using a social graph therefore a social networking system may keep track of many different types of objects and edges the interactions and connections among those objects thereby maintaining an extremely rich store of socially relevant information.

In one embodiment edges in the graph information store have associated metadata such as a label describing the type of relationship e.g. friend or following as the label between two user objects and or a value quantifying the strength of the relationship. Further a relationship degree or distance between any two objects can be ascertained by determining the number of edges on the shortest path between the objects. For example two user objects that have an edge between them e.g. denoting a friendship relationship have a relationship degree or distance of one and are considered first order connections. Similarly if a user object A is a first order connection of user object B but not of user object C and B is a first order connection of C then objects A and C have a relationship degree of two indicating that C is a second order connection of A and vice versa .

The social networking system further comprises a feed module that displays a list of relevant content items from the social networking system a feed for a given user to view within the user interface for the user s account on the social networking system. For example the feed can include status messages of other users of the social networking system such as the user s first order connections as well as comments of other users thereto recent events recent actions of a given application and the like. In one embodiment the feed module constructs a list of some number N of the most recent content items relevant to the given user places them within a webpage and provides the webpage to the client device of the user.

The social networking system further comprises a third party application interaction module that the social networking system uses to display content of followed users from the third party application to the following users.

Specifically the third party application interaction module comprises a notification API that third party applications can use to inform the social networking system of relevant events that occurred on the third party applications such as that a first following user has just begun to follow a second followed user on the third party application or that a followed user has just posted an item of content on the third party application. In some embodiments the third party application interaction module explicitly polls the relevant third party applications for new postings by followed users rather than relying on the third party applications to use the notification API to inform the social networking system.

In one embodiment the notification API permits or requires the third party application to specify user identifiers of the followed and or following users on both the third party application and the social networking system . For example the notification API may require that the third party application specify user identifiers of the following user on both the third party application and the social networking system so that it can more easily correlate the two in future.

The third party application interaction module further comprises an insertion module that inserts content of followed users on the third party application into the user interface associated with the following user on the social networking system . In one embodiment the third party interaction module stores a copy of or reference to each content item posted on the third party application of which the third party application has informed the social networking system using the notification API . Then when the feed module is forming the appropriate feed for a given user the feed module requests the insertion module to provide any relevant content items from the third party application to be included in the feed. For example the insertion module might identify the most recent postings of users of the third party application that are followed by the user for whom the feed is being generated including such postings within the feed if they have sufficiently recent posting dates to be within the feed s most recent N content items.

Initially the followed user uses the third party application to approve sharing of content posted by the followed user on the third party application with the social networking system . For example the followed user may use an account settings user interface of the third party application to select the option Allow my posts to be shared with my followers on S where S is a given social networking system . As part of the approval the followed user may specify a user name or other user identifier that the followed user has on the social networking system . The specification of the user names or other identifiers permits the social networking system to more easily map the identities of the users on the third party application to corresponding identities of the users on the social networking system.

At step the following user follows the followed user e.g. indicates using the third party application that the following user wishes in future to see content posted by the followed user within the third party application.

In response to step the third party application notifies the social networking system e.g. using the notification API that the following user is now following the followed user . In other embodiments the social networking system may explicitly poll the third party application to determine whether there are new following relationships since the last poll. Accordingly the social networking system updates the graph information store e.g. by introducing an edge labeled follow and oriented from the following user to the followed user .

The social networking system may optionally inform the following user that the follow relationship will also be reflected within the social networking system as well as within the third party application . For example the social networking system could add an entry into the newsfeed of the following user e.g. Christian is now following Angel Pagal on Chatter to refer back to the example of .

Once the above steps have taken place content posted by the followed user on the third party application will be included for display to the following user on the social networking system . Specifically in step the followed user uses the third party application to post new content which the third party application displays to the following user when the following user is logged into the third party application e.g. as the message C illustrated in .

Accordingly the third party application notifies the social networking system of the posting by the followed user on the third party application e.g. by calling the notification API . In one embodiment as part of the notification the third party application explicitly provides a unique user ID for the account of the followed user on the social networking system this allows the social networking system to more easily determine the identity of the content poster on the social networking system. In one embodiment rather than relying on the third party application to inform it of new postings by followed users the social networking system explicitly polls the third party application for the new postings. In one embodiment the social networking system continues to store copies of or references to the postings of which is notified by the third party application making use of the stored postings only as needed e.g. when the feed module is generating the feed for a given user.

At an appropriate time such as when generating the starting page on the social networking system for a following user the social networking system uses the posting provided by the third party application and the unique user ID for the followed user who generated the posting to provide the posting to the following user . For example the posting can be included within a news feed of the following user along with the name of the followed user on the social networking system as described above with respect to the insertion module . Further details regarding the use of the news feed are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 8 171 128 Systems and Methods for Providing Dynamically Selected Media Content to a User of an Electronic Device in a Social Network Environment and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008 0040475 Systems and Methods for Measuring User Affinity in a Social Network Environment which are hereby incorporated by reference. For instance in the social networking system has displayed the posting the textual message Stolen bases are even better than free tacos in association with the name of the followed user on the social networking system Angel Pagal as opposed to the name A. M. Pagal of the followed user on the third party application as depicted in .

It is appreciated that although the steps of can be performed in the particular order illustrated in other embodiments they might alternatively be performed in different orders or by different actors or not performed at all. For example the social networking system might query a third party application for new postings rather than the third party application proactively notifying the social networking system of the new postings. As a further example the social networking system might not explicitly inform the user of the following relationship on the third party application .
