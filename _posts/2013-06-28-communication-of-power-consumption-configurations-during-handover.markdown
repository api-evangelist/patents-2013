title: Communication of power consumption configurations during handover
abstract: Technology for communicating user equipment (UE) power consumption configurations is disclosed. One method can include selecting, at the UE, a Power Preference Indication (PPI) state of a power consumption configuration of the UE. The UE can receive, from a source evolved node B (eNB), instructions to begin a PPI Prohibit Event Interval during a handover from the source eNB to a target eNB, wherein the UE cannot send the PPI state to the source eNB during the PPI Prohibit Event Interval. The UE can send the PPI state to the target eNB after the PPI Prohibit Event Interval ends and handover has either successfully completed or failed from the source eNB to the target eNB.

The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 732 851 filed Dec. 3 2012 the entire specification of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a node e.g. a transmission station and a wireless device e.g. a mobile device . Some wireless devices communicate using orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA in a downlink DL transmission and single carrier frequency division multiple access SC FDMA in an uplink UL transmission. Standards and protocols that use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM for signal transmission include the third generation partnership project 3GPP long term evolution LTE the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.16 standard e.g. 802.16e 802.16m which is commonly known to industry groups as WiMAX Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access and the IEEE 802.11 standard which is commonly known to industry groups as WiFi.

In 3GPP radio access network RAN LTE systems the node can be a combination of Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network E UTRAN Node Bs also commonly denoted as evolved Node Bs enhanced Node Bs eNodeBs or eNBs and Radio Network Controllers RNCs which communicates with the wireless device known as a user equipment UE . The downlink DL transmission can be a communication from the node e.g. eNodeB to the wireless device e.g. UE and the uplink UL transmission can be a communication from the wireless device to the node.

In homogeneous networks the node also called a macro node can provide basic wireless coverage to wireless devices in a cell. The cell can be the area in which the wireless devices are operable to communicate with the macro node. Heterogeneous networks HetNets can be used to handle the increased traffic loads on the macro nodes due to increased usage and functionality of wireless devices. HetNets can include a layer of planned high power macro nodes or macro eNBs overlaid with layers of lower power nodes small eNBs micro eNBs pico eNBs femto eNBs or home eNBs HeNBs that can be deployed in a less well planned or even entirely uncoordinated manner within the coverage area cell of a macro node. The lower power nodes LPNs can generally be referred to as low power nodes small nodes or small cells.

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.

Before the present invention is disclosed and described it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures process steps or materials disclosed herein but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element. Numbers provided in flow charts and processes are provided for clarity in illustrating steps and operations and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence.

An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

In Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP Long Term Evolution LTE Release 11 a user equipment UE may send a power preference indication PPI to an evolved node B eNB . The PPI may be one bit UE assistance information that improves the UE s power efficiency in the context of background traffic. In other words the UE may communicate its preferred power consumption configuration i.e. PPI information to the eNB. A PPI value of 0 may be a default configuration that represents a preferred UE power configuration that is optimized for active traffic such as delay sensitive applications. An active traffic session may include a time period when a user is actively interacting with the UE. A PPI value of 1 may be a lower power consumption configuration that represents a preferred UE power configuration that is optimized for device power saving and is suitable for background traffic. A background traffic session may represent the duration when the user is not directly interacting with the UE. During the background traffic session applications may run in the background and generate updates notifications etc. The UE may send the PPI state or PPI value i.e. the preferred power consumption configuration to the eNB and then the eNB may set or establish the UE s power consumption configuration based on the PPI state sent from the UE.

However frequent PPI reports from the UE to the eNB may cause excessive Radio Resource Control RRC signaling. Thus according to 3GPP Technical Specification TS 36.300 Release 11 the UE may not send the same preferred power consumption configuration consecutively to the eNB. A prohibit timer e.g. timer T340 may be used to limit PPI reporting from the UE to the eNB. For example the UE cannot send a PPI value of 1 to the eNB if the UE is already in a low power consumption configuration i.e. the UE s previous preferred power consumption configuration was also PPI 1 . The prohibit timer can be used to avoid excessive signaling overhead due to unnecessarily frequent transmission of the PPI from the UE to the eNB. After sending a PPI value of 0 to the eNB the UE can start the timer T340 so that the UE can send a next PPI state e.g. PPI 1 after expiry of the T340 timer.

During handover a UE that is communicating with a source eNB may be handed over to a target eNB i.e. the UE may communicate with the target eNB after the handover . If the target eNB supports PPI functionality then the PPI state of the UE may be retained at the target eNB. For example the source eNB may communicate to the target eNB that the PPI state of the UE is 1 so that after the handover occurs the target eNB knows that the preferred power consumption configuration of the UE is PPI 1. However the PPI state of the UE after handover occurs i.e. to the PPI state known at the target eNB may be inconsistent with the actual PPI state of the UE.

In one example the source eNB may initiate a handover request process with the target eNB. At the beginning of the handover request process the PPI state of the UE may be PPI 0 so the source eNB may send PPI 0 to the target eNB. During the handover process i.e. before the handover process between the source eNB and the target eNB is complete the UE may desire a lower power consumption configuration and send PPI 1 to the source eNB. In particular the UE may send PPI 1 to the source eNB before the UE receives instructions to detach from the source eNB and synchronize with the target eNB. The source eNB may not transfer the most recent PPI state of the UE i.e. PPI 1 to the target eNB because the source eNB has already communicated UE context information to the target eNB. Thus the target eNB may configure the UE for PPI 0 after handover even though the most recent PPI state of the UE is PPI 1.

After handover is established the UE may wish to send its preferred power consumption configuration i.e. PPI 1 to the new source eNB i.e. the target eNB of the handover procedure . However 3GPP Technical Specification TS 36.300 Release 11 may prohibit the UE from sending the same PPI state consecutively. Thus the UE may not send PPI 1 to the target eNB and as a result the UE may remain in the default state i.e. PPI 0 for the entire RRC connected state. As will be described in greater detail below an incorrect PPI setting that results from handover may be mitigated by at least one of defining a PPI Prohibit Event Interval communicating a most recent PPI state to the target eNB using a sequence number SN status transfer message or communicating a last sent PPI message to the target eNB using a Radio Resource Control RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete message.

At step the source eNB may communicate a handover request message to the target eNB. The handover request message may include the necessary information to prepare for the handover at the target side such as E UTRAN Radio Access Bearer E RAB quality of service QoS information. At step admission control may be performed by the target eNB dependent on the received E RAB QoS information to increase the likelihood of a successful handover if the resources can be granted by the target eNB. The E RAB may uniquely identify the concatenation of an SI Bearer and the corresponding Data Radio Bearer. The target eNB may configure the required resources according to the received E RAB QoS information and reserve a cell radio network temporary identifier C RNTI and optionally a Random Access Channel RACH preamble.

At step the target eNB may prepare for handover with a physical layer i.e. Layer 1 or L1 and a data link layer i.e. Layer 2 or L2 . The target eNB may communicate a handover request acknowledge message to the source eNB. The handover request acknowledge message may include a transparent container to be sent to the UE as an RRC message to perform the handover. The container may include a new C RNTI target eNB security algorithm identifiers a dedicated RACH preamble and other parameters e.g. a system information block . As soon as the source eNB receives the handover request acknowledge message from the target eNB or as soon as the transmission of the handover command is initiated in the downlink data forwarding may be initiated.

At step the target eNB may generate the RRC message to perform the handover which may be communicated to the source eNB. The source eNB may communicate the RRC message to the UE. In particular the RRC message may be a RRC Connection Reconfiguration message that includes mobility control information. The source eNB may perform the necessary integrity protection and ciphering of the RRC message. The UE may receive the RRC Connection Reconfiguration message with the necessary parameters e.g. a new C RNTI target eNB security algorithm identifiers and optionally dedicated RACH preamble . The UE may be instructed by the source eNB to perform the handover. In other words the UE may be instructed to detach from the source eNB and synchronize to the target eNB i.e. the new source eNB .

At step the source eNB may communicate a sequence number SN status transfer message to the target eNB. The SN status transfer message may convey the uplink packet data convergence protocol PDCP SN receiver status and the downlink PDCP SN transmitter status of E RABs for which PDCP status preservation applies i.e. for radio link control acknowledged mode or RLC AM .

At step after receiving the RRC Connection Reconfiguration message that includes the mobility control information the UE may perform synchronization with the target eNB and then access the target cell via RACH. The UE may access the target cell following a contention free procedure if a dedicated RACH preamble was indicated in the mobility control information. Alternatively the UE may access the target cell following a contention based procedure if no dedicated preamble was indicated in the mobility control information. At step the target eNB may respond to the UE with uplink UL allocation and timing advance. At step when the UE has successfully accessed the target cell the UE may communicate the RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete message including a C RNTI to the target eNB to confirm the handover. The RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete message may include an uplink Buffer Status Report to indicate that the handover procedure is completed for the UE. The target eNB may verify the C RNTI included in the RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete message. After step occurs the target eNB may begin communicating user data to the UE.

As an example the source eNB may initiate the handover process at step . At step the PPI of the UE may be 0 so the source eNB may forward PPI 0 to the target eNB in the handover request message. If the UE sends an updated PPI of 1 to the source eNB before step i.e. when the source eNB sends the RRC Connection Reconfiguration message to the UE the target eNB may not receive the latest preferred power consumption configuration i.e. PPI 1 because the source eNB has already sent PPI 0 to the target eNB.

In one example the PPI Prohibit Event Interval may be defined to begin at step of the handover procedure illustrated in and end at step of the handover procedure. The PPI Prohibit Event Interval may begin at step when the source eNB makes a handover decision and communicates a handover request message to the target eNB. The source eNB may initiate the PPI Prohibit Event Interval by sending a medium access control MAC message or an RRC message to the UE. The MAC message or the RRC message may signal the start of the PPI Prohibit Event Interval during which time the UE cannot send any PPI state updates to the source eNB. In addition the source eNB may instruct the UE to begin the PPI Prohibit Event Interval before the source eNB sends the handover request message to the target eNB.

In one embodiment the PPI Prohibit Event Interval may end at step when the UE communicates the RRC Connection Reconfiguration complete message to the target eNB. In other words if handover from the source eNB to the target eNB is successful then the PPI Prohibit Event Interval automatically ends when the UE communicates the RRC Connection Reconfiguration complete message to the target eNB. After handover is established if the UE is configured to change its preferred power consumption configuration the UE may communicate an updated PPI value to the target eNB i.e. after the UE communicates the RRC Connection Reconfiguration complete message to the target eNB .

In one example handover failure may occur between the source eNB and the target eNB. Handover failure may result due to radio link failure with the UE or for any number of other reasons. When handover fails the UE may communicate an RRC Connection Re Establishment message to the source eNB. The PPI Prohibit Event Interval may automatically end when the UE communicates the RRC Connection Re Establishment message to the source eNB. Thus the UE may communicate an updated PPI value to the source eNB after communicating the RRC Connection Re Establishment message to the source eNB.

In another example handover failure may occur when the target eNB responds with a handover failure message to the source eNB. In this scenario the source eNB may communicate a new RRC message to the UE indicating that the PPI Prohibit Event Interval has ended. After receiving the RRC message from the source eNB the UE may communicate an updated PPI value to the source eNB rather than the target eNB if the UE is configured to change its preferred power consumption configuration.

As illustrated in the source eNB may communicate a message to the UE instructing the UE to start the PPI Prohibit Event Interval. The source eNB may communicate the message to the UE before making a handover decision at step . Alternatively the source eNB may communicate the PPI Prohibit Event Interval message to the UE immediately after making the handover decision at step . Step of the handover procedure may occur only after the source eNB ha sent the PPI Prohibit Event Interval message to the UE. The PPI Prohibit Event Interval may begin when the source eNB communicates the message to the UE during which time the UE cannot send a preferred power consumption configuration i.e. a PPI state to the source eNB. In other words the UE may be prohibited from sending the PPI state to the source eNB during a handover execution phase. At step the source eNB may communicate a handover request to the target eNB. The PPI Prohibit Event Interval may end when the UE communicates a RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete message to the target eNB i.e. the new source eNB at step . After the PPI Prohibit Interval ends the UE may communicate an updated PPI state to the target eNB i.e. the new source eNB .

As shown in the UE may communicate a preferred power consumption configuration to the source eNB according to a UE triggering algorithm. For example the UE may send the PPI information to the source eNB before a handover execution phase occurs i.e. before the source eNB sends a handover request message to the target eNB . Alternatively the UE may send the PPI information during step through step of the handover execution phase based on the triggering algorithm.

The source eNB may append the most updated PPI information received from the UE to the SN status transfer message communicated to the target eNB during step of the handover process. In other words the SN status transfer message may include the most recent preferred power consumption configuration of the UE. As a result the target eNB may receive the most recent PPI information of the UE. However if the UE sends updated PPI information to the source eNB during step to step of the handover process i.e. after the SN status transfer message is sent to the target eNB then the target eNB may not receive the updated PPI information along with the SN status transfer message.

In one example the UE may communicate the last sent PPI message to the target eNB along with the RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete message as illustrated at step of . For example the UE may have sent PPI information to the source eNB during any of steps through step of the handover execution process. Alternatively the UE may have sent PPI information to the source eNB before the handover execution phase was started between the source eNB and the target eNB i.e. before the source eNB communicated a handover request message to the target eNB . In addition the UE may resend its last sent PPI message regardless of the fact that it may be the same PPI message as sent to the source eNB. Furthermore the UE may communicate PPI information to the target eNB regardless of when the UE last communicated the PPI information to the source eNB i.e. regardless of the T340 timer . Thus the UE may resend its last sent PPI message to the target eNB even when the PPI of the UE was not updated during handover. Alternatively the UE may communicate PPI information to the target eNB that is different than the PPI information that was previously communicated to the source eNB.

For example the UE may communicate PPI 0 to the source eNB during step of the handover process illustrated in . In one example the UE may communicate the PPI information to the source eNB based on a trigger algorithm. The UE may not update its preferred power consumption configuration during the handover execution process. Nevertheless the UE may resend PPI 0 along with the RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete message to the target eNB during step . As another example the UE may communicate PPI 0 to the source eNB before the source eNB initiates a handover execution phase with the target eNB. During the handover execution phase the UE may update its preferred power consumption configuration to PPI 1. Thus when the UE resends the PPI information to the target eNB the UE may communicate the updated PPI information i.e. PPI 1 . Thus the PPI information communicated to the target eNB may be different than the PPI information previously communicated to the source eNB. As a result the target eNB may receive the latest PPI information from the UE.

Another example provides a method for communicating user equipment UE power consumption configurations as shown in the flow chart in . The method may be executed as instructions on a machine where the instructions are included on at least one computer readable medium or one non transitory machine readable storage medium. The method includes the operation of selecting at the UE a Power Preference Indication PPI state of a power consumption configuration of the UE as in block . The method can include receiving from a source evolved node B eNB instructions to begin a PPI Prohibit Event Interval during a handover from the source eNB to a target eNB wherein the UE cannot send the PPI state to the source eNB during the PPI Prohibit Event Interval as in block . The next operation of the method can include sending from the UE the PPI state to the target eNB after the PPI Prohibit Event Interval ends and handover has either successfully completed or failed from the source eNB to the target eNB as in block .

In one example the method can further include receiving at the UE instructions to begin the PPI Prohibit Event Interval before the source eNB sends a handover request message to the target eNB. In addition the method can include receiving from the source eNB a Medium Access Control MAC message or a Radio Resource Control RRC message that indicates a start of the PPI Prohibit Event Interval.

In another example the method can further include sending the PPI state to the target eNB from the UE after the UE sends a Radio Resource Control RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete message to the target eNB. In addition the method can include determining that the PPI Prohibit Event Interval ends when the UE sends the RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete message to the target eNB.

In an additional example the method can include determining that the PPI Prohibit Event Interval ends when the UE sends a Radio Resource Control RRC Connection Re Establishment message to the source eNB. Furthermore the method can include sending the PPI state to the source eNB from the UE after the UE sends the RRC Connection Re Establishment message to the source eNB in response to handover not being established between the source eNB and the target eNB.

In one example the method can include determining that the PPI Prohibit Event Interval ends after receiving a message from the source eNB indicating that the PPI Prohibit Event Interval has terminated because handover could not be established between the source eNB and the target eNB. In addition the method can include sending the PPI state to the target eNB wherein the power consumption configuration of PPI 0 indicates a default power configuration and the power consumption configuration of PPI 1 indicates a lower power consumption configuration.

Another example provides functionality of computer circuitry of a user equipment UE operable to communicate a UE power consumption configuration as shown in the flow chart in . The functionality may be implemented as a method or the functionality may be executed as instructions on a machine where the instructions are included on at least one computer readable medium or one non transitory machine readable storage medium. The computer circuitry can be configured to determine at the UE Power Preference Indication PPI information wherein the PPI information includes a preferred power consumption configuration of the UE as in block . The computer circuitry can be further configured to send the PPI information to a source evolved node B eNB during a handover execution phase between the source eNB and a target eNB as in block . The computer circuitry can also be configured to receive instructions from the source eNB to perform a handover from the source eNB to the target eNB as in block . In addition the computer circuitry can be configured to send from the UE the PPI information to the target eNB that is configured to accept the PPI information wherein the PPI information contains a most recent preferred power consumption configuration of the UE regardless of when the UE last sent the PPI information to the source eNB as in block .

In one configuration the computer circuitry can be configured to send the PPI information to the target eNB using a Radio Resource Control RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete message. In another example the computer circuitry can be configured to send the same PPI information to the target eNB as the PPI information sent to the source eNB. In addition the computer circuitry can be configured to send PPI information to the target eNB that is different than the PPI information sent to the source eNB in response to the PPI information being updated during the handover execution phase. Furthermore the computer circuitry can be configured to send PPI information to the source eNB and the target eNB wherein the preferred power consumption configuration of PPI 0 indicates a default power configuration and the preferred power consumption configuration of PPI 1 indicates a lower power consumption configuration.

Another example provides functionality of computer circuitry of a source evolved node B eNB operable to support communication of a power consumption configuration. The functionality may be implemented as a method or the functionality may be executed as instructions on a machine where the instructions are included on at least one computer readable medium or one non transitory machine readable storage medium. The computer circuitry can be configured to initiate a handover from the source eNB to a target eNB by sending a handover request message to the target eNB as in block . The computer circuitry can be further configured to receive Power Preference Indication PPI information from a user equipment UE wherein the PPI information includes a preferred power consumption configuration of the UE as in block . The computer circuitry can also be configured to send a sequence number SN status transfer message to the target eNB during a handover execution phase wherein the SN status transfer message includes the PPI information of the UE as in block .

In one configuration the computer circuitry can be configured to receive the PPI information from the UE based on a UE triggering algorithm. In addition the computer circuitry can be configured to send a most recent preferred power consumption configuration of the UE along with the SN status transfer message to the target eNB.

In one example the receiving module can be configured to receive the message from the source eNB to begin the PPI Prohibit Event Interval before the source eNB sends a handover request message to the target eNB .

In another example the sending module can be configured to send the PPI state to the target eNB after the UE sends a Radio Resource Control RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete message to the target eNB. In addition the sending module can be configured to send the PPI state to the source eNB after the UE sends a Radio Resource Control RRC Connection Re Establishment message to the source eNB based on handover between the source eNB and the target eNB not being established. Furthermore the sending module can be configured to send the PPI state to the source eNB after receiving a message from the source eNB indicating that the PPI Prohibit Event Interval has ended in response to handover not being established between the source eNB and the target eNB. In one example the sending module can be configured to send the PPI state to the target eNB using a Radio Resource Control RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete message.
