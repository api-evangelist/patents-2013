title: Systems and methods for providing live voicemail to a mobile handset
abstract: The exemplary live voicemail functionality offers a user of a mobile station the ability to listen to a voicemail message, as the message is being recorded in a voicemail platform. The mobile communication network serving the user directs an incoming call intended for the mobile station to the voicemail platform, which records the audio for the incoming message. The network infrastructure also duplicates the audio and directs the duplicate audio to the mobile station for monitoring of the incoming message by the user, as the platform is recording the voicemail message.

This application is a continuation and claims the benefit of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 873 898 filed Sep. 1 2010 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PROVIDING LIVE VOICEMAIL TO A MOBILE HANDSET the disclosure of which is entirely incorporated herein by reference.

In recent years mobile stations have become must have devices for most people in many countries. The communications that such devices offer via wireless mobile communications network enable users to talk and exchange various types of messages for business and personal reasons and to access information all from or while traveling through any location where a network provides service.

There are situations however where it is undesirable or impractical for a user to receive and participate in an incoming call directed to the user s mobile station. For example a user might not desire to receive a call during a work meeting or during a social occasion. In other situations users may be busy performing a physical activity that could otherwise be hindered or disrupted in the person were to engage in an interactive phone conversation. Additionally it is becoming more and more frequent for people to have a single mobile station as a main telephone. Often there are situations where the user receives a call from a calling party with an unknown number not recognized by the user. In other situations due to a required option that networks provide users with the ability to hide their number when calling mobile station users often receive calls from phones having blocked numbers.

Voicemail service provided through a central office of the network has become commonplace for both landline and mobile station customers. If a call can not be completed to an intended destination in the mobile scenario to the intended destination mobile station then the network redirects the call to a voicemail system. The voicemail system is a specialized computer that answers the call and stores a message from the caller in digital form. Many of the situations outlined above where it is undesirable or impractical for a user to receive and participate in an incoming call directed to the user s mobile station result in calls routed to a network platform providing the voicemail service to the mobile subscriber where the callers leave messages for later retrieval. Once stored a voicemail message is available for retrieval and playback to the intended recipient. However playback often entails a later call to the voicemail system. Many older customer premises based answering machines offered a monitoring capability in the form of an audible output of the caller s voice message in real time as the machine recorded the audio of the incoming message. However with voicemail the call is redirected to the voicemail platform. Hence there is no link to the called subscriber s mobile station during message recording therefore traditional network based voicemail has not offered a real time message monitoring capability.

The need for a later call to retrieve a message imposes a delay on the called party s ability to hear the message and determine its importance. Hence there is still room for an improved simplified technique for accessing a voicemail message.

In the following detailed description numerous specific details are set forth by way of examples in order to provide a thorough understanding of the relevant teachings. However it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present teachings may be practiced without such details. In other instances well known methods procedures components and or circuitry have been described at a relatively high level without detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring aspects of the present teachings.

Functionality systems and methods for providing a mobile station with live voicemail are shown and described. The live voicemail feature allows a user of a mobile station to listen to a voicemail message in real time as it is being recorded.

Reference now is made in detail to the examples illustrated in the accompanying drawings and discussed below. illustrates a mobile communication network as may be operated by a carrier or service provider to provide a wide range of mobile communication services and ancillary services or features to its subscriber customers and associated mobile station MS users. The elements collectively indicated by the reference numeral generally are elements of the network and are operated by or on behalf of the carrier although the mobile stations may be sold to and owned by the carrier s customers. The mobile communication network provides communications between mobile stations as well as communications for the mobile stations with networks and stations not shown outside the mobile communication network .

The wireless mobile communication network might be implemented as a network conforming to the code division multiple access CDMA IS 95 standard the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 3GPP2 wireless IP network standard or the Evolution Data Optimized EVDO standard the Global System for Mobile GSM communication standard a time division multiple access TDMA standard or other standards used for public mobile wireless communications. The mobile stations may be capable of conventional voice telephone communications and data communications.

For purposes of later discussion several mobile stations appear in the drawing to represent examples of the mobile stations that may receive various services via the mobile communication network .

Mobile stations can take the form of portable handsets smart phones or personal digital assistants although they may be implemented in other form factors. Mobile stations can include media content. The media content can be configured to execute on many different types of mobile stations . For example a mobile station application can be written to execute on a binary runtime environment for mobile BREW based mobile station. In further instances a mobile station application can be written to execute on a Windows Mobile based mobile station Android I Phone Java Mobile or RIM based mobile station such as a BlackBerry or the like.

The mobile communication network can be implemented by a number of interconnected networks. Hence the overall network may include a number of radio access networks RANs as well as regional ground networks interconnecting a number of RANs and a wide area network WAN interconnecting the regional ground networks to core network elements. A regional portion of the network such as that serving mobile stations can include one or more RANs and a regional circuit and or packet switched network and associated signaling network facilities.

Physical elements of a RAN operated by one of the mobile service providers or carriers include a number of base stations represented in the example by the base stations BSs . Although not separately shown such a base station can include a base transceiver system BTS which can communicate via an antennae system at the site of base station and over the airlink with one or more of the mobile stations when the mobile stations are within range. Each base station can include a BTS coupled to several antennae mounted on a radio tower within a coverage area often referred to as a cell. The BTS is the part of the radio network that sends and receives RF signals to from the mobile stations that are served by the base station .

The radio access networks can also include a traffic network represented generally by the cloud at which carries the user communications and data for the mobile stations between the base stations and other elements with or through which the mobile stations communicate. In some examples the mobile traffic network includes network elements that support mobile station media content transfer services such as mobile switching centers MSCs signal transfer points STPs and an application server App. Server . The network can also include other elements that support functionality other than media content transfer services such as messaging service messages and voice communications. Examples of other network elements that may be used in support of messaging service message communications include but are not limited to message centers MCs home location registers HLRs simple messaging service point to point SMPP gateway and other network elements such as wireless internet gateways WIGs and visitor location registers VLRs not shown . Other individual elements such as switches and or routers forming the traffic network are omitted here form simplicity. It will be understood that the various network elements can communicate with each other and other aspects of the mobile communications network and other networks e.g. the public switched telephone network PSTN and the Internet either directly or indirectly.

The mobile switching center MSC is responsible for managing communications between the mobile station and the other elements of the network . In addition the MSC is responsible for handling voice calls and messaging service message requests as well as other services such as conference calls FAX and circuit switched data messaging service communications Internet access etc. . The MSC sets up and releases the end to end connection or session and handles mobility and hand over requirements during the call. The MSC also routes messaging service messages to from the mobile stations typically from to an appropriate MC . The MSC is sometimes referred to as a switch . The MSC manages the cell sites the voice trunks voicemail and SS7 links.

The message center MC in some examples allows messaging service messages to be exchanged between mobile telephones and other networks. For SMS messaging for example the MC receives packet communications containing text messages from originating mobile stations and forwards the messages via the signaling resources and the signaling channels to the appropriate destination mobile stations. The MC may receive messages from external devices for similar delivery to mobile stations and the MC may receive similar messages from the mobile devices and forward them to servers or terminal devices in either case via an Internet Protocol IP packet data network.

In some examples the MC can also be considered or include functionality that may be considered that of a Short Messaging Service Message Center SMSC or a Message Register MR . Wireless carriers developed the short message service SMS to transmit text messages for display on the mobile stations. In many existing network architectures the SMS traffic uses the signaling portion of the network to carry message traffic between a Short Message Service Center SMSC and the mobile stations. The SMSC supports mobile station to mobile station delivery of text messages. However the SMSC also supports communication of messages between the mobile stations and devices coupled to other networks. For example the SMSC may receive incoming IP message packets from the Internet for delivery via the network one of the base stations and a signaling channel over the air link to a destination mobile station. For this later type of SMS related communications the network also includes one or more Short Message Peer to Peer SMPP protocol gateways .

In other examples the MC can include functionality related to the Enhanced Messaging Service EMS or Multimedia Messaging service MMS . An EMS message can have special text formatting e.g. such as bold or italic animations pictures icons sound effects and special ring tones. MMS messages support the sending and receiving of multimedia messages e.g. images audio video and their combinations to or from MMS enabled mobile stations. In some examples the MC can be considered in whole or in part a multimedia messaging service center MMSC .

Although a single MC is shown a network can have many geographically dispersed MCs . The MCs can include destination routing tables DRTs . In essence the DRTs are databases within the MCs . A DRT contains a list of the MDNs which are associated with the various MCs . For example a first MDN is associated with a MC in California while a second MDN is associated with a MC in Virginia. The DRTs are used to determine which MC should attempt to deliver an incoming messaging service message to the destination MDN. For example if a user associated with the MC in California sends an SMS to a user associated with the MC in Virginia the California MC sends the SMS to the Virginia MC for delivery to the destination MDN. The communication among the MCs occurs using know protocols such SMPP and the like.

The HLR in some examples stores a subscriber profile for each of the wireless subscribers and their associated mobile stations and . The HLR may reside in an MSC or in a centralized service control point that communicates with the MSC s via an out of band signaling system such as an SS7 network. The HLR stores for each mobile subscriber the subscriber s mobile directory number MDN the mobile identification number MIN and information specifying the wireless services subscribed to by the mobile subscriber such as numeric paging or text based paging data communication services etc. Of course the HLR can also be a stand alone device. The HLR also tracks the current point of attachment of the mobile station to the network e.g. the identification of the MSC with which the mobile station is currently registered to receive service.

The visitor location register VLR not shown is in some examples a temporary database of the mobile stations that have roamed into the particular area which it serves. The VLRs for a region often are implemented in or in association with a MSC . Each base station in the network is served by a single VLR hence a subscriber cannot be present in more than one VLR at a time. The data stored in the VLR has either been received from the HLR or collected from the mobile station.

The SMPP gateway provides functionality to transport messaging service messages to other mobile communication networks and also receive messaging service messages from other networks. The SMPP gateway supports communications using the SMPP protocol. SMPP gateways are Short Message Peer to Peer SMPP gateways used to connect the wireless communication network such as an Internal Protocol IP network on the left of the SMPP Gateway in to another network such as a public Internet network on the right of the SMPP Gateway in . The SMPP Gateway allows the MC to receive and send messages in IP packet format. The SMPP Gateway is an entity within the wireless network that acts as an intermediary between the wireless service provider network and other networks. For example the SMPP Gateway converts messages in protocol s used by other applications and devices e.g. Extensible Markup Language XML Hypertext Mail Protocol HTMP etc. to and from the SMPP protocol. The SMPP messages ride on IP transport e.g. between the SMPP Gateway and the MC .

In addition the traffic network portion of the mobile communications network connects to a private data network . The private data network connects to the traffic network portion via a gateway not shown . The gateway can provide protocol conversions between the protocols used by the traffic network and the protocols used by the private data network . The private data network can be in communication with various auxiliary services servers e.g. such as those providing additional services to the users of the network and or to operations support personnel of the service provider or carrier that operates the network . For example the carrier can also offer its subscribers on line access to a variety of functions related to the subscribers accounts such as review of billing statements and usage data on line payment subscription changes password control or the like. For that purpose the carrier can operate a customer account web server offering a MyAccount type subscriber interface via the Internet e.g. a My Verizon page for a user having a Verizon Wireless account. Hence a user s terminal such as PC may be used to access on line information about a subscriber s account which the mobile carrier makes available via the carrier s MyAccount web site accessible through the Internet .

In addition a group provisioning manager device GPMD a zone provisioning device ZPD and a service creation manager device SCMD can be provided in communication with the private data network media content transfer functions e.g. downloading of media content. The GPMD can also be referred to as a group provisioning manager network device. For discussion purposes each of the GPMD ZPD and SCMD can be a stand alone computing device such as a server. The functionality described below with respect to each of the GPMD ZPD and SCMD can however be provided by one or multiple different computing devices. In other words the GPMD ZPD and SCMD need not be a stand alone computing device in various configurations. The SCMD can maintain provisioning information for a particular end user and mobile station . As explained in further detail below for a network can be provided with various elements for determining the location of a mobile station and allowing software applications to make use of such position information. A voicemail platform e.g. hard drive storage is shown in addition to a digital signal cross connect DSX .

An example of a wireless network with infrastructure for support of live voicemail is shown . Network includes elements similar to those of network of including one or more mobile stations . depicts a scenario where a circuit switched incoming call is provided to a circuit switched mobile station. The mobile devices or stations can be advanced devices e.g. a Blackberry RIM Android Palm LiMo Java or Linux device. With continued reference to the incoming call is routed out of the BSC vocoder . As shown a T1 connection links the DTC SPM through the DSX and or DACS and over to the Voicemail platform . The T1 can be optioned with in band SS7 signaling on two channels of the T1 for call set up and the remaining 22 ds0 channels can be used for voice. The SS7 signaling can be set up in the Voicemail and assigned a pointcode and also given the pointcode of the MSC . The MSC translation can be set up with the pointcode to the Voicemail that the subscriber is assigned. When a call set up is established on the SNMP and the SS7 to the MSC and the called party does not answer the call is routed to the voicemail trunks and sent to the voicemail storage where the voice can be saved e.g. on hard drive disk space. MSC is present and can include two DTC SPMs and trunk monitoring and switching controller TM ST and trunk monitoring block as shown.

As shown in an incoming voice message from is duplicated and split with one trunk leading to the voicemail platform storage and simultaneously one outbound voice signal being sent to the called party e.g. at . A second path from the DACS to the media gateway allows for trunks to be established between the MSC and the media gateway through to the voicemail and the called party e.g. at . In this scenario the call set up takes place but the HLR is queried to see if the subscriber has live voice mail feature enabled. If the feature is enabled and the called party does not answer the call is routed to the trunks going to the media gateway . The media gateway recognizes the call needs to be routed to the voicemail point code and duplicates the voice packets and sends one to the MSC and establishes the 2path to the voicemail box. Now there are two audio transmissions one being handled by the voicemail as a call no answer and the second being routed out of the MSC to the site controller and to the called party.

The called party will manually end the incoming call but instead of no audio the called party will receive the outbound audio that is also routed to the voicemail . This is preferably outbound only and the called party can not induce any audio back to the originating caller. The called party can then end the call for a second time to stop the audio transmission.

The software on the mobile station and the network architecture can be configured to allow the called party to choose between three 3 options e.g. by selecting one of three buttons or virtual switches on a touch screen call answer end call send directly and only to voicemail or monitor call send to voicemail and monitor audio . The call is set up in two directions and the called party will not be able to end the call going to voicemail only end the transmission that is being received by the called party s phone. When the originating caller disconnects the call the path is torn down. The SMS sends a message to the called party that a voice message has been left.

With continued reference to when receiving an incoming voice message the message is duplicated and split with one trunk leading to the voicemail platform and simultaneously one outbound voice signal being sent to the called party. There is another path from the DACS to the media gateway to allow for trunks to be established between the MSC and the media gateway. In this scenario the call set up takes place but the Packet Core is queried to see if the subscriber has live voice mail feature enabled. If the feature is enabled and the called party does not answer a signal is sent to the MSC to establish the call to the gateway controller. The call is routed to the trunks going to the media gateway. The media gateway recognizes the call needs to be routed to the voicemail point code and duplicates the voice packets and sends path to the voicemail box and recognizes the other path needing to be routed to the VANC Volga gateway. The media gateway sets up a call with outbound audio only to the eNodeB and to the called party in one direction. The called party receives a duplicate of the audio that is being routed to the voicemail system. The called party can disconnect the call by ending the call a second time. When the originating caller disconnects the call the path is torn down. The SMS sends a message to the called party that a voice message has been left.

The Voicemail is accessed through the PDN SAE gateway EPC and through the IMS . EPC includes SGW MME PGW and PCRF . VANC is connected to EPC and MSC DACS and Media Gateway .

In providing live voicemail e.g. to mobile station the packet core gateway will duplicate the voice and set up one call to the voicemail storage device and the other will be sent to the called party outbound only . In this scenario the called party can have an option to connect to the originating party while the voicemail is being left. The call will go full two way audio and the voice call routed to the voicemail platform will be torn down. The call can now continue as a standard call and can be torn down by the called party.

Continuing with the description of in operation the mobile subscriber registers with the MME over the LTE network. The MME checks the privileges and authenticates the subscriber through the HLR HSS home subscriber server. The mobile is connected with the VANC through a bearer channel using IP protocols. The mobile can acquire the VANC IP by DHCP or it can be static assigned. The mobile then registers on the MSC through the secure channel established. A dedicated channel is established between the VANC and the MSC through a secure channel. If a call needs to be set up to the VANC from the circuit switched network a paging message is sent as though the VANC was a BSC. Once the call is set up the MSC recognizes the called party and sends the set up signal over the SNMP simple network management protocol and the phone begins to receive an audible alert ringing . The called party then acknowledges the call will be sent to voicemail and to monitor call by ending the call. The second call end will end the audio being received from the called party. The MSC will set up a call to the media gateway. The media gateway will recognize the call is being sent to the voicemail IP address or point code circuit switched and duplicate the call to both the called party s IP address and the Voicemail IP address.

Continuing with the description of the SGW sends the Proxy Binding Update to the PGW as shown at step . Next the PGW responds back with Acknowledge message to the SGW as shown at step . Then as shown at step the SGW replies to the GTP message with a create session response. At step the MME then responds to the S1AP initial context setup message. As shown at step the eNodeB notifies the UE RRC connection reconfigure NAS. As shown at step the UE responds with a RRC Connection reconfigure complete message to the eNodeB . The eNodeB notifies the MME with the context setup response as shown at step . Then RRC UL information Trans. NAS as shown at step . At step the eNodeB sends the S1AP UL NAS trans NAS message to the MME. At step the MME sends a GTP modify bearer request to the SGW. Finally at step the GTP Modify Bearer Request is sent to the MME.

As shown by the above discussion functions relating to live voicemail may be implemented on network elements such as media gateways and or voicemail platforms configured for wireless communication via a mobile communication network or on elements operating as one of the mobile stations as shown by way of example in . The software functionalities involve programming including executable code as well as associated stored data e.g. files used for the code recognition. The programming code is executable by the processor microprocessor or the like that functions as the control element of the particular gateway voicemail platform or mobile station device. In operation the code is stored within the memory of the particular element or device for loading and execution by the processor. At other times however the executable code may be stored at other locations and or transported for loading into the element or device. Execution of such code by the corresponding network elements enables the wireless network to implement the methodology of providing live voicemail to mobile stations in essentially the manner performed in the examples discussed and illustrated herein.

Hence aspects of the methods of providing live voicemail outlined above may be embodied in programming. Program aspects of the technology may be thought of as products or articles of manufacture typically in the form of executable code and or associated data that is carried on or embodied in a type of machine readable medium. Storage type media include any or all of the non transitory tangible memory of the computers processors mobile stations or the like or associated modules thereof such as various semiconductor memories tape drives disk drives and the like which may provide non transitory storage at any time for the software programming. All or portions of the software may at times be communicated through the Internet or various other telecommunication networks. Such communications for example may enable loading of the software from a computer or processor into the gateway and or the voicemail platform to add or update the live voicemail functionality of the network infrastructure. Thus another type of media that may bear the software elements includes optical electrical and electromagnetic waves such as used across physical interfaces between local devices through wired and optical landline networks and over various air links. The physical elements that carry such waves such as wired or wireless links optical links or the like also may be considered as media bearing the software. As used herein storage media relates to tangible non transitory media for storing programming and or data and unless restricted to such storage media terms such as computer or machine readable medium refer to any medium that participates in providing instructions to a processor for execution.

Such a machine readable medium may take many forms including but not limited to a tangible storage medium a carrier wave medium or physical transmission medium. Non volatile storage media include for example optical or magnetic disks such as any of the storage devices in the mobile stations illustrated in the drawings. Volatile storage media include dynamic memory such as main memory of such a computer platform. Tangible transmission media include coaxial cables copper wire and fiber optics including the wires that comprise a bus within a computer system. Carrier wave transmission media can take the form of electric or electromagnetic signals or acoustic or light waves such as those generated during radio frequency RF and infrared IR data communications. Common forms of computer readable media therefore include for example a floppy disk a flexible disk hard disk magnetic tape any other magnetic medium a CD ROM DVD or DVD ROM any other optical medium punch cards paper tape any other physical storage medium with patterns of holes a RAM a ROM a PROM and EPROM a Flash EPROM any other memory chip or cartridge a carrier wave transporting data or instructions cables or links transporting such a carrier wave or any other medium from which a computer can read programming code and or data. Many of these forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to a processor for execution.

While the foregoing has described what are considered to be the best mode and or other examples it is understood that various modifications may be made therein and that the subject matter disclosed herein may be implemented in various forms and examples and that the teachings may be applied in numerous applications only some of which have been described herein. It is intended by the following claims to claim any and all applications modifications and variations that fall within the true scope of the present teachings.

The description above has used a large number of acronyms to refer to various services messages and system components. Although generally known use of several of these acronyms is not strictly standardized in the art. For the convenience of the reader the following list correlates terms to acronyms as used in the detailed description above.
