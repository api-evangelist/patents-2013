The present invention relates to external fixation and particularly to fixator pins and devices used in treating bone fractures and deformities with the use of sub atmospheric pressure.

External fixation is a common technique used to treat a variety of conditions including bone fractures dislocations and deformities. Although different techniques are used external fixation generally involves the use of threaded fixator pins that are screwed into bone. For bone fractures two or more fixator pins are inserted into the bone on each side of the fracture. Compression and distraction forces are applied to the fixator pins to correctly position and align the bone. External fixation may be applied over several months for complicated fractures during which time the pin remains in the bone. Long term use of external fixator pins involves risks and complications that can delay the patient s recovery and further aggravate the patient s condition. In some patients the pin may result in infection within the pin tract in the bone. In addition the skin around the pin skin interface can become irritated or infected. The pin may also become unstable and loosened in the bone. Therefore there is a need for improved implements and devices that reduce the risks and complications associated with external fixation.

Based on the foregoing an external fixation assembly includes a plurality of hollow fixator pins for insertion into a patient s bone. Each pin has a hollow shaft with an insertion end that may be advanced through a tissue opening and into the patient s bone. The shaft has an interior passageway or conduit such as a bore that extends generally along the longitudinal axis of the shaft. At least one vent aperture and optionally a plurality of vent apertures extend through the shaft in fluid communication with the bore. The pin may be removably connected to a source of vacuum pressure operable to draw fluid or gas through the aperture of the pin and apply reduced pressure in the tissue surrounding the pin. The reduced pressure may be used to stimulate blood circulation around the tissue opening reduce the potential for inflammation and infection and stabilize the fixator pin in the bone.

The shaft may include a first inner section or insertion end such as a threaded section for securing the fixator pin in the bone. In addition the shaft may include a second outer section such as a non threaded section. A connection port is provided on the shaft for example along or at an end of the outer section to fluidly connect to or communicate with the bore inside the pin. The port may be connected to the source of vacuum pressure by a suitable connection such as a flexible tube. A cover is removably disposed around the pin and surrounds the tissue opening to form a generally fluid tight enclosure that is sufficient to enable sub atmospheric pressure i.e. negative pressure to be maintained beneath the cover. A pressure distribution element such as a porous screen may additionally be placed at or around the pin and between the tissue opening and the cover to prevent sub atmospheric pressure to be distributed beneath the cover and at the tissue opening and optionally to substantially prevent direct contact between the tissue opening and the cover.

If a plurality of vent apertures are utilized the apertures may be located on one or more sections of the shaft to apply reduced pressure to different selected locations along the shaft and optionally to different tissue areas. For example the apertures may be formed in the outer or non threaded section of the shaft and adapted to apply reduced pressure at the epidermis or external to the epidermis. In addition the apertures may be formed in the inner or threaded section and adapted to apply a reduced pressure in the pin tract in the bone. Alternatively the apertures may be formed in two separate areas on the non threaded section of the shaft to apply reduced pressure for example to one or more of a sub cutaneous layer or organ the epidermis and or a tissue layer in the dermis. As yet a further alternative apertures may be provided in the inner or threaded section as well as the outer or non threaded section as well as along different areas of the outer section to supply reduced pressure at any one or all of the bone sub cutaneous tissue or organs the dermis the epidermis and to areas beneath the cover and outside of the epidermis or any other selected tissues or organs enclosed and sealed within the cover.

A method for applying external fixation using the hollow fixator pins described above includes the step of inserting each pin through a skin opening and into bone. The pin is positioned so that the apertures are in substantial alignment with selected tissue. For example the apertures could be aligned with the epidermis or positioned inside the pin tract in the bone or at other desired locations. Once the pins are placed the skin opening around each pin is covered with a sealed enclosure. The hollow pins are connected to a source of vacuum pressure. The source of vacuum pressure functions to create reduced pressure that is supplied from the pin apertures in the patient s bone tissue or any soft tissues outside of the bone as desired.

Referring now to the drawing figures in general and to specifically an external fixator assembly is shown in accordance with the invention. In general the fixator assembly may include four hollow fixator pins inserted into bone tissue in the patient on opposite sides of a fracture or other deformity so that suitable compression or distraction forces can be applied. Each fixator pin is positioned at a pin site and connected to a source of vacuum pressure . Negative or reduced pressure e.g. sub atmospheric pressure is applied at each pin site to stimulate blood circulation to the pin site to reduce the potential for inflammation and infection and to stabilize the fixator pin. While each of the fixator pins shown in is a cannulated pin for supplying reduced pressure other fixator arrangements could be utilized in which one or more fixation pins are cannulated while one or more other pins are not cannulated. The non cannulated pins may be used at pin sites where the application of reduced pressure is contra indicated or is not desired or needed.

Each cannulated fixator pin has a hollow shaft and sidewall that forms an internal bore . The fixator pin may be cannulated from an outer end to provide an access port at the outer port end that leads to the internal bore that extends from the outer end to the inner or tip end of the pin. To preserve the integrity of the tip the bore may terminate before extending through the tip end. The fixator pin is removably connected to the source of vacuum pressure by suitable connectors or tubing such as flexible tubes removably coupled to the port end of the pin . One or more vent apertures extend through the sidewall of the fixator pin and communicate with the bore in the shaft. The source of vacuum pressure is operable to draw fluid or gas through the apertures and bore to create negative pressure at the interface between the pin and tissue around the pin.

Referring now to the external fixator assembly will be described in more detail. For purposes of clarity the fixator assembly is shown in simplified form with a fixator device having two fixator pins on each side of a bone fracture or other deformity . It will be appreciated that more than two fixator pins may be inserted on each side of the bone fracture depending on the location and nature of the fracture. In addition it will be appreciated that the fixator assembly is not strictly intended for bone fractures and may be applied to other conditions including for example dislocations and deformities. The assembly may incorporate a variety of fixator devices and the specific type of fixator is not critical. For example the fixator assembly may be used with flexible or rigid fixators. In addition the fixator assembly may be applied to different fracture types and fracture locations including for example femural fractures and tibial fractures.

The fixator includes a pair of retainers with each retainer positioned on one side of the bone fracture . One or more bars connect between the retainers and are operable to apply compression and distraction forces on the fixator pins. In the retainers are connected for example by a compression bar A and a distraction bar B.

Referring now to a fixator pin is shown having a hollow or cannulated shaft with an attachment end the port end and an insertion end the tip end . The bore extends through the hollow shaft of the cannulated fixator pin and provides fluid communication from the attachment end to the insertion end . A vacuum port is formed at or through the attachment end of the shaft and is in fluid communication with the bore . The attachment end is adapted to receive an end of flexible tubing in a sealed snug fit as the tube slides over the attachment end to provide a fluid flow path to the vacuum port as shown in . The flexible tubing has an interior lumen with a diameter substantially equal to the outer diameter of the fixator pin . As such the flexible tubing is configured to slide over the attachment end of the fixator pin and form a substantially fluid tight seal. The flexible tube connects the fixator pin with a source of vacuum pressure . A variety of vacuum pressure sources may be used with the fixator assembly including for example a Gast Vacuum pump Fischer Scientific .

The pin has a first threaded section that may taper to form a sharp point or tip and a second non threaded section . The pin may have other configurations wherein the tip end does not taper to a point or does not taper at all. The threaded section is configured to penetrate into the bone to securely anchor the fixator pin into the pin tract in the bone . For this purpose the pin may include a self tapping threaded tip for tapping into bone . Alternatively the fixator pin may be provided in the from of a transfixing pin for positioning through a limb . In such a use the pin may have a threaded middle portion with smooth end portions or the entire pin may be threaded and the pin may be provided with a Trocar tip. Vent apertures may be provided in the middle portion of the pin or may be provided peripherally e.g. vent apertures .

As shown schematically in the pin screws into the bone to hold the pin firmly in place. For this purpose the pin may be screwed into the bone a desired depth greater than that specifically depicted in so that the non tapered portion extends into the bone to anchor the pin in place. Optionally a portion of the pin such as tip may be detachable to provide an implant that may be left in the patient as shown in . In such a configuration the pin or the implant portion e.g. tip may comprise a bone substitute material. For example the pin or tip may comprise a natural synthetic or natural synthetic hybrid porous material and may comprise a material to support or direct osteoconduction or a material to induce differentiation of stem cells to osteogenic cells i.e. osteoinductive agents or materials which provide stem cells e.g. bone marrow aspirate.

For example the pin or tip may be a bioglass ceramic material or other natural or synthetic porous material such as calcium sulphate or calcium phosphate. One suitable calcium sulphate bone substitute is OSTEOSET Bone Graft Substitute a product of Wright Medical Technology Inc. of Arlington Tenn. Another class of suitable materials is one comprising various derivates of calcium phosphate which can be used to provide a structural matrix for osteoconduction such as hydroxyapatite coral based or chemically derived synthetic ceramic fluorapatite tri calcium phosphate bioglass ceramics and combinations thereof. One suitable calcium phosphate bone substitute is OsteoGraft Bone Graft Substitute a product of Millenium Biologix of Kingston Ontario Canada. In addition the pin or tip need not comprise a bone substitute material and may comprise a metal or other suitable materials.

In addition a guide pin may be used in conjunction with the open ended fixator pin to aid in guiding placement of the fixator pin . For instance a narrow guide pin having a cross sectional dimension less than that of the bore may be placed in the bone prior to placement of the fixator pin allowing the physician to first verify that the guide pin has been placed in the correct location. The location of the guide pin may be determined by an x ray or other suitable imaging modality. After the guide pin location has been verified the fixator pin may be inserted in the bone by placing the fixator pin over the guide pin so that the guide pin is located within the bore of the fixator pin.

Returning now to a plurality of apertures may formed through the non threaded section of the shaft to form a vent section along the length of the shaft. The apertures extend through the wall of the shaft . When the vacuum pump is activated the vacuum pump draws air or gas through the apertures to create negative pressure through and along the apertures. The apertures may be positioned at various locations relative to the tip to apply reduced pressure at specific areas within the pin tract. For example the apertures may be positioned where the pin intersects with the epidermis skin pin interface as shown in . In this arrangement the apertures may form a vent section at a location at and above the epidermis to supply negative pressure through a reduced pressure distribution element or screen . Alternatively the apertures may be positioned where the pin intersects deeper tissue layers in the dermis . Apertures may be concentrated at one section of the shaft to treat a specific tissue layer or may be formed at multiple sections of the shaft to supply reduced pressure to multiple layers or tissues. In a second embodiment of a fixator pin is shown with apertures positioned at one section of the shaft to supply reduced pressure at the skin pin interface and apertures positioned at another section of the shaft to supply reduced pressure at deeper tissue layers in the dermis . As shown in the tip end of the fixator pin may also include apertures to supply reduced pressure to bone at the pin bone interface. The pins may also be used intermittently or continuously to effect delivery of medication such as antibiotics local anesthetic and biopharmaceuticals to the various tissue pin interfaces by introducing medication into the bore for delivery through the vent apertures.

A fluid tight enclosure or cover such as OpSite or TEGADERM is positioned over the pin to cover the pin site. The cover is configured to form a fluid tight seal around the pin site to maintain the reduced pressure that is applied at the tissue pin interface. The cover includes an inner face that faces into the pin site and an outer face that faces outwardly and away from the pin site when the cover is placed over the pin . The inner face may include an adhesive backing that adheres to the patient s skin around the periphery of the pin site. Alternatively or in addition other adhesives or sealers may be applied. The adhesive backing has sufficient adhesive properties to form a fluid tight enclosure around the periphery of the pin site and to hold the cover in sealed contact with the patient s skin when reduced pressure is applied beneath the cover. The cover may be impermeable or semipermeable depending on the level of permeability needed or desired for a particular application as long as the desired level of reduced pressure is maintained beneath the cover for a desired amount of time to effect the desired treatment.

A hole or opening is formed through a central or interior portion of the cover and is adapted to fit over the attachment end of the fixator pin as the attachment end of the pin is inserted through the hole . The cover engages the outer circumference of the pin in a fluid tight seal to substantially prevent leakage of pressure through the hole around the pin. Optionally the cover may incorporate an O ring seal at the hole in the cover that is adapted to squeeze around and seal onto the outer periphery of the pin. The O ring engages the exterior of the fixator pin when the cover is placed over the pin. The O ring has an inner diameter substantially equal to the outer diameter of the fixator pin and is configured to frictionally engage the outer surface of the pin. The O ring may be affixed to the cover around the hole by an adhesive or other bonding. Alternatively the O ring may be embedded within the cover or heat sealed into the cover. For example the cover may include two plies that form a pocket in which the O ring is embedded. The frictional engagement between the O ring and pin forms a fluid tight seal between the exterior of the pin and the cover.

It may be desirable to stabilize the O ring axially on the pin . Referring to the pin includes a pair of circumferential ridges on the outer section of the pin that form a seat for the O ring . The ridges form a narrow groove having a thickness and diameter suitable to seat the O ring . The groove is adapted to receive the O ring when the cover is placed over the pin . As a result the seat formed by the ridges limits the axial displacement of the O ring and cover along the length of the pin . The O ring may be formed of any flexible elastomeric material that permits the O ring to be stretched. In this way the O ring can be stretched to temporarily expand the inside diameter of the O ring to allow it to be slipped over the top ridge and into the seat allowing the O ring to slide into and become properly seated within the seat groove.

A reduced pressure distribution element such as a porous screen may surround the apertures on the fixator pin as shown in . The screen is positioned beneath the cover and over the pin site to help distribute reduced pressure across its surface area and to optionally help keep the cover out of direct contact with the skin around the pin . The screen has sufficient porosity to permit the flow of gases into the apertures of the pin when reduced pressure is applied by the vacuum pump. The screen may also absorb exudate and other liquids that may aspirate from the tissue around the pin site. Preferably the screen is formed out of an open cell polymer foam such as polyurethane foam. Other porous or perforated materials may also be used. Foams may be used with a wide range of pore sizes and densities. Since the fixator assembly usually rests on top of the patient s extremity it may be desirable to select a light weight low density foam or sponge that is less noticeable to the patient. It may optionally be desirable to form large perforations or other flow paths in the screen to reduce the weight of the screen or to increase the flow of gas drawn by the vacuum pump. In the screen and cover are cut to fit over a single pin site. Other screen and cover configurations may be used however and the configurations illustrated in the drawing figures are not intended to be the only workable configurations. For example it may be desirable to use a single screen and cover over multiple pin sites. This may be desirable where pins are spaced close together in a relatively small area.

The fixator assembly may be used in the following manner. After the pin locations are selected small incisions are made through the skin at the pin locations and the fixator pins are placed into the patient s bone. The desired pin location may include a fracture or a joint to be immobilized. In such a case where the pin is inserted in the fracture or joint the pin may desirably include an implantable portion which may optionally comprises a bone substitute material. The pins are advanced into the bone until the pin apertures are positioned at a desired axial locations relative to the tissue pin interface. For example as shown in the apertures may be positioned at the skin pin interface in substantial alignment at with or above the epidermis or in communication with the screen . Alternatively as shown in the apertures may also be positioned adjacent to tissue in the dermis either exclusively or in conjunction with apertures at another location such apertures at or above the epidermis . Apertures may be provided at other locations as well. Screens are secured over the pins around the apertures and over the incisions. Covers are then placed over the pins and the adhesive surfaces on the inner faces of the covers are pressed firmly against the patient s skin to form a fluid tight enclosure around the pin sites. Many types of suitable covers may be used. The fixator is then assembled and connected with the fixator pins. Once the fixator is assembled flexible tubes are connected to the attachment ends of the fixator pins and to the suction port of the vacuum pump .

The vacuum pump is connected to a power source and switched on to apply reduced pressure within the space beneath the cover as shown in . The amount of pressure reduction applied at the pin sites is dependent on the desired course of treatment the location of the pins the density of the screen material and other variables. For example the reduced pressure may be between 10 mm Hg below atmospheric pressure and 300 mm Hg below atmospheric pressure. In the embodiment shown in reduced pressure is supplied to the pin bone interface at apertures while the cover and optional screen help to maintain the negative pressure at that site.

Thus far the fixator pins have been described primarily with apertures that are positioned to apply reduced pressure at the epidermis and or dermis. It will be appreciated that reduced pressure may be applied at deeper levels in the pin incision and need not be limited to the dermis or epidermis. For example reduced pressure may be applied as shown in at the interface between the fixator pin and bone bone pin interface by apertures positioned at the bone of . Application of reduced pressure in bone tissue is intended to reduce the occurrence of pin tract infection and inflammation in the bone. In addition the application of reduced pressure in bone tissue is intended to increase bone growth and bone ingrowth in the pin tract which increases stability of the pin.

Referring now more specifically to a third embodiment of a fixator pin is shown. The fixator pin is configured to apply reduced pressure at the bone pin interface in a pin tract. The fixator pin is substantially similar to the pins described above having a hollow shaft with a central bore an insertion end a threaded section on the insertion end a non threaded section and a plurality of apertures . The apertures are formed in the threaded section of the insertion end as opposed to the non threaded section of the shaft. In this way the reduced pressure is applied through bore to the pin tract inside the bone . Referring to the apertures are preferably recessed in the groove formed by the thread on the threaded section at the tip . The groove provides additional void space around the apertures to reduce the potential for clogging caused by bone fragments that may become lodged in the apertures.

In some cases it may be desirable to locate the vacuum port as a side port on the side of the pin rather than at the attachment end. For example the fixator appliance may have retainers that connect over the top of the fixator pins covering the attachment ends of the pins and preventing connection of flexible tubing to the attachment ends. Therefore locating the vacuum port on the side of the pin can avoid problems that occur when the attachment end is obstructed or inaccessible. In a fourth embodiment of a fixator pin is shown in accordance with the invention. The fixator pin is connected to a retainer that covers the end of the fixator pin. A vacuum port is formed through the side wall of the pin and connects with a flexible tube . A cylindrical hub surrounds the vacuum port and projects radially outwardly from the side wall of the pin . The flexible tube is adapted to slide over the hub to connect the port to a vacuum pump or other source of reduced pressure. The hub has an outer diameter that is substantially equal to the inner diameter of the flexible tube . In this way the flexible tube slides over the hub in frictional engagement to form a fluid tight seal around the port .
