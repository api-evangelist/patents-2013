This invention was made with governmental support under grant number DE DE FC26 06NT42932 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.

Sealed beam lamps are ubiquitous and used in a variety of lighting applications. They are employed for example as automobile headlights theatrical lights outdoor architectural lights aircraft landing lights and spot lights. A sealed beam lamp is a type of lamp that includes a reflector and filament manufactured as a single assembly over which a front cover or lens usually of clear glass is permanently attached. Popular sizes of sealed beam lamps are the PAR56 PAR38 and PAR30 where the PAR is an acronym for Parabolic Aluminum Reflector. The PAR has come to be accepted as a non SI unit of measurement equal to one eighth of an inch. For example a PAR38 light bulb is a light bulb having a diameter equal to 4.75 inches. Common light beam spreads for sealed beam lamps are flood spot narrow spot or very narrow spot beams.

Spot lights are found in various retail residential and architectural settings everyday. For example virtually all supermarkets convenience stores drug stores department stores jewelry stores discount stores motor vehicle dealers and specialty apparel stores use spot lighting. Conventional light sources typically employed in spot lighting applications however suffer from a number of drawbacks.

In particular fluorescent light sources although often efficient and inexpensive are too diffuse to be effective for spot lighting. In other words these sources are poorly suited for applications requiring directed light. In addition to poor light output distribution color temperatures of these sources are not well suited for many applications. Further although halogen lamps tend to have low upfront costs good color rendition and good beam control they are typically quite inefficient for spot light applications having light output efficiencies in the range of just 10 20 lumens watt. Another type of lamp typically used for spot lighting is the ceramic metal halide CMH lamp. While CMH lamps can offer good beam control and energy efficiency they typically have high initial costs and can be too bright and non dimmable making adjacent areas often look dark by comparison. Finally traditional incandescent lighting tends to be too inefficient for spot lighting applications.

Given the widespread use of spot lighting and other types of lighting in general vast energy savings for the benefit of both business and consumer users and the environment could be realized if the energy efficiency of lighting could be improved without compromising performance. Despite these potential energy savings and the growing environmental concerns that have existed for years in the world however there still exists a need for a sealed beam lamp having substantially improved energy efficiency. In particular there exists a need for a highly efficient durable and relatively inexpensive spot light capable of providing aesthetically pleasing illumination with a uniform beam pattern to fit application and end user expectations.

The advent of digital lighting technologies i.e. illumination based on semiconductor light sources such as light emitting diodes LEDs offers a viable alternative to traditional fluorescent HID and incandescent lamps. Functional advantages and benefits of LEDs include high energy conversion and optical efficiency robustness lower operating costs and many others. The LEDs smaller size long operating life low energy consumption and durability make them a great choice in a variety of lighting applications.

Accordingly it would be desirable to provide an improved luminaire employing LED light sources addressing the drawbacks of conventional technologies while providing quality illumination. Besides the required high color rendering properties quality of light considerations include several other observable and measurable criteria like useful and applicable spatial distribution of the illumination and a white emission of desired color temperature with no halos or other texture and color artifacts. It is also desirable for this luminaire to retain commonly encountered form factors so that existing hardware sockets and power connections could be employed thereby further reducing costs and reducing waste associated with retooling and facilitating adoption of the improved luminaire.

The present invention relates generally to energy efficient LED based luminaires having standard form factors so that they may be used with existing lighting hardware. More particularly various embodiments of the present invention are directed to high output lighting systems suitable for replacement of conventional lighting sources.

As used herein for purposes of the present disclosure the term LED should be understood to include any electroluminescent diode or other type of carrier injection junction based system that is capable of generating radiation in response to an electric signal. Thus the term LED includes but is not limited to various semiconductor based structures that emit light in response to current light emitting polymers organic light emitting diodes OLEDs electroluminescent strips and the like. In particular the term LED refers to light emitting diodes of all types including semiconductor and organic light emitting diodes that may be configured to generate radiation in one or more of the infrared spectrum ultraviolet spectrum and various portions of the visible spectrum generally including radiation wavelengths from approximately 400 nanometers to approximately 700 nanometers . Some examples of LEDs include but are not limited to various types of infrared LEDs ultraviolet LEDs red LEDs blue LEDs green LEDs yellow LEDs amber LEDs orange LEDs and white LEDs discussed further below . It also should be appreciated that LEDs may be configured and or controlled to generate radiation having various bandwidths e.g. full widths at half maximum or FWHM for a given spectrum e.g. narrow bandwidth broad bandwidth and a variety of dominant wavelengths within a given general color categorization.

The term spectrum should be understood to refer to any one or more frequencies or wavelengths of radiation produced by one or more light sources. Accordingly the term spectrum refers to frequencies or wavelengths not only in the visible range but also frequencies or wavelengths in the infrared ultraviolet and other areas of the overall electromagnetic spectrum. Also a given spectrum may have a relatively narrow bandwidth e.g. a FWHM having essentially few frequency or wavelength components or a relatively wide bandwidth several frequency or wavelength components having various relative strengths . It should also be appreciated that a given spectrum may be the result of a mixing of two or more other spectra e.g. mixing radiation respectively emitted from multiple light sources . For purposes of this disclosure the term color is used interchangeably with the term spectrum. However the term color generally is used to refer primarily to a property of radiation that is perceivable by an observer although this usage is not intended to limit the scope of this term . Accordingly the terms different colors implicitly refer to multiple spectra having different wavelength components and or bandwidths. It also should be appreciated that the term color may be used in connection with both white and non white light.

The term color temperature generally is used herein in connection with white light although this usage is not intended to limit the scope of this term. Color temperature essentially refers to a particular color content or shade e.g. reddish bluish of white light. The color temperature of a given radiation sample conventionally is characterized according to the temperature in degrees Kelvin K of a black body radiator that radiates essentially the same spectrum as the radiation sample in question. Black body radiator color temperatures generally fall within a range of from approximately 700 degrees K typically considered the first visible to the human eye to over 10 000 degrees K white light generally is perceived at color temperatures above 1500 2000 degrees K.

Lower color temperatures generally indicate white light having a more significant red component or a warmer feel while higher color temperatures generally indicate white light having a more significant blue component or a cooler feel. By way of example fire has a color temperature of approximately 1 800 degrees K a conventional incandescent bulb has a color temperature of approximately 2848 degrees K early morning daylight has a color temperature of approximately 3 000 degrees K and overcast midday skies have a color temperature of approximately 10 000 degrees K. A color image viewed under white light having a color temperature of approximately 3 000 degree K has a relatively reddish tone whereas the same color image viewed under white light having a color temperature of approximately 10 000 degrees K has a relatively bluish tone.

The term controller is used herein generally to describe various apparatus relating to the operation of one or more light sources. A controller can be implemented in numerous ways e.g. such as with dedicated hardware to perform various functions discussed herein. A processor is one example of a controller which employs one or more microprocessors that may be programmed using software e.g. microcode to perform various functions discussed herein. A controller may be implemented with or without employing a processor and also may be implemented as a combination of dedicated hardware to perform some functions and a processor e.g. one or more programmed microprocessors and associated circuitry to perform other functions. Examples of controller components that may be employed in various embodiments of the present disclosure include but are not limited to conventional microprocessors application specific integrated circuits ASICs and field programmable gate arrays FPGAs .

In various implementations a processor or controller may be associated with one or more storage media generically referred to herein as memory e.g. volatile and non volatile computer memory such as RAM PROM EPROM and EEPROM floppy disks compact disks optical disks magnetic tape etc. . In some implementations the storage media may be encoded with one or more programs that when executed on one or more processors and or controllers perform at least some of the functions discussed herein. Various storage media may be fixed within a processor or controller or may be transportable such that the one or more programs stored thereon can be loaded into a processor or controller so as to implement various aspects of the present disclosure discussed herein. The terms program or computer program are used herein in a generic sense to refer to any type of computer code e.g. software or microcode that can be employed to program one or more processors or controllers.

It should be appreciated that all combinations of the foregoing concepts and additional concepts discussed in greater detail below provided such concepts are not mutually exclusive are contemplated as being part of the inventive subject matter disclosed herein. It should also be appreciated that terminology explicitly employed herein that also may appear in any disclosure incorporated by reference should be accorded a meaning most consistent with the particular concepts disclosed herein.

Various implementations of the present invention and related inventive concepts are described below include certain implementations relating to PAR38 luminaires. It should be appreciated however that the present invention is not limited to any particular manner of implementation and that the various embodiments discussed explicitly herein are primarily for purposes of illustration. For example the various concepts discussed herein may be suitably implemented in a variety of luminaires having different form factors and light output.

As mentioned above some aspects of the invention disclosed herein relate to high output lighting systems suitable for replacement of conventional light sources. These systems integrate efficient and compact power supply and control components for driving high intensity LEDs together with thermal management and optical systems into a luminaire providing for a form and function fit equivalent to common general purpose incandescent fluorescent and halogen luminaires. Applicants have recognized and appreciated that no component or subsystem of a high performance LED based luminaire can be designed in isolation and that system performance is a result of interrelated technical issues. Thus impact of design choices in one area of the system may have undesirable consequences in other areas. For example attempting to generate more output from a LED source may come at the cost of greater power density exacerbating thermal loading and in turn overall system efficiency. Manipulating die and package constraints may have downstream effects that need to be addressed through careful consideration of optics. Accordingly the approach disclosed in detail below seeks to optimize LED source efficiency and geometry with a variety of system design concerns including efficient thermal management and power management.

The heat sink is formed from a heat conducting material for example aluminum and is configured to facilitate heat dissipation while remaining relatively lightweight. For example in one implementation the heat sink has a cage like design and includes a plurality of heat dissipating fins spread apart providing substantial surface area for heat dissipation. The heat sink may be treated to facilitate heat dissipation for example by sand blasting.

Cover lens can be made from any known transparent materials such as glass acrylic or polycarbonate. Cover lens is seated on landings of heat sink and then affixed with any convenient fasteners or connector s such as screws. In one implementation as illustrated in LED based luminaire has a form factor of a PAR38 lamp so that its widest diameter measures 4.75 inches. Other form factors are also possible.

Referring now to an exploded view and cross sectional view respectively of luminaire reveal the features housed within base enclosure and heat sink . In various implementations of the present invention base enclosure houses a power supply and electronics control module also referred to herein simply as power supply including one or more printed circuit boards having power management and driver circuitry components disposed thereon e.g. power supply controller processor and or memory components etc. for driving and controlling the light emitting diodes LEDs provided in an LED module described in greater detail below.

Power supply may have various configurations in order to optimize its performance while taking into account space limitations of the base enclosure. For example in one implementation like that shown in the power supply includes multiple printed circuit boards stacked one on top of the other and secured with the base enclosure at desired intervals. The circuit boards are electrically connected by wires running between them. In other implementations of the present invention a continuous e.g. flexible circuit board is fitted into the space provided within the base enclosure for example by rolling or winding. In still another implementation a single circuit board is affixed perpendicularly to the heat as described with respect to below. Other configurations are also possible.

Some general examples of LED based lighting units and methods for their control suitable for use in conjunction with luminaires according to the present disclosure can be found for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 016 038 and 6 211 626. Also some general examples of digital power processing and integrating power and data management within an LED fixture suitable for use in conjunction with luminaires according to the present disclosure can be found for example in U.S. Pat. No. 7 233 115 U.S. Pat. No. 7 256 554 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 113 320 each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Some specific examples of power supplies and control electronics according to embodiments of the present invention are discussed in detail below in connection with .

The electrical connections between power supply and LED module may be provided in any suitable manner such as via holes in the base of heat sink . Other forms of interconnection are also possible.

In various implementations of the present invention and as illustrated in a thermal connector is disposed between LED module and heat sink to provide thermal conductivity therebetween to facilitate heat dissipation. The thermal connector is made from a thermally conductive material such as copper and is attached to the back of the LED module by inductive soldering or any other suitable method. This configuration minimizes the number of thermal interfaces between the LED module and the heat sink and in turn reduces the thermal resistance seen by the LED module. The thermal connector may take the form of a plug or slug as shown in that is inserted into a cavity or recess in the heat sink or may take any other suitable form. For example according to one embodiment the thermal connector may be formed as a thin layer on the heat sink or as one or more metallic traces such as copper formed on a portion of a surface of the heat sink . The LED module may then be soldered to the metallic trace s for example using inductive soldering.

The LED module may take any suitable form as the various aspects of the invention are not limited to use with any particular type of LED light source. illustrate examples of features which the LED module may include. However it should be appreciated that these features are only optional and that other forms of the LED module are possible.

As shown in according to one embodiment LED module includes a substrate e.g. a printed circuit board upon which are disposed multiple LED die and . The properties of the individual LED die are selected to provide the particular type of light output desired for LED based luminaire . For example in various embodiments a first type of LED die may include one or more LED junctions for generating first radiation having a first spectrum and a second type of LED die may include one or more LED junctions for generating second radiation having a second spectrum different from the first spectrum. While a general example of two different types of LEDs is given for the luminaire it should be appreciated that a variety of different types of LEDs may be employed together in various numbers combinations to provide resulting light based on a mixture of respective different source spectrums.

In one exemplary implementation of the present invention the light emitting properties of the LED die are respectively selected to provide white light of a desired color temperature. For example one implementation of an LED module configured to generate essentially white light may include a number of dies which respectively emit different spectra of electroluminescence that in combination mix to form essentially white light. In another implementation a white light LED may be associated with a phosphor material that converts electroluminescence having a first spectrum to a different second spectrum. In one example of this implementation electroluminescence having a relatively short wavelength and narrow bandwidth spectrum pumps the phosphor material which in turn radiates longer wavelength radiation having a somewhat broader spectrum.

Referring to the layout of the LED die or package in LED module is selected to provide the type of combined light desired for LED based luminaire . In certain implementations LED based luminaire emits a white light of a predetermined color temperature or range of color temperatures. In various implementations the layout includes a combination of direct emission LEDs e.g. essentially monochromatic or narrow bandwidth radiation and phosphor conversion LEDs e.g. relatively broader band radiation . For example in one implementation a plurality of first LEDs emitting first radiation is combined with a plurality of second LEDs emitting second radiation . The first LEDs may be direct emission LED die while the second LEDs may be phosphor conversion LED die.

In one implementation the layout shown in is used to produce white light. The first LEDs are direct emission LED die and the second LEDs are phosphor conversion LED die. The resulting correlated color temperature CCT of white light depends on the amount of phosphor material that is applied to the blue emission LEDs i.e. second LEDs in this non limiting example as well as the amount of light coming from the red direct emission LEDs i.e. first LEDs in this non limiting example . To achieve the desired color point both parameters are controlled together for example by varying the amount of red emission from the source module by biasing the phosphor conversion and direct conversion LEDs independently.

In one implementation for providing white light having a correlated color temperature CCT of about 2800 Kelvin a mixture of twenty second LEDs each of which is a phosphor conversion LED die in this example and six first LEDs each of which is a direct emission LED die in this example are provided however other numbers and combinations of die are possible. The second LEDs include blue LEDs coupled with a suitable phosphor material for generating white light available from Cree Inc. of Durham N.C. The first LEDs include red LEDs also available from Cree Inc. of Durham N.C. In certain implementations of the current invention the ratio of direct emission LED die e.g. first LEDs to phosphor conversion LED die e.g. second LEDs is selected to provide a high color rendering index CRI within a range of about 85 90 or higher and a CCT of about 2800 Kelvin. In the implementation of this ratio is 3 10 with 6 direct emission LEDs and 20 phosphor conversion LEDs.

In general the number of LEDs in the LED module is selected to provide favorable driver efficiencies and luminous efficacy. In various implementations a larger number of smaller LED chips are used. The size of the LED chips is optimized within the form factor constraints of the luminaire particularly in view of the diameter of the rear opening of the reflector to provide favorable light output thermal properties and current density balanced against packaging costs substrate and optics costs die bonding costs yield losses etc. In some implementations standard commercially available LED chips having a diameter of 700 micron are used. In other implementations this invention contemplates using customized LED chips to further lower costs of the LED module while maintaining desired levels of overall performance. In particular multiple benefits are achieved by increasing the number or density of LEDs such as optical electrical thermal packaging cost and energy efficiency benefits. First a denser constellation of die produces a more uniform light output thereby improving color mixing glare issues and luminance. Second a larger number of LEDs when connected in series permits the use of lower electrical currents which can be provided by lower cost drivers. Third the power density of a larger number of smaller chips is lower and overall thermal qualities improve. As the power requirement is reduced by using smaller die package the packaging costs also drop. Finally the combined electrical thermal and optical benefits yield greater efficiencies of the overall integrated system.

In general the layout of the various die types is selected to provide good color mixing and improved uniformity of the color and or color temperature so as to achieve a uniform visual appearance of the light output of luminaire . In the implementation of the first LEDs e.g. direct emission LED die are disposed somewhat toward the edges of LED module but in a randomly distributed fashion. This configuration provides a very uniform color distribution at locations both near and far from luminaire .

In various implementations the electrical currents through the individually controlled die types are selected to in part achieve the desired luminous flux and efficacy of LED based luminaire . For example in order to achieve a white light output from luminaire having a CCT of about 2800 Kelvin and a luminous flux of about 600 lumens the current through second LEDs which are connected in series is about 0.142 amps and the current through first LEDs also connected in series is about 0.125 amps. The output and efficiency of this PAR38 implementation is about triple the output and twice the efficiency of some existing PAR38 lamps representing a significant improvement over conventional approaches.

As shown in in various implementations LED module further includes a primary optic. The primary optic in is a lens mounted on the substrate which may support one or more LED die. The lens may be a silicone lens that covers the LED die. According to some embodiments the primary optic of an LED module may include texturing to facilitate mixing of light produced by the LED module .

For example referring to the lens may include texturing on an inner surface in the form of bumps . There may be any suitable number of bumps and the bumps may have any suitable shape and size. In addition the bumps may take any suitable spacing relative to each other and may be formed over substantially the entire inner surface of lens or over only a portion of the inner surface of lens .

Alternatively as shown in an LED module may include a lens having texturing on an outer surface as shown by the bumps . Similar to the bumps described in connection with the bumps may take any suitable shape size and spacing and any number of bumps may be included. In addition it should be appreciated that the bumps shown in and the bumps shown in may only cover a portion of the lens and not necessarily the entire lens . Furthermore it should be appreciated that the bumps and may be used in combination such that the lens may include texturing on both an inner and outer surface. Moreover it should be appreciated that bumps and are one non limiting example of texturing of a primary optic and that other forms of texturing such as indentations ridges channels gratings or any other suitable type of texturing may be employed. Furthermore it should be appreciated that lens may not include any texturing at all in some embodiments.

Furthermore the lens may take different shapes. For example according to one embodiment the lens is substantially hemispherical. However in various implementations the lens is molded to have a shape that is not perfectly hemispherical. Rather the center of the hemisphere is raised by some distance. illustrates an example. As shown the lens A is not perfectly hemispherical but rather includes a hemispherical portion raised an amount Habove the substrate . Thus the center of the hemisphere shown as P is raised above the substrate by the amount H and may be substantially co planar with an upper surface of the first LEDs and or the second LEDs . Thus the profile of the dome inhibits light from being redirected toward the die and lost and permits the secondary optics such as the cover lens to capture more of the light emitted from the primary optic. In various implementations the area covered by the primary optic extends beyond the area of the LED die to an extent that reduces or eliminates light losses due to high angles associated with the walls of the primary optic. In one implementation the diameter of the array of LED die of LED module is about 7 mm and the diameter of the primary optic e.g. lens is about 11 mm.

As illustrated in LED based luminaire also includes a reflector optic which is housed within heat sink for shaping the beam of light emitted by LED module . In various implementations reflector optic is made from a plastic material that is coated with a reflective material such as aluminum. LED module is positioned so that light emitted by the primary optic e.g. lens transmits through a rear opening i.e. an exit aperture of the reflector optic . Cover lens is positioned above reflector optic for providing a beam of uniform light. In various implementations an additional holographic diffuser not shown for example a 5 diffuser can be added to the secondary optic to further homogenize the light output. However it should be appreciated that in some implementations no diffuser may be included over the exit aperture formed by the reflector optic. Preferably the angular distribution of the lighting output of the respective different spectrum LED sources e.g. the blue and red LED channels in one exemplary implementation is close to identical. In one implementation using a 90 reflective surface of reflector optic the optical system efficiency is about 83 with the beam angle of about 25 degrees FWHM.

The reflector optic may take any suitable shape. As shown in the reflector optic may include an outer surface which is a faceted surface. However it should be appreciated that the outer surface may be continuous in some embodiments as the various aspects of the invention are not limited in this respect. Because the LED module is disposed inside the reflector optic the shape of the outer surface may not impact the functionality of the reflector optic.

The reflector optic also includes an inner surface which is shown in further detail in which illustrates the reflector optic along the line A A in . As shown in the inner surface of the reflector optic may include texturing. For example the inner surface may include one or more bumps which may take any suitable size and shape. Such texturing may facilitate mixing of light produced by an LED light source such as LED module . Thus it should be appreciated that the texturing illustrated in is optional and that in those situations in which texturing is included on the inner surface of reflector optic the texturing may take any suitable form and patterning. For example the inner surface of reflector optic may include texturing in the form of divots ridges facets gratings raised surfaces in geometric patterns or any other suitable type of texturing.

It should be appreciated that the features illustrated in may be used alone or in combination. For example according to some embodiments a luminaire may include an LED module with texturing and a reflector optic with texturing. According to other embodiments only one or the other may be textured. According to some embodiments neither the LED module nor the reflector optic is textured.

Various operating characteristics of the luminaire are now described. For example according to one aspect a luminaire implementing one or more aspects described herein may operate at a color temperature of approximately 2700 2800 K. The lighting system may further demonstrate a CRI greater than or equal to 90 or in some embodiments within the range from 85 to 90. Moreover the lighting system may output 70 lumens per watt and provide 700 lumens at 10 watts. Furthermore the beam angle provided by luminaire or other lighting systems as described herein may be sufficient to provide effective indoor or outdoor illumination. illustrates an example.

Referring to as described above spot lighting is one particularly useful application for the LED based luminaire having the PAR38 form factor. As shown in the spatial distribution of a light beam is such that a beam angle of about 25 degrees is achieved. Furthermore in this particular implementation the light output of luminaire is uniform enough and for a given ceiling height and lighting angle the spot size is appropriately dimensioned to provide excellent lighting of merchandise and other commonly displayed items.

In summary luminaire is a highly efficient durable environmentally friendly LED based lamp which is compatible with standard lighting hardware provides uniform light distribution and has excellent heat dissipation and color rendering properties. For example an output of about 600 lumens at about 55 lumens per watt at steady state has been achieved with one implementation of the current invention and an output of 700 lumens at about 70 lumens per watt has been achieved in another implementation thereby providing substantial improvements over conventional sources.

While have illustrated non limiting examples of one or more features of one exemplary luminaire it should be appreciated that other configurations and form factors are possible. For example according to one aspect a luminaire may include a shroud or housing within which one or more components of the luminaire may be disposed. The shroud may be formed of plastic or any other suitable electrically non conducting material such as polycarbonate or ABS. According to some embodiments the shroud may be formed of glass which may provide heat dissipation. The shroud may inhibit external access to electrically active components of the luminaire therefore reducing the risk of shock or fire. According to some aspects the shroud encompasses substantially all the components of the luminaire and may include one or more holes to facilitate heat dissipation.

Electrical connection between the power supply and control electronics and the LED module may be provided in any suitable manner. According to the non limiting implementation of a ring shaped circuit board is provided which is disposed around the LED module and electrically connected to the power supply by one or more wires or metal traces as shown in greater detail in . Other manners of providing electrical connection to the LED module are also possible.

The luminaire A also includes reflector optic . The reflector optic may be mounted to the heat sink such that the LED module is disposed within the reflector optic so that light emitted from the LED module is reflected collimated and or focused by the reflector optic . Finally a cover lens A may be included and may be secured to the shroud by any suitable manner such as for example clipping into the shroud being fastened by screws being secured by glue or being fastened in any other suitable manner.

As shown in which is a top down view of the cover lens A the cover lens may have a central portion which may be substantially transparent to light emitted by the LED module or which may be a diffuser in some embodiments. The central portion may substantially correspond in size to the reflector optic . In addition the cover lens A may include an outer portion . The reflector optic may confine light exiting the LED module to exiting through the central portion of the cover lens A. Therefore light from the LED module does not pass through the outer portion of the cover lens A. However the outer portion of the cover lens A may include one or more holes to facilitate dissipation of heat from the luminaire. The holes may take any suitable number shape and patterning. For example according to some embodiments each of the holes is equal to or less than approximately 2 mm in diameter.

Various features of the luminaire A are now illustrated and described in greater detail. For example illustrates the relative positioning of the LED module and the heat sink . As shown in this top down view the heat sink includes a plurality of fins which facilitate heat dissipation. The LED module is disposed in the center of the heat sink and may be mounted on the thermal connector which is not visible in . Solder pads may be included to facilitate soldering of the LED module to the ring shaped circuit board and or to the thermal connector .

As shown in which is a top down view of the ring shaped circuit board may be positioned around the LED module . The ring shaped circuit board may include holes and which may accommodate electrical wires from the power supply and control electronics shown in providing electrical interconnection between the LED module and the power supply and control electronics . It should be appreciated that any number of holes and relative positioning of holes may be used and that the ring shaped circuit board may include one or more metal traces as appropriate for providing proper electrical functionality.

It should be appreciated that the configuration illustrated in is one non limiting example. Thus other forms of circuits and LED modules may be used. For example as shown in an alternative implementation to using a ring shaped circuit board may involve positioning a circuit and electrical connections on one side of the LED module. As shown an LED module may be connected to a flexible circuit having one or more electrical contact points . The electrical contact points are arranged on a single side of the LED module which may simplify formation of electrical interconnections between the LED module and a power supply. The LED module may be connected to the flexible circuit by die bonding or by any other suitable manner.

According to one embodiment a temperature sensor is provided in the luminaire A to enable measurement of the operating temperature of the luminaire and to facilitate control of the luminaire. The temperature sensor is shown in and may be mounted within an opening or recess in the heat sink may be mounted proximate to the heat sink may be disposed within a recess of the thermal connector may be within the LED module or may be mounted in any other suitable position to enable determination of the temperature of the luminaire A. The temperature sensor may be connected to the power supply and control electronics to provide electrical connection to the temperature sensor.

As shown in the temperature sensor may be mounted on the circuit board for the power supply and control electronics and then may be inserted into a recess in the heatsink . The temperature sensor may be secured within the recess of the heatsink by epoxy or any other suitable method. Thus according to one embodiment a printed circuit board holding power and control electronics includes a tab which is inserted into a recess of the heatsink . The temperature sensor may be disposed on the tab of the circuit board inserted into the heatsink. It should be appreciated however that other configurations are possible. For example the temperature sensor need not be on the same printed circuit board as that holding the power supply and control electronics but rather may be distinct. In addition it should be appreciated that the temperature sensor may be any suitable type of temperature sensor such as a thermister or any other type of temperature sensor.

As shown in the luminaire including multiple LED light sources includes a power supply and control electronics that receives an A.C. input voltage and provides an operating voltage for the LED light sources. In two different types of LED light sources are shown constituting multiple series connected loads namely one or more first LEDs for generating first radiation having a first spectrum and one or more second LEDs for generating second radiation having a second spectrum different from the first spectrum for simplicity in the one or more first LEDs are shown in a block labeled L1 and the one or more second LEDs are shown in a block labeled L2 .

In one non limiting exemplary implementation the first LED s may include one or more red LEDs for generating a first spectrum of radiation including essentially monochromatic red light and the second LED s may include one or more white LEDs e.g. a blue LED irradiating a phosphor for generating a second spectrum of radiation including relatively broadband white light. Light generated by the luminaire results from a mixture of the first radiation and the second radiation when both are present. In one specific example a relatively smaller number of red LEDs e.g. six are employed with a relatively larger number of white LEDs e.g. twenty in the luminaire to provide a particular correlated color temperature of white light e.g. approximately 2800 to 3000 Kelvin and a relatively high color rendering index e.g. CRI of approximately 85 90 .

In the first LED s and the second LED s are electrically connected in series between a first node A and a second node B. When the power supply provides the operating voltage a series current IL flows between the first node and the second node.

As shown in the block diagram of the power supply may be a multi stage switching power supply for providing both power factor correction and the operating voltage . More specifically the power supply may include a power factor correction stage for receiving the A.C. input voltage via a bridge rectifier and providing the power factor correction and the operating voltage . Due to the high power factor correction provided by the power factor correction stage the luminaire apparatus appears as an essentially resistive element to the applied input voltage .

The power supply may also include a load control stage to control a flow of the series current between the nodes A and B. In particular as illustrated in the load control stage includes a controllable current path including switch coupled to a node between the first LED s and the second LED s and connected in parallel with the second LED s so as to at least partially divert the series current around the second LED s . In one aspect the current path may be controlled such that a first current I through the first LED s and a second current I through the second LED s are different. Such control of the respective currents Iand Ithrough the first LED s and the second LED s facilitates setting and adjusting a color or color temperature of the light generated by the luminaire. In one aspect of an exemplary implementation discussed in detail below a portion of the second current that is diverted from the second LED s may be recycled and added to the first current.

While specifically illustrates the controllable current path of the load control stage in parallel with the second LED s it should be nonetheless appreciated that one or more controllable current paths may be employed in the load control stage parallel to either or both of the first LED s and the second LED s for diverting at least a portion of the series current around either or both of the first LED s and the second LED s . As also shown in the load control stage may receive from the power factor correction stage a voltage different than the operating voltage for facilitating control of the switch in the controllable current path as well as other components in the load control stage as discussed further below.

In another aspect of the embodiment shown in the apparatus luminaire may further include one or more temperature sensors TS disposed proximate to and in thermal communication with the first LED s and the second LED s . Additionally the power supply may include a controller associated with at least the load control stage for receiving a temperature signal provided by the temperature sensor s . As also shown in the controller may receive one or more external signals instead of or in addition to the temperature signal . In one aspect the controller provides a control signal to the load control stage for controlling the controllable current path i.e. controlling the switch based at least in part on the temperature signal and or the external signal . In this manner control over one or both of the first current through the first LED s and the second current through the second LED s may be a function of temperature changes over time in the vicinity of the LED sources via the temperature signal and or any number of external parameters via the external signal . As discussed in greater detail below in connection with the ability to vary one or both of the first and second currents as a function of LED temperature significantly mitigates undesirable variations in color or color temperature of light provided by the luminaire during thermal transients e.g. as the LEDs warm up over some period of time to a thermal steady state following power on of the luminaire .

In yet another aspect of the embodiment shown in the power supply may include a second controller coupled to the power factor correction stage . The controller provides a control signal to the power factor correction stage so as to control the operating voltage and or a power provided by the power factor correction stage based on any of a variety of parameters. To this end the controller may receive as inputs a first signal representing at least one voltage or current associated with the power factor correction stage a second signal representing a frequency of the A.C. input voltage or an external signal . In particular internal timing of the controller may be line driven via the second signal allowing accurate timing features through the use of a 50 Hz or 60 Hz A.C. line voltage reference .

It should be appreciated that while both a controller associated with the power factor correction stage and a controller associated with the load control stage are shown in the power supply of one or both of the controllers and constitute optional features that need not be present in various implementations of the apparatus luminaire according to the present disclosure. Additionally in some inventive embodiments a single controller may be employed to provide one or more control signals to both the power factor correction stage and the load control stage so as to implement the various functionalities discussed herein in connection with these respective stages.

More specifically the power factor correction stage employs a power factor correction controller exemplified by the ST Microelectronics L6562 controller. In some conventional applications the L6562 controller and the related ST Microelectronics L6561 controller utilize a transition mode TM technique i.e. operating around a boundary between continuous and discontinuous modes commonly employed for power factor correction in relatively low power applications. Details of the L6561 controller and the transition mode technique are discussed in ST Microelectronics Application Note AN966 L6561 Enhanced Transition Mode Power Factor Corrector by Claudio Adragna March 2003 available at http www.st.com and incorporated herein by reference. Differences between the L6561 and L6562 controllers are discussed in ST Microelectronics Application Note AN1757 Switching from the L6561 to the L6562 by Luca Salati April 2004 also available at http www.st.com and incorporated herein by reference. For purposes of the present disclosure these two controllers generally are discussed as having similar functionality.

In addition to facilitating power factor correction the ST Microelectronics L6561 and L6562 controllers may be alternatively employed in a non standard configuration as a controller in a flyback DC DC converter implementation. Details of this and related alternative applications of the L6561 L6562 controllers are discussed in ST Microelectronics Application Note AN1060 Flyback Converters with the L6561 PFC Controller by C. Adragna and G. Garravarik January 2003 ST Microelectronics Application Note AN1059 Design Equations of High Power Factor Flyback Converters based on the L6561 by Claudio Adragna September 2003 and ST Microelectronics Application Note AN1007 L6561 based Switcher Replaces Mag Amps in Silver Boxes by Claudio Adragna October 2003 each of which is available at http www.st.com and incorporated herein by reference.

Specifically Application Notes AN1059 and AN1060 discuss one exemplary configuration for an L6561 based flyback converter High PF flyback configuration that operates in transition mode and exploits the aptitude of the L6561 controller for performing power factor correction thereby providing a high power factor single switching stage DC DC converter for relatively low load power requirements e.g. up to approximately 30 Watts . The flyback converter configuration requires a voltage regulation feedback control loop which receives as an input a sample of the DC output voltage provided by the converter and provides as feedback an error signal which is applied to the INV input of the L6561 controller.

ST Microelectronics Application Note AN1792 entitled Design of Fixed Off Time Controlled PFC Pre regulators with the L6562 by Claudio Andragna November 2003 available at http www.st.com and incorporated herein by reference discloses another approach for controlling a power factor corrector pre regulator as an alternative to the transition mode method and the fixed frequency continuous conduction mode method. Specifically a fixed off time FOT control method may be employed with the L6562 controller for example in which only the on time of a pulse width modulated signal is modulated and the off time is kept constant leading to a modulation in switching frequency . Like the transition mode approach the fixed off time FOT control method conventionally contemplated using the L6562 controller similarly requires a voltage regulation feedback control loop.

As can be seen from unlike the conventional applications for the L6561 and L6562 controller discussed above the power factor correction stage does not require any feedback control loop to regulate the operating voltage thereby simplifying the circuit design as compared to conventional implementations. In particular Applicants have recognized and appreciated that for implementations involving essentially fixed stable load power requirements a voltage regulation feedback control loop is not necessary to achieve effective operation. Specifically loads involving light emitting diodes LEDs themselves are essentially voltage regulation devices in that a single LED or multiple LEDs interconnected in various series parallel or series parallel configurations dictates a particular voltage across the load. Hence the power factor correction stage may be reliably configured to provide an appropriately stable operating voltage and power to the LED load without requiring a feedback control loop.

In the circuit diagram of the power factor correction stage is based on a buck type DC DC converter configuration in which the power factor correction controller controls a switch implemented by transistor Q which in turn dictates an energy storage and release cycle for an inductor provided by one of the windings of transformer T . More specifically during the intervals in which the transistor switch is on or closed i.e. applying a voltage across the transformer winding serving as the inductor current flows through the inductor based on the applied voltage and the inductor stores energy in its magnetic field. When the switch is turned off or opened i.e. voltage is removed from the inductor the energy stored in the inductor is transferred via diode D to a filter capacitor C across which is provided the operating voltage i.e. the capacitor provides essentially continuous energy between inductor energy storage cycles .

The power factor correction stage may be configured for a variety of different input voltages operating voltages and load series current I based on an appropriate selection of various circuit components. In particular the resistor divider network formed by R and R substantially determines the series current through the load given that the type and number of series connected LEDs constituting the load essentially determines the target operating voltage. In the particular circuit example shown in the circuit is configured to accept an input voltage of 120 Volts RMS and provide an operating voltage on the order of 80 Volts with a series current on the order of 150 milliamperes. In one aspect of the circuit shown in the power factor correction controller is configured to employ the fixed off time FOT control technique to control the switch Q . The FOT control technique permits the use of a relatively smaller transformer T for the buck configuration. This allows the transformer to be operated at a more constant frequency which in turn delivers higher power to the load for a given core size.

In some exemplary implementations the A.C. input voltage may be derived from an output of an A.C. dimmer which in turn receives as an input an A.C. line voltage . In various aspects the voltage provided by the A.C. dimmer may be a voltage amplitude controlled or duty cycle phase controlled A.C. voltage for example. In one exemplary implementation by varying an RMS value of the A.C. voltage applied to the power supply via the A.C. dimmer the operating voltage and in turn the series current may be similarly varied thus the A.C. dimmer may be employed to vary an overall brightness of light generated by the luminaire.

With respect to parameters in response to which the controller may vary the control signal as shown in the controller may receive one or more inputs representing at least one voltage or current associated with the power factor correction stage e.g. pin of the IC U is coupled to receive the signal controlling the switch Q and pins and of U are coupled to a voltage associated with the resistor divider network . In this manner the controller may serve a feedback control function and provide the control signal in response to any one of a number of monitored circuit parameters associated with the power factor correction stage .

The controller also may receive a signal representing a frequency of the A.C. input voltage applied to pin of IC U via the resistor divider network formed by R R and R . In particular internal timing of the controller may be line driven via the signal allowing accurate timing features through the use of a 50 Hz or 60 Hz A.C. line voltage reference. In one exemplary application the controller may maintain a cycle count e.g. monitor zero crossings of the A.C. input voltage via the signal as a metric for time in operation of the LED light sources constituting the load. In turn the controller may adjust operating parameters of the power factor correction stage via the control signal based on the time of operation to compensate for aging effects associated with LEDs e.g. increasing the operating voltage and or the series current to compensate for lower efficiency reduced flux of aging LEDs . Alternatively or in addition to adjusting operating parameters of the power factor correction stage to compensate for aging effects the controller may use the information associated with time in operation of the LED light sources to provide some indication of lamp life remaining. For example the controller may provide a control signal that modulates the power provided to the LED load to visibly affect the generated light e.g. intentionally blink or modulate light brightness so as to provide information relating to some condition e.g. lamp age via the intentionally modulated light.

Additionally the controller may receive one or more external signals e.g. applied to pin of IC U in the example of so that control of the power factor correction stage may be based on any of a wide variety of external conditions e.g. temperature conditions ambient lighting conditions other environmental conditions overvoltage or load failure conditions emergency conditions motion etc. . In response to one or more such external signals the controller may provide a control signal that adjusts one or more operating parameters of the power factor correction stage and or may modulate the power provided to the LED load so as to provide information relating to some condition represented by the external signal s via the intentionally modulated light.

As discussed above in connection with in the first LED s and the second LED s are connected in series between the nodes A and B across which the operating voltage is provided. The controllable current path is coupled to the node between the series connected first LED s and second LED s . While only a single LED is shown for purposes of illustration in for each of the series connected LED loads as discussed above it should be appreciated that each of the LED loads and may include multiple LED light sources connected in any of a variety of series parallel or series parallel arrangements and may have different numbers of a given type of LED. In one exemplary implementation discussed herein the first LED s may include on the order of six series connected red LEDs and the second LED s may include on the order of 20 series connected white LEDs. Given a forward operating voltage for a red LED on the order of 3.3 Volts and a forward operating voltage for a white LED on the order of 3 Volts an appropriate operating voltage applied across the nodes A and B in this example would be on the order of 80 Volts i.e. 3.3 Volts 6 3 Volts 20 .

Via control of the switch and in turn the current path the load control stage of controls a flow of the series current between the nodes A and B. In particular via operation of the switch the series current may be at least partially diverted around the second LED s such that the first current I through the first LED s and the second current I through the second LED s are different specifically when the switch is on or conducting the inductor L3 is connected to a ground potential via resistor R thereby providing an alternate current path between the nodes A and B and allowing at least some of the series current to be diverted around the second LED s . In the circuit of a duty cycle of the switch as controlled by the IC controller and hence the difference between the first current and the second current is set by the resistor divider network constituted by R and R. In the particular example illustrated in with R at 10 K Ohms and R at 20 K Ohms and based on an operating voltage of approximately 80 Volts and a series current of approximately 150 milliamperes the first current is on the order of 180 milliamperes and the second current is on the order of 120 milliamperes. The foregoing illustrates that the portion of the series current that is diverted from the second LED s is not lost but recycled in that it is diverted to the storage element inductor L3 and dumped on the next half of the cycle back into the first LED s with minimal losses e.g. 30 milliamperes is deducted from the second current and added to the first current .

The first current and the second current generally determine respective amounts luminous flux of the first radiation and the second radiation generated by the first LED s and the second LED s . Accordingly by appropriate selection of the values of resistors R and R in and based on the type and number of LEDs employed for each of the first LED s and the second LED s a color or color temperature of generated light based on a mixture of the first radiation and the second radiation may be set.

Notwithstanding the foregoing Applicants have recognized and appreciated that the current to flux relationship for different types of LEDs varies differently as a function of temperature. This phenomenon may be problematic for some applications involving multiple different types of LEDs in which thermal transients are expected. For example a system initially at some ambient temperature that is then powered up for operation warms up over some thermal transient period during which current begins and continues to flow through the LEDs. Based on an illustrative implementation involving both red LEDs and white LEDs for the respective series connected loads as the system continues to warm up to some thermal steady state the flux from the red LED s changes at a different rate than the flux from the white LED s as a function of temperature causing a noticeable shift in the color temperature of generated light during the thermal transient period more specifically at constant respective values for the first and second currents as the system warms up the flux from the red LED s decreases at a rate faster than the flux from the white LED s . By way of example over an approximately twenty minute thermal transient period following initial power up the color temperature of generated light may shift e.g. increase by as much as 100 Kelvin due to a decrease in the flux from the red LED s as compared to the white LED s . For some applications this effect is undesirable especially at lower nominal color temperatures at which the human eye is more sensitive to color shifts.

In view of the foregoing another embodiment of the present invention is directed to methods and apparatus for compensating color and or color temperature shifts arising from thermal transients in a lighting apparatus that includes multiple series connected LED light sources of different types.

To this end is a circuit diagram illustrating the load control stage of the power supply shown in together with an associated controller according to another embodiment of the present invention. In one aspect of this embodiment the controller controls the load control stage in response to a temperature signal received from a temperature sensor disposed proximate to and in thermal communication with the first LED s and the second LED s so as to provide the thermal compensation functionality noted above. It should be appreciated however that this thermal compensation functionality constitutes merely one example of how the controller may be implemented to control various aspects of the load control stage and that parameters or conditions other than the temperature proximate to the LED light sources may be input to and utilized by the controller to affect control of the load control stage e.g. refer to the discussion above in connection with the external signal shown in .

As shown in in one exemplary implementation the controller includes an integrated circuit microcontroller U that receives operating power from an integrated circuit voltage regulator U. With respect to compensation for thermal transients the microcontroller U also receives as an input the temperature signal output by the temperature sensor U and provides as an output a control signal that is applied to resistor network filter of the load control stage . In one exemplary implementation the temperature sensor may be a low power linear active thermistor integrated circuit examples of which include the MCP9700 9700A and MCP9701 9701A family of integrated circuits available from Microchip Technology Inc.

In one exemplary implementation the controller may provide the control signal to the load control stage in the form of a pulse width modulated PWM control signal the duty cycle of which affects the voltages established by the resistor network filter of the load control stage . Hence by varying the duty cycle of a PWM control signal the controller may in turn vary a difference between the first current through the first LED s and the second current through the second LED s and thereby alter the respective fluxes generated by the different LED types. By controlling the duty cycle of the PWM control signal in response to the temperature signal the controller may effectively provide compensation for shifts in color or color temperature of generated light during thermal transients e.g. due to different temperature dependent current to flux relationships for different types of LEDs .

With respect to the relationship in block that specifies duty cycle as a function of temperature for the PWM control signal this relationship may be empirically determined during a calibration procedure an example of which is discussed in detail below. Such a relationship may be modeled as a linear piece wise linear or nonlinear relationship depending at least in part on the degree of compensation desired for a given application. In one exemplary model the relationship is dictated by a linear equation in which various parameters of the equation are determined empirically given by Duty Cycle Ambient Temp Duty Cycle Temp Reading Ambient Temp Slope Eq. 1 

In Eq. 1 PWM Duty Cycle refers to the duty cycle of the control signal calculated in block of the Ambient Temp Duty Cycle is the duty cycle of the control signal at which the first and second currents provide a desired target color temperature for the generated light when the LEDs and are at ambient temperature the Temp Reading is the temperature represented by the temperature signal as acquired in block of the Ambient Temp is the ambient temperature e.g. prior to power on and the Slope is the change in duty cycle per change in temperature.

In one exemplary implementation all of the values represented in Eq. 1 are converted to a binary value between 0 and 255 so that they each may be processed by the microcontroller U of the controller as an 8 bit data word . With respect to the duty cycle values a binary value of 255 represents 100 i.e. a binary value of 128 represents an approximately 50 duty cycle . With respect to the Temp Reading and Ambient Temp parameters in one example temperature in degrees Celsius is converted according to floor Temperature C. 0.01 0.414 5 255 .

In an exemplary calibration procedure to facilitate determination of the various parameters of Eq. 1 one aspect of the procedure involves varying the duty cycle of the PWM control signal over some exemplary range and measuring the first current and the second current . Table 1 below provides and example of such measurements.

Another aspect of the calibration procedure involves measuring the color temperature of generated light as a function of various first and second currents applied to the respective first and second LEDs. This process involves a sequence of instant on photometric tests in which two separate known current sources are respectively connected to the first LED s and the second LEDs for a relatively short period of time and the color temperature of generated light is measured within a few seconds of the currents being applied. The currents are then immediately turned off long enough so that the LEDs are maintained at an ambient thermal steady state before applying another pair of currents. In one exemplary implementation in which red LED s are employed as the first LED s and white LED s are employed as the second LED s it may be assumed that the red flux varies more than the white flux and hence a nominal value may be chosen for the second current while the first current is varied. Table 2 below provides one example of such a measurement process.

Based on the measurement process exemplified in Table 2 a nominal target operating color temperature may be selected for the generated light. Based on this target color temperature the corresponding first and second currents required from Table 2 are matched to similar first and second currents in Table 1 to determine the Ambient Temp Duty Cycle for Eq. 1 . For example if the target color temperature is 3000 Kelvin from Table 2 this corresponds to a first current of 150 mA and a second current of 130 mA at ambient temperature which from Table 1 in turn corresponds to a duty cycle for the PWM control signal of 62.5 . Thus the Ambient Temp Duty Cycle in this example for Eq. 1 would have a binary value of 62.5 255 159.

A final aspect of the calibration procedure to facilitate determination of the various parameters in Eq. 1 involves a determination of the Slope term. Again the Slope term represents the change in duty cycle per change in temperature required to maintain a sufficiently stable color and or color temperature of generated light during a thermal transient such as a warm up period following power on. In one example a determination of an appropriate slope term may include choosing an initial seed value for the Slope term iterating the method over an estimated thermal transient period e.g. twenty to thirty minutes making periodic measurements e.g. every thirty seconds of the color temperature of generated light and plotting these color temperature measurements vs. time. This process may be repeated using a different value for the Slope term until an appropriate value is found that results in the flattest color temperature vs. time plot.

It should be appreciated that the general outline of the foregoing calibration procedure may be applied to other types of LED sources and or other color temperature ranges of interest to effectively implement the temperature compensation functionality of the controller shown in . In particular it should be appreciated that in some instances using exactly the same hardware two identical luminaires may be configured to provide significantly different colors and or color temperatures of white light merely by selecting a different value for the Ambient Temp Duty Cycle term in Eq. 1 above. Additionally the Ambient Temp Duty Cycle term in Eq. 1 may in some implementations be a predetermined function of time e.g. to compensate for gradual aging of the LEDs and flux depreciation over time . Furthermore as noted above the particular relationship employed in block of the method shown in may be modeled as a linear relationship as in Eq. 1 above or alternatively as a piece wise linear or nonlinear relationship depending at least in part on the degree of compensation desired for a given application .
