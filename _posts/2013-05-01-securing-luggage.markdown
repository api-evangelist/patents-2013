This application claims the benefit of U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 61 785 593 filed on Mar. 14 2013 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Some conventional briefcases include security devices that permit a user to lock and unlock the briefcases.

In general one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may include the action of receiving at a processing system housed within a piece of luggage a representation for a credential from a client device. The actions may also include transmitting a validation request to a server the validation request including data derived from the representation for the credential. Additionally the actions may include receiving a validation response from the server indicating that the credential is valid and in response to receiving the validation response outputting an unlock signal wherein the unlock signal causes an actuator to unlock a locking device coupled to the luggage. In some implementations the representation for the credential may be an optical machine readable representation a sound signal representing the credential an electromagnetic signal representing the credential a near field communications signal representing the credential or an alphanumeric code for the credential.

Other features may include corresponding systems apparatus and computer programs encoded on computer storage devices configured to perform the foregoing actions.

The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

In some instances representations of credentials for groups of users or individuals are generated. The credentials can be for example identity credentials driver s licenses passports visas police badges etc. health insurance cards loyalty cards badges reflecting membership in a group e.g. employees of a company graduates of a college gym club memberships etc. badges to gain entrance to a location or event a ticket for entry to a location or event a key that unlocks a lock e.g. on a briefcase etc. Some credentials may be used for more than one purpose.

In particular lockable luggage e.g. briefcases suitcases etc. may include a processing system that is configured to interface with client device based credentials. The processing system may therefore permit access to the luggage when valid credentials are presented at the luggage. For example when operated by a user a client device may present a representation of a credential to an input device at the luggage in order to unlock the luggage. Responsive to successful validation of the credential the luggage may be unlocked.

Credentials can be maintained on and or accessed from client devices e.g. mobile computing devices like smart phones and tablet computers and credentials can be represented in various forms. A server or collection of servers can manage and distribute credentials to appropriate users client devices. Users may then operate the client devices to present representations of the credentials which can be validated using suitable mechanisms.

Examples of different representations for credentials and mechanisms for validating the different representations will now be described with reference to a system for securing luggage. In certain implementations credentials can be represented by alphanumeric codes optical machine readable representations e.g. QR codes sound signals electromagnetic signals e.g. visible light infrared IR etc. and or near field communication NFC signals.

A first form of representation for a credential is an alphanumeric code. As referred to herein an alphanumeric code may be a sequence of numbers and or letters e.g. 4 to 24 characters that is associated with a credential and a user. In some instances a given alphanumeric code may be time varying e.g. will only be valid for a certain time period . To initialize an alphanumeric code a server associates a given alphanumeric code with a credential and distributes the alphanumeric code to the appropriate client device or devices.

To validate an alphanumeric code a user presents the alphanumeric code to a validating device e.g. a processing system housed within a piece of luggage . For example the user may enter the alphanumeric code using a keypad on a briefcase which then transmits the code to the validating device. The validating device may validate the alphanumeric code by transmitting a validation request message which includes the alphanumeric code to the server. When the server receives the validation request message it attempts to confirm that the presented representation of the credential is valid. For example the server may parse the alphanumeric code to obtain a credential identifier. The server can then access the corresponding credential using the credential identifier e.g. from a database by querying using the credential identifier . Upon retrieving the credential the server can determine whether the presented representation for the credential was valid by comparing data received in the validation request message e.g. the alphanumeric code with data associated with the retrieved credential.

Upon successful validation the server sends the validating device a validation response indicating that the representation for the credential was valid e.g. the presented alphanumeric code matches a valid alphanumeric code for the credential and the credential holder is authorized to unlock the luggage . In turn the validating device may then send a signal to unlock the luggage.

Another form of representation for a credential is an optical machine readable representation. As referred to herein an optical machine readable representation of a credential may be an arrangement of graphical elements that encode alphanumeric data representing the credential where the elements are arranged so that the data can be read by an optical scanner. For example an optical machine readable representation of a credential may be a bar code a quick response QR code or an Aztec code among other optical machine readable representations. In some instances a given optical machine readable representation of a credential only may be valid for a certain time period. In some implementations optical machine readable representations of credentials may encode data including or representing credential identifiers and any other suitable data. In other implementations optical machine readable representations of credentials may encode other identifiers that are linked to or otherwise associated with credential identifiers.

To generate an optical machine readable representation a client device may use any suitable technique for encoding alphanumeric data within the optical machine readable representation. For example the client device may call a function or library routine that encodes QR codes in accordance with the QR code International Organization for Standardization ISO standard ISO IEC 18004 2006 RSS Information technology Automatic identification and data capture techniques QR Code 2005 bar code symbology specification.

To initiate the validation process for an optical machine readable representation a client device may output an optical machine readable representation to a display of the client device. An optical scanner or camera arranged on a piece of luggage can scan the portion of the client device s display showing the representation of the credential and transmit the representation to a validating device e.g. a processing system within the luggage . The validating device can then decode the representation of the credential to generate a set of alphanumeric characters that were encoded in the representation of the credential.

The validating device may use any suitable mechanism to decode the optical machine readable representation of the credential. For example the validating device may access a function or library routine that captures and decodes QR codes and or barcodes using a camera operatively coupled to the validating device. Suitable libraries may include for example RedLaser or Zxing.

In some implementations the validating device may then validate the optical machine readable representation of the credential by transmitting a validation request message to a server. The validation request message may include data corresponding to the alphanumeric characters that were encoded in the optical machine readable representation of the credential. When the server receives the validation request message it attempts to confirm that the presented representation of the credential is valid. For example the server may parse and or decode the alphanumeric characters to obtain a credential identifier. The server can then access the corresponding credential using the credential identifier e.g. from a database by querying using the credential identifier . Upon retrieving the credential the server can determine whether the presented representation for the credential was valid by comparing data received in the validation request message e.g. the alphanumeric characters with data associated with the retrieved credential.

Upon successful validation the server sends the validating device a validation response indicating that the representation for the credential was valid e.g. the alphanumeric characters in the request match a valid sequence of alphanumeric characters for the credential and the credential holder is authorized to unlock the luggage . In turn the validating device may then send a signal to unlock the luggage.

Alternatively or in addition a validating device may validate a set of alphanumeric characters from an optical machine readable representation locally without requiring interaction with a server. For example the optical machine readable representation for the credential may include a digital signature generated using a digital signature algorithm that generates the digital signature based on data derived from the credential and a private key of the credential grantor. The validating device may then access a public key of the credential grantor to validate the digital signature using the digital signature algorithm.

Yet another form of representation for a credential is a sound signal. As described herein a sound signal is an oscillation of pressure waves transmitted through the air that are modulated to encode information. Any suitable modulation scheme could be used such as for example frequency shift keying FSK or phase shift keying PSK . In some implementations the sound signal may be in the ultrasonic frequency range e.g. greater than about 20 kHz. In some implementations the sound signal may be in the audible frequency range e.g. about 20 Hz to about 20 kHz.

A sound signal representing a credential may encode data including or representing a corresponding credential identifier and any other suitable data. In addition a sound signal representing a credential may encode another identifier that is linked to or otherwise associated with a corresponding credential identifier. In some implementations a given sound signal representing a credential may only be valid for a certain time period. For example part of the data encoded in the signal may correspond to a time stamp and the credential represented by the signal may be deemed invalid if a validating device attempts to decode the data more than a predetermined amount of time after the time stamp was generated.

To generate a sound signal a client device may use any suitable technique for encoding a representation of a credential. For example the client device may call a function or library routine that encodes data into sound signals such as the Zoosh software development kit SDK by Naratte Inc. The client device can then output the sound signal representation of the credential from a speaker coupled to the client device for reception by a validating device.

To initiate the validation process for a sound signal a client device outputs a sound signal representing a credential. A validating device e.g. a processing system within a piece of luggage may then receive the sound signal via a speaker coupled to the validating device and decode the sound signal to generate a set of alphanumeric characters that were encoded in the sound signal. The validating device may use any suitable mechanism to receive and decode the sound signal.

In some implementations the validating device may then validate the sound signal by transmitting a validation request message to a server. The validation request message may include data corresponding to the alphanumeric characters that were encoded in the sound signal. When the server receives the validation request message it attempts to confirm that the presented sound signal is valid. For example the server may parse and or decode the alphanumeric characters to obtain a credential identifier. The server can then access the corresponding credential using the credential identifier e.g. from a database by querying using the credential identifier . Upon retrieving the credential the server can determine whether the presented representation for the credential was valid by comparing data received in the validation request message e.g. the alphanumeric characters with data associated with the retrieved credential.

Upon successful validation the server sends the validating device a validation response indicating that the sound signal was valid e.g. the alphanumeric characters in the request match a valid sequence of alphanumeric characters for the credential and the credential holder is authorized to unlock the luggage . In turn the validating device may then send a signal to unlock the luggage.

Alternatively or in addition a validating device may validate a set of alphanumeric characters from a sound signal locally without requiring interaction with a server. For example the sound signal may include a digital signature generated using a digital signature algorithm that generates the digital signature based on data derived from the credential and a private key of the credential grantor. The validating device may then access a public key of the credential grantor to validate the digital signature using the digital signature algorithm.

An electromagnetic signal e.g. visible light IR etc. representing a credential may encode data including or representing a corresponding credential identifier and any other suitable data. In addition an electromagnetic signal representing a credential may encode another identifier that is linked to or otherwise associated with a corresponding credential identifier. In some implementations a given electromagnetic signal representing a credential may only be valid for a certain time period. For example part of the data encoded in the signal may correspond to a time stamp and the credential represented by the signal may be deemed invalid if a validating device attempts to decode the data more than a predetermined amount of time after the time stamp was generated.

To generate an electromagnetic signal a client device may use any suitable technique for encoding a representation of a credential. For example the client device may call a function or library routine that encodes data into electromagnetic signals. The client device can then output the electromagnetic signal representation of the credential from a light source e.g. a visible light IR etc. light source coupled to the client device for reception by a validating device. In some examples the credential may be represented by a series of pulses of electromagnetic radiation where the data encoded within the electromagnetic signal may be reflected by the timing of the pulses.

To initiate the validation process for an electromagnetic signal a client device outputs an electromagnetic signal representing a credential. A validating device e.g. a processing system within a piece of luggage may then receive the electromagnetic signal via a light sensitive sensor e.g. a camera etc. and decode the electromagnetic signal to generate a set of alphanumeric characters that were encoded in the electromagnetic signal. The validating device may use any suitable mechanism to receive and decode the electromagnetic signal.

In some implementations the validating device may then validate the electromagnetic signal by transmitting a validation request message to a server. The validation request message may include data corresponding to the alphanumeric characters that were encoded in the electromagnetic signal. When the server receives the validation request message it attempts to confirm that the presented electromagnetic signal is valid. For example the server may parse and or decode the alphanumeric characters to obtain a credential identifier. The server can then access the corresponding credential using the credential identifier e.g. from a database by querying using the credential identifier . Upon retrieving the credential the server can determine whether the presented representation for the credential was valid by comparing data received in the validation request message e.g. the alphanumeric characters with data associated with the retrieved credential.

Upon successful validation the server sends the validating device a validation response indicating that the electromagnetic signal was valid e.g. the alphanumeric characters in the request match a valid sequence of alphanumeric characters for the credential and the credential holder is authorized to unlock the luggage . In turn the validating device may then send a signal to unlock the luggage.

Alternatively or in addition a validating device may validate a set of alphanumeric characters from an electromagnetic signal locally without requiring interaction with a server. For example the electromagnetic signal may include a digital signature generated using a digital signature algorithm that generates the digital signature based on data derived from the credential and a private key of the credential grantor. The validating device may then access a public key of the credential grantor to validate the digital signature using the digital signature algorithm.

Still another form of representation for a credential is a near field communication NFC signal. NFC as described herein is a set of standards e.g. ECMA 340 and ISO IEC 18092 for client devices to establish radio communication with each other by touching them together or bringing them into close proximity e.g. within a few centimeters . NFC as described herein may also include other suitable short range wireless communication protocols such as Bluetooth or Zigbee.

A client device may use any suitable technique for encoding a representation of a credential within an NFC signal such as a function or library routine. An NFC signal representing a credential may encode data including or representing a corresponding credential identifier and any other suitable data. In addition an NFC signal representing a credential may encode another identifier that is linked to or otherwise associated with a corresponding credential identifier. In some implementations a given NFC signal representing a credential may only be valid for a certain time period. For example part of the data encoded in the signal may correspond to a time stamp and the credential represented by the signal may be deemed invalid if a validating device attempts to decode the data more than a predetermined amount of time after the time stamp was generated.

To initiate the validation process for an NFC signal a client device transmits an NFC signal representing a credential. A validating device e.g. a processing system within a piece of luggage may then receive the signal at a wireless receiver coupled to the validating device and decode the NFC signal representing the credential to generate the set of alphanumeric characters encoded in the signal.

In some implementations the validating device may then validate the NFC signal by transmitting a validation request message to a server. The validation request message may include data corresponding to the alphanumeric characters that were encoded in the NFC signal. When the server receives the validation request message it attempts to confirm that the presented NFC signal is valid. For example the server may parse and or decode the alphanumeric characters to obtain a credential identifier. The server can then access the corresponding credential using the credential identifier e.g. from a database by querying using the credential identifier . Upon retrieving the credential the server can determine whether the presented representation for the credential was valid by comparing data received in the validation request message e.g. the alphanumeric characters with data associated with the retrieved credential.

Upon successful validation the server sends the validating device a validation response indicating that the NFC signal was valid e.g. the alphanumeric characters in the request match a valid sequence of alphanumeric characters for the credential and the credential holder is authorized to unlock the luggage . In turn the validating device may then send a signal to unlock the luggage.

Alternatively or in addition a validating device may validate a set of alphanumeric characters from an NFC signal locally without requiring interaction with a server. For example the sound signal may include a digital signature generated using a digital signature algorithm that generates the digital signature based on data derived from the credential and a private key of the credential grantor. The validating device may then access a public key of the credential grantor to validate the digital signature using the digital signature algorithm.

The client device is configured to receive credentials associated with the user and store them in any suitable memory for later retrieval. A given user may be associated with multiple different credentials. Furthermore some or all of the credentials associated with a user may be accessible on a user s client device . In particular a software application executing on the client device can retrieve the credentials associated with user so they can be used for generating and presenting a representation of the credential e.g. to unlock luggage . The client device may be any type of computing device including but not limited to a mobile phone smart phone PDA music player e book reader tablet computer laptop or desktop computer or other stationary or portable device that includes one or more processors and non transitory computer readable storage media. The software application can be written in any suitable programming language such as for example Objective C C Java etc.

When a user desires to present a representation of a credential for validation the user may input a command into the client device via a man machine interface e.g. a user interface on a presence sensitive display . In response an application executing on the client device then generates and outputs the representation. In order to unlock the luggage this representation should match the validation capabilities of the luggage . For example if the user s client device is in a sound signal or NFC signal output mode as illustrated in then the luggage should be capable of receiving and decoding a sound signal or NFC signal representing the credential. If the user s client device is in an optical machine readable representation output mode as illustrated in and described further below then the luggage should be capable of receiving and decoding an optical machine readable representation for the credential. In some implementations the luggage may be capable of receiving and validating several different types of representations e.g. two or more of an optical machine readable representation an alphanumeric code a sound signal an electromagnetic signal and a NFC signal .

In the example shown in the client device outputs a signal e.g. a sound signal representing the user s credential. While described in as a sound signal the signal alternatively may be a NFC signal and the input device may be a wireless receiver. In some implementations the client device may output an optical machine readable representation for a credential an electromagnetic signal representation for the credential or an alphanumeric code representing a credential. In such implementations the input device may be a camera or optical scanner or a keypad. Client device also provides a user interface . In particular the client device may show the user interface while outputting a signal representing the user s credential for the purpose of attempting to access the luggage . The user interface includes a graphic symbol indicating that the client device is outputting a signal representing the credential as well as a caption indicating that the representation is an Employee ID for MicroStrategy Incorporated. Also the user interface includes an image of the employee and the name and title of the employee John Smith Chief Ops Officer .

The luggage may be any form of lockable baggage such as a briefcase or a suitcase. The luggage includes an enclosure and various components arranged on and within the enclosure . A locking assembly is arranged in the enclosure that includes two locking devices . These locking devices may be spring loaded hinged hasp type locks that are configured to be received and locked in place within openings included in the two spring loaded locking devices. Alternatively the locking devices may be any suitable locking mechanisms such as for example a set of apertured tabs on a front portion of the upper half of the luggage adapted to fit within a set of slots formed in a front portion of the lower half of the luggage as illustrated in . The locking devices also can be implemented as magnetic locks electric strike locks etc. The enclosure also houses a set of actuators . The actuators may be any suitable electromechanical devices that can be mechanically coupled to the locking devices so as to unlock the locking assembly. For example the actuators may be linear solenoids rotary solenoids servomotors or stepper motors. The exterior of the enclosure also has an input device attached. The input device may be a microphone as shown in . Alternatively or in addition the input device may include one or more of a wireless receiver an optical scanner a camera or a keypad. The enclosure may also include an LED to indicate the status of validating any credentials presented to the input device .

The processing system housed within the luggage may be any suitable combination of one or more processors coupled to memory devices that is capable of performing the necessary functions. The example processing system includes a processor a memory a storage device and an input output device . Each of the processor the memory the storage device and the input output device are interconnected using a system bus . The processor is capable of processing instructions for execution within the processing system . In some implementations the processor is a single threaded processor. In some implementations the processor is a multi threaded processor. The processor may be included in a microcontroller or any other suitable system.

The processor is capable of processing instructions stored in the memory or on the storage device to perform various operations. In particular the processor is configured to receive and decode a representation for a credential from the input device e.g. microphone . The processor is also capable of validating the representation by communicating with the server for example via the input output device and the network . The processor may also output an indication that validation is in process for example by driving the LED to flash change colors or otherwise signal the user via the input output device . The processor may also send an unlock signal to the actuators thereby causing the locking devices on the luggage to be unlocked. For example the unlock signal may be a digital or analog electrical signal capable of driving the actuators.

In some implementations the processor may also be configured to perform off line credential validation. Such off line credential validation does not require a concurrent network connection to the server in order to validate credentials. Rather to perform validation the processor may retrieve a valid representation for a credential from memory and or storage device and then confirm that the representation for the credential received from the client device matches the representation retrieved from memory and or storage device . In some aspects a set of representations for credentials may be stored in memory and or storage device . An identical set of representations for credentials may also be stored on the client device . The client device and the processing system may be configured to cycle through the same sequence of representations for credentials in a synchronized manner such that the representation output by the client device would match the current representation at the processing system . For example a clock at the client device and the processing system could be synchronized or substantially synchronized and the representations at the client device and the processing system could be rotated based on a predefined clock time. For example the representations could progress through a predefined sequence that involves selecting a new value on an hourly basis at both the client device and the processing system . To maintain synchronization the client device and the processing system may periodically synchronize with a network server for example using a network time protocol.

In some implementations involving off line validation the processor may periodically download a credential revocation list from the server and store the list in memory or storage device . For example the processor may download a credential revocation list daily weekly or monthly when network access is available. When the processor validates a credential in the off line mode the processor can verify that the credential is not listed in the credential revocation list and therefore confirm that the credential has not been revoked.

In some implementations involving off line validation the representation for the credential provided by the client device may include a digital signature derived from a private key of a credential grantor e.g. the employer or luggage retailer and a portion of the data from the credential. For example the digital signature may be generated by encoding one or more components of the credential e.g. the credential identifier the user name the user title etc. using a suitable digital signature algorithm and the private key of the credential grantor. Suitable algorithms may include the Rivest Shamir Adleman RSA algorithm or the digital signal algorithm DSA . When the processor determines that the data corresponding to the credential includes a digital signature it can access a public key of the credential grantor. For example the processor may retrieve the public key from the memory and or the storage device . In some implementations the processor may periodically receive updates to a library of public keys for credential grantors. The processor can then validate the credential by authenticating the digital signature using the public key of the credential grantor and the digital signature algorithm used to encode the original digital signature.

In some implementations some or all of the functions of the processing system may be performed by an additional client device e.g. a mobile computing device like a smart phone or tablet computer not shown that is housed within the luggage. For example a user may have an additional client device that may be stored within the luggage . This additional client device may be coupled to an input output device within the luggage and may provide the functions of the processor .

The memory stores information within the processing system . In some implementations the memory is a computer readable medium. In some implementations the memory is a volatile memory unit. In some implementations the memory is a non volatile memory unit.

The storage device is capable of providing mass storage for the processing system . In some implementations the storage device is a computer readable medium. In various different implementations the storage device may be a floppy disk device a hard disk device an optical disk device or a tape device.

The input output device provides input output operations for the processing system . For example the input output device may include a network interface. The input output device also may include a driver e.g. a digital to analog converter to control the LED and or an analog to digital converter to receive input from the microphone . The input output device may further include a driver e.g. a digital to analog converter or digital output to control the actuators . In some implementations the input output device may be configured to receive input from an optical scanner a camera or a keypad. In addition the input output device may be configured to drive an LED display on the exterior or interior of the luggage not shown to provide a graphical information to the user .

The server communicates via a network with the client device and the processing system . As illustrated in when the user attempts to unlock the luggage the user operates the client device to present a representation of a credential to the input device of the luggage . The processing system then may validate the credential by communicating with the server as described above. Once the processing system has validated the credential the processing system sends an unlock signal to the actuators thereby causing the locking devices on the luggage to unlock.

The server manages and or stores one or more credentials associates users and groups of users with appropriate credentials and provides the credentials to users client devices and or processing systems e.g. operated by credential authorities for validation. The server can be any suitable computer or collection of computers executing software capable of managing distributing and or validating representations of credentials for users and groups of users via a network as described herein.

Credentials user accounts group accounts and administrative accounts can be stored in a database e.g. MySQL PostgreSQL MS SQL Server MongoDB or other suitable data structure that can be accessed by the server . In some implementations the server may access the stored credentials and or user accounts via web services such as representational state transfer REST style services.

Initially the server creates a credential based on input provided by a credential grantor e.g. an employer or luggage retailer . In some implementations multiple different credential grantors e.g. different entities and or organizations may issue credentials using the same server . The credential may include a variety of information such as a credential identifier e.g. a number or alphanumeric character string that uniquely identifies a credential an indication of the grantor of the credential information about the user to whom the credential grantor granted the credential an indication of one or more permissions granted by the credential grantor to the user a description of a specific piece of luggage associated with the credential etc.

The server may present a suitable interface to the credential grantor for creation of credentials. For example the server may present a web interface through which grantors can interact via a Web browser. In other aspects the server may be directly accessible via a graphical user interface or an application running on a mobile device. Any suitable interface can be used that enables the creation and storage of credentials and user accounts. In addition or as an alternative to creation of credentials by credential grantors credentials may be created at the request of registered users through a web based or other interface or through any other suitable mechanism such as sending email or short message service SMS transmissions to grantors. In some implementations registered users may be able to create credentials by use of an application running on a client device.

The server also may present an interface so that users and or credential grantors can create user accounts for individual users and groups of users. For example the server may present a web interface through which credential grantors can interact via a Web browser. Additionally or alternatively the server may be directly accessible via a graphical user interface or an application on a mobile device. User accounts may be stored in a table or collection of tables in a database or in any other suitable data structure accessible by the server . The user accounts may include a variety of information such as user name user title user identifier e.g. a number or character string that uniquely identifies a user one or more unique keys for the user e.g. alphanumeric codes that can be used for encryption and or decryption and or the address es of one or more client devices owned by or otherwise associated with the user. Likewise group accounts may be stored in a table collection of tables or any other suitable data structure. Certain individual users may be identified as belonging to a group by linking an entry for the user to an entry for the group for example by use of a linking table. The group accounts may include a variety of information such as a group name group identifier e.g. a number or character string that uniquely identifies a group and a description of the group. In addition or as an alternative to creation of user accounts and groups by grantors user accounts and groups can be created at the request of potential users through a web based or other interface or through any other suitable means such as sending email or SMS to grantors. In some implementations the potential users may be able to create user accounts by use of an application running on a client device.

Once credentials and users or groups of users have been created credential grantors and or users can associate the credentials with users or groups of users. For example the server may present a web interface through which grantors can interact via a Web browser to link a given credential to a given user or group of users. In other aspects the server may be directly accessible via a graphical user interface or an application on a mobile device. Credentials may be associated with users or groups of users for example by generating a credential identifier for a given user or group of users and associating the credential identifier with the user or group of users by storing an entry for the credential identifier as a database entry related to a credential. In addition to association of credentials to users and groups of users by grantors registered users also may request that certain users or groups of users be associated with certain credentials through a web based or other interface or through any other suitable means such as sending email or SMS transmissions to grantors. In some implementations users may be able to associate their user accounts with one or more credentials by use of an application running on a client device. Furthermore the server also may notify the users that they have been associated with the credential s for example by pushing notifications to the respective users client devices. Such notifications may include the credential identifier for the user.

As an example an employer e.g. MicroStrategy Incorporated may issue Mr. Smith a piece of luggage . The employer may create a new user account at the server that includes a credential permitting Mr. Smith to access the luggage . In an alternative scenario Mr. John Smith may purchase a new piece of luggage from a retailer. At checkout the retailer may request a new user account from the server on behalf of the user . The server can then create database entries representing a user account for Mr. Smith where the user account includes a credential allowing Mr. Smith to unlock the luggage .

Once credentials have been associated with appropriate user and or group accounts the credentials can then be distributed to client devices for the appropriate users via the network . For example the network may be a local area network LAN and or a wide area network WAN e.g. the Internet. In some versions the server may communicate with the client devices via SMS or multimedia messaging service MMS . The server may access user accounts in a database to locate the appropriate users client devices.

When the processing system transmits an unlock signal the linear solenoid is energized driving the plunger into the end of the push rod assembly as illustrated in . As a result the push rod assembly compresses springs thereby causing the latch bolt to retract. This frees the ends of the hasp type locks from the openings of the locking assembly and causes the luggage to be unlocked.

Next in step the processing system transmits a validation request to a server e.g. server from where the validation request includes data derived from the representation for the credential. The data in the validation request may depend upon the type of representation received from the client device. For example if the representation is a sound signal an electromagnetic signal or an NFC signal the processing system may decode the representation to derive a set of alphanumeric characters. Likewise if the representation is an optical machine readable representation the processing system may decode the representation to derive a set of alphanumeric characters. This set of alphanumeric characters may be included in the validation request. However if the representation is an alphanumeric code the processing system may include the alphanumeric code in the validation request without performing any decoding.

In response the server transmits a validation response. The processing system receives the validation response indicating that the credential is valid in step . In step the processing system then outputs an unlock signal that causes an actuator to unlock a locking device coupled to the luggage.

In some implementations unlocking of the locking device coupled to the luggage may be conditioned upon the presentation of multiple valid representations of credentials to the processing system e.g. within a defined window of time . For example an individual user may present representations of two different credentials associated with the user e.g. a government issued identity credential and an employer issued employee credential to the processing system and the processing system may request validation of the representations of the two credentials from the server. If the server responds indicating that the representations of both credentials are valid the luggage may be unlocked. However if one or both of the credentials are invalid the luggage may not be unlocked.

Alternatively two different users may present representations of two different credentials associated with the two users respectively to the processing system and the processing system may request validation of the representations of the two credentials from the server. If the server responds indicating that the representations of both credentials are valid the luggage may be unlocked. However if one or both of the credentials are invalid the luggage may not be unlocked.

In other implementations unlocking of the locking device coupled to the luggage may be conditioned upon the presentation of multiple valid representations of the same credential to the processing system e.g. within a defined window of time . For example an individual user may present two representations of the same credential e.g. a sound signal representation of the credential and an alphanumeric code representation of the credential to the processing system and the processing system may request validation of both representations of the credential from the server. If the server responds indicating that both representations of the credential are valid the luggage may be unlocked. However if one or both of the representations of the credential are invalid the luggage may not be unlocked.

Additionally or alternatively in some implementations unlocking of the locking device coupled to the luggage may be conditioned upon the presentation of one or more biometric identifiers e.g. a fingerprint an iris or retina scan a voice signature etc. in addition to the presentation of a valid representation of a credential to the processing system e.g. within a defined period of time . In such implementations the luggage may include or otherwise be coupled to an appropriate input mechanism for receiving the biometric identifier. For example the luggage may include a fingerprint scanner e.g. for receiving fingerprints a camera e.g. for receiving iris or retina scans and or a microphone e.g. for receiving voice signatures . A user may present a representation of a credential as well as a biometric identifier of the user to the processing system and the processing system may request validation of both the representation of the credential and the biometric identifier from the server. If the server responds indicating that both the representation of the credential and the biometric identifier are valid e.g. that the representation of the credential is valid and the biometric identifier corresponds to the user represented by the credential the luggage may be unlocked. However if one or both of the representation of the credential and the biometric identifier are invalid the luggage may not be unlocked.

In some implementations unlocking of the locking device coupled to the luggage may be conditioned upon satisfaction of a location condition in addition or as an alternative to the other conditions described above. For example a user may present a representation of a credential to the processing system and the processing system may request validation of the representation of the credential from the server. In addition the processing system may transmit an indication of a location of the luggage e.g. geographic coordinates obtained from global positioning system GPS capabilities of the processing system to the server. If the server responds indicating that the representation of the credential is valid and that the location of the luggage is within an allowed region the luggage may be unlocked. However if the representation of the credential is invalid or the location of the luggage is not within an allowed region the luggage may not be unlocked. Alternatively in some implementations the processing system may enforce the location condition itself. In such implementations the processing system may determine if the luggage is located within an allowed region e.g. based on data obtained from GPS capabilities of the processing system and cause the luggage to be unlocked responsive to receipt of an indication from the server that the representation of the credential is valid and a determination that the luggage is located within an allowed region. In contrast the luggage may remain locked if the server indicates that the representation of the credential is invalid or the processing system determines that the luggage is not located within an allowed region.

Certain features described herein can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry or in computer hardware firmware software or in combinations of them. Certain apparatus described herein can be implemented in a computer program product tangibly embodied in an information carrier e.g. in a machine readable storage device for execution by a programmable processor and certain method steps can be performed by a programmable processor executing a program of instructions to perform functions of certain described implementations by operating on input data and generating output. Furthermore certain described features can be implemented advantageously in one or more computer programs that are executable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor coupled to receive data and instructions from and to transmit data and instructions to a data storage system at least one input device and at least one output device. A computer program is a set of instructions that can be used directly or indirectly in a computer to perform a certain activity or bring about a certain result. A computer program can be written in any form of programming language including compiled or interpreted languages and it can be deployed in any form including as a stand alone program or as a module component subroutine or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment.

Suitable processors for the execution of a program of instructions include by way of example both general and special purpose microprocessors and the sole processor or one of multiple processors of any kind of computer. Generally a processor will receive instructions and data from a read only memory or a random access memory or both. The elements of a computer may include a processor for executing instructions and one or more memories for storing instructions and data. Storage devices suitable for tangibly embodying computer program instructions and data include all forms of non volatile memory including by way of example semiconductor memory devices such as EPROM EEPROM and flash memory devices magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks magneto optical disks and CD ROM and DVD ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by or incorporated in ASICs application specific integrated circuits .

To provide for interaction with a user certain features can be implemented on a computer having a display device such as a CRT cathode ray tube or LCD liquid crystal display monitor for displaying information to the user and a touchscreen and or a keyboard and a pointing device such as a mouse or a trackball by which the user can provide input to the computer.

Certain features can be implemented in a computer system that includes a back end component such as a data server or that includes a middleware component such as an application server or an Internet server or that includes a front end component such as a client computer having a graphical user interface or an Internet browser or any combination of them. The components of the system can be connected by any form or medium of digital data communication such as a communication network. Examples of communication networks include e.g. a LAN a WAN and the computers and networks forming the Internet.

The computer system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a network such as a network described above. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client server relationship to each other.

A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure.

For instance in some implementations a piece of luggage including a processing system and locking mechanisms as described herein may present a representation of a luggage identifier to a user who desires to gain access to the piece of luggage. For example the piece of luggage may present the representation of the luggage identifier as an alphanumeric code an optical machine readable representation e.g. a QR code a sound signal an electromagnetic signal e.g. visible light IR etc. and or an NFC signal. The user who desires to gain access to the piece of luggage may receive the representation of the luggage identifier using a computing device e.g. with an appropriate client application executing on the computing device and the computing device may transmit an indication of the luggage identifier to a server along with an indication of the user associated with the computing device e.g. a user identifier associated with the user and or an indication of one or more credentials possessed by the user . The server then may determine if the user is authorized to access the luggage e.g. based on one or more credentials possessed by the user and the indication of the luggage identifier . In the event that server determines that the user is authorized to access the piece of luggage the server may transmit a communication to the processing system associated with the piece of luggage instructing the processing system to unlock the piece of luggage. In response the processing system may cause the locking mechanisms to unlock.

Furthermore while techniques and mechanisms disclosed herein generally are described in the context of securing luggage the techniques and mechanisms disclosed herein may be employed in connection with any of a variety of portable or non portable containers including for example shipping containers. Accordingly other implementations are within the scope of the following claims.
