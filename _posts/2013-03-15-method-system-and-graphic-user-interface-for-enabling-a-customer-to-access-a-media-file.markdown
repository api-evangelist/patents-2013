This invention relates to a method system graphic user interface GUI apparatus and computer readable media for enabling a customer to access a media file uploaded by a user to a hosted user profile.

Current media file downloading sources such as iTunes and Rhapsody offer customers the ability to purchase and download media files. Typically these downloading sources receive media files from a recording industry representative and not from a user or artist. Once received a media file may then be processed and uploaded to a website hosted by the downloading source so that they may be viewed and or purchased by one or more customers. In this way a user or artist is denied direct access to the downloading source. The lack of direct access to a downloading source causes considerable delay in the time it takes for a media file to get to market. This delay may in turn cost the user or artist valuable opportunities and financial benefits. Additionally the lack of direct access to a downloading source denies a user or artist direct control over a media file they generate or are otherwise associated with.
