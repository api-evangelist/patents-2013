This invention was developed under Contract DE AC04 97AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.

Photoacoustic spectroscopy PAS relies on the photoacoustic effect in irradiating a sample with intermittent pulses of light. Concomitantly as the incident light hits the sample heat is generated and acoustic waves having a frequency relative to the light pulse frequency are generated. The resulting series of acoustic pulses is detected by a highly sensitive microphone for example at lkHz repetition rate and may be formulated into a signal for analysis and detection of chemical species.

Optical microphones rely on modulated light from a displaced or vibrating microphone membrane and detecting the modulation of the light. The modulated light pattern carries the displacement information that is provided by the microphone membrane. By knowing the stiffness of the microphone membrane the displacement can then be translated into a known pressure signal.

The following is a brief summary of subject matter that is described in greater detail herein. This summary is not intended to be limiting as to the scope of the claims.

In an embodiment a miniaturized photoacoustic sensor is optimized for applications where the volume available for sensor integration is limited and electrical connections to the sensing area are not desirable. The sensor measured apart from any connecting cables may for example have a total volume of 1 cubic millimeter to 1 cubic centimeter such as for example 15 cubic millimeters to 800 cubic millimeters or 60 cubic millimeters to 500 cubic millimeters. The sensor may be manufactured in such small dimensions by employing semiconductor fabrication techniques in the manufacture of components including the photoacoustic microphone.

Environments where the electrical connection free embodiment may be particularly useful include those with unstable or reactive chemical species such as volatile gas environments. The sensor may also be useful in analyzing chemicals in environments where an electrical spark or discharge could cause the analyte to react and change thereby hampering accurate analysis of the analyte.

In an exemplary embodiment the miniaturized photoacoustic sensor is also capable of operating at very low power. For example the sensor may be configured to operate for example at 1 mW to 100 mW such as 5 mW to 75 mW or 25 mW to 60 mW.

In another exemplary embodiment the acoustic sensor of the miniaturized photoacoustic sensor is optically interrogated light in light out and free of exposed electrical conductors on an exterior of the acoustic sensor e.g. electrical wiring conductors or leads that are not hermetically sealed or encapsulated in the sensor that might otherwise come into contact with the sample chamber or the environment in which the sensor is disposed. In embodiments the light for generating the pressure pulse through absorption by the chemical species of interest is brought in by optical fiber. In a further enhancement light provided by an optical fiber is converted into electrical power by a solar cell and is provided to an integrated circuit IC in the sensor. The IC controls the power delivery and runs local diagnostics provides biasing if necessary and communicates data for example calibration and status information back through the optical fiber by modulating a light source such as an LED VCSEL or edge emitting diode laser maintaining the no electrical conductor linkage between the sensor and the monitoring computing device.

With reference now to an exemplary system that facilitates photoacoustic analysis of a sample is illustrated. The system includes a photoacoustic sensor . In an embodiment the photoacoustic sensor is built on a base plate . The base plate may comprise an acoustic insulator such as ceramic and the base plate may house electrical connections terminals and components. In an exemplary embodiment the electrical connections and components are hermetically sealed from the exterior of the photoacoustic sensor . In the embodiment of the base plate includes electrical contacts that are configured to be electrically coupled to an external computing device wherein the external computing device can perform functions such as testing calibration etc. on data received by way of the electrical contacts . However the use of these contacts or any other electrical connection is not required to operate the sensor in a sample environment. In an embodiment the electrical contacts may be ports for respective optical fibers or may be replaced with ports for respective optical fibers. In another exemplary embodiment the base plate is not present and components described as coupled to the base plate are directly coupled to each other.

An acoustic component is secured on top of the base plate . The acoustic component defines an inner sample chamber that is covered with a top cover shown cut away in . In an exemplary embodiment the acoustic component can comprise an acoustic insulator such as ceramic. The walls top cover and floor of the sample chamber is coated with an optical reflector such as gold or another reflective metal. For instance the reflector can be corrosion resistant and non reactive with the sample environment in which the sensor is employed.

As shown in the sample chamber is an inner cavity bounded by components of the sensor . It is in the geometry of a hollow polygonal prism which as used herein includes without limitation a cylinder having a top and bottom. The sample chamber of is generally cylindrical with a triangular feature extending out from the wall toward the center of the cylinder. The triangular feature promotes reflection of the light around the sample chamber and additionally promotes absorption by the analyte.

The total volume of the sample chamber may for example be 1 cubic millimeter to less than 1000 cubic millimeters such as 10 cubic millimeters to 750 cubic millimeters or 50 cubic millimeters to 250 cubic centimeters. The sample chamber may for example be 1 mmto 10 mmin base area such as 2 mmto 8 mm or 3.5 mmto 7.5 mm and 1 mm to 10 mm in height such as 2 mm to 8 mm or 3.5 mm to 7.5 mm.

The acoustic component includes a sample inlet port and a sample outlet port wherein such ports and extend through the walls of the sample chamber to the exterior of the photoacoustic sensor . The sample inlet and outlet ports and may be configured to couple to capillary tubing or other devices for transporting analytes. In an exemplary embodiment the small size of the sample inlet and outlet ports and may enable such portions to function as respective capillaries. Further the analyte may be pumped into the sample chamber out of the sample chamber or both. In yet another exemplary embodiment the analyte may naturally diffuse in or out of the sample chamber through the inlet and outlet ports and e.g. no pump is needed .

A light component is in optical communication with the sample chamber and includes elements that facilitate direction of light into the sample chamber including a prism a mirror a waveguide or other suitable element. A pair of components are in optical communication as used herein if they are aligned or positioned so that light can be directed between components of the pair. In the light component is coupled to the sample chamber and forms a portion of the sample chamber wall thereby enclosing it. The light component may comprise an IR fiber ferrule and can be configured to receive an optical fiber . In an exemplary embodiment the light component connects to the optical fiber and directs light pulses comprising infrared light from the optical fiber into the sample chamber . In the exemplary embodiment shown in the light component is situated opposite to the triangular feature of the wall of the sample chamber .

The light component may also include a solar cell not shown that receives the light pulses from the optical fiber or a separate optical fiber or both. The solar cell converts optical signals into electrical current to power certain components of the photoacoustic sensor . These components may include for example an IC coupled to the photoacoustic sensor a transmitting light source coupled to the photoacoustic sensor or a gating mechanism for the inlet and outlet ports and .

The photoacoustic sensor can also optionally include an IC that may be housed in the base plate or coupled to another component of the photoacoustic sensor . The solar cell may be coupled to and provide current to such IC wherein the IC is configured to provide power instructions or both power and instructions to components of the photoacoustic sensor .

In an exemplary embodiment power to the photoacoustic sensor is provided from a DC component of the optical signal as received by the solar cell and instructions are provided from an AC component from the optical signal wherein the AC component is transmitted to the above mentioned IC. For instance the optical fiber may transmit the light for the AC component that provides instructions to the IC and a separate optical fiber may provide light to the solar cell which converts such light to DC current to power the components of the sensor . In an embodiment a capacitively coupled node component detects the AC part of the signal.

A microphone is in acoustic communication with the sample chamber and is coupled to the bottom side of the base plate . Thus the microphone provides at least a portion of the bottom surface and encloses the sample chamber . The light component and the light directed into the sample chamber are orthogonal to the microphone .

In another embodiment the diffraction grating is positioned above the microphone membrane . The diffraction grating causes a portion of the light coming from the sample chamber to diffract onto the microphone membrane .

In an embodiment the microphone includes an optical component shown in for detecting the modulated light pattern or transmitting optical output. Thus the optical component can be or include an optical fiber that directly transmits the diffracted light pattern to the external computing device thereby providing an optical output signal from the photoacoustic sensor a photodetector that detects the diffracted light pattern such as a photodiode and or other elements that facilitate detection and or transmittal of the diffracted light pattern. Such optical fiber can have prisms mirrors or other optical elements associated therewith to facilitate transmittal of the optical output signal to a remotely situated computing device. Additionally one or more lenses mirrors lensed fibers or waveguides that focus the diffracted light on the optical fiber or photodetector may also be employed. In an exemplary embodiment a plurality of optical fibers can be configured to receive respective diffracted light patterns simultaneously and can be employed to transmit the diffracted light patterns to the remotely situated computing device or respective photodetectors. Still further an optical signal that encodes data can be transmitted to or from the photoacoustic sensor by way of at least one optical fiber such as the optical component . Exemplary positioning of the optical component relative to the diffraction grating and the microphone membrane is depicted in .

In an embodiment where the photodetector is used to detect the diffracted light the photodetector may transmit an electrical signal to an output light source coupled to the sensor . The output light source may be for example an LED a laser or a vertical cavity surface emitting laser VCSEL . The optical output signal is then transmitted through an optical output fiber coupled to the output light source.

In an alternative embodiment the microphone is a piezoelectric microphone where the acoustic response is measured piezoelectrically. In such an embodiment a signal converter is used to convert the piezoelectric impulses to an output light source coupled to the sensor and an optical signal is transmitted through an optical output fiber coupled to the light source.

The system may further include an external computing device which is explained in further detail below that is used to analyze the optical output signal or electrical output from the photoacoustic sensor .

The integrated circuit that is onboard the sensor may receive electrical input from the photodetector or a piezoelectric microphone and perform onboard measurements calibrations or other processing of the input. The integrated circuit then communicates data through an electrical signal to the output light source coupled to the sensor and an optical output signal is transmitted through the optical output fiber coupled to the light source. The optical output signal may thus be defined as comprising data relating to the modulated light pattern which may directly reflect the modulated light pattern or may be processed data relating to the modulated light pattern.

In another exemplary embodiment the light component can include a laser. Light emitted by the laser that is incident on a grating can be modulated by the relative movement of the grating and a reflector surface that is proximate to the grating. A related alternative approach is based on modulation of laser light in a waveguide that is mechanically deformed due to the incident pressure pulse. In order to reduce possible system noise the sensor can be modulated at a higher frequency and filtered to remove the unwanted noise sources. This can be achieved by modulating light emitted by the laser that is directed to the chemical species and or by modulating light emitted by a laser that is interrogating the acoustic sensor. In yet another alternative embodiment the sensor can be mechanically modulated for example by electrostatically moving the grating .

Referring now solely to a methodology that facilitates photoacoustic analysis is illustrated. The methodology begins at and at an optical signal is transmitted to a photoacoustic sensor through for example an optical fiber. At the optical signal is directed into a sample chamber of the sensor where an acoustic signal is induced when the light interacts with an analyte. At the acoustic signal displaces the microphone membrane causing a vibration response.

At light from the optical signal is diffracted onto the microphone membrane. For example a portion of the light is diffracted as it passes from the sample chamber through a diffraction grating and onto the microphone membrane. In another exemplary embodiment a separate light source is used to interrogate the microphone membrane.

At the displacement of the microphone membrane causes light incident on the microphone membrane to be diffracted in a modulated light pattern that is relative to the displacement. At this point the modulated light pattern may optically be received through for example a lens or waveguide coupled to an optical fiber and at the modulated light pattern can be transmitted as an optical output signal outside the sensor.

Optionally at the modulated light pattern may instead or in addition be detected with a photodetector which converts the modulated light pattern to an electrical signal. At the electrical signal may be transmitted to the IC for processing or at the electrical signal can be transmitted to an output light source for optical transmission where the modulated light pattern or data indicative thereof is transmitted as an output optical signal at . In another exemplary embodiment the modulated light pattern is directly output through optical fibers and the signal that is processed by the IC is for providing one or more of a state of health calibration or diagnostics type of information.

In another alternative along this path the electrical signal from the photodetector or from the integrated circuit may be transmitted as electrical output . However this is not preferred for applications in volatile environments. This option may be used for example to calibrate and test the sensor prior to inserting it into a testing environment.

In another embodiment after act at displacement of the microphone membrane can detected on a piezoelectric microphone which converts the acoustic signal to an electrical signal. This electrical signal may then be transmitted at as an output electrical signal or the methodology can proceed to acts and .

In another embodiment depicted as an option in the methodology the photoacoustic sensor is powered and controlled by an optical linkage. At a transmitted optical signal is received by a solar cell on the photoacoustic sensor and converted to electrical current to provide power to the sensor. At the same or a different optical signal may be converted to a data input signal and this signal is then transmitted to the integrated circuit at . The methodology can then proceed to act . In an exemplary embodiment both AC and DC current can be generated from the same optical input signal carried over an optical fiber. In such embodiment the optical signal has been modulated to encode data therein. The DC portion of the optical signal is converted to electrical power by the solar cell and the AC part of the signal can be detected by a capacitively coupled node that only detects the AC part of the signal. Whereas the sensor can also or alternatively be powered through an electrical connection such an electrical connection is not preferred when the sensor is deployed in certain testing environments.

In a method of analyzing a sample with the miniaturized photoacoustic sensor no electrical signals are passed between the sensor and an exterior measurement point such as a computing device. As mentioned above this embodiment where there are only optical linkages is valuable when there is a concern about having an electrical conductor running between where the monitoring processing or observation is being made the computing device and the location of the sensor.

Referring now to a semiconductor manufacturing methodology for making an exemplary miniaturized optical microphone of the photoacoustic sensor is illustrated. This methodology is only an example and other processes and steps may be used to manufacture embodiments of the miniaturized photoacoustic sensor. Terms such as etching releasing and deposition are used as those terms are typically used in semiconductor fabrication techniques. For example deposition may be performed by processes such as physical vapor deposition PVD chemical vapor deposition CVD electrochemical deposition ECD molecular beam epitaxy MBE atomic layer deposition ALD etc. As another example wet or dry etching may be used.

In a silicon on insulator SOI wafer is provided. The upper most layer disposed on the wafer is a device layer and the middle layer directly on top of the wafer is a buried silicon dioxide layer . The device layer and the buried silicon dioxide layer are etched to form divots . The device layer may be for example 20 microns to 1 micron such as for example 5 microns to 15 microns. The oxide layer may be for example 0.5 microns to 2 microns such as for example 1 micron to 1.5 microns.

In the divots are backfilled to form doped polysilicon filled divots and then chemical mechanical polishing is performed to remove excess polysilicon and to smooth out the topography. This chemical mechanical polishing step may also be performed after other deposition or filling steps.

In a second oxide layer is deposited over the device layer . The second oxide layer is then etched down to the device layer in six locations four that are in the middle between the doped polysilicon filled divots and one on each side that are between the outer and inner doped polysilicon filled divots . The second oxide layer may be for example 0.25 microns to 1 micron for example 0.4 microns to 0.75 microns. The same silicon dioxide exemplified above for the buried layer may be used for the second oxide layer and other oxide layers described below.

In a silicon nitride layer is deposited over the second oxide layer and the nitride fills in the etchings locations in the second oxide layer . In addition four etchings are performed to remove portions of both the second oxide layer and nitride layers .

In a conductive doped polysilicon layer is then deposited over the nitride layer and also fills the outer two etchings in the second oxide layer and the nitride layer . The polysilicon layer makes contact to the substrate to provide electrical connectivity to those regions. Further etchings are made in the polysilicon layer as shown in .

In several additional etchings are made through the nitride second oxide and device layers to open divots through the device layer and to contact the buried oxide layer . This step allows for later removing device layer regions. A third oxide layer is deposited over the structure to encapsulate such structure. This third oxide layer may have a thickness for example of 1 to 5 microns such as 1 to 3 microns as measured over the polysilicon layer .

The photoacoustic sensor may be optimized for gas phase analytes or solution phase analytes or even solid analytes. The photoacoustic sensor system may also be used for example to perform COdetection in the atmosphere with high resolution and no consumables.
