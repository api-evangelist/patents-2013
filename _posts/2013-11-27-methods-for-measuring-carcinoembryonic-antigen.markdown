This invention and embodiments illustrating the method and materials used may be further understood by reference to the following non limiting examples.

To determine if the New Method for dilution of pancreatic cyst fluid specimens for CEA testing is improved compared to the clinical method through establishing analytical linearity accuracy precision sensitivity and specificity.

CEA measurements in diluted pancreatic cyst fluids have been found to not accurately reflect the original neat pancreatic cyst fluid CEA value. RedPath Integrated Pathology has developed a unique testing method to address this issue. A pancreatic cyst fluid is inherently a lower volume specimen type and often times the volume of the specimen collected does not meet the volume requirement for CEA testing. The ability to perform upfront dilutions on pancreatic cysts specimens and provide an accurate CEA value as compared to undiluted CEA measurements was the goal in the development of this methodology improvement.

The development process for this methodology evolved through trial and error of different applications and the correlating analyses of each result set. Pancreatic cyst fluids with excess volume were used for all developmental testing of this method and dilutions performed on specimens were compared to the CEA values obtained from testing the specimens neat undiluted .

A number of different off shelf diluents were tested comparatively. During this testing it was found that Saline showed improvement as a diluent versus Diluent Universal UD Roche which is currently the diluent used to perform dilutions for clinical CEA testing. However the use of saline alone was not enough to improve the accuracy of the CEA value for all pancreatic cyst fluid specimens when diluted.

An in house diluent Solution CEA was developed and tested in effort to improve the accuracy of all diluted pancreatic cyst fluid specimens. This diluent was found to be effective on some specimens but to over perform for certain pancreatic cyst fluid specimens. When specimens were tested in parallel with saline and Solution CEA dilutions the comparative data was reviewed and a pattern evolved with the incorporation of the Amylase results into the analysis. It was determined that specimens with an Amylase value of less than 15 000 were more accurate with the use of saline as a diluent when compared to the neat CEA values. However specimens with an Amylase value of greater than 15 000 were more accurate with the use of Solution CEA as the diluent when compared to the neat CEA values.

As more testing was conducted to verify the method and increase the n of specimens tested it was identified through statistical analysis that the effect of the Solution CEA as a diluents could be mathematically replicated through the use of a correction factor CF . Different CFs were trained and tested on varying dilution points. It was found through this testing that it was essential to both train and validate the method on data sets with pancreatic cyst fluids divided proportionately since differ methods of testing were required for specimens based on the Amylase result please refer to Validation Methods below .

All pancreatic fluid specimens requiring an upfront dilution will be diluted using saline as the diluent and will be diluted using a 1 10 dilution point. Any specimen that requires a dilution and has an Amylase value of greater than 15 000 will have a correction factor CF of 0.7 applied to the CEA value to determine the final CEA result reported.

To validate the method for dilution of pancreatic cyst fluid specimens parallel specimen testing for CEA was completed. Each specimen was diluted in UD old method and saline new method with re testing of CEA Amylase on a neat specimen aliquot for result comparison. The validation specimen set was comprised of an equal number of specimens divided into 4 categories. These four specimen categories are 

For this validation 92 pancreatic cyst fluid specimens were accrued with 23 specimens in each of the four categories described above. Each specimen was accrued and tested as follows 

To determine precision pancreatic cyst fluid specimens were collected to perform parallel specimen testing for CEA. Prior to the precision study each specimen was re tested for CEA Amylase using a neat specimen aliquot for result comparison. Parallel testing was performed in triplicate on specimen dilutions in UD old method and Saline new method . Each dilution was tested over 3 different run scenarios 

For this validation 16 specimens were accrued with 4 specimens in each of the four categories described above in the Linearity Accuracy Sensitivity Specificity section. Each specimen was accrued and tested as follows 

Intraclass Correlation ICC concordance correlation CC and bias were used to measure the agreement between CEA values obtained on neat pancreatic fluid specimens versus diluted pancreatic fluid specimens both old and new dilution methods . See .

The concordance for the old and new dilution method compared to neat undiluted CEA values were determine when data was analyzed in clinically relevant categories. The categories were defined by using 192 ng mL as the cut off between Low CEA and High CEA. A CEA value of 192 ng mL was selected because this value has been used to discriminate between mucinous and non mucinous cysts. Values at or above 192 ng mL indicate mucinous cysts values below this cut off indicate non mucinous cysts. The concordance with neat CEA values was improved using the New CEA method as compared to the Old CEA method Table 2 .

The sensitivity and specificity for measuring the CEA analyte is described by the manufactures of the Elecsys 2010 CEA analyzer Roche REF 11731629 http www.roche.com.mx fmfiles re7143001 ElecsysCEA.pdf . The range in which CEA can be measured by this instrument is 0.200 1000 ng mL with 0.200 being the lower limit of detection. Any interfering substances present in pancreatic cyst fluid will be less abundant when dilution in saline occurs.

Coefficient of variation CV was used to assess the reproducibility of CEA values obtained on neat pancreatic fluid specimens versus diluted pancreatic fluid specimens both old and new dilution methods . Please see Table 3 for the inter run and intra run reproducibility of old dilution method and Table 4 for inter run and intra run reproducibility of new dilution method.

There is an increase in agreement between the neat CEA value and the diluted CEA value using the New CEA Dilution method versus the Old CEA dilution method. Intraclass Correlation ICC concordance correlation CC bias and categorical concordance between diluted and neat CEA values were all improved using the New CEA dilution method as compared to the Old CEA dilution method.

Sensitivity and Specificity are per the manufacturer s description for the Elecsys 2010 Roche instrument CEA analyzer.

Both methods showed good reproducibility with the New CEA Dilution method showing a slight improvement in overall intra run reproducibility. Inter run reproducibility is generally accepted with CVs of less than 15 intra run reproducibility is generally accepted with CVs of less than 10 . All CVs for the New CEA dilution method were less than these values.

The results described above indicate that the New CEA Dilution method performance is similar to or improved compared to the current clinical method i.e. Old CEA Dilution method for pancreatic fluid samples. Therefore the New CEA Dilution method is acceptable for implementation on clinical pancreatic fluid specimens received for CEA testing.
