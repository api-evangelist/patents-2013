title: Notifications based on social network service activity and profile triggers
abstract: An embodiment searches a social network for at least one trigger event, detects one or more trigger events, and communicates the detected one or more trigger events as an alert. Searching the social network comprises searching member profiles and searching member activities. Detected one or more trigger events are centralized into a sortable list and prioritized based on business entities and the importance of the trigger events to persons related to the business entities. The centralized sortable list is fed into a customer relations management system which presents the alerts on a user interface. A plurality of types of triggers includes people updates, company updates, product purchases, and product usage.

The present disclosure generally relates to data processing systems. More specifically the present disclosure relates to methods systems and computer program products that estimate the hierarchy of an organization from entries and relationships in social graphs of a social network service.

The advent of social networks has provided an opportunity for organizations be they sales organizations or other organizations to prioritize likely prospects and to assign the most likely prospects respectively to the people internal to the organization who are most likely to be successful in closing a transaction with the prospect. When a prospect has been assigned to an internal organization resource such as an account executive in one embodiment a background process may monitor certain profile information and or activity of members of a social network who are employed by the prospect. Upon detecting certain triggering events e.g. a change in a member profile that provides information to the sales organization that may lead to a sale or some other behavior such as content consumption joining or leaving a group and the like exhibited by one or more social network members employed by that prospect a notification can be communicated to the account executive with a suggestion to take some action. For instance if a member s job title changes at a prospect or if a member leaves his employment with the prospect for another employer a notification might be communicated to the account executive who has a relationship with the member. The notification might indicate some specific action that the account executive should take. This is made possible by monitoring member profiles and member activities on an online social network service.

As a general matter online social network services provide users with a mechanism for defining and memorializing in a digital format their relationships with other people. This digital representation of real world relationships is frequently referred to as a social graph. Many social network services utilize a social graph to facilitate electronic communications and the sharing of information between its users or members. For instance the relationship between two members of a social network service as defined in the social graph of the social network service may determine the access and sharing privileges that exist between the two members. As such the social graph in use by a social network service may determine the manner in which two members of the social network service can interact with one another via the various communication and sharing mechanisms supported by the social network service.

Some social network services aim to enable friends and family to communicate and share with one another while others are specifically directed to business users with a goal of facilitating the establishment of professional networks and the sharing of business information. For purposes of the present disclosure the terms social network and social network service are used in a broad sense and are meant to encompass services aimed at connecting friends and family often referred to simply as social networks as well as services that are specifically directed to enabling business people to connect and share business information also commonly referred to as social networks but sometimes referred to as business networks or professional networks .

With many social network services members are prompted to provide a variety of personal information which may be displayed in a member s personal web page. Such information is commonly referred to as personal profile information or simply profile information and when shown collectively it is commonly referred to as a member s profile. For example with some of the many social network services in use today the personal information that is commonly requested and displayed as part of a member s profile includes a member s age e.g. birth date gender contact information home town address the name of the member s spouse and or family members a photograph of the member interests and so forth. With certain social network services such as some business network services a member s personal information may include information commonly included in a professional resume or curriculum vitae such as information about a person s education employment history job skills professional organizations and so forth. With some social network services a member s profile may be viewable to the public by default or alternatively the member may specify that only some portion of the profile is to be public by default. As such many social network services serve as a sort of directory of people to be searched and browsed.

Because social network services are a rich source of information about people social network services are an extremely useful tool when performing certain tasks. For example many people use social network services to search for and or browse member profiles that exhibit various desired characteristics. For instance a person may search for persons who have profiles indicating the possession of certain technical skills and educational and professional experiences and backgrounds. Similarly when someone needs to hire a person employed in a particular profession e.g. a general contractor a doctor a lawyer a landscaper a plumber an investment banker and so forth that person may turn to a social network service to identify persons who possess the requisite skills and qualifications. In another scenario a person may desire to contact someone for the purpose of exploring or proposing the possibility of a particular business arrangement or relationship. Accordingly the person may use a social network service to identify the appropriate persons to contact.

The present disclosure describes methods systems and computer program products for inferring the hierarchy or the estimation of the hierarchy of an organization by leveraging a social graph of a social network service to identify and convey information about various connection paths and relationships between and among members as defined in or inferred from the social graph of the social network service. In addition finding of these paths are useful for sales marketing and related business support from the social graphs of members of a social network service such as a professional social network and also from the social graph of the social network service itself. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various aspects of different embodiments of the present invention. It will be evident however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without all of the specific details and or with variations permutations and combinations of the various features and elements described herein.

Consistent with embodiments of the invention some of the many tasks people commonly use a social network service to perform are improved by conveying to a user of the service specific information concerning the associations e.g. relationships and affiliations that a user or an entity on whose behalf the user is acting e.g. a company group or other organization with which the user is associated might share in common with another member of the social network service while the user is performing a particular task. Specifically the inventive concepts described herein involve techniques for analyzing a social graph to identify connection paths connecting a user or some other entity with another member of the social network service and then to present a visual representation of those connection paths that are determined to be well or best suited for a particular purpose. While social graphs used by many conventional social network services model only the relationships that exist between people embodiments of the present invention use a social graph that includes not only people but other types of entities as well. For example a social graph consistent with some embodiments of the invention may include entity types such as companies educational institutions groups and so forth. As such a connection path in the social graph that connects two members may be based on a wide variety of associations between the various entities including personal relationships between members a common employment relationship with a particular company common membership in a group and so forth.

The algorithmic processes used to identify and present the connection paths connecting a user with a target member are implemented with a combination of hardware e.g. computer processors and memory and software e.g. executable instructions that may be generally referred to herein as a pathfinder module. Furthermore the inventive concepts that are presented herein are generally applicable to a wide variety and nature of applications and tasks. However for brevity the examples of the inventive concepts described herein are primarily presented in the context of two specific types of applications including applications involving electronic or digital messaging or communication systems and techniques and applications for facilitating browsing and searching of member profiles.

Consistent with some embodiments of the invention a social network service maintains a social graph implemented as a graph data structure having nodes and edges where the nodes represent different entities and the edges represent various associations or relationships between entities. For example with some embodiments the entity types may include people companies educational institutions e.g. schools and universities and groups e.g. online groups or professional organizations among others. Accordingly the edges that connect any two nodes entities represent types of associations between the entities and will therefore depend in part on the entities involved. For example an edge connecting two nodes that represent people may be representative of a specific type of relationship between the two people including a direct bilateral connection between the two people. An edge connecting a first node representing a person with a second node representing a company may be representative of an employment relationship current or previous between the person and the company. In addition to the edges having a particular type representative of the nature of the relationship between two entities each edge connecting two entities is assigned an edge score to reflect the strength or relevance of the particular association.

Consistent with some embodiments when a user is performing a particular task the social network service e.g. specifically the pathfinder module will perform an algorithmic process to analyze the social graph and to identify the connection paths that connect a user e.g. the person performing the task or some entity specified by the user and on whose behalf the user may be acting with another member of the social network service. The connection path or paths that are determined to be strongest or most relevant with respect to the particular task being performed are then visually presented to the user providing the user with important contextual information for completing the task. For purposes of the present disclosure to distinguish the person involved in the performance of a task with those persons who may be subjects of a task the term user is used herein to identify the person who is performing a task while the terms target and or target member are used to identify a subject of the task. Similarly in the specific context of a digital messaging application the terms message sender and message recipient are used herein. While a message recipient is the member to whom a message is addressed a message sender is the user performing the task of preparing and sending a message on his or her own behalf or on behalf of an entity such as a company group or other organization.

Consistent with some embodiments of the invention for each connection path connecting a user to a target member a path score is derived to reflect the overall connection strength or relevance of the path connecting the user with the target. For example with some embodiments the path score may be derived by simply aggregating e.g. summing or otherwise combining with an algorithm or formula the individual edge scores that correspond with the edges connecting the nodes that ultimately connect the user with the target member. As described in greater detail below a variety of algorithms may be used to derive the individual edge scores for a particular edge and or edge type connecting any two nodes in the social graph. Similarly a variety of algorithms may be used to derive the path scores for the connection paths connecting a user with a target. For example with some embodiments various weighting factors may be applied to influence e.g. increase or decrease the edge score for a particular edge type e.g. the type of association existing between two nodes in the social graph based on the particular task for which the connection paths are being identified and presented. In any case once the various connection paths connecting a user or some user specified entity to a target member have been identified and ordered or ranked by path score a visual representation of the connection path having the highest path score may be presented to the user. With some embodiments a visual representation of several independent connection paths may be presented.

In the context of a messaging application and particularly a web based messaging application consistent with some embodiments of the invention when a message sender has addressed a message to another member of the social network service e.g. a message recipient the message sender is presented with a visual representation of the best connection path or paths connecting the message sender to the message recipient as determined by analysis of the social graph maintained by the social network service. With some embodiments the algorithm used to derive path scores for the various connection paths connecting the message sender to the message recipient may be selected based on an inferred type of communication or an explicitly selected type of communication. For instance with some embodiments the social network service may use machine learning techniques and or various algorithms to infer the type of communication e.g. the purpose or reason the message sender is communicating with the message recipient and then based on this information a particular algorithm for deriving the path scores may be selected. With some embodiments the message sender may explicitly select or otherwise specify the type of communication such that the selected communication type will influence the algorithm used to derive the path scores for the connection paths connecting the message sender with the message recipient. By tailoring the algorithm that may be used to derive the path scores to a specific task e.g. sending a message and or a specific context for a task e.g. a type of communication for the task of sending a message the most relevant connection path s can be presented to the user based on the task and context in which the task is being performed.

With some embodiments the visual representation of the best connection path or paths e.g. the connection path or paths with the highest path scores may be automatically embedded or otherwise included in the content of a message being prepared by the message sender. Consequently when the message recipient receives the message the message recipient can view a visual representation of the best connection path or paths connecting the message sender with the message recipient. Alternatively the connection path or paths may be presented in a manner that allows the message sender to simply reference the relevant information when the message sender is composing the message. For instance with some embodiments the visual representation of the connection path may be presented as a separate element of a graphical user interface displayed when the message sender is composing the message. Similarly the visual representation of the connection path or paths may be presented to a message recipient not as part of a received electronic message but instead as part of a separate user interface element that is presented when the message recipient is accessing and viewing the electronic message. In either case by identifying and then presenting information indicating how the message sender and message recipient are associated or related e.g. connected via the social graph the message recipient is more likely to be receptive to receiving reading and replying to the message. This is particularly advantageous in an environment where people are frequently overloaded with information and are receiving hundreds of messages per day.

With some embodiments and specifically in the context of an application that enables users to search for or otherwise browse member profiles the strongest or most relevant connection path or paths connecting the user with a target member will be presented when the user is viewing the profile of the target member. For example a user may perform a search of member profiles by specifying various desirable member attributes or characteristics. For instance a person may perform a search by specifying one or more member profile characteristics including a company at which one is employed a job title a college or university attended and one or more possessed skills. In response to the person s query the social network service may present to the person a list of members having member profile attributes or characteristics that match partially or fully the characteristics specified in the query. When the person selects a particular member from the list the person will be presented with the selected member s profile information. In addition the social network service may present a visual representation of a connection path connecting the person to the selected member where the connection path has been selected for having the highest path score of all connection paths connecting the person with the target member. Alternatively a visual representation of several individual connection paths may be presented. With some embodiments the connection path or paths may be presented automatically with the profile information of the selected member. Alternatively with some embodiments a graphical user interface element e.g. a button or link may be provided with the selected member profile such that when the person selects or otherwise interacts with the graphical user interface element the social network service will invoke the algorithmic process for identifying and presenting the connection path having the highest path score.

With some embodiments the user that is performing a search of member profiles or otherwise browsing member profiles may specify as a sort of proxy an alternative entity e.g. person company or other organization to serve as the starting or beginning node for purposes of identifying the connection paths to an identified target member. For instance if an independent party has been tasked with inferring the organization chart for a particular part of a particular company party may specify that the company be used as the starting node in the social graph of any connection paths to a particular target member. As such a pathfinder module of the social network service will attempt to identify and present connection paths connecting the specified company with the identified target member. In such a scenario the nodes forming the connection paths between the company and the target member may include entities of various types including but not limited to members who are current or past employees of the specified company other companies that are associated with the specified company and schools whose graduates are employed by the specified company.

Referring again to a messaging application consistent with some embodiments a message sender may compose a message intended for multiple message recipients. For instance a person may use the social network service to compile a list of target members to contact as potential candidates for a job opening. The person may then compose a single generic message to be sent to all the target members on the list without manually personalizing or customizing the content of the message for each individual member specified as a message recipient. In general the connection paths from the message sender the person or the company on whose behalf the person is acting to each message recipient will be different. In this scenario the pathfinder module of the social network service is automatically invoked once for each individual message recipient. With each invocation the pathfinder module will attempt to identify connection paths connecting the message sender with an individual message recipient. Upon successfully identifying one or more connection paths the message content to be communicated to a particular message recipient will automatically be modified to include a description or graphical visualization of one or more of the strongest or most relevant connection paths. In this way the messaging application can perform a mass customization operation to customize or personalize an otherwise general or generic message so that a customized or personalized instance of the message is communicated to each message recipient. In particular the customized or personalized message may include a visual representation of a connection path between the message recipient and the message sender or the message recipient and some entity on behalf of which the message is being communicated. Alternatively the message may include information identifying one or more entities in the connection path with an indication of how the message sender or the entity on whose behalf the message is being sent and the message recipient are associated. The personalization of the message to provide some social context will increase the relevance of the message to the particular message recipient.

With some embodiments in addition to presenting the user with a visual representation of the connection path with the highest path score the actual path score may be presented to the user. The path score may be normalized in some manner for easy comparison with other path scores thereby giving the user a sense of which connection paths may be best for a particular task. The path score may be conveyed on some arbitrary scale e.g. a scale of one to five with one being a low score and five being a high score or simply as a raw number. Additionally the visual representation of the connection path connecting the user with the target member may be presented in an interactive manner such that additional information about various entities and associations e.g. relationships and or affiliations may be easily obtained by the user for example by manipulating a cursor control device or interacting with a touch sensitive display to select or hover over various user interface elements included in the visual representation of the connection path.

With some embodiments various user interface controls may be presented with the visual representation of the connection path thereby allowing the user to very quickly navigate or cycle through the many connection paths connecting the user with the target member or filter and or sort the connection paths based on various connection path parameters. For example by selecting a particular button or link associated with a navigation control the view of the visual representation of the connection path with the highest path score may be replaced with a view of a visual representation of the connection path with the second highest path score. With some embodiments user interface controls may be presented to enable the user to filter and or sort connection paths based on certain entities entity types edge types and or any combinations thereof. For instance a filtering mechanism may allow the user to select for presentation only those connection paths that include a particular type of entity e.g. a person a company a school or university or a group or even a particular entity e.g. all connection paths including a specific entity such as the person John Smith or a specific educational institution such as Stanford University . Similarly the filtering mechanism may enable the user to identify a particular entity to be excluded from all connection paths such that only those connection paths that do not include the selected entity will be presented to the user. With some embodiments the filtering mechanism may enable the user to specify various requirements concerning the number of nodes in a connection path such as a maximum minimum or exact number of nodes separating the user with the target member. For instance the user may desire to view a visual representation of all connection paths between the user and a target member where the number of nodes between the user and the target member is two or less. Accordingly the pathfinder module will select for presentation only those connection paths satisfying the specified requirements and will generally present the selected connection paths in an order with the connection path having the highest path score presented first. Additionally with some embodiments various controls may allow the user to explicitly select other connection path parameters that influence the algorithm used to derive the path scores for the connection paths. Further detail about the technological operation of social networks useful in embodiments hereof may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 430 284 entitled Leveraging a Social Graph for use with Electronic Messaging assigned to the assignee of this patent and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Various embodiments of the inventive subject matter presented herein provide the aforementioned features and advantages as well as other advantages which will be readily apparent from the following description of the various figures.

As shown in the front end consists of a user interface module e.g. a web server which receives requests from various client computing devices and communicates appropriate responses to the requesting client devices. For example the user interface module s may receive requests in the form of Hypertext Transport Protocol HTTP requests or other web based application programming interface API requests. The client devices not shown may be executing conventional web browser applications or applications that have been developed for a specific platform to include any of a wide variety of mobile devices and operating systems.

As shown in the data layer includes several databases including databases for storing data for various entities of the social graph including member profiles company profiles educational institution profiles as well as information concerning various online or offline groups . In addition the graph data structure is implemented with a graph database which is a particular type of database that uses graph structures with nodes edges and properties to represent and store data. Of course with various alternative embodiments any number of other entities might be included in the social graph and as such various other databases may be used to store data corresponding with other entities.

Consistent with some embodiments when a person initially registers to become a member of the social network service the person will be prompted to provide some personal information such as his or her name age e.g. birth date gender interests contact information home town address the names of the member s spouse and or family members educational background e.g. schools majors etc. current job title job description industry employment history skills professional organizations and so on. This information is stored for example in the database with reference number .

Once registered a member may invite other members or be invited by other members to connect via the social network service. A connection may require a bi lateral agreement by the members such that both members acknowledge the establishment of the connection. Similarly with some embodiments a member may elect to follow another member. In contrast to establishing a connection the concept of following another member typically is a unilateral operation and at least with some embodiments does not require acknowledgement or approval by the member that is being followed. When one member follows another the member who is following may receive automatic notifications about various activities undertaken by the member being followed. In addition to following another member a user may elect to follow a company a topic a conversation or some other entity which may or may not be included in the social graph. Various other types of relationships that may exist between different entities and represented in the social graph data are described in connection with .

The social network service may provide a broad range of other applications and services that allow members the opportunity to share and receive information often customized to the interests of the member. For example with some embodiments the social network service may include a photo sharing application that allows members to upload and share photos with other members. As such at least with some embodiments a photograph may be a property or entity included within a social graph. With some embodiments members of a social network service may be able to self organize into groups or interest groups organized around a subject matter or topic of interest. Accordingly the data for a group may be stored in database . When a member joins a group his or her membership in the group will be reflected in the social graph data stored in the database with reference number . With some embodiments members may subscribe to or join groups affiliated with one or more companies. For instance with some embodiments members of the social network service may indicate an affiliation with a company at which they are employed such that news and events pertaining to the company are automatically communicated to the members. With some embodiments members may be allowed to subscribe to receive information concerning companies other than the company with which they are employed. Here again membership in a group a subscription or following relationship with a company or group as well as an employment relationship with a company are all examples of the different types of relationships that may exist between different entities as defined by the social graph and modeled with the social graph data of the database with reference number .

The application logic layer includes various application server modules which in conjunction with the user interface module s generates various user interfaces e.g. web pages with data retrieved from various data sources in the data layer. With some embodiments individual application server modules are used to implement the functionality associated with various applications services and features of the social network service. For instance a messaging application such as an email application an instant messaging application or some hybrid or variation of the two may be implemented with one or more application server modules . Similarly a search engine enabling users to search for and browse member profiles may be implemented with one or more application server modules . Of course other applications or services that utilize the pathfinder module may be separately embodied in their own application server modules .

In addition to the various application server modules the application logic layer includes the pathfinder module . As illustrated in with some embodiments the pathfinder module is implemented as a service that operates in conjunction with various application server modules . For instance any number of individual application server modules can invoke the functionality of the pathfinder module to include an application server module associated with a messaging application and or an application server module associated with an application to facilitate the viewing of member profiles. However with various alternative embodiments the pathfinder module may be implemented as its own application server module such that it operates as a stand alone application. With some embodiments the pathfinder module may include or have an associated publicly available application programming interface API that enables third party applications to invoke the functionality of the pathfinder module.

Generally the pathfinder module takes as input parameters that at a minimum identify two different nodes corresponding with two entities e.g. two persons or a person and a company etc. in a social graph that is implemented with a graph data structure e.g. social graph data . Using the input parameters the pathfinder module analyses the social graph data to identify the connection paths in the social graph that connect the two entities if any exist. With some embodiments additional input parameters may be provided to the pathfinder module and used to refine the connection paths selected for potential presentation to the user. These parameters include for example filtering criterion to include or exclude connection paths having particular entities or particular entity types or specific edge types. Once the set of connection paths satisfying the input parameters has been identified the pathfinder module derives a path score for each connection path for example by aggregating the individual edge scores for the edges that connect the different nodes included in the connection paths. Finally the pathfinder module provides the information corresponding with the connection paths to the application that invoked the pathfinder module so that a visual representation of one or more connection paths can be presented to the user.

The pathfinder module can be invoked from a wide variety of applications. In the context of a messaging application e.g. email application instant messaging application or some similar application the pathfinder module may be invoked to provide a message sender with a visual representation of a connection path between the message sender and a person to whom the message sender has addressed a message e.g. the message recipient . Similarly the pathfinder module may be invoked to provide a message sender with a visual representation of a connection path connecting an entity on whose behalf the message sender is acting e.g. company group or other organization with a message recipient. An example of such an embodiment of the invention is illustrated and described in connection with . In the context of an application that allows one to browse member profiles the pathfinder module may be invoked to present to the viewing user a connection path from the user to a target member whose profile is being viewed by the user. An example of such an embodiment of the invention is illustrated and described in connection with .

Referring to the table with reference number illustrates a non exhaustive list of associations that may be attributed to an edge connecting two nodes representing entities in the social graph data structure. Various edge types or associations may be applicable to all combinations of entity types while others may be applicable to only a certain subset of combinations of entity types. For example an edge type representing a following relationship may connect two nodes where each node represents a person and the edge connecting the two nodes indicates that one person is following the other. Similarly an edge representing a following relationship may connect a first node representing a person with a second node representing a company to indicate that the person is following the company. Accordingly the edge type for a following relationship applies to the entity type person as well as company. Some other associations are only meaningful when applied to an edge connecting certain types of entities.

Some of the various associations or edge types shown in indicate a particular relationship that exists between two entities represented by nodes in the graph data structure. For instance two members of the social network service may be directly connected one member may be following another one member may be in an address book or contacts list of another two members may be co managing a group or co inventors on a patent and so forth. In each of these examples the association or edge type is assigned to the edge connecting the two nodes representing the two entities e.g. person company educational institution group etc. 

Some of the various associations or edge types shown in indicate an activity that is shared in common between two entities or an activity that involves two entities. For example a first member may have communicated a message to a second member. A first member may have re tweeted or forwarded some content item e.g. a tweet that was originally generated by a second member. A first member may share an item of content with a second member or comment on an item of content posted by a second member and so forth.

A third category of associations generally involves what may be thought of as affiliations. For example a member may be affiliated with a company based on current or past employment at the company. A member may be affiliated with an educational institution based on current or past attendance as a student. A member may be affiliated with an online group based on membership in the group.

Another general category of associations or edge types involves what are referred to herein as affinities. For instance two members may be associated based on an affinity or similarity of profile attributes such as the same general geographic location skills shared in common employment in the same industry common degrees or majors etc. The various associations or edge types that may be assigned to an edge connecting two nodes in a graph data structure presented in are simply some of the many examples. In various alternative embodiments of the invention different associations not shown in may also be used particularly with embodiments of the invention that have additional entity types other than the specific examples presented herein e.g. person company educational institution group .

Referring again to there is an edge connecting Jane Smith to ACME Products Inc. which represents Jane s affiliation with ACME Products Inc. as the executive chairman and founder of the company. The score or weight assigned to this edge indicates the strength of this affiliation. For example with some embodiments the weight can be computed based on the overlap between Jane s network and the network of ACME Products Inc. where the node in the social graph representing ACME Products Inc. is connected to each member who is a current or former employee of the company. That is for a member M1 and a company C1 W M1 C1 Conn M1 C1 SQRT Conn M1 Conn C1 where W M1 C1 denotes the weight of the edge connecting M1 and C1 Conn M1 C1 denotes the number of members M1 is connected to who are also current or past employees of C1 Conn M1 denotes the total number of connections in M1 s network and Conn C1 denotes the total number of members who are current or past employees of C1. Similarly there is an edge connecting Jane Smith to State University which represents Jane s affiliation with State University as an alumnus of the university. The weight of this edge indicates the strength of this affiliation. For example the weight of an edge connecting a member M1 and a school S1 could be computed as W M1 S1 Conn M1 S1 Conn M1 where Conn M1 S1 denotes the number of members M1 is connected to who are also students or alumni of S1 and Conn M1 denotes the total number of member connections in M1 s network.

There is an edge connecting ACME Products Inc. with Widget Corp. which represents the association between the two companies. An association between two companies can exist for a variety of reasons for example if they share a common founder if some members of the social network service have been employed at both companies if one company is a subsidiary of the other or if the two companies are business partners. In this particular example ACME Products Inc. and Widget Corp. are connected because a large number of former Widget Corp. employees are currently employed with ACME Products Inc. The weight of the edge denotes the strength of the association. For example the weight of an edge connecting two companies C1 and C2 could be computed as W C1 C2 Conn C1 C2 SQRT Conn C1 Conn C2 where Conn C1 C2 denotes the number of members who have worked at both C1 and C2 and Conn C1 and Conn C2 denote the number of members who have worked at C1 and C2 respectively. Similarly there is an edge connecting ACME Products Inc. with State University which represents the association between the company and the school. This association can exist for a variety of reasons for example if graduates of the school or students at the school are employed by the company. Again the weight assigned to the edge indicates the strength of the association. For example the weight of an edge connecting a company C1 with a school S1 could be computed as W C1 S1 Conn C1 S1 SQRT Conn C1 Conn S1 where Conn C1 S1 denotes the number of members employed by company C1 who attend or have attended school S1 Conn C1 denotes the number of members employed by C1 and Conn S1 denotes the total number of members who attend or have attended S1.

In the example connection path with reference number the user represented by the node with reference number is directly connected to the member Fred Jones represented by the node with reference number . In turn Fred Jones is an employee of the same company e.g. ACME Products Inc. represented by the node with reference number at which the target member John Doe node with reference number is employed. Accordingly this example connection path involves two different node types e.g. a person and a company and two different edge types e.g. a direct connection and an employment relationship .

Given the various associations that may exist between entities for example as set forth in the table of it is readily apparent that in many instances there may be a significant number of connection paths connecting two persons or an entity e.g. a company with a person such that one or more of the connection paths may not be obvious or immediately apparent to the user. Furthermore as these two different example connection paths and make apparent the entity and edge types or associations involved in a particular connection path will often make one connection path more relevant with respect to a particular task or objective than another connection path. Accordingly with some embodiments of the invention after identifying a set of connection paths connecting a user with a target member or a user specified entity with a target member the pathfinder module will generate a path score for each connection path identified. With some embodiments the path score for each individual connection path will be dependent upon the individual edge scores assigned to the edges connecting the nodes in the connection path. With some embodiments of the invention different algorithms may be automatically used to derive path scores for different applications or tasks. The particular algorithm used to derive the path score may be automatically and dynamically selected for example based on a determination of what the user is attempting to achieve. Alternatively with some embodiments the user may make an explicit selection e.g. by specifying a type or category of message or a purpose for contacting someone which will then influence the algorithm used to derive the path scores. Consequently the edge scores or weights for different edge types may be derived differently for example to increase or decrease the influence of edge scores of certain types of edges on the path score depending upon the particular application that has invoked the pathfinder module or a particular task or process being undertaken or performed.

With some embodiments the application invoking the pathfinder module may filter the connection paths output by the pathfinder module or modify the scores or ordering of the connection paths by using additional methods or algorithms that customize the output of the pathfinder module for the needs of the particular application. For example an application that identifies intermediate members in a social network who may be able to introduce the user to a target member could adjust the scores of the intermediate members based on data concerning the historical or past activities undertaken by those members within the context of the social network service.

The presentation of the visual representation of the connection path or paths can vary significantly from one application to the next and from one embodiment of the invention to the next. Without any intent to limit the scope of what is claimed present various examples of user interfaces that convey a visual representation of connection paths in a social graph connecting a user with a target member consistent with some embodiments of the invention. These example user interfaces represent user interface elements that might be used in any type of application to present contextual information concerning a connection path between a user and another member of a social network service.

As illustrated in the example user interface shows a visual representation of three different connection paths having an equal number of nodes e.g. entities and the same type of edges e.g. association . Specifically in this example the user represented by YOU has seven direct connections e.g. person to person relationships established via the social network service that are also directly connected to the target member . Of those seven connections three are visually presented in the user interface element while the other four are accessible to the user via the button or link corresponding with the text SEE 4 MORE. With some embodiments when multiple connection paths exist with the same number of nodes and the same edge types all or a specific subset of the connection paths may be presented in parallel as shown in . Generally the order in which the connection paths are presented will be dependent upon the connection strength as indicated by the path score derived for the various connection paths. For instance in the example of the connection path including the node with reference number is presumed to be a stronger or more relevant connection path than the connection path including the node with reference number or the connection path including the node with reference number for the same reason i.e. given the order in which the connection path with node is presented.

While the connection paths associated with the user interface element of involve a direct connection as an edge type the visual representation of the connection paths corresponding with involve an employment relationship with a company. Specifically the user interface element shown in indicates that the user represented by the point with reference number has three people in his broader network e.g. within the social graph who are connected to the target member and who were at one time or another employed with the same company at which the user and the target member e.g. Peter Quick with reference number were at one time employed. In this example the company e.g. Support Soft. is represented by the user interface element with reference number while the individual members and thus the separate connection paths are represented by the user interface elements with reference numbers and . In this particular example as indicated by the textual descriptions positioned next to each user interface element that corresponds with a node from the social graph the members forming the connection path to the target member are second level or second degree connections of the user . With some embodiments the user may interact with the individual user interface elements for example by manipulating a cursor control device or interacting with a touch sensitive display to select or hover over a user interface element causing additional information to be presented. The additional information may include information concerning the various first level or first degree connections who the user shares in common with the members represented by the user interface elements with reference numbers and forming the connection paths with the target member as shown in .

The particular user interfaces shown in are simply examples of how a connection path may be conveyed in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. The particular examples might be used as a portion of a user interface for any number of different applications. Other embodiments of the invention may use visual representations of the connection path that differ from those shown in . Specifically with some embodiments a visual representation of a connection path may not include any parallel paths but instead each individual connection path may be shown as a series of nodes representing different entities. With some embodiments only a subset of the nodes in a particular connection path may be visually represented. Alternatively with some embodiments each and every node in a connection path is included in the visual representation.

Although discussed herein in terms of a method the same discussion may be made in terms of a system and of an article of manufacture. As used herein the term internal is applied to organizations such as a sales organization and may also include distributors for the organization who while not technically internal to the organization may in some instances be considered as internal resources. Further the terms prospective account and account may be used interchangeably herein. Likewise representative and account executive may also be used interchangeably herein. Further still while representative and account executive have the connotation of members in a sales organization this is used merely as one example. Other embodiments would naturally be applicable to service and support representatives as well and the prioritization activities discussed here may also scale into marketing as well.

Business organizations have limited resources and seek ways to determine how best to use those resources. Sales organizations desire to determine the best prospects to sell to and when to sell to them. Also given a set of internal resources available to an organization and given an available number of things that those resources can focus on the question arises how to prioritize the available leads or customers viewed as external contacts and then to which resources internal to the sales organization should the external contacts be allocated or assigned. This may be viewed in one embodiment as how best to manage sales staff which may be a group of people that are focused on marketing and sales and their function in order to maximize their impact in a broad way. An embodiment may prioritize companies by ranking them by prospective spend on a given product or on a given matter perhaps in a descending order of prospective spend. Further since it is people who purchase the embodiment may also in addition to ranking companies by spending propensity determine what person or persons at a prospect may influence the execution of a given matter such as a person who would decide whether to make a purchase. This influencer would be the person a sales organization would generally like to contact. Such an influencer may be determined by searching the social network profiles and social graphs of persons employed by the company who are members of the social network service. Further the social graph of the social network itself may be used in the prioritization. As one example if the profile of the member indicates that the member is the Chief Marketing Officer at the company that person is highly likely to be an influencer. In one embodiment this may be determined by searching the titles of the profiles of the members. Stated another way it is desirable to find which person employed at an account is either going to be a key influencer or is going to be the actual decision maker the terms key influencer and decision maker may be used interchangeably herein that can decide to execute a particular sale as quickly as possible. Embodiments herein may use of a mix of profile data engagement or social graph activity or social network data to determine a person s influence on a particular matter. In some embodiments social graph activity may be detected by determining emails between members such as by using the email application discussed above. These social graph data profile data and social network activity may be combined together to create a way to rank external people at the prospective account who are members of the social network to be used for contacts and to rank internal people at the sales organization who are also members of a social network to assign contacts to or for help in establishing contacts or for introductions to contacts. The social network service itself may be the employer of the sales organization using member profiles member social graph activity and the social graph of the social network service itself for prioritization that may lead to making sales. In addition a sales organization that is separate from a social network service may use the social network service for the foregoing sales purposes. Embodiments herein may help determine which companies to approach which people at those companies to approach and which people internal to the sales organization are best suited to approach those people.

As examples of using the above method a sales organization may have several businesses it sells through. One example may be a hiring solutions business which sells recruiting solutions 

another may be a marketing solutions business which sells ads and related items another may be a sales solutions business that sells products to sales people for helping to make sales. In each case there are usually corporate buyers and the embodiments herein may be used to find corporate decision makers who have buying power or who influence buying power who can write a meaningful sized check for a sale.

As an example a law firm may want to market to general counsel of corporations around the web. A sales organization may market a product that can find corporate general counsel for law firm marketing purposes. One way this may be performed is to approach the law firm offering to sell or more appropriately to license an advertising product that can find corporate general counsel for that law firm. The method may prioritize to find the person in the law firm who is in charge of marketing the law firm s legal services such as the firm s Chief Marketing Officer CMO which may be viewed as an external prioritization. Having found the CMO the determination may be made which person on the sales team is most suited to approach the law firm CMO. This may be viewed as an internal prioritization. This internal prioritization may be based for example on the fact that a person on the sales team may have a law degree or that a person is connected to five lawyers on a social network service which indicates a social proximity that may enable the person to be likely to be a good or perhaps even an optimal person to interface with lawyers. A map may be constructed between the external prioritization and the internal prioritization. This prioritization may be integrated into the sales organizations customer relations management software as a ranking score for use in one embodiment at the beginning of each year or at other times for individual sales representatives to obtain needed sales prospect information.

In one embodiment implementing external prioritization provides estimates in U.S. dollars of how much an account could spend annually with a sales organization on products offered by that organization. This may be based upon the behavior of the sales organization customers of recruiting products as determined by social network activity of employees of an account as discussed above in this patent. As only one example using data of a social network service scoring of accounts may be based on three factors. One may be the number of employees who joined the account from a different organization in a given time period. A second may be how many employees of the account serve a recruiting related role as indicated by coding titles such as recruiting talent and the like in the social network service s data from member profiles. A third may be determining which industries have the highest usage of the social network service and which industries the sales organization has penetrated historically.

The sales organization may determine a procedure to translate number of hires number of recruiters and the number of members in a social network to a dollar amount in order to rank prospective accounts by prospective spend. For example a dollar multiplier may be placed on the number of hires where the multiplier may depend upon the historical dollar volume of the account which the sales organization has in its database the number of recruiters and the number of members. The multiplier depends on the sales organization. As an example Company A makes one hundred 100 hires per year has twenty 20 recruiters and has one thousand 1000 members on the social network which data is available on the social network service. The sales organization may believe each hire in Company A is valued for sales purposes at 1000 and that company A s prospective spend is therefore 100 000. In this example there are five 5 hires for every recruiter. The ratio is 5 1. As another example Company B makes one hundred 100 hires per year has two 2 recruiters and has one thousand 1000 members on the social network. The sales organization believes each hire in Company B is valued at 750 and that the company s prospective spend is 75 000. Company B has only two 2 recruiters versus twenty 20 recruiters for Company A and therefore the sales organization may believe Company B is less lucrative than Company A and may marshal its resources accordingly.

A screenshot of a user interface displaying prioritization is illustrated in where companies have been prioritized by prospective spend. As can be seen ID 1680 the company Cognizant Technology Solutions is prioritized as first. The Company s number of hires 6 143 number of members on the social network 52 599 and number of recruiters 200 are used in a calculation as discussed above ranking the estimated value prospective spend as 2 276 513. The other companies are prioritized accordingly with 1 3 Communications ranked next at and so on. Again these numbers are found by path finding the social graph of the social network organization and of the members as discussed above and the prospective spend may be calculated from these numbers in a manner similar to that discussed.

As a further operation in the method it is desirable to find which person employed at an account is either going to be a key influencer or is going to be the actual decision maker that can decide to execute this sale as quickly as possible. As discussed previously this may be accomplished by using social graph data profile data and the relationship and engagement among members of the above social network service as discussed above in this patent. The key decision maker or influencer may be based upon titles of the account members on the social network and also their engagement with the sales organization. This may identify the person who is the optimum or a highly effective entry to the account. is a screen shot that shows how these results may look. In this example a sales organization wishes to sell to LinkedIn and the results show the rank ordered list of people the sales organization believes it should call in a prospective client hypothetically LinkedIn in order to sell recruiting products. The same type of result would occur for other companies used as an example of the company that is being sold to. This may vary based on the weight given to factors such as connectedness and influence in a particular embodiment. If greater weight is given to influence in an embodiment Jeff Wang who is Head of Organization and Staffing APAC would be the key person in this example because his influence and engagement is judged to be higher and he is likely to have a higher likelihood for being key to closing the particular deal. If on the other hand more weight is given to connectedness Patrick Cronin would be the key person given his higher number of connections.

Determining the organization chart of the company or determining titles of members may find the critical person for use in a user interface such as above. Determining an organization chart may be accomplished as discussed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 756 142 filed Jan. 31 2013 entitled Techniques for Inferring an Organizational Hierarchy from a Social Graph assigned to the assignee of the present patent and incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The foregoing discussion relating to evaluating prospective spends and determining a key influencer at the prospective account may be viewed as external ranking. The method may then perform internal ranking to rank internal personnel at the sales organization who may be the best persons to approach the account or to help the assigned representative approach the account. This may be done by determining who from the sales organization has in one embodiment first or second degree connections to the account. This may be viewed as a social proximity which may be derived from the social network service that has employees of the account and employees of the sales organization as members. The social proximity may be used to assign the best or an optimum account executive in the sales organization to the account. This may be done by calculating a proximity score by measuring how connected an account executive is to a company via first and second degree connections on the social network service. This may be focused on the connections to persons at the account. First degree connections may be given higher weighting than second degree connections due to the difference in closeness of the two types of connections with the high social proximity accounts then assigned to the most connected account executive. Alternatively social proximity may be based on influence. In the first degree and second degree social network service connections and respectively between a sales organization account executive and certain high level employees of a prospective account are shown. In this example each internal sales person s overall influence on each of the external accounts may be calculated using a summary of SSI score in an effort to assign sales people to the right accounts. An embodiment may give more weight indicated at as percent of the score to first degree connection relationships between an account executive and the more senior contacts at a target company for example Vice Presidents . Relationships that are second degree connection relationships or where the contact is less senior e.g. an individual contributor who is less likely to have less influence on a buying decision may be given less weight . Further not shown in social proximity may also be measured not only on explicit connections such as connections between two members of the social network but also on inferred connections based on overlaps in experience between two members of the social network. Similarly social proximity may be measured based on the number of common connections of two members with another member. All of this may be found by interrogating the profiles and social graphs of the members of the social network. The result in some instances may be that an account might be allocated not to the member with the highest score but the allocation would be one that maximizes social proximity overall.

If the prioritization function discussed above were static with no provision to alert sales representatives to hiring activity changes or real time personnel movement in accounts and the like sales representatives may miss important events in their accounts. One such event may be that a key decision maker switched from one account to another account or that four former users of a particular product now work at the representative s account or the account may have doubled hiring in the last three months. Similarly the representative may not be calling on the account at the right times. For example is there a hiring cycle to track at the account Is there a budget cycle Is the account posting new jobs or buying a product that indicates they are hiring. Is the account s usage of or impact on the social network service increasing or dropping To stay fully cognizant of accounts and determine an appropriate time or manner to make a call representatives need to constantly rerun searches and or interrogations such as those discussed above to learn some of the foregoing information which is inefficient. However social network and customer relations management software include data sources that are dynamic and constantly updating to create new potentially relevant signals every day. Therefore an event based account management tool can be implemented that will offer real time insight alerts or triggers to enable trigger based selling and increase representative effectiveness. A goal might be that representatives learn of relevant updates and adapt sales approaches accordingly. The event based account management tool using the social network may be adapted to sync directly with a priority framework that may be used by the sales organization such as that framework illustrated in which illustrates the prioritization ranking similar to that of with alerts of which may be viewed as being triggers displayed in real or nearly real time. illustrates one embodiment in which triggers are provided in four categories although one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that more or fewer categories may be provided. In four categories include people updates such as a decision maker joining or leaving a company as at a former recruiter joining a company as at or a prospect downloads a white paper or attends a marketing event as at . Each of these may be recorded as an event on the social network service and can be detected as triggers in nearly real time by searching member profiles in the social network. In this embodiment detecting one of the above events may be inserted as triggers in . The trigger types illustrated on are People Updates Company Updates Product Purchases and Product Usage and may be provided by detecting them among profiles or actions of members who are employed by accounts or potential accounts on the social network service. Further the triggers may be centralized into a sortable list and prioritized based on the magnitude and importance of the account to a particular representative. The triggers may also be speeded up by feeding them to the sales organizations customer relations management system again resulting in the user interface of .
