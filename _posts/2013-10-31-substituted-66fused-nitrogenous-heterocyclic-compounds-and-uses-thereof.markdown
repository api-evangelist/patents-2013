The present invention relates to organic compounds useful for therapy and or prophylaxis in a mammal and in particular to inhibitors of Abl tyrosine kinases e.g. c Abl ABL1 v Abl and related tyrosine kinases e.g. Abl related gene ABL2 that are useful for treating diseases and disorders that result from over activation of Abl tyrosine kinase.

The Abl family of non receptor kinases contain as key members c Abl and Arg. c Abl is ubiquitously expressed in mammals and is found localized at many subcellular sites including the nucleus cytoplasm mitochondria the endoplasmic reticulum and the cell corex where c Abl interacts with a large variety of cellular proteins including signaling adaptors kinases phosphatases cell cycle regulators transcription factors and cytoskeleton proteins. The function of c Abl in regulating cell growth is well established. Oncogenetically activated c Abl kinase has been implicated to play a role in the progression of hematopoetic malignancies and solid tumor cancers. Additionally it has also been shown that c Abl functions in the development and regeneration of the nervous system. In the brain c Abl is involved in neuronal plasticity neurite outgrowth and neurogenesis. Overactivation or undesired activation of c Abl can also play a role in neurological disorders including but not limited to Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease Pick s disease Niemann Pick s disease among others. In view of the above it is desirable to have small molecule inhibitors of Abl and or Abl related kinases that can be used to treat diseases wherein aberrant Abl and or Abl related kinase activity is observed such as for example in cancer and in neurodegenerative diseases and or disorders.

 Enantiomers refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non superimposable mirror images of one another.

As used herein the phrase aliphatic and aromatic portions when used to described portions of a group e.g. a Rgroup on a compound formula that may be substituted with specified substituents is meant to include all portions of such group including all non aromatic and aromatic portions fo the group.

Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker Ed. McGraw Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms 1984 McGraw Hill Book Company New York and Eliel E. and Wilen S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1994. The compounds of the invention can contain asymmetric or chiral centers and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention including but not limited to diastereomers enantiomers and atropisomers as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms i.e. they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane polarized light. In describing an optically active compound the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center s . The prefixes d and l or and are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane polarized light by the compound with or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer can also be referred to as an enantiomer and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50 50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate which can occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms racemic mixture and racemate refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species devoid of optical activity.

As used herein the term tautomer or tautomeric form refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example proton tautomers also known as prototropic tautomers include interconversions via migration of a proton such as keto enol and imine enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.

As used herein the term solvate refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound of the invention. Examples of solvents that form solvates include but are not limited to water isopropanol ethanol methanol DMSO ethyl acetate acetic acid and ethanolamine. The term hydrate refers to the complex where the solvent molecule is water.

As used herein the term protecting group refers to a substituent that is commonly employed to block or protect a particular functional group on a compound. For example an amino protecting group is a substituent attached to an amino group that blocks or protects the amino functionality in the compound. Suitable amino protecting groups include acetyl trifluoroacetyl t butoxycarbonyl BOC benzyloxycarbonyl CBZ and 9 fluorenylmethylenoxycarbonyl Fmoc . Similarly a hydroxy protecting group refers to a substituent of a hydroxy group that blocks or protects the hydroxy functionality. Suitable protecting groups include acetyl and silyl. A carboxy protecting group refers to a substituent of the carboxy group that blocks or protects the carboxy functionality. Common carboxy protecting groups include phenylsulfonylethyl cyanoethyl 2 trimethylsilyl ethyl 2 trimethylsilyl ethoxymethyl 2 p toluenesulfonyl ethyl 2 p nitrophenylsulfenyl ethyl 2 diphenylphosphino ethyl nitroethyl and the like. For a general description of protecting groups and their use see P. G. M. Wuts and T. W. Greene Greene s Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 4edition Wiley Interscience New York 2006.

As used herein the term mammal includes but is not limited to humans mice rats guinea pigs monkeys dogs cats horses cows pigs and sheep

As used herein the term pharmaceutically acceptable salts is meant to include salts of the active compounds which are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases depending on the particular substituents found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively acidic functionalities base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired base either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic bases include aluminum ammonium calcium copper ferric ferrous lithium magnesium manganic manganous potassium sodium zinc and the like. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic bases include salts of primary secondary and tertiary amines including substituted amines cyclic amines naturally occurring amines and the like such as arginine betaine caffeine choline N N dibenzylethylenediamine diethylamine 2 diethylaminoethanol 2 dimethylaminoethanol ethanolamine ethylenediamine N ethylmorpholine N ethylpiperidine glucamine glucosamine histidine hydrabamine isopropylamine lysine methylglucamine morpholine piperazine piperidine polyamine resins procaine purines theobromine triethylamine trimethylamine tripropylamine tromethamine and the like. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively basic functionalities acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric hydrobromic nitric carbonic monohydrogencarbonic phosphoric monohydrogenphosphoric dihydrogenphosphoric sulfuric monohydrogensulfuric hydriodic or phosphorous acids and the like as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic propionic isobutyric malonic benzoic succinic suberic fumaric mandelic phthalic benzenesulfonic p tolylsulfonic citric tartaric methanesulfonic and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like see for example Berge S. M. et al. Pharmaceutical Salts Journal of Pharmaceutical Science 1977 66 1 19 . Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.

The neutral forms of the compounds can be regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties such as solubility in polar solvents but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the compound for the purposes of the present invention.

In addition to salt forms the present invention provides compounds which are in a prodrug form. As used herein the term prodrug refers to those compounds that readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the present invention. Additionally prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the present invention by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example prodrugs can be slowly converted to the compounds of the present invention when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent.

Prodrugs of the invention include compounds wherein an amino acid residue or a polypeptide chain of two or more e.g. two three or four amino acid residues is covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of a compound of the present invention. The amino acid residues include but are not limited to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated by three letter symbols and also includes phosphoserine phosphothreonine phosphotyrosine 4 hydroxyproline hydroxylysine demosine isodemosine gamma carboxyglutamate hippuric acid octahydroindole 2 carboxylic acid statine 1 2 3 4 tetrahydroisoquinoline 3 carboxylic acid penicillamine ornithine 3 methylhistidine norvaline beta alanine gamma aminobutyric acid citrulline homocysteine homoserine methyl alanine para benzoylphenylalanine phenylglycine propargylglycine sarcosine methionine sulfone and tert butylglycine.

Additional types of prodrugs are also encompassed. For instance a free carboxyl group of a compound of the invention can be derivatized as an amide or alkyl ester. As another example compounds of this invention comprising free hydroxy groups can be derivatized as prodrugs by converting the hydroxy group into a group such as but not limited to a phosphate ester hemisuccinate dimethylaminoacetate or phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyl group as outlined in Fleisher D. et al. 1996 Improved oral drug delivery solubility limitations overcome by the use of prodrugs Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 19 115. Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino groups are also included as are carbonate prodrugs sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as acyloxy methyl and acyloxy ethyl ethers wherein the acyl group can be an alkyl ester optionally substituted with groups including but not limited to ether amine and carboxylic acid functionalities or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above are also encompassed. Prodrugs of this type are described in J. Med. Chem. 1996 39 10. More specific examples include replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as C alkanoyloxymethyl 1 C alkanoyloxy ethyl 1 methyl 1 C alkanoyloxy ethyl C alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl N C alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl succinoyl C alkanoyl alpha amino C alkanoyl arylacyl and alpha aminoacyl or alpha aminoacyl alpha aminoacyl where each alpha aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L amino acids P O OH P O O C alkyl or glycosyl the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate .

Bull. 32 692 1984 each of which is specifically incorporated herein by reference.

Additionally the present invention provides for metabolites of compounds of the invention. As used herein a metabolite refers to a product produced through metabolism in the body of a specified compound or salt thereof. Such products can result for example from the oxidation reduction hydrolysis amidation deamidation esterification deesterification enzymatic cleavage and the like of the administered compound.

Metabolite products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabelled e.g. C or H isotope of a compound of the invention administering it parenterally in a detectable dose e.g. greater than about 0.5 mg kg to an animal such as rat mouse guinea pig monkey or to man allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours and isolating its conversion products from the urine blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite . The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion e.g. by MS LC MS or NMR analysis. In general analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well known to those skilled in the art. The metabolite products so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the compounds of the invention.

Techniques and formulations generally are found in Remington The Science and Practice of Pharmacy Remington the Science and Practice of Pharmacy 2005 21Edition Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients.

In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers diluents or excipients or finely divided solid carriers diluents or excipients or both and then if necessary shaping the product. A typical formulation is prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention and a carrier diluent or excipient. The formulations can be prepared using conventional dissolution and mixing procedures. For example the bulk drug substance i.e. compound of the present invention or stabilized form of the compound e.g. complex with a cyclodextrin derivative or other known complexation agent is dissolved in a suitable solvent in the presence of one or more of the excipients described above. A compound of the present invention is typically formulated into pharmaceutical dosage forms to provide an easily controllable dosage of the drug and to enable patient compliance with the prescribed regimen.

In one example compounds of Formula I may be formulated by mixing at ambient temperature at the appropriate pH and at the desired degree of purity with physiologically acceptable carriers i.e. carriers that are non toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed into a galenical administration form. The pH of the formulation depends mainly on the particular use and the concentration of compound but preferably ranges anywhere from about 3 to about 8. In one example a compound of Formula I is formulated in an acetate buffer at pH 5. In another embodiment the compounds of Formula I are sterile.

Formulations of a compound of the invention e.g. compound of Formula I suitable for oral administration can be prepared as discrete units such as pills capsules cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of the invention.

Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules optionally mixed with a binder lubricant inert diluent preservative surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets can optionally be coated or scored and optionally are formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therefrom.

Tablets troches lozenges aqueous or oil suspensions dispersible powders or granules emulsions hard or soft capsules e.g. gelatin capsules syrups or elixirs can be prepared for oral use. Formulations of a compound of the invention e.g. compound of Formula I intended for oral use can be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions can contain one or more agents including sweetening agents flavoring agents coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide a palatable preparation. Tablets containing the active ingredient in admixture with non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipient which are suitable for manufacture of tablets are acceptable. These excipients can be for example inert diluents such as calcium or sodium carbonate lactose calcium or sodium phosphate granulating and disintegrating agents such as maize starch or alginic acid binding agents such as starch gelatin or acacia and lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate stearic acid or talc. Tablets can be uncoated or can be coated by known techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax can be employed.

An example of a suitable oral administration form is a tablet containing about 1 mg 5 mg 10 mg 25 mg 30 mg 50 mg 80 mg 100 mg 150 mg 250 mg 300 mg and 500 mg of the compound of the invention compounded with about 90 30 mg anhydrous lactose about 5 40 mg sodium croscarmellose about 5 30 mg polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP K30 and about 1 10 mg magnesium stearate. The powdered ingredients are first mixed together and then mixed with a solution of the PVP. The resulting composition can be dried granulated mixed with the magnesium stearate and compressed to tablet form using conventional equipment. An example of an aerosol formulation can be prepared by dissolving the compound for example 5 400 mg of the invention in a suitable buffer solution e.g. a phosphate buffer adding a tonicifier e.g. a salt such sodium chloride if desired. The solution may be filtered e.g. using a 0.2 micron filter to remove impurities and contaminants.

The combination therapy can be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially the combination can be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation and consecutive administration in either order wherein preferably there is a time period while both or all active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.

Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and can be lowered due to the combined action synergy of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments.

The combination therapy can provide synergy and prove synergistic i.e. the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect can be attained when the active ingredients are 1 co formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined unit dosage formulation 2 delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations or 3 by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy a synergistic effect can be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially e.g. by different injections in separate syringes separate pills or capsules or in separate infusions. In general during alternation therapy an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially i.e. serially whereas in combination therapy effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.
