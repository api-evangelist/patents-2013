This application is Continuation of co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 833 839 entitled METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PREVENTING UNAUTHORIZED RECORDING OF MEDIA CONTENT ON A MACINTOSH SYSTEM by Risan et al. with a filing date of Jul. 9 2010 and assigned to the assignee of the present application and incorporated in its entirety herein.

The application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 772 031 entitled METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PREVENTING UNAUTHORIZED RECORDING OF MEDIA CONTENT ON A MACINTOSH OPERATING SYSTEM by Risan et al. with a filing date of Feb. 3 2004 and assigned to the assignee of the present application and incorporated in its entirety herein.

The present invention relates to the recording of media content. More particularly the present invention relates to preventing unauthorized recording of media content on a Macintosh operating system.

With advancements in hardware and software technology computers are integral tools utilized in various applications such as finance CAD computer aided design manufacturing health care telecommunication education etc. Further an enhancement in computer functionality can be realized by communicatively coupling computers together to form a network. Within a network environment computer systems enable users to exchange files share information stored in common databases combine or pool resources communicate via electronic mail e mail and access information on the Internet. Additionally computers connected to a network environment e.g. the Internet provide their users access to data and information from all over the world.

Some of the various types of data that a user can access and share include but are not limited to text data such as that found in a word document graphical data such as that found in pictures e.g. JPEGs GIFs TIFFs audio data such as that found in music files e.g. MP3 files and video data such as that found in moving pictures files e.g. MPEG MOV and AVI files to name a few. In fact nearly any type of data can be stored and shared with other computer systems. In many instances the material contained within the various data types is copyrighted material.

There are many different types of network environments that can be implemented to facilitate sharing of data between computer systems. Some of the various network environment types include Ethernet client server and wired and or wireless network environments. A common utilization of a network environment type is for file sharing such as in a P2P network or point to point network. Most P2P networks rely on business models based upon the transfer and redistribution of copyrighted material e.g. audio files between computers coupled to a network e.g. the Internet. A P2P network allows a user to acquire the copyrighted material from a computer a web site source or a music broadcaster and store and share the material with other users throughout the network in some instances acting as a web site source or a music broadcaster.

It is also common for users sharing media files in an uncontrolled manner to use freely distributed or commercially available media player applications to experience e.g. listen view and or watch the shared files. In many instances these media player applications also provide for downloading the media file from a P2P network or from licensed web broadcasters saving it locally and then upload the media file onto an unlawful P2P or similar network and or consumer recording devices. Unlawfully saving recording a media file can be as simple as selecting the save or record function on a media player application.

Additionally many of the computers web sites and web broadcasters that share copyrighted material commonly do not control or monitor the files being exchanged between computers. Additionally when web sites attempt to control or restrict the distribution of copyrighted material e.g. audio files users seeking to circumvent controls or restrictions can in many cases simply utilize the recording functionality of a media player application and save the copyrighted material rename the particular audio file and upload the renamed file rendering attempts to control or restrict its distribution moot.

Further many of the media player recorder applications are designed to capture and record incoming media files in a manner that circumvents controls implemented by a media player application inherent to an operating system e.g. QuickTime for Apple MediaPlayer for Windows etc. or one downloadable from the Internet e.g. RealPlayer LiquidAudio or those provided by webcasters e.g. PressPlay for controlling unauthorized recording of media files. Additionally many digital recording devices e.g. mini disc recorders MP3 recorders and the like can be coupled to a digital output of a computer system to capture the media file.

It is desired to prevent persons from making unauthorized copies of copyrighted material through some available network e.g. wireline wireless P2P etc. or through a communicative coupling. It is further desirable to prevent persons from making unauthorized copies of media files from or to alternative sources e.g. CD players DVD players removable hard drives personal electronic and or recording devices e.g. MP3 recorders and the like.

Current methods of sharing media files do not provide adequate protection against unauthorized recording of the media files.

Accordingly a need exists for a method that prevents unauthorized recording of media files on a Macintosh operating system. Further a need exists for a method that prevents unauthorized recording of media files on a Macintosh operating system that can be updated over a network. Yet another need exists for a method that prevents unauthorized recording of media files on a Macintosh operating system which is compatible with industry standards. Embodiments of the present invention satisfy the above mentioned needs.

In one embodiment the present invention provides a method for preventing unauthorized recording of media content on a Macintosh operating system. The present method registers a compliance mechanism on a client system having the Macintosh operating system operating thereon. The compliance mechanism comprises a framework for validating the compliance mechanism on the client system and a multimedia component opened by the framework. The present method uses the multimedia component for decrypting the media content on the client system. The present method also prevents decryption of the media content on the client system having the Macintosh operating system operating thereon if a portion of the compliance mechanism is invalidated.

In another embodiment the present invention provides computer implementable instructions stored on a computer readable medium the instructions for causing a client system to perform a method for preventing unauthorized recording of media content on a Macintosh operating system. The present method registers a compliance mechanism on a client system having the Macintosh operating system operating thereon. The compliance mechanism comprises a framework for validating the compliance mechanism on the client system a multimedia component opened by the framework and a kernel level extension communicatively coupled with the framework. If the framework detects an invalid environment the multimedia component will prevent decryption of the media content on the client system. The kernel level extension provides kernel level driver information to the framework such that the output of the media content on the client system having the Macintosh operating system operating thereon is disabled if a portion of the compliance mechanism is invalidated.

In another embodiment the present invention provides a system for preventing unauthorized recording of media content on a Macintosh operating system. The present method provides a means for registering a compliance mechanism on a client system having the Macintosh operating system operating thereon. The compliance mechanism comprises a means for validating the compliance mechanism on the client system a means for preventing decryption of the media content on the client system and means for providing kernel level extension information to the framework. In addition if a portion of the compliance mechanism is invalidated there is a means for disabling the output of the media content on the client system having the Macintosh operating system operating thereon.

It is further noted that directing and or activating the cursor can be accomplished by alternative means e.g. voice activated commands provided computer system is configured with such functionality.

Network includes a web server and content server which are communicatively coupled to Internet . Further web server and content server can be communicatively coupled without utilizing Internet as shown. Web server content server and client computers and can communicate with each other. It is noted that computers and servers of network are well suited to be communicatively coupled in various implementations. For example web server content server and client computer systems and of network can be communicatively coupled via wired communication technology e.g. twisted pair cabling fiber optics coaxial cable etc. or wireless communication technology or a combination of wired and wireless communication technology.

Still referring to it is noted that web server content server and client computer systems and can in one embodiment be each implemented in a manner similar to computer system of . However the server and computer systems in network are not limited to such implementation. Additionally web server and content server can perform various functionalities within network . It is also noted that in one embodiment web server and content server can both be disposed on a single or a plurality of physical computer systems.

Further it is noted that network can operate with and deliver any type of media content e.g. audio video multimedia graphics information data software programs etc. in any format. In one embodiment content server can provide audio and video files to client computers via Internet .

There are currently two types of copyright licenses recognized by the digital millennium copyright act DMCA for the protection of broadcasted copyrighted material. One of the broadcast copyright licenses is a compulsory license also referred to as a statutory license. A statutory license is defined as a non interactive license meaning the user cannot select the song. Further a caveat of this type of broadcast license is that a user must not be able to select a particular music file for the purpose of recording it to the user s computer system or other storage device. Another caveat of a statutory license is that a media file is not available more than once for a given period of time. In one example the period of time can be three hours.

The other type of broadcast license recognized by the DMCA is an interactive licensing agreement. An interactive licensing agreement is commonly with the copyright holder e.g. a record company the artist etc. wherein the copyright holder grants permission for a server e.g. web server and or content server to broadcast copyrighted material. Under an interactive licensing agreement there are a variety of ways that copyrighted material e.g. music files can be broadcast. For example one manner in which music files can be broadcast is to allow the user to select and listen to a particular sound recording but without the user enabled to make a sound recording. This is commonly referred to as an interactive with no save license meaning that the end user is unable to save or store the media content file in a relatively permanent manner. Additionally another manner in which music files can be broadcast is to allow a user to not only select and listen to a particular music file but additionally allow the user to save that particularly music file to disc and or burn the music file to a CD MP3 player or other portable electronic device. This is commonly referred to as an interactive with save license meaning that the end user is enabled to save store or burn to CD the media content file.

It is noted that the DMCA allows for the perfect reproduction of the sound recording. A perfect copy of a sound recording is a one to one mapping of the original sound recording into a digitized form such that the perfect copy is virtually indistinguishable and or has no audible differences from the original recording.

In one embodiment CCM copyright compliance mechanism can be stored in web server and or content server of network and is configured to be installed into each client computer system e.g. and enabled to access the media files stored within content server and or web server . Alternatively copyright compliance mechanism can be externally disposed and communicatively coupled with a client computer system via e.g. a portable media device of . In yet another embodiment CCM can be configured to be operable from a media storage device e.g. upon which media files may be disposed.

Copyright compliance mechanism is configured to be operable while having portions of components entire components combinations of components disposed within one or more memory units and or data storage devices of a computer system e.g. and or .

Additionally CCM can be readily updated e.g. via Internet to reflect changes or developments in the DMCA copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements pertaining to any media file changes in current media player applications and or the development of new media player applications or to counteract subversive and or hacker like attempts to unlawfully obtain one or more media files. It is noted that updating CCM can include but is not limited to updating portions of components entire components and or combinations of components of CCM .

Referring to CCM can include instructions for enabling client computer system to interact with web server and content server of network . Instructions enable client computer system to interact with servers e.g. and in a network e.g. .

The copyright compliance mechanism also includes in one embodiment a user ID generator for generating a user ID or user key and one or more cookie s which contain s information specific to the user and the user s computer system e.g. . In one embodiment the user ID and the cookie s are installed in computer system prior to installation of the remaining components of the CCM . It is noted that the presence of a valid cookie s and a valid user ID user key are verified by web server before the remaining components of a CCM can be installed within one embodiment of the present invention. Additionally the user ID user key can contain but is not limited to the user s name the user s address the user s credit card number an online payment account number a verified email address and an identity username and password selected by the user.

Furthermore the cookie can contain but is not limited to information specific to the user information regarding the user s computer system e.g. types of media applications operational therewithin a unique identifier associated with computer system e.g. a MAC media access control address an IP address and or the serial number of the central processing unit CPU operable on computer system and other information specific to the computer system and its user.

Additionally in another embodiment user biometrics may be combined with computer system data and user data and incorporated into the generation of a user ID. Alternatively biometric data may be used in a stand alone implementation in the generation of the user ID. Types of biometric data that may be utilized to provide a user ID and or authorization may include but is not limited to fingerprint data retinal scan data handprint data facial recognition data and the like.

It is noted that the information regarding the client computer system e.g. the user of system and an access key described herein can be collectively referred to as authorization data.

Advantageously with information regarding the user and the user s computer system e.g. web server can determine when a user of one computer system e.g. has given their username and password to another user using another computer system e.g. . Because the username password and the user s computer system are closely associated web server can prevent unauthorized access to copyrighted media content in one embodiment. It is noted that if web server detects unauthorized sharing of usernames and passwords it can block the user of computer system as well as other users who unlawfully obtained the username and password from future access to copyrighted media content available through web server . Web server can invoke blocking for any specified period of time e.g. for a matter of minutes hours months years or longer or permanently.

Still referring to copyright compliance mechanism further includes a coder decoder codec that in one embodiment is adapted to perform but is not limited to encoding decoding of media files compressing decompressing of media files and detecting that delivered media files are encrypted as prescribed by CCM . In the present embodiment coder decoder can also extract key fields from a header attached to each media content file for in part verification that the file originated from a content server e.g. . It is noted that CCM can include one or more codecs similar to codec .

In the present embodiment coder decoder can also perform a periodic and repeated check of the media file while the media file is passed to the media player application e.g. in a frame by frame basis or in a buffer by buffer basis to ensure that CCM rules are being enforced at any particular moment during media playback. It is noted that differing coder decoders can be utilized in conjunction with various types of copyrighted media content including but not limited to audio files video files graphical files alphanumeric files and the like such that any type of media content file can be protected in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.

Within copyright compliance mechanism also includes one or more agent programs which are configured to engage in dialogs and negotiate and coordinate transfer of information between a computer system e.g. or a server e.g. web server and or content server and or media player applications with or without recording functionality that are operable within a client computer system in one embodiment. In the present embodiment agent program can also be configured to maintain system state verify that other components are being utilized simultaneously to be autonomously functional without knowledge of the client and can also present messages e.g. error messages media information advertising etc. via a display window or electronic mail. This enables detection of proper skin implementation and detection of those applications that are running. It is noted that agent programs are well known in the art and can be implemented in a variety of ways in accordance with the present embodiment.

Copyright compliance mechanism also includes one or more system hooks in one embodiment of the present invention. A system hook is in one embodiment a library that is installed in a computer system e.g. that intercepts system wide events. For example a system hook in conjunction with skins can govern certain properties and or functionalities of media player applications operating within the client computer system e.g. including but not limited to mouse click shortcuts keyboard shortcuts standard system accelerators progress bars save functions pause functions rewind functions skip track functions forward track preview copying to CD copying to a portable electronic device and the like.

It is noted that the term govern or governing for purposes of the present invention can refer to a disabling deactivating enabling activating etc. of a property or function. Governing can also refer to an exclusion of that function or property such that a function or property may be operable but unable to perform in the manner originally intended. For example during the playing of a media file the progress bar may be selected and moved from one location on the progress line to another without having an effect on the play of the media file.

Within it is further noted that codec compares the information for the media player application operating on client computer system e.g. with a list of signatures associated with known media recording applications. In one embodiment the signature can be but is not limited to a unique identifier of a media player application which can consist of the window class of the application along with a product name string which is part of the window title for the application. Advantageously when new media player applications are developed their signatures can be readily added to the signature list via an update of CCM described herein.

The following C source code is an exemplary implementation of the portion of a codec for performing media player application detection in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In another embodiment the following source code can be modified to detect kernel streaming mechanisms operable within a client system e.g. .

Within it is further noted that codec can also selectively suppress waveform input output operations to prevent recording of copyrighted media on a client computer system e.g. . For example codec subsequent to detection of bundled media player applications operational in a client computer system e.g. can stop or disrupt the playing of a media content file. This can be accomplished in one embodiment by redirecting and or diverting certain data pathways that are commonly used for recording such that the utilized data pathway is governed by the copyright compliance mechanism . In one embodiment this can be performed within a driver shim e.g. wave driver shim of B C and D.

A driver shim can be utilized for nearly any software output device such as a standard Windows waveform output device e.g. Windows Media Player or a hardware output device e.g. speakers or headphones . Client computer system is configured such that the driver shim e.g. appears as the default waveform media device to client level application programs. Thus requests for processing of waveform media input and or output will pass through the driver shim prior to being forwarded to the actual waveform audio driver e.g. media device driver of . Such waveform input output suppression can be triggered by other components e.g. agent of CCM to be active when a recording operation is initiated by a client computer system e.g. during the play back of media files which are subject to the DMCA.

It is noted that alternative driver shims can be implemented for nearly any waveform output device including but not limited to a Windows Media Player. It is further noted that the driver shim can be implemented for nearly any media in nearly any format including but not limited to audio media files audio input and output devices video graphic and or alphanumeric media files and video input and output devices.

The following C source code is an exemplary implementation of a portion of a codec and or a custom media device driver for diverting and or redirecting certain data pathways that are commonly used for recording of media content in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.

It is noted that when properly configured system hook can govern nearly any function or property within nearly any media player application that may be operational within a client computer system e.g. . In one embodiment system hook is a DLL dynamic link library file. It is further noted that system hooks are well known in the art and are a standard facility in a Microsoft Windows operating environment and accordingly can be implemented in a variety of ways. However it is also noted that system hook can be readily adapted for implementation in alternative operating systems e.g. Apple operating systems Sun Solaris operating systems Linux operating systems and nearly any other operating system.

In copyright compliance mechanism also includes one or more skins which can be designed to be installed in a client computer system e.g. and . In one embodiment skins are utilized to assist in client side compliance with the DMCA digital millennium copyright act regarding copyrighted media content. Skins are customizable interfaces that in one embodiment are displayed on a display device e.g. of computer system and provide functionalities for user interaction of delivered media content. Additionally skins can also provide a display of information relative to the media content file including but not limited to song title artist name album title artist biography and other features such as purchase inquiries advertising and the like.

Furthermore when system hook is unable to govern a function of the media player application operable on a client computer system e.g. such that client computer system could be in non compliance with DMCA and or RIAA restrictions a skin can be implemented to provide compliance.

Differing skins can be implemented depending upon the restrictions applicable e.g. DMCA and or RIAA to each media content file. For example in one embodiment a skin may be configured for utilization with a media content file protected under a non interactive agreement DMCA such that skin may not include a pause function a stop function a selector function and or a save function etc. Another skin e.g. skin may in one embodiment be configured to be utilized with a media content file protected under an interactive with no save agreement DMCA such that skin may include a pause function a stop function a selector function and for those media files having an interactive with save agreement a save or a burn to CD function.

Still referring to it is further noted that in the present embodiment each skin can have a unique name and signature. In one embodiment skin can be implemented in part through the utilization of an MD message digest 5 hash table or similar algorithm. An MD5 hash table can in one implementation be a check sum algorithm. It is well known in the art that a skin e.g. skin can be renamed and or modified to incorporate additional features and or functionalities in an unauthorized manner. Since modification of the skin would change the check sum and or MD5 hash without knowledge of the MD5 hash table changing the name or modification of the skin may simply serve to disable the skin in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Since copyright compliance mechanism CCM verifies skin MD5 hash tables advantageously provide a deterrent against modifications made to the skin .

In one embodiment CCM also includes one or more custom media device driver s for providing an even greater measure of control over the media stream while increasing compliance reliability. A client computer system e.g. can be configured to utilize a custom media device application e.g. custom media device of C and D to control unauthorized recording of media content files. A custom media device application can be but is not limited to a custom media audio device application for media files having sound content a custom video device application for media files having graphical and or alphanumeric content etc. In one embodiment custom media device of is an emulation of the custom media device driver . With reference to audio media the emulation is performed in a waveform audio driver associated with custom media device . Driver is configured to receive a media file being outputted by system prior to the media file being sent to a media output device e.g. media output device and or a media output application e.g. recording application . Examples of a media output device includes but is not limited to a video card for video files a sound card for audio files etc. Examples of a recording application can include but is not limited to CD burner applications for writing to another CD ripper applications which capture the media file and change the format of the media file e.g. from a CD audio file to an .mpeg audio file and or a .wav file and or an ogg vorbis file and various other media formats. In one embodiment client computer system is configured with a custom media device driver emulating custom media device and which is system s default device driver for media file output. In one embodiment an existing GUI graphical user interface can be utilized or a GUI can be provided e.g. by utilization of skin or a custom web based player application or as part of a CCM installation bundle for forcing or requiring system to have driver as the default driver.

Therefore when a media content file is received by system from server the media content file is playable provided the media content file passes through the custom media device application e.g. of emulated by custom media device driver prior to being outputted. However if an alternative media player application is selected delivered media files from server will not play on system .

Thus secured media player applications would issue a media request to the driver e.g. for the custom media device which then performs necessary media input suppression e.g. waveform suppression for audio files prior to forwarding the request to the default Windows media driver e.g. waveform audio driver for audio files .

Within it is noted that requests for non restricted media files can pass directly through custom media device driver to a Windows waveform audio driver operable on system thus reducing instances of incompatibilities with existing media player applications that utilize waveform media e.g. audio video etc. . Additionally media player applications that do not support secured media would be unaffected. It is further noted that for either secured media or non restricted media e.g. audio media files waveform input suppression can be triggered by other components of CCM e.g. agents system hooks and skins or a combination thereof to be active when a recording operation is initiated simultaneously with playback of secured media files e.g. audio files. Custom device drivers are well known and can be coded and implemented in a variety of ways including but not limited to those found at developers network web sites e.g. a Microsoft or alternative OS operating system developer web sites .

Advantageously by virtue of system being configured with a custom media device as the default device driver e.g. of C and D that is an emulation of a custom media device driver those media player applications that require their particular device driver to be the default driver e.g. Total Recorder etc. are rendered non functional for secured media. Further advantageous is that an emulated custom media device provides no native support for those media player applications used as a recording mechanism e.g. DirectSound capture direct sound of B C and D etc. that are able to bypass user mode drivers for most media devices. Additionally by virtue of the media content being sent through device driver thus effectively disabling unauthorized saving recording of media files in one embodiment media files that are delivered in a secured delivery system do not have to be encrypted although in another embodiment they still may be encrypted. By virtue of non encrypted media files utilizing less storage space and network resources than encrypted media files networks having limited resources can utilize the functionalities of driver of CCM to provide compliance with copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements applicable with a media content file without having the processing overhead of encrypted media files.

Client computer system can communicatively couple with a network e.g. to request a media file a list of available media files or a play list of audio files e.g. MP3 files etc. In response web server determines if the request originates from a registered user authorized to receive media files associated with the request. If the user is not registered with the network web server can initiate a registration process with the requesting client . Client registration can be accomplished in a variety of ways. For example web server may deliver to client a registration form having various text entry fields into which the user can enter required information. A variety of information can be requested from the user by web server including but not limited to user s name address phone number credit card number online payment account number biometric identification e.g. fingerprint retinal scan etc. verifiable email address and the like. In addition registration can in one embodiment include the user selecting a username and password.

Still referring to web server can in one embodiment detect information related to the client s computer system and store that information in a user media database . For example web server can detect a unique identifier of client computer system . In one embodiment the unique identifier can be the MAC media access control address of a NIC network interface card of client computer system or the MAC address of the network interface adapter integrated on the motherboard of system . It is understood that a NIC enables a client computer system to access web server via a network such as Internet . It is well known that each NIC typically has a unique identifying number MAC address. Further web server can in one embodiment detect and store also in database information regarding the type s of media player application s e.g. Windows Media Player Real Player iTunes Player Apple Live 365 player and those media player applications having recording functionality e.g. Total Recorder Cool Edit 2000 Sound Forge Sound Recorder Super MP3 Recorder and the like that are present and operable in client computer system . In one embodiment the client information is verified for accuracy and is then stored in a user database e.g. within web server .

Subsequent to registration completion creation of the user ID and password and obtaining information regarding client computer system all or part of this information can be installed in client computer system . In one embodiment client computer system information can be in the form of a cookie. Web server then verifies that the user and client computer system data is properly installed therein and that their integrity has not been compromised. Subsequently web server installs a copyright compliance mechanism e.g. into the client s computer system e.g. in one embodiment of the present invention. It is noted that web server may not initiate installation of CCM until the user ID password and client computer system information is verified. A variety of common techniques can be employed to install an entire CCM portions of its components entire components and or combinations or a function of its components. For example copyright compliance mechanism can be installed in a hidden directory within client computer system thereby preventing unauthorized access to it. In one embodiment it is noted that unless CCM is installed in client computer system its user will not be able to request access or have delivered thereto media files stored by web server and or content server .

Referring still to upon completion of client registration and installation of CCM client computer system can then request a media play list or a plurality of play lists etc. In response web server determines whether the user of client computer system is authorized to receive the media play list associated with the request. In one embodiment web server can request the user s username and password. Alternatively web server can utilize user database to verify that computer is authorized to receive a media play list. If client computer is not authorized web server can initiate client registration as described herein. Additionally web server can disconnect computer or redirect it to an alternative web site. Regardless if the user and client computer system are not authorized web server will not provide the requested play list to client computer system .

However if client computer system is authorized web server can check copyright compliance mechanism within data base to determine if it or any of the components therein have been updated since the last time client computer system logged into web server . If a component of CCM has been updated web server can install the updated component and or a more current version of CCM into client computer system e.g. via Internet . If CCM has not been updated web server can then deliver the requested media play list to system via Internet along with an appended user key or user identification ID . It is noted that user database can also include data for one or more media play lists that can be utilized to provide a media play list to client computer system . Subsequently the user of client computer system can utilize the received media play list in combination with the media player application operating on system to transmit a delivery request for one or more desired pieces of media content from web server . It is noted that the delivery request contains the user key for validation purposes.

Still referring to upon receiving the media content delivery request web server can then check the validity of the requesting media application and the attached user key. In one embodiment web server can utilize user database to check their validity. If either or both are invalid web server in one embodiment can redirect unauthorized client computer system to an alternative destination to prevent abuse of the system. However if both the requesting media application and the user key are valid CCM verifies that skins are installed in client computer system . Additionally CCM further verifies that system hook s have been run or are running to govern certain functions of those media player applications operable within client computer system that are known to provide non compliance with one or more restricted use standards such as the DMCA and or the RIAA. Additionally CCM further diverts and or redirects certain pathways that are commonly used for recording e.g. driver of device of device of and driver of . Once CCM has performed the above described functions web server then in one embodiment issues to the client computer a redirect command to the current address location of the desired media file content along with an optional time sensitive access key e.g. for that hour day or other defined timeframe.

In response to the client computer system receiving the redirect command from web server the media player application operating on client computer system automatically transmits a new request and the time sensitive access key to content server for delivery of one or more desired pieces of media content. The validity of the time sensitive access key is checked by content server . If invalid unauthorized client computer is redirected by content server to protect against abuse of the system and unauthorized access to content server . If the time sensitive access key is valid content server retrieves the desired media content from content database and delivers it to client computer system . It is noted that in one embodiment the delivered media content can be stored in hidden directories and or custom file systems that may be hidden within client computer system thereby preventing future unauthorized distribution. In one embodiment an HTTP hypertext transfer protocol file delivery system is used to deliver the requested media files meaning that the media files are delivered in their entirety to client computer system as compared to streaming media which delivers small portions of the media file.

Still referring to it is noted that each media file has had in one embodiment a header attached therewith prior to delivery of the media file. In one embodiment the header can contain information relating to the media file e.g. title or media ID media data such as size type of data and the like. The header can also contain a sequence or key that is recognizable to copyright compliance mechanism that identifies the media file as originating from content server . In one embodiment the header sequence key can also contain instructions for invoking the licensing agreements and or copyright restrictions that are applicable to that particular media file.

Additionally if licensing agreements and or copyright restrictions are changed developed or created or if new media player applications with or without recording functionality are developed CCM has appropriate modifications made to portions of components entire components combinations of components and or the entire CCM to enable continued compliance with licensing agreements and or copyright restrictions. Furthermore subsequent to modification of copyright compliance mechanism modified portions of or the entire updated CCM can be installed in client computer system in a variety of ways. For example the updated CCM can be installed during client interaction with web server during user log in and or while client computer system is receiving the keyed play list.

Referring still to it is further noted that in one embodiment the media files and attached headers can be encrypted prior to being stored within content server . In one embodiment the media files can be encrypted utilizing randomly generated keys. Alternatively variable length keys can be utilized for encryption. It is noted that the key to decrypt the encrypted media files can be stored in database content database or in some combination of databases and . It is further noted that the messages being passed back and forth between client computer system and web server can also be encrypted thereby protecting the media files and the data being exchanged from unauthorized use or access. There are a variety of encryption mechanisms and programs that can be implemented to encrypt this data including but not limited to exclusive OR shifting with adds public domain encryption programs such as Blowfish and non public domain encryption mechanisms. It is also noted that each media file can be uniquely encrypted such that if the encryption code is cracked for one media file it is not applicable to other media files. Alternatively groups of media files can be similarly encrypted. Furthermore in another embodiment the media files may not be encrypted when being delivered to a webcaster known to utilize a proprietary media player application e.g. custom media device driver .

Subsequent to media file decryption the media file may be passed through CCM e.g. coder decoder to a media player application operating on client computer system e.g. playback application of B C D and A which can then access and utilize the delivered high fidelity media content enabling its user s to experience the media content e.g. listen to it watch it view it or the like. In one embodiment of the present invention a specialized or custom media player may or may not be required to experience the media content e.g. skin of . A skin may be necessary when CCM cannot modify an industry standard media player application to comply with copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements in accordance with the DMCA. Alternatively an industry standard media player can be utilized by client computer system to experience the media content. Typically many media player applications are available and can include but are not limited to Windows Media Player for PCs personal computers iTunes Player or QuickTime for Apple computers and XMMS player for computers utilizing a Linux operating system. Regardless of the media player application utilized while the media file is passed to the media player application e.g. in a frame by frame basis or in a buffer coder decoder will repeatedly ensure that CCM rules are being enforced at any particular moment during media playback shown as step of .

As the media file content is delivered to the media player application periodically e.g. after a specified number of frames after a defined period of time or any desired time or data period coder decoder repeatedly determines whether or not all the rules as defined by CCM are enforced. If the rules are not enforced e.g. a user opening up a recording application such as Total Recorder or an alternative application the presentation of the media content is in one embodiment suspended or halted. In another embodiment the presentation of the media content can be modified to output the media content in a non audible manner e.g. silence . In yet another embodiment the media content may be audible but recording functionality can be disabled such that the media content cannot be recorded. These presentation stoppages are collectively shown as step of .

If the rules in accordance with CCM are enforced the codec decoder retrieves a subsequent portion of the media content that is stored locally in client computer system . The newly retrieved portion of the media file is then presented by the client s media player application. While the newly retrieved portion is presented CCM again checks that the rules are enforced and retrieves an additional portion of the media file or suspends presentation of the media file if the rules are not being enforced. These operations are performed repeatedly throughout the playback of the media file in a loop environment until the media file s contents have been presented in their entirety. Advantageously by constantly monitoring during playing of media files CCM can detect undesired activities and enforces those rules as defined by CCM .

In one embodiment a copyright compliance mechanism is shown as being communicatively coupled with a media playback application via coupling . Therefore CCM is enabled to communicate with playback application . In one embodiment CCM can be integrated into a media playback application. CCM is also coupled to and controls a selectable switch in wave shim driver as described in via coupling . CCM is further coupled to and controls a selectable switch in direct sound via coupling . Depending upon the copyright restrictions and licensing agreements applicable to an incoming media file e.g. CCM controls whether switches and are open shown thus preventing incoming media from reaching a media recording application or closed not shown to allow recording of incoming media .

For example incoming media may originate from a content server e.g. coupled to system . In another example incoming media may originate from a personal recording electronic device e.g. a MP3 player recorder or similar device coupled to system . Alternatively incoming media may originate from a magnetic optical or alternative media storage device inserted into a media device player coupled to system e.g. a CD or DVD inserted into a CD or DVD player a hard disk in a hot swappable hard drive an SD secure digital card inserted into a SD reader and the like. In yet another example incoming media may originate from another media player application or media recording application. Incoming media may also originate from a satellite radio feed e.g. XM radio a personal communication device e.g. a mobile phone a cable television radio input e.g. DMX digital music express a digital distribution and or a public presentation source via a network Internet or other communication connection pay per view and or pay per play system or a set top box. It is noted that incoming media can originate from nearly any source that can be coupled to system . However regardless of the source of incoming media embodiments of the present invention described herein can prevent unauthorized recording of the media .

Media device driver in one embodiment may be a software driver for a sound card coupled to system having a media output device e.g. speakers or headphones coupled therewith for media files having audio content. In another implementation media device driver may be a software driver for a video card coupled with a display device e.g. for displaying media files having alphanumeric and or graphical content and so on. With reference to audio files it is well known that a majority of recording applications assume a computer system e.g. has a sound card disposed therein providing full duplex sound functionality to system . This means media output driver can simultaneously cause playback and recording of incoming media files . For example media device driver can playback media along wave out line to media output device e.g. speakers for audible playback via wave out line while outputting media on wave out line to eventually reach recording application .

For purposes of B C and D the terms wave in line and wave out line are referenced from the perspective of media device driver . Additionally for the most part wave in lines are depicted downwardly and wave out lines are depicted upwardly in B C and D.

Continuing with playback application is coupled with an operating system O S multimedia subsystem via wave in line . O S multimedia subsystem is coupled to a wave shim driver via wave in line and wave out line . O S multimedia subsystem is also coupled to recording application via wave out line . Operating system O S multimedia subsystem can be any O S multimedia subsystem e.g. a Windows multimedia subsystem for system operating under a Microsoft O S a QuickTime multimedia subsystem for system operating under an Apple O S and the like. Playback application is also coupled with direct sound via wave in line .

Direct sound in one embodiment may represent access to a hardware acceleration feature in a standard audio device enabling lower level access to components within media device driver . In another embodiment direct sound may represent a path that can be used by a recording application e.g. Total Recorder that can be further configured to bypass the default device driver e.g. media device driver to capture incoming media for recording. For example direct sound can be enabled to capture incoming media via wave in line and unlawfully output media to recording application via wave out line as well as media eventually going to media device driver the standard default driver.

Still referring to wave shim driver is coupled with media device driver via wave in line and wave out line . Media device driver is coupled with direct sound via wave in line which is shown to converge with wave in line at media device driver . Media device driver is also coupled with direct sound via wave out line .

Wave out lines and are shown to diverge from wave out line at media device driver into separate paths. Wave out line is coupled to wave shim driver and wave out line is coupled to direct sound . When selectable switches and are open shown incoming media cannot flow to recording application thus preventing unauthorized recording of it.

For example incoming media is received at playback application . Playback application activates and communicates to CCM regarding copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements applicable to incoming media . If recording restrictions apply to media CCM can in one embodiment open switches and thereby blocking access to recording application to effectively prevent unauthorized recording of media . In one embodiment CCM can detect if system is configured with direct sound selected as the default driver to capture incoming media via wave in line or a recording application is detected and or a hardware accelerator is active such that wave driver shim can be bypassed by direct sound . Upon detection CCM can control switch such that the output path wave out line to recording application is blocked. It is further noted that CCM can detect media recording applications and devices as described herein with reference to .

Alternatively if media device driver is selected as the default driver incoming media is output from playback application to O S multimedia subsystem via wave in line . From subsystem media is output to wave shim driver via wave in line . The wave shim driver was described herein with reference to . Media is output from wave shim driver to media device driver via wave in line . Once received by media device driver media can be output via wave out line to media output device coupled therewith via wave out line . Additionally media device driver can simultaneously output media on wave out line back to wave shim driver . Dependent upon recording restrictions applicable to media CCM can in one embodiment close switch not shown as closed thereby allowing media to be output from wave shim driver to subsystem via wave out line and then to recording application via wave out line . Alternatively CCM can also open switch thereby preventing media from reaching recording application .

It is noted that by virtue of CCM controlling both switches and and therefore controlling wave out line and wave out line leading into recording application incoming media files e.g. can be prevented from being recorded in an unauthorized manner in accordance with applicable copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements related to the incoming media . It is also noted that embodiments of the present invention in no way interfere with or inhibit the playback of incoming media .

Diagram B of is similar to diagram A of with a few changes. Particularly diagram B includes a custom media device communicatively interposed between and coupled to O S multimedia subsystem and wave shim driver . Custom media device is coupled to O S multimedia subsystem via wave in line and wave out line . Custom media device is coupled with wave shim driver via wave in line and wave out line . Additionally custom media device is coupled with direct sound via wave in line which converges with wave in line and wave out line which diverges from wave out line in one embodiment.

Diagram B also includes a media hardware output device that is coupled to media device hardware driver via line . Media hardware output device can be but is not limited to a sound card for audio playback a video card for video graphical alphanumeric output and the like.

In one embodiment CCM is communicatively coupled with playback application via coupling waveform driver shim via coupling and custom media device via coupling . CCM is coupled to and controls selectable switch in waveform driver shim via coupling . CCM is also coupled to and controls selectable switch in custom audio device via coupling . Depending upon the copyright restrictions and licensing agreements applicable to an incoming media file e.g. media CCM controls whether switches and are open shown thus preventing the incoming media from reaching a recording application or closed not shown so as to allow recording of the incoming media .

Continuing with direct sound is coupled with custom media device via wave in line instead of being coupled with media device driver . In one embodiment custom audio device mandates explicit selection through system meaning that custom audio device needs to be selected as a default driver of system . By virtue of having the selection of custom media device as the default driver of system the data path necessary for direct sound to capture the media content can be selectively closed.

For example incoming media originating from nearly any source described herein with reference to is received by media playback application of system . Playback application communicates to CCM via coupling to determine whether incoming media is protected by any copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements. Playback application communicates with CCM to control switch and accordingly. For example if recording of incoming media would violate applicable restrictions and or agreements switch is in an open position as shown such that the output path to recording application e.g. wave out line and or wave out line is effectively blocked thereby preventing unauthorized recording of media .

Alternatively if media device driver is selected as the default driver incoming media continues from O S multimedia subsystem through custom media device wave driver shim and into media device driver where media can be simultaneously output to media output device via line and output on wave out line wave shim driver on wave out line . However by virtue of CCM controlling switch wave out line which eventually leads to recording application is blocked thus effectively preventing unauthorized recording of media .

It is noted that by virtue of CCM controlling both switches and and therefore controlling wave out line and wave out line any incoming media files e.g. can be prevented from being recorded in an unauthorized manner in accordance with applicable copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements related to the incoming media .

Still referring to it is further noted that custom media device allows for unfettered playback of incoming media . Additionally at any time during playback of media custom media device can be dynamically activated by CCM .

Diagram C of is similar to diagram B of with a few changes. Particularly media hardware output device is shown to include a switch controlled by CCM via communication line similar to switches and for controlling output of incoming media . Diagram C includes media hardware output device that is coupled with a media device driver . In one embodiment media hardware output device can be a S PDIF Sony Phillips Digital Interface card for providing multiple outputs e.g. an analog output and a digital output . An alternative media hardware output device providing similar digital output can also be implemented as device including but not limited to a USB universal serial bus output device and or an externally accessible USB port located on system a FireWire IEEE1394 output device and or an externally accessible FireWire port located on system with wireline or wireless communication functionality.

In one embodiment CCM is communicatively coupled with playback application via coupling waveform driver shim via coupling custom media device via coupling and media hardware output device via coupling . CCM is coupled to and controls selectable switch in waveform driver shim via coupling . CCM is also coupled to and controls selectable switch in custom audio device via coupling . CCM is further coupled to and controls selectable switch in media hardware output device via coupling . Depending upon the copyright restrictions and licensing agreements applicable to an incoming media file e.g. media CCM controls whether switches and are open shown thus preventing the incoming media from reaching a recording application or closed not shown so as to allow recording of the incoming media . Additionally CCM controls whether switch is open shown thus preventing incoming media from being output from digital output of media hardware output device or closed not shown to allow incoming media to be output from media hardware output device .

By controlling media hardware output device copyright compliance mechanism can prevent unauthorized output of incoming media to e.g. a digital recording device that may be coupled with digital output of media hardware output device . Accordingly in one embodiment CCM is enabled to also detect digital recording devices that may be coupled to a digital output line e.g. of a media hardware output device e.g. . Examples of a digital recording device that can be coupled to media hardware output device includes but is not limited to mini disc recorders MP3 recorders personal digital recorders digital recording devices coupled with multimedia systems personal communication devices set top boxes and or nearly any digital device that can capture incoming media being output from media hardware output device e.g. a sound card video card etc. .

Within direct sound is shown coupled with custom media device via wave in line instead of being coupled with media device driver . In one embodiment custom audio device mandates explicit selection through system meaning that custom audio device needs to be selected as a default driver of system . By virtue of having the selection of custom media device as the default driver of system the data path necessary for direct sound to capture the media content can be selectively closed.

For example incoming media originating from nearly any source with reference to is received by media playback application of system . Playback application communicates to CCM via coupling to determine whether incoming media is protected by any copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements. Playback application communicates with CCM to control switch and accordingly. In the present example recording of incoming media would violate applicable restrictions and or agreements and therefore switch is in an open position such that the output path to recording application e.g. wave out line and or wave out line is effectively blocked thereby preventing unauthorized recording of media .

Alternatively if media device driver is selected as the default driver incoming media continues from O S multimedia subsystem through custom audio device wave driver shim and into media device driver where media can be simultaneously output to media output device via line and output on wave out line to wave shim driver on wave out line . However by virtue of CCM controlling switch wave out line which eventually leads to recording application is blocked thus effectively preventing unauthorized recording of media .

It is noted that by virtue of CCM controlling both switches and and therefore controlling wave out line and wave out line any incoming media files e.g. can be prevented from being recording in an unauthorized manner in accordance with applicable copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements related to the incoming media.

Still referring to it is noted that although CCM can prevent unauthorized recording of incoming media by controlling switches and thus preventing incoming media from reaching recording application controlling switches and do nothing to prevent incoming media from being captured by a peripheral digital device e.g. a mini disc recorder etc. coupled to digital output of device . Thus by also controlling digital output of media hardware output device via switch CCM can prevent unauthorized capturing of incoming media from output e.g. on a sound card for audio files a video card for video and or graphical files regardless of whether incoming media is received in a secure and encrypted manner. However when switch is in a closed position incoming media may be played back in an unfettered manner. Additionally at any time during playback of media switch of custom media device switch of media device driver and or switch of media hardware output device can be dynamically activated by CCM .

Diagram D of is similar to diagram C of with some changes. Particularly diagram D includes a kernel streaming mechanism e.g. DirectKS that is coupled with media device driver . In one embodiment DirectKS can be used for establishing a direct connection with media device driver . In the present embodiment media device driver is shown to include a switch controlled by CCM via communication line that is similar to switches and for controlling output of incoming media .

In one embodiment CCM is communicatively coupled with playback application via coupling waveform driver shim via coupling custom media device via coupling and media device driver via coupling . Specifically CCM is coupled to and controls selectable switch of waveform driver shim via coupling . CCM is also coupled to and controls selectable switch of custom audio device via coupling . CCM is further coupled to and controls selectable switch of media device driver via coupling . Depending upon the copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements applicable to an incoming media file e.g. media CCM controls whether switches and are open shown thus preventing the incoming media from reaching a recording application or closed not shown so as to allow recording of the incoming media . Additionally CCM controls whether switch is open shown thus preventing incoming media from capturing incoming media and redirecting it to recording application to create an unauthorized copy or recording of incoming media . CCM can also control whether switch is closed not shown to allow DirectKS to capture and redirect incoming media to recording application .

DirectKS in one embodiment may represent a kernel streaming mechanism that is adapted to establish a direct connection with media device driver of an operating system operable on client computer system enabling kernel level access to media device driver . A kernel streaming mechanism can be implemented for the purpose of precluding utilization of standard audio APIs application programming interfaces to play or record media content with particular attention paid to those playback applications with low latency requirements. DirectKS can bypass existing APIs and communicate with media device driver . DirectKS can be readily adapted to work in conjunction with a playback application e.g. via coupling to capture incoming media and redirect it to driver via coupling and then to recording application via wave out line . Accordingly DirectKS can be implemented to create unauthorized media recordings.

By controlling media device driver copyright compliance mechanism can prevent unauthorized output of incoming media to e.g. a digital recording device that may be coupled with recording application . In one embodiment media device driver is configured through the kernel mixer not shown to control the data path. Additionally in one embodiment CCM is enabled to also detect a kernel streaming mechanism e.g. DirectKS that may be operable on client computer system as described herein with reference to .

In one embodiment custom media device mandates explicit selection through system meaning that custom media device needs to be selected as a default driver of system . By virtue of having the selection of custom media device as the default driver of system the data path necessary for direct sound to capture the media content is selectively closed.

For example incoming media originating from nearly any source described herein with reference to is received by media playback application of system . Playback application communicates to CCM via connection to determine whether incoming media is protected by any copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements. Playback application communicates with CCM to control switches and accordingly. In the present example recording of incoming media would violate applicable restrictions and or agreements and there e.g. wave out line and or wave out line and or wave out line is effectively blocked thereby preventing unauthorized recording of media .

Still referring to it is particularly noted that although CCM can prevent unauthorized recording of incoming media by controlling switches and thus preventing incoming media from reaching recording application controlling switches and do nothing to prevent incoming media from being returned to recording application by a kernel streaming mechanism e.g. DirectKS which enables capturing and redirecting of incoming media to recording application via wave out line . Thus by also controlling switch of media device driver CCM can prevent kernel streaming mechanism from returning incoming media to recording application thereby preventing incoming media from being captured and redirected to recording application in an attempt to create an unauthorized copy and or recording of incoming media . However when switch is in a closed position incoming media may be returned to recording application such that recording could be possible provided recording does not violate copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements applicable to incoming media . Additionally at any time during playback of media switch of custom media device switch of wave shim driver and or switch of media device driver can be dynamically activated by CCM .

Playback application is coupled with CCM via communication line in a manner analogous to B C and or D. Although not shown in it is noted that CCM is also coupled to switches and as shown in switches and in switches and in and switches and in .

In one embodiment an indicator is attached to incoming media for preventing unauthorized copying or recording in accordance with the SCMS. In one embodiment indicator can be a bit that may be transmitted prior to beginning the delivery of incoming media to playback application . In another embodiment indicator may be placed at the beginning of the bit stream of incoming media . In yet another embodiment indicator may be placed within a frame period of incoming media e.g. every fifth frame or any other desired frame period. In another embodiment indicator may be transmitted at a particular time interval or intervals during delivery of the media file e.g. . Thus indicator may be placed nearly anywhere within or attached to the bit stream related to incoming media .

Within indicator may be comprised of various indicators e.g. a level 0 indicator a level 1 indicator and a level 2 indicator in one embodiment of the present invention. In the present embodiment a level 0 indicator may be for indicating to CCM that copying is permitted without restriction e.g. incoming media is not copyrighted or the copyright is not asserted . In the present embodiment a level 1 indicator may be for indicating to CCM that one generation of copies of incoming media may be made such that incoming media is an original copy and that one copy may be made. In the present embodiment a level 2 indicator may be for indicating to CCM that incoming media is copyright protected and or a copy thereof and as such no digital copying is permitted.

For example incoming media is received by playback application . Application detects an indicator attached therewith in this example a level 2 bit placed in the bit stream indicates to CCM that copying is not permitted. As such when CCM is configured in system such as that shown in in response to a level 2 indicator bit CCM while controlling the media path then activates switches and to prevent any recording of incoming media .

However CCM is configured in system such as that shown in in response to a level 2 indicator bit CCM while controlling the media path then activates switches and to prevent any recording of incoming media .

Alternatively when CCM is configured in system such as that shown in in response to a level 2 indicator bit CCM while controlling the media path then activates switches and to prevent any recording of incoming media .

It is noted that CCM can activate or deactivate switches coupled therewith as described herein with reference to thereby funneling incoming media through the secure media path in this instance the audio path to prevent unauthorized copying of incoming media . It is further noted that CCM can detect media recording applications and devices as described herein with reference to .

The present embodiment provides a method for restricting recording of high fidelity media content delivered via one or more communication networks. The present embodiment delivers the high fidelity media content to registered clients while preventing unauthorized clients from directly receiving media content from a source database. Once the client computer system receives the media content it can be stored in hidden directories and or custom file systems that may be hidden to prevent subsequent unauthorized sharing with others. It is noted that various functionalities can be implemented to protect and monitor the delivered media content. For example the physical address of the media content can be hidden from media content recipients. Alternatively the directory address of the media content can be periodically changed. Additionally an access key procedure and rate control restrictor can also be implemented to monitor and restrict suspicious media content requests. Furthermore a copyright compliance mechanism e.g. CCM can be installed in the client computer system to provide client side compliance with licensing agreements and or copyright restrictions applicable to the media content. By implementing these and other functionalities the present embodiment restricts access to and the distribution of delivered media content and provides a means for copyrighted media owner compensation.

It is noted that flowchart is described in conjunction with and A D in order to more fully describe the operation of the present embodiment. In operation of a user of a computer system e.g. causes the computer to communicatively couple to a web server e.g. via one or more communication networks e.g. Internet and proceeds to attempt to log in. It is understood that the log in process of step can be accomplished in a variety of ways in accordance with the present invention.

In operation of web server accesses a user database e.g. to determine whether the user and the computer system logging in are registered with it. If the user and computer system are registered with web server the present embodiment proceeds to operation . However if the user and computer system are not registered with web server web server can initiate a user and computer system registration process at operation .

In operation registration of the user and computer system is initiated. The user and computer system registration process can involve the user of computer system providing personal information including but not limited to their name address phone number credit card number online payment account number biometric identification e.g. fingerprint retinal scan etc. and the like. Web server can verify the accuracy of the information provided. Web server can also acquire information regarding the user s computer system including but not limited to identification of media players disposed and operable on system a unique identifier corresponding to the computer system etc. In one embodiment the unique identifier corresponding to the computer system can be a MAC address. Additionally web server can further request that the user of computer system select a username and password.

In operation of subsequent to the completion of the registration process web server generates a unique user identification ID or user key associated with the user of client computer system . The unique user ID or user key is then stored by web server in a manner that is associated with that registered user. Furthermore one or more cookies containing that information specific to that user and the user s computer system is installed in a non volatile memory device e.g. and or data storage device of computer system . It is noted that the user ID and cookie can be stored in a hidden directory within one or more non volatile memory devices within computer system thereby preventing user access and or manipulation of that information. It is further noted that if the unique user ID or user key has been previously generated for the user and computer that initially logged in at operation the present embodiment proceeds to operation

In operation web server verifies that the user ID and the cookie s are properly installed in computer system and verifies the integrity of the cookie s and the user ID thereby ensuring no unauthorized alterations to the user ID or the cookie s has occurred. If the user ID is not installed and or not valid web server can re initiate the registration process at operation . Alternatively web server can decouple computer system from the network thereby requiring a re log in by the user of computer . If the cookie s and user ID are valid the present embodiment proceeds to operation .

In operation of web server can install a version of a copyright compliance mechanism e.g. onto one or more non volatile memory devices of computer system . Installing CCM into user s computer system can facilitate client side compliance with licensing agreements and copyright restrictions applicable to specific delivered copyrighted media content. At operation the components of CCM such as instructions coder decoder codec agent programs system hooks skins and custom media device drivers e.g. custom media device of are installed in computer system such as that shown in . In one embodiment a hypertext transfer protocol file delivery system can be utilized to install CCM into computer system . However operation is well suited to install CCM on computer system in a wide variety of ways in accordance with the present embodiment. For example CCM can be installed as an integrated component within a media player application media recorder application and or media player recorder application. Alternatively CCM can be installed as a stand alone mechanism within client computer system . Additionally CCM can be installed as a stand alone mechanism and or as part of a bundled application from a media storage device e.g. a CD a DVD an SD and or as part of an installation package. In another embodiment CCM can be installed in conjunction with a presentation of desired media content e.g. listening to an audio file on a music CD reading a document viewing a video etc. . It is noted that in one embodiment CCM may be installed on client system in a clandestine manner relative to a user.

In operation web server can request the previously established username and password of the user of client computer system . Accordingly the user of client computer system causes it to transmit to web server the previously established username and password. Upon the receipt thereof web server may access a user database e.g. to determine their validity. If the username and password are invalid web server refuses access wherein flowchart may be discontinued not shown . Alternatively if the username and password are valid the present embodiment proceeds to operation .

In operation of web server can access media file database to determine if copyright compliance mechanism has been updated to reflect changes made to the DMCA Digital Millennium Copyright Act and or to the interactive non interactive licensing agreements recognized by the DMCA. It is noted that alternative licensing agreements can be incorporated into copyright compliance mechanism . Advantageously by providing a copyright compliance mechanism that can be readily updated to reflect changes in copyright restrictions licensing agreements and or changes to existing media player applications and or the development of new media player applications copyright compliance mechanism can provide compliance with current restrictions associated with the media content.

Continuing with operation if web server determines that CCM or components thereof of computer has not been updated web server initiates installation of the newer components and or the most current version of CCM into computer system shown as operation . If web server determines that the current version of CCM installed on system does not have to be updated the present embodiment proceeds to operation of .

In operation of the user of client computer system causes it to transmit to web server e.g. via Internet a request for a play list of available media files. It is noted that the play list can contain all or part of the media content available from a content server e.g. .

In operation in response to web server receiving the play list request web server transmits to client computer system a media content play list together with the unique user ID associated with the logged in user. The user ID or user key can be attached to the media content play list in a manner invisible to the user. It is noted that the media content in content server can be but is not limited to high fidelity music audio video graphics multimedia alphanumeric data and the like. The media content play list of operation can be implemented in diverse ways. In one example web server can generate a media content play list by combining all the available media content into a single play list. Alternatively all of the media content titles or different lists of titles can be loaded from content server and passed to a CGI common gateway interface program operating on web server where the media titles or differing lists of titles can be concatenated into a single dimensioned array that can be provided to client computer system . It is understood that the CGI can be written in nearly any software computing language.

In operation of the user of client computer system can utilize the received media content play list in conjunction with a media player application in order to cause client computer system to transmit a request to web server for delivery of desired media content and wherein the user ID is automatically included therewith. The media content play list provided to client computer system by web server can enable the user to create one or more customized play lists by the user selecting desired media content titles. It is noted that a customized media play list can establish the media content that will eventually be delivered to client computer system and the order in which the content will be delivered. Additionally the user of client computer system can create one or more customized play lists and store those play lists in system and or within web server . It is noted that a customized play list does not actually contain the desired media content titles but rather the play list includes one or more identifiers associated with the desired media content that can include but is not limited to a song an audio clip a video clip a picture a multimedia clip an alphanumeric document or particular portions thereof. In another embodiment the received media content play list can include a random media content delivery choice that the user of client computer system can transmit to web server with the user ID to request delivery of the media content in a random manner.

In operation upon receiving the request for media content from client computer system web server determines whether the requesting media application operating on client computer system is a valid media application. One of the functions of a valid media application is to be a player of media content as opposed to an application that downloads media content in an unauthorized or unregulated manner. If web server determines that the media application operating on system is not a valid media application the present embodiment proceeds to operation which in one embodiment redirects client computer to a web site where the user of system can download a valid media player application or to a software application which can identify client computer system log system out of web server and or prevent future logging in for a defined period of time e.g. 15 minutes an hour a day a week a month a year or any specified amount of time . If web server determines that the media application operating on system is a valid media application the present embodiment proceeds to operation .

In operation of the present embodiment causes web server to determine whether the user ID or user key that accompanied the media delivery request sent by client computer system is valid. If web server determines that the user ID is invalid the present embodiment proceeds to operation where client computer system can be logged off web server or client computer system can be returned to operation of to re register and to have another unique user ID generated by web server . It is noted that the order in which operation and are performed can be altered such that operation can be performed prior to operation . If web server determines that the user ID is valid the present embodiment proceeds to operation .

In operation prior to web server authorizing the delivery of the redirect and access key for the requested media file content shown as operation CCM governs certain media player applications and or functions thereof that are operable on client computer system . These governed functions can include but is not limited to pause stop progress bar save etc. It is noted that in one embodiment CCM can utilize system hooks to accomplish the functionality of operation .

In operation of the present embodiment causes web server to transmit to client computer system a redirection command along with a time sensitive access key e.g. for that hour day or for any defined period of time thereby enabling client computer to receive the requested media content. The redirection command can include a time sensitive address of the media content location within content server . The address is time sensitive because in one embodiment the content server periodically renames some or all of the media address directories thereby making previous content source addresses obsolete. Alternatively the address of the media content is changed. In another embodiment the location of the media content can be changed along with the addresses. Regardless unauthorized users and or applications are restricted from directly retrieving and or copying the media content from content server . Therefore if someone with inappropriate or unlawful intentions is able to find where the media content is stored subsequent attempts will fail as the previous route no longer exists thereby preventing future unauthorized access.

It is noted that in one embodiment of the present invention the addresses or routes of content server that are actively coupled to one or more client computer systems e.g. are maintained while future addresses or routes are being created for new client devices. It is further noted that as client computer systems are uncoupled from the media content source of content server that directory address or link can be immediately changed thereby preventing unauthorized client system or application access.

In another embodiment the redirection of client computer system to content server can be implemented by utilizing a server network where multiple servers are content providers e.g. or by routing a requesting client computer system e.g. or through multiple servers. In yet another embodiment the delivery of media content from a central content provider e.g. can be routed through one or more intermediate servers before being received by the requesting client computer system e.g. .

The functionality of operation is additionally well suited to provide recordation of the Internet Protocol IP addresses of the client computer systems e.g. the media content requested and its transfer size thereby enabling accurate monitoring of royalty payments clock usage and transfers and media content popularity.

In operation of upon receiving the redirection command the present embodiment causes the media playback application operating on client computer system to automatically transmit to content server a new media delivery request which can include the time sensitive access key and the address of the desired media content.

In operation of content server determines whether the time sensitive access key associated with the new media delivery request is valid. If content server determines that the time sensitive access key is valid the present embodiment proceeds to operation of . However if content server determines that the time access key is not valid the present embodiment proceeds to operation a client redirect.

In operation content server redirects client computer to operation where a new access key is generated. Alternatively operation causes the present embodiment to return to operation of . In yet another embodiment operation can cause client computer system to be disconnected from content server .

In operation of content server transmits the requested high fidelity media content to client computer system . It is noted that each media content file delivered to client computer system can have a header attached thereto prior to delivery as described herein with reference to . It is further noted that both the media content and the header attached thereto can be encrypted. In one embodiment the media content and the header can be encrypted differently. Alternatively each media content file can be encrypted differently. In another embodiment groups of media files are analogously encrypted. It is noted that public domain encryption mechanisms e.g. Blowfish and or non public domain encryption mechanisms can be utilized.

Still referring to operation content server can transmit the requested media content in a burst load in comparison to a fixed data rate thereby transferring the content to client computer system as fast as the network transfer rate allows. Further content server can have its download rate adapted to be equal to the transfer rate of the network to which it is coupled. In another embodiment the content server download rate can be adapted to equal the network transfer rate of the client computer system to which the media content is being delivered. For example if client computer system is coupled to Internet via a T1 connection then content server transfers the media content at transmission speeds allowed by the T1 connection line. As such once the requested media content is transmitted to client computer system content server is then able to transmit requested media content to another client computer system e.g. or . Advantageously this provides an efficient means to transmit media content in terms of statistical distribution over time and does not overload the communication network s .

It is noted that delivery of the requested media content by content server to client computer system can be implemented in a variety of ways. For example an HTTP hypertext transfer protocol file transfer protocol can be utilized to transfer the requested media content as well as copyright compliance mechanism to client . In this manner the copyright compliance mechanism as well as each media content file title can be delivered in its entirety. In another embodiment content server can transmit to client computer system a large buffer of media content e.g. audio clips video clips and the like .

In operation of upon receiving the requested high fidelity media content from content server the present embodiment causes client computer system to store the delivered media content in a manner that is ready for presentation e.g. playback . The media content is stored in client computer system in a manner that restricts unauthorized redistribution. For example the present embodiment can cause the high fidelity media content to be stored in a volatile memory device e.g. utilizing one or more hidden directories and or custom file systems that may be hidden where it may be cached for a limited period of time. Alternatively the present embodiment can cause the high fidelity media content to be stored in a non volatile memory device e.g. or data storage device e.g. . It is noted that the manner in which each of the delivered media content file s is stored volatile or non volatile can be dependent upon the licensing restrictions and or copyright agreements applicable to each media content file. It is further noted that in one embodiment when a user of client computer system turns the computer off or causes client computer system to disconnect from the network the media content stored in a volatile memory device is typically deleted therefrom.

Still referring to operation in another embodiment the present embodiment can cause client computer system to store the received media content in a non volatile manner within a media application operating therein or within one of its Internet browser applications e.g. Netscape Communicator Microsoft Internet Explorer Opera Mozilla and the like so that delivered media content can be used in a repetitive manner. Further the received media content can be stored in a manner making it difficult for a user to redistribute in an unauthorized manner while allowing the user utilization of the received media content e.g. by utilizing one or more hidden directories and or custom file systems that may also be hidden . It is noted that by storing media content with client computer system when allowed by applicable licensing agreements and or copyright restrictions content server does not need to redeliver the same media content to client computer each time its user desires to experience e.g. listen to watch view etc. the media content file.

In operation of the received media content file is then fed into a media player application e.g. of which then runs it through a codec e.g. of CCM in one embodiment. In response coder decoder sends an authorization request to the content server e.g. with attached authorization data as described herein. In response to receiving codec s authorization request server compares the received authorization data with that stored in server and subsequently the present embodiment proceeds to operation .

In operation the content server responds with a pass or fail authorization. If server responds with a fail such that the received authorization data is invalid the present embodiment can proceed to operation where server can in one embodiment notify the user of client system e.g. by utilization of skin that there was an unsuccessful authorization of the requested media content file. It is noted that alternative messages having similar meanings may also be presented to the user of client computer system thereby informing the user that the delivery failed. However if the authorization data passes the present embodiment proceeds to operation .

In operation content server transmits certain data back to the media player application enabling the media player application to present the contents of the media file via media playback application of . In one embodiment a decryption key can be included in the transmitted data to decrypt the delivered media content file. In another embodiment an encryption decryption key can be included in the transmitted data to allow access to the contents of the media file.

In operation of subsequent to media file decryption the media file may be passed through CCM e.g. a codec to a media player application operating on client computer system e.g. playback application of which can then access and utilize the delivered high fidelity media content enabling its user s to experience the media content e.g. listen to it watch it view it or the like . In one embodiment of the present invention a specialized or custom media player may be involved in order to experience the media content e.g. skin of . Skin may be implemented when CCM cannot modify an industry standard media player application to comply with copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements in accordance with the DMCA. Alternatively a specialized or custom media player may not be needed to experience the media content. Instead an industry standard media player can be utilized by client computer system to experience the media content. Typically many media player applications are available and can include but are not limited to Windows Media Player for PCs personal computers iTunes Player or QuickTime for Apple computers and XMMS player for computers utilizing a Linux operating system. Regardless of the media player application utilized while the media file is passed to the media player application e.g. in a frame by frame basis or in a buffer by buffer basis coder decoder will repeatedly ensure that CCM rules are being enforced at any particular moment during media playback shown as operation .

In operation as the media file content is delivered to the media player application e.g. of periodically e.g. after a specified number of frames after a defined period of time or any desired time or data period coder decoder repeatedly determines whether or not all the rules are enforced in accordance with rules as defined by CCM . If the rules are not enforced e.g. change due to a user opening up a recording application e.g. Total Recorder or alternative application the present method proceeds to operation . If the rules in accordance with CCM are enforced the present embodiment then proceeds to operation .

In operation of if the rules according to CCM are not enforced the presentation of the media content is in one embodiment suspended or halted. In one embodiment CCM of can selectively control switches and to prevent output of incoming media to a recording application via wave shim driver and direct sound respectively thus preventing unauthorized recording of incoming media . In another embodiment CCM of can selectively control switches and to prevent output of incoming media to recording application via wave shim driver and custom media device thus preventing unauthorized recording of incoming media . In yet another embodiment CCM of can selectively control switches to not only prevent incoming media from being recorded in an unauthorized manner but can also selectively control switch to prevent unauthorized output of incoming media via digital output of media hardware output device . In yet another embodiment CCM of can selectively control switches and to a prevent kernel streaming mechanism e.g. DirectKS which can establish a connection with media device driver of from capturing incoming media content and returning it to recording application to create an unauthorized recording of the media content. In one embodiment incoming media may not be output from digital output . In another embodiment incoming media may be output via digital output but in an inaudible manner e.g. silence . In yet another embodiment incoming media can be audible but recording functionality can be disabled such that the media content cannot be recorded.

In operation if the rules are enforced in accordance with CCM codec retrieves a subsequent portion of the media content that is stored locally in client computer system . The present embodiment proceeds to operation where the newly retrieved portion of the media file is then presented by the client s media player application. In this manner the playback of the media content is constantly monitored by the present embodiment. Advantageously by constant monitoring playback media files CCM can detect undesired activities and enforce those rules defined by CCM . It is noted that process can be exited not shown once the media file contents are presented in their entirety.

For example a media delivery point MDP located in Tokyo Japan is able to provide and deliver media content from the media content library stored in its content database e.g. to client computer systems within the Asiatic regions of the world while a media delivery point located in New York City N.Y. USA is able to provide and deliver media content from its stored media content library to client devices within the Eastern United States and Canada. It is noted that each city name e.g. London Tokyo Hamburg San Jose Dallas Amsterdam or New York City associated with one of the media delivery points represents the location of that particular media delivery point or point of presence. However it is further noted that these city names are exemplary because media delivery points can be located anywhere within the world and as such are not limited to the cities shown in global network .

Still referring to it is further noted that global system is described in conjunction with A D and in order to more fully describe the operation of the present embodiment. Particularly subsequent to a client computer system e.g. of interacting with a web server e.g. of as described herein web server in one embodiment can redirect client computer system to receive the desired media content from an MDP e.g. based on one or more differing criteria.

For example computer system may be located in Brattleboro Vt. and its user causes it to log in with a web server which can be located anywhere in the world. It is noted that operations of can then be performed as described herein such that the present embodiment proceeds to operation of . At operation the present embodiment can determine which media delivery points e.g. or can subsequently provide and deliver the desired media content to client computer system .

Still referring to one or more differing criteria can be utilized to determine which media delivery point e.g. to select for delivery of the desired media content. For example the present embodiment can base its determination upon which media delivery point is in nearest proximity to client computer system e.g. media delivery point . This can be performed by utilizing the stored registration information e.g. address provided by the user of client computer system . Alternatively the present embodiment can base its determination upon which media delivery point provides media content to the part of the world in which client computer system is located. However if each media of the delivery points e.g. stores differing media content the present embodiment can determine which one can actually provide the desired media content. It is noted that these are exemplary determination criteria and the embodiments of the present invention are not limited to such implementation.

Subsequent to determination of which media delivery point is to provide the media content to client computer system at operation web server transmits to client computer system a redirection command to a media delivery point content server e.g. along with a time sensitive access key also referred to as a session key e.g. for that hour day or any defined time frame thereby enabling client computer system to eventually receive the requested media content. Within system the redirection command can include a time sensitive address of the media content location within media delivery point . Accordingly the New York City media delivery point can subsequently provide and deliver the desired media content to client computer system . It is noted that operation of can be performed by media delivery point in a manner similar to content server described herein.

Advantageously by utilizing multiple content servers e.g. media delivery point to provide high fidelity media content to client computer systems e.g. located throughout the world communication network systems of the Internet do not become overly congested. Additionally global network can deliver media content to a larger number of client computer systems e.g. in a more efficient manner. Furthermore by utilizing communication technology having data transfer rates of up to 320 Kbps kilobits per second or higher embodiments of the present invention provide for rapid delivery of the media content in a worldwide implementation.

Referring still to it is noted that media delivery points content servers of global network can be coupled in a wide variety of ways in accordance with the present embodiment. For example media delivery point can be coupled utilizing wired and or wireless communication technologies. Further it is noted that media delivery points can be functionally coupled such that if one of them fails another media delivery point can take over and fulfill its functionality. Additionally one or more web servers similar to web server can be coupled to global network utilizing wired and or wireless communication technologies.

Within system content server media delivery point includes a web infrastructure that in one embodiment is a fully redundant system architecture. It is noted that each of the MDP content servers of global network can be implemented to include a web infrastructure in a manner similar to the implementation shown in MDP .

Specifically the web infrastructure of media delivery point includes firewalls and which are each coupled to global network . Firewalls and can be coupled to global network in diverse ways e.g. utilizing wired and or wireless communication technologies . Particularly firewalls and can each be coupled to global network via a 10 100 Ethernet handoff. However system is not limited in any fashion to this specific implementation. It is noted that firewalls and are implemented to prevent malicious users from accessing any part of the web infrastructure of media delivery point in an unauthorized manner. Additionally firewall can include a device e.g. a router or other switching mechanism coupled therewith and a DB database server coupled to device while firewall includes a device e.g. a router or other switching mechanism coupled therewith and a DB database server coupled to device . Furthermore DB server is coupled with device and DB server is coupled with device .

Still referring to and within media delivery point firewall is coupled to a director device which is coupled to internal web application server and and a hub server . Firewall is coupled to a director which is coupled to internal web application servers and and hub server . Hub server can be implemented in a variety of ways including but not limited to as a Linux hub server. Hub server is coupled to a data storage device capable of storing media content. Data storage device can be implemented in a variety of ways e.g. as a RAID redundant array of inexpensive independent disks appliance.

It is noted that media delivery points can be implemented in any manner similar to content server described herein. Additionally media delivery points of the present embodiment can each be implemented as one or more physical computing devices e.g. computer system of .

In another embodiment CCM can be adapted to be disposed on a media storage device e.g. of . Media storage device can be but is not limited to a CD a DVD or other optical or magnetic storage device. By virtue of disposing a version of CCM on a media storage device embodiments of the present invention can provide copy protection for audio video multimedia graphics information data software programs and other forms of media that may contain copyrighted material and which may be disposed on a media storage device. Alternatively CCM can be adapted to be installed on a computer system e.g. via a media storage device upon which it may be disposed.

In one embodiment CCM MSD is adapted to provide stand alone compliance with copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements applicable to media files that may be disposed on a media storage device e.g. . In another embodiment CCM MSD is adapted to be installed on a computer system e.g. to provide compliance with copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements applicable to media files as described in A D A and A C.

Referring to CCM MSD includes an autorun protocol component for invoking automatic installation of CCM . To deter users from attempts at defeating various features inherent to CCM e.g. the autorun feature CCM s monitoring program agent program verifies that those features that are to be operational are operational and if not CCM prohibits the user from experiencing the contents of the media storage device.

If a user somehow defeats the autorun feature and the user attempts to utilize an application to capture an image of the content the application will make an image of the content on the media storage device which also images the copyright protection contained thereon. As such when the image is played CCM recognizes the copy protection is present and CCM will only allow the user to experience the content when authorized once CCM is installed.

By virtue of the protections as described above provided by CCM users will be able to experience the content of the media storage device in the content s original high quality format thereby obviating the need to compress the media file used on client system . Advantageously the user will no longer need to suffer through poor quality output as a result of severely compressed media files.

It is noted that when adapted to be implemented in conjunction with a secure file format meaning that the format of the file is without proper authorization non morphogenic embodiments of the present invention also provide effective compliance with copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements with secure files formats. CCM can control the types of file formats into which the media file can be transformed e.g. .wav .mp3 etc. .

In one embodiment the autorun feature associated with a media storage device drive e.g. of of client system is activated and operational. Alternatively a notice of required autorun activation within client system may be displayed on the media storage device and or the case in which the media storage device is stored.

In another embodiment if CCM is present or if the user is coupled to a server then messages containing instructions on how to activate the autorun feature of client system may be presented to the user.

In one embodiment autorun protocol component can detect media storage device drives resident on a computer system e.g. .

The following C source code is an exemplary implementation of a portion of autorun protocol component for detecting media storage device drives residing and operable on client computer system according to one embodiment of the present invention.

In another embodiment autorun protocol component can detect whether a media storage device containing media files has been inserted into a media storage device drive coupled with client computer system e.g. drive of . In another embodiment CCM can include instructions for monitoring media storage device drive and upon detection of drive activation CCM determines what type of media storage device has been inserted therein. Subsequently CCM can detect various triggers on the media storage device to invoke its protection e.g. a hidden file on newer media storage devices and or the copyright indicator bit on legacy media storage devices obviating the need for autorun. Upon detection CCM can invoke the appropriate protection for the associated media file.

The following C source code is an exemplary implementation of a portion of autorun protocol component for detecting a media storage device inserted in a media storage device drive residing and operable on client computer system according to one embodiment of the present invention.

Additionally autorun protocol component can also detect changes in media e.g. insertion of a different media storage device . Further other media changes can be detected subsequent to adaptation of the source code including but not limited to detecting a previously accessed media file and or detecting a previously inserted media storage device.

The following C source code is an exemplary implementation of a portion of autorun protocol component for detecting a change in media according to one embodiment of the present invention.

Still referring to CCM MSD also includes a kernel level filter driver for controlling a data input path of an operating system coupled with and operable on client computer system .

CCM MSD also includes a generalized filter driver for controlling ripping and burning applications e.g. Nero Roxio Exact Audio Copy and others thereby preventing such activities.

The following C source code is an exemplary implementation of a portion of generalized filter driver for controlling ripping and burning applications that may be residing on and operable within client computer system in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.

Still referring to CCM MSD includes a CCM analogous to CCM of that is adapted to be installed in client computer system in one or more ways described herein.

In one embodiment kernel level filter driver generalized filter driver and CCM of CCM MSD are automatically installed on client computer system subsequent to insertion of media storage device into a media storage device drive e.g. of . Autorun protocol component as described above detects insertion of media storage device into an appropriate drive and initiates installation of the components e.g. CCM driver and driver . In one embodiment drivers and may be temporarily installed and may be deleted upon removal of media storage device from media storage device drive . In yet another embodiment drivers and may be installed in hidden directories and or files within client computer system . In another embodiment some components of CCM can remain installed on client system e.g. the monitoring program agent program . In still another embodiment other components e.g. the kernel level filter driver can be dynamically loaded and unloaded as necessary in accordance with copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements applicable to the media file.

Embodiments of the present invention utilize software e.g. CCM MSD that is placed on media storage device in conjunction with controlling software CCM installed on client computer system and web server and or content server wherein each component is communicatively coupled with the other via the Internet thereby enabling dynamic updating of CCM in the manner as described with reference to and operation and of .

In the present embodiment CCM MSD provides a stand alone DRM that is far more sophisticated than existing DRM solutions. This is because CCM MSD goes into the data pathway of the operating system operable on client computer system and obtains control of the data pathway e.g. filter driver of rather than exploiting inefficiencies or errors in the computer system.

Advantageously the monitoring mechanism of agent program enables constant morphing of the version of CCM disposed on media storage device by communicating with server and or and utilizing the dynamic update capabilities of global network to readily update that which has been installed on client computer system via media storage device .

In one embodiment the installation is performed clandestine with respect to the user and is initiated by inserting media storage device into an appropriate media storage device drive e.g. a magnetic optical disk drive or alternative device drive coupled with client system . If the user is not registered with CCM as described herein with reference to and once installed CCM initiates an update process with web server and or content server to readily include updates that have been invoked subsequent to release of the media file on media storage device . By virtue of the dynamic update capabilities of CCM regardless of the version of CCM on media storage device CCM provides compliance with copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements applicable to the media file on media storage device . Advantageously enabling dynamic adaptability of CCM provides for continued interoperability with new and updated operating systems advancements in electronic technology communication technologies and protocols and the like ensuring the effectiveness of CCM into the future.

In another embodiment if the user is a registered user with global delivery system CCM can detect which version is most current. Accordingly when the version existing on client system is more current that the version for install on media storage device CCM can bypass the install process and present the contents contained on media storage device to the user for them to experience.

Further advantageous this technology is backward compatible with media storage device drives manufactured subsequent to and including the year 1982. Additionally CCM is compatible with media storage devices having a copyright indicator bit disposed thereon. The copyright indicator bit has been included on all CDs released since the year 1982.

In the present embodiment of the media content is not encrypted on media storage device . In one embodiment if the media content is encrypted on computer it can be decrypted on the computer . However home players and or stand alone media playing devices rarely include a decryption mechanism and to experience the music on a home machine the music is conventionally not encrypted.

In one embodiment an additional component of CCM is that the trigger for agent program may be the copyright bit indicator. This means when the copyright indicator bit is detected by CCM the functions of CCM are initiated. Alternatively in another embodiment when the copyright bit indicator is not detected CCM may remain in an un invoked or idle state. If CCM can detect the copyright bit indicator CCM can provide the appropriate compliance with regard to copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements applicable to the media files.

In an alternative embodiment a trigger control in the table of contents of media storage device includes instructions for triggering autorun protocol of CCM MSD and can utilize the copyright indicator bit or alternative implementation to trigger the technology. In this manner CCM can control copyrighted works while public domain material can be experienced and reproduced at a user s discretion. Because autorun can be problematic for media storage device manufacturers embodiments of CCM MSD can include alternative autorun programs that perform analogous to autorun.

In another embodiment CCM can invoke its own proprietary player e.g. custom media device as described with reference to thus enabling increased control of copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements applicable to the media. By invoking custom media device CCM enables user experience of the media while providing protection against unauthorized reproduction of the media disposed on media storage device .

In an alternative embodiment the media files and the CCM MSD disposed on a media storage device are encrypted. This implementation is particularly advantageous for demonstration demo versions of media files beta test versions and the like that may be disposed on media storage device . It is noted that the present embodiment is operable in an online environment meaning that client computer system is communicatively coupled with web server and or content server to enable a user experience of the content on a demo version of media storage device . In this implementation CCM allows for specific plays for specific users which can be controlled via a network e.g. network of and server and or .

In another embodiment CCM can be implemented for demo and or pre release protection. In this embodiment CCM utilizes sophisticated encryption technology to encrypt the table of contents and CCM with an associated decrypted key located on client computer system . Encrypting CCM can also deter nefarious attempts to reverse engineer CCM . Decryption can be performed using an associated decryption key. Alternatively decryption can be performed by a proprietary or custom media player application resident on demo media storage device e.g. .

The content of media storage device is encrypted using various levels of encryption to provide protection levels commensurate with copyright holder s desires and required protection. For example media storage device is delivered to a user or critic for the purposes of review the user inserts media storage device into the appropriate storage device reader or connector coupled with the journalist s computer e.g. and CCM is installed on client system in a manner clandestine to the user. Once installed CCM initiates a communication session with web server content server where content server can provide authorization for the user to experience the media on media storage device .

Accordingly if the user to whom demo media storage device had been released had demo media storage device stolen or if the user allowed alternative parties to try to experience the content of media storage device the unauthorized party would have to try to crack the encryption keys and the encryption of the actual content of media storage device consuming non trivial amounts of time.

Thus CCM is able to control which users receive authorization to experience the media of media storage device how many times the user may experience the media and CCM may also define a period of time until the media may no longer be accessible. This may enable copyright holders to release the content on an authorized media storage device e.g. prior to pirated copies flooding the market.

Accordingly a demo media storage device may be configured such that a first user may get a copy a second user may get a copy and if it is known that the second user will share the demo with a third and a fourth user then the known users would be enabled to experience the media. Advantageously by virtue of defining which users can access and experience the media any unauthorized sharing of the media by one of the authorized users can be readily detected and further sharing or experiencing of the media may be halted. Additionally because the authorized user shared the media in an unauthorized manner in a worse case scenario criminal charges could be filed against that user.

It is noted that placing CCM MSD on a media storage device e.g. so as to enable installation of CCM on client system is one manner in which CCM can be installed on client system . An alternative manner in which CCM can be installed on client computer system is through cross pollination. For example webcasters broadcast the media file to the user. The media file has a CCM coupled with the media file and upon downloading the media file onto client computer system embodiments of the present invention enable the installation of CCM onto client computer system . In another manner CCM is incorporated into and becomes part of an operating system operational on client system . Alternatively laws are passed that mandate the inclusion of CCM on each client computer system .

Diagram of includes a media storage device media extraction creation application communicatively coupled to operating system input output subsystem via wave in line and wave out line . Operating system input output subsystem is coupled with media storage device class driver via wave in line and wave out line . Media storage device class driver is coupled with filter driver via wave in line and wave out line . Filter driver is coupled with media storage device port driver via wave in line and wave out line . Filter driver is shown to include a switch controlled by CCM via coupling . Media storage device port driver is coupled with media storage device drive via wave line in and wave line out . Media storage device shown to include CCM MSD is receivable by media storage device drive . Additionally CCM is coupled with operating system input output subsystem via wave in line and wave out line .

In one embodiment CCM is coupled to and controls selectable switch in filter driver . Depending upon the copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements applicable to a media file disposed on media storage device CCM controls whether switch is open shown thus preventing the media file from reaching media extraction creation application or closed not shown so as to allow reproduction of the protected media file. Media extraction creation application can be a ripping or burning application such as Nero Roxio Exact Audio Copy or other readily available application.

Continuing with media storage device is received by media storage device drive . CCM determines whether media storage device or media disposed thereon is protected by any copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements e.g. via detection of a copyright indicator bit. CCM communicates with filter driver to control switch accordingly. In the present example reproducing media storage device and or the contents thereon would violate applicable restrictions and or agreements and therefore switch is in an open position such that the output path e.g. wave out line to media extraction creation application is effectively blocked thereby preventing unauthorized reproduction of media storage device .

It is particularly noted that by virtue of CCM controlling switch and therefore controlling wave out line any incoming copyright protected media disposed on a media storage device can be prevented from being reproduced in an unauthorized manner in accordance with applicable copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements related to the incoming media.

Advantageously as new secure or proprietary file formats are developed CCM can be readily adapted to be functional therewith. Further CCM MSD can prevent users from making unauthorized reproductions e.g. recording copying ripping burning etc. of media files. By using kernel level filter drivers e.g. and getting to a low enough level within the operating system OS on client system CCM can detect particular applications and when they request media storage device drive to poll the media file for copying ripping etc. and disable the data input path. CCM in this embodiment deals with the input pathway.

In one embodiment alternative applications that monitor the state of client computer system can enable the autorun functionality of client computer system or alternatively invoke an automatic mechanism similar to autorun to ensure invocation of CCM for compliance of copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements applicable to media storage device and or the copyright protected media disposed thereon.

In one embodiment CCM can invoke a proprietary media player from media storage device or activate a proprietary media player resident and operable on client computer system or an alternative authorized media player resident on client computer system in a manner similar to that described herein with reference to .

When media storage device is a multisession device e.g. a compact disk having a data session and a music session audio tracks and it is inserted into or communicatively coupled with media storage device drive such that its content is accessible CCM views the contents of the media storage device and in some operating systems the audio tracks will not be displayed. Instead the data session is shown as is an autorun file e.g. autorun protocol component and upon clicking invokes a player application. CCM can have a data session and files to which a user may not have access unless a player application is invoked.

In one embodiment the player application could deposit a monitoring portion e.g. agent program on client system which in one embodiment may reside on client computer system subsequent to removal or decoupling of media storage device from media storage device drive .

By virtue of content in a multisession media storage device which may not be directly accessible to most player applications the player application can be invoked which can then install the CCM into client system according to one embodiment of the present invention.

In one embodiment a proprietary media player application is stored on media storage device . However it may not be automatically invoked. Upon some user intervention e.g. inserting media storage device into media storage device drive the media player application is loaded onto client system which has CCM integrated therewith. Thus CCM is launched regardless of autorun being activated or de activated and mandates the user to utilize the proprietary media player application to experience the content of the media e.g. media files on the media storage device .

In an alternative embodiment client computer system has autorun turned off wherein it is common for the user to be unable to play a media file unless a proprietary media player application is invoked. Activating the proprietary media player application can initiate an installation of those components of CCM that are bypassed when autorun is not active.

Advantageously by providing a copyright compliance mechanism e.g. which can be easily and readily installed on a client computer system e.g. one of more embodiments of the present invention can be implemented to control access to the delivery of and the user s experience with media content subject to copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements for example as defined by the DMCA. Additionally by closely associating a client computer system e.g. with the user thereof and the media content received embodiments of the present invention can provide for accurate royalty recording.

In one embodiment usage compliance mechanism can be disposed on a media storage device e.g. . Content disposed thereon can in one embodiment be demonstration and or pre release content. Examples of demonstration and or pre release content can include but is not limited to audio video multimedia graphics information data software programs etc. More specifically demonstration and or pre release content can contain but is not limited to digital movies or music that may be distributed to persons in the related media field for review e.g. a motion picture academy member for their review of a movie a record industry critic to review songs that may be released on a new compact disc etc. . Alternatively demonstration and or pre release content can also contain but is not limited to a beta version of a software program and the like.

Alternatively the content disposed on media storage device can in another embodiment be a commercial release of audio content video content software application etc. Embodiments of the present invention are well suited to be implemented in a commercial environment e.g. public presentation systems such as those in movie theaters auditoriums arenas and the like. Additionally embodiments of the present invention are readily adaptable to be implemented in commercial distribution points e.g. audio video and or software retail and or rental establishments as well as for pay per view and or pay per play implementations.

Further literary works documents graphics such as pictures painting drawing and the like can comprise the content on media storage device . It is noted that a nearly endless variety of demonstration pre release and or commercially released content can be disposed on media storage device .

Referring to usage compliance mechanism UCM includes an autorun protocol for invoking installation of components of UCM on a client computer system e.g. in one embodiment of the present invention. Autorun protocol of is analogous to autorun protocol of . Also included in UCM is a file system filter driver in one embodiment of the present invention.

File system filter driver can in one embodiment be an upper level and or lower level filter for the individual bus devices within client computer system e.g. media storage device drive of and . File system filter driver is enabled to hook onto access to a media storage device drive e.g. a CD drive and intercept data reads associated with accessing the content on media storage device .

File system filter driver includes a decrypter for providing decryption of encryptions applied to encrypted content e.g. encryptions P applied to encryptions N of media content M of in one embodiment of the present invention. Decrypter can provide dynamic decryption of encryptions applied to encrypted media content on a media storage device as the content e.g. M is accessed and read by media storage device drive .

Still referring to UCM also includes a secure media player . Secure media player can be in one embodiment similar to custom media device that is an emulation of the custom media device driver as described herein with reference to FIGS. and B D. Alternatively secure media player may be an alternative media player having controlling properties analogous to custom media device . Secure media player includes a decrypter for decrypting encryption applied to each instance of media disposed on a media storage device e.g. encryptions to N applied to media content to N of respectively. Secure media player also includes a watermarker for watermarking the outgoing data stream. In one embodiment watermarker operates concurrent with secure media player and during player rendering of the content. For example watermarker can attach a serial number e.g. serial number of associated with each media storage device onto the outgoing data stream.

Media storage device of is analogous to media storage device of and . In one embodiment of the present invention media storage device is configured for utilization in conjunction with demonstration and or pre release content.

Media storage device of is shown to have disposed thereon a UCM usage compliance mechanism for controlling presentation of content e.g. media content M disposed on media storage device . The UCM described herein with reference to and is analogous to the UCM described herein with reference to . It is noted that autorun protocol of UCM is in one embodiment disposed on media storage device in a non encrypted format.

Also shown on media storage device is a unique identifier e.g. a serial number for providing a unique identification of the media storage device in one embodiment of the present invention. Unique identifier may be but is not limited to nearly any distinguishable identifying type of indicator e.g. a randomly generated number a sequential number a combination of numbers and alphanumeric characters and the like .

Advantageously by disposing unique identifier on a media storage device it enables close association of the content disposed thereon e.g. media content M with the anticipated recipient e.g. a movie critic a music critic an academy award member a software beta tester etc. of the media storage device. Therefore by closely associating a media storage device e.g. with an anticipated recipient e.g. the user of computer system embodiments of the present invention can prevent unauthorized persons from experiencing content on a media storage device as described herein with reference to A C and .

Further advantageous is that by having unique identifier for each media storage device embodiments also provide security at the media storage device mastering level. This means that an employee working at a mastering facility who dishonestly and or unlawfully purloins a copy of the media storage device is prevented from copying the contents and turning it into bootleg unauthorized versions copies of the media storage device in an attempt to flood the market. Specifically by virtue of each media storage device having unique identifier and each media storage device is associated with its intended recipient persons not associated with a particular media storage device are unable to experience the content thereon. It is noted that while the market may still be flooded with bootleg copies those that acquire a bootleg copy of a media storage device in accordance with the present invention will not be able to experience the content thereon thereby possibly causing the public to be less receptive to the idea of an inexpensive bootleg copy of something that they cannot use.

In one embodiment media storage device may be distributed to its intended recipients in a variety of ways. For example distribution of media storage device to its intended recipients can include but is not limited to postal delivery methods e.g. the United States Postal Service parcel delivery services such UPS United Parcel Service and or Federal Express courier delivery services and the like. In another embodiment the intended recipient of a media storage device may be required to physically pick up device from a distribution point.

Media storage device can include multiple instances of content e.g. media content M in one embodiment of the present invention. Media content M can be any type of digital media content including but not limited to audio video multimedia graphics information data software programs etc.

Still referring to in one embodiment of the present invention each instance of media M is subject to a first encryption e.g. encryptions N respectively. In one embodiment a first decryption key for each encryption e.g. encryptions N may be stored in a server e.g. web server and or content server of and . In one embodiment secure media player can utilize decrypter and the decryption key stored on web server and or content server to decrypt encryptions N during rendering of the content. It is noted that secure media player can be communicatively coupled with web server and or content server during rendering and presentation of the content disposed on media storage device .

Additionally media content M having a first encryption applied thereto e.g. encryptions N can each be subject to a second encryption e.g. encryptions P respectively prior to disposal of media content N on media storage device . In one embodiment a second decryption key to decrypt encryptions P may be stored in a server e.g. web server and or content server of and . In one embodiment file system filter driver can utilize decrypter and the second decryption key stored on web server and or content server to decrypt encryptions P during the reading of the content on media storage device by media storage device drive . It is noted that file system filter driver can be communicatively coupled with web server and or content server during rendering and presentation.

In one embodiment encryptions N can be less computationally intensive encryptions when compared to encryptions P. Alternatively in one embodiment encryptions N can be more computationally intensive when compared to than encryptions P.

There are many available encryption methods that can be implemented as encryptions N and or encryptions P. Examples of encryptions that may be implemented for encryptions N and or P can include but are not limited to triple DES data encryption standard AES advanced encryption standard Blowfish and numerous others. In one embodiment encryptions N and or P can each be comprised of a series and or a mixture of encryptions. A differing encryption e.g. a plurality of randomly generated encryptions can be implemented for each instance of media on a media storage device rather than using one format. In one embodiment numerous variations of Blowfish are utilized to provide the desired encryptions.

It is noted that when the media e.g. of media storage device is encrypted utilizing multiple different encryptions e.g. and the media is more secure against those with dishonest and or unlawful interests. For example a person hacker may attempt to gain access to the content by breaking the second encryption e.g. applied to a media content e.g. . However if they are successful the remaining encryption e.g. remains unbroken by virtue of the differing encryptions. Therefore the person hacker would have to perform the entire encryption breaking process again to access media content on media storage device . Thus after spending non trivial amounts of time breaking two differing encryptions applied to an instance of media e.g. the remaining content on media storage device can still be encrypted each with it own differing multiple encryptions.

Advantageously the monitoring mechanism of agent program enables constant morphing of the version of CCM disposed on media storage device by communicating with server and or and utilizing the dynamic update capabilities of global network to readily update that which has been installed on client computer system via media storage device .

In one embodiment the installation is performed clandestine with respect to the recipient of media storage device and is initiated by inserting media storage device into an appropriate media storage device drive e.g. a magnetic optical disk drive or alternative device drive coupled with client system . Portions of UCM determine if the recipient is registered with web server and or content server . If the recipient is not registered with servers and or as described herein with reference to A C and portions of UCM initiates an installation process as described herein with reference to A C and .

If computer system is registered with servers and or UCM can initiate an update process with web server and or content server to readily include updates that have been invoked subsequent to distribution of media storage device . By virtue of the dynamic update capabilities of UCM regardless of the version of CCM on media storage device UCM provides compliance with copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements applicable to the media content on media storage device e.g. media content M . Advantageously enabling dynamic adaptability of UCM provides for continued interoperability with new and updated operating systems advancements in electronic technology communication technologies and protocols and the like ensuring the effectiveness of UCM into the future.

In another embodiment if the user is a registered user with global delivery system UCM can detect which version is most current. Accordingly when the version existing on client system is more current that the version for install on media storage device UCM can bypass the install process and present the contents contained on media storage device to the user for them to experience.

Further advantageous this technology is backward compatible with media storage device drives manufactured subsequent to 1982. Additionally UCM is compatible with media storage devices having a copyright indicator bit disposed thereon. The copyright indicator bit has been included on all CDs released since 1982.

In the present embodiment of each instance of media is encrypted on media storage device as described herein with reference to . However most home players and or stand alone media playing devices rarely include a decryption mechanism. As such to experience the music on a home machine the music is conventionally not encrypted. Accordingly media storage device in its present embodiment may not be operable on a home and or stand alone media playing device.

In one embodiment UCM can invoke its own proprietary player e.g. secure media player as described with reference to custom media device of thus enabling increased control of copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements applicable to the media content. By invoking a secure media player UCM enables user experience of media content while providing protection against unauthorized presentation or reproduction of the media disposed on media storage device .

Still referring to in one embodiment the media content e.g. media content M and UCM disposed on a media storage device are encrypted with the exception of autorun protocol as described above. In one embodiment of the present invention UCM is encrypted differently than media content M thereby preventing the cracking of one encryption from being utilized on another encryption. This implementation is particularly advantageous for demonstration demo versions of media files beta test versions and the like that may be disposed on media storage device . It is noted that the present embodiment is operable in an online environment meaning that client computer system can be communicatively coupled with web server and or content server to enable a user experience of the content on a demo version of media storage device . In this implementation UCM allows for specific plays for specific users which can be controlled via a network e.g. network and server and or .

In the present embodiment UCM can be implemented for demonstration and or pre release protection of content disposed on a media storage device . However content disposed on media storage device can also be commercially released content e.g. audio video software and the like . In this embodiment sophisticated encryption technology e.g. Blowfish is utilized to encrypt media content M on media storage device with an associated decrypter key located on web server and or content server . In one embodiment a plurality of encryptions are applied to media content M and a plurality of decrypter keys are stored on web server and or content server . Decryption can be performed using an associated decryption key in conjunction with a secure media player and file system filter driver installed on computer system via media storage device .

Still with reference to the content e.g. media content M of media storage device is encrypted using various levels of encryption to provide protection levels commensurate with copyright holders desires and required protection. For example media storage device is delivered to a user or critic for the purposes of review. The user inserts media storage device into the appropriate storage device reader or connector coupled with the recipient s computer and autorun protocol initiates UCM install of CCM file system filter driver secure media player on client system in a manner clandestine to the user. Once installed UCM initiates a communication session with web server content server where content server can provide authorization for the user to experience the media on media storage device .

Accordingly if the user to whom demo media storage device had been released had demo media storage device stolen or if the user allowed alternative parties to try to experience the content of media storage device the unauthorized party would have to try to crack the encryption keys and the encryption of the actual content of media storage device consuming non trivial amounts of time.

Thus UCM is able to control which recipients receive authorization to experience the media content on media storage device how many times the recipient may experience the media and UCM may also define a period of time beyond which the media content may no longer be accessible. This may enable copyright holders to release the media content on an authorized media storage device e.g. prior to pirated copies flooding the market.

Still referring to accordingly a media storage device may be configured such that a first user may get a copy a second user may get a copy and if it is known that the second user will share the demo with a third and a fourth user then the known users would be enabled to experience the media. Advantageously by virtue of defining which users can access and experience the media any unauthorized sharing of the media by one of the authorized users can be readily detected and further sharing or experiencing of the media may be halted. Additionally since the authorized user shared the media in an unauthorized manner in a worse case scenario criminal charges could be filed against that user.

It is noted that by including placing UCM on a media storage device e.g. so as to enable installation of CCM on client system is one manner in which CCM can be installed on client system . An alternative manner in which CCM can be installed on client computer system is through cross pollination. For example webcasters broadcast the media file to the user. The media file has a CCM coupled with the media file and upon downloading the media file onto client computer system embodiments of the present invention enable the installation of CCM onto client computer system . In another manner CCM is incorporated into and becomes part of an operating system operational on client system . Alternatively laws are passed that mandate the inclusion of CCM on each client computer system .

Diagram includes a media storage device drive e.g. coupled with a media storage device file system driver via line . Media storage device drive file system driver enables an operating system e.g. Windows by Microsoft Apple Linux etc. on a client computer system e.g. to recognize and control the media storage device drive . Coupled to media storage device drive file system driver is file system filter driver via line . Coupled to file system filter driver is a secure media player via line . Coupled with secure media player are an operating system media subsystem via line and a media hardware output device via line . UCM is coupled with operating system media subsystem via line .

Media storage device drive of is analogous to media storage device drive of . Media storage device drive is configured to receive a media storage device . In one embodiment drive may be a CD drive and media storage device would be a CD. In another embodiment drive may be a DVD drive and accordingly media storage device would be a DVD and so on. Therefore media storage device drive can when so configured receive any media storage device upon which data or content may be disposed.

File system filter driver can be an upper level and or lower level filter for individual bus devices e.g. media storage device drive within client computer system and is analogous to file system filter driver of . File system filter driver is able to hook onto access of media storage device drive e.g. a CD drive and intercept data reads associated with accessing the content e.g. media content M of media storage device . File system filter driver is also enabled via decrypter and a decrypter key on servers and or to provide dynamic decryption of encrypted media content on media storage device as the content is accessed and read by media storage device drive .

By virtue of file system filter driver operating at a file system level instead of operating at a device drive class level e.g. a CD class level it is able to recognize which files are being accessed from media storage device for a particular operation. Advantageously this obviates the need for a file system to be implemented within a driver for determining whether data that is being read needs decrypting.

Still referring to secure media player is analogous to secure media player of . Secure media player can in one embodiment be a custom media device emulated by a custom media device driver as described herein with reference to . In another embodiment secure media player can be a proprietary player configured for utilization with demonstration and or pre release content disposed e.g. M on a media storage device e.g. . Other authorized media players may also be used to present media content of a media storage device provided the other media players can comply with usage restrictions and or licensing agreements applicable to the media content and provided by secure media player .

Media hardware output device is an appropriate output device for the media content of media storage device . If media content M are audio tracks or songs then output device is an audio or sound card for outputting music via speakers. Alternatively if media content M are video tracks movies literary works software programs etc. then output device is a graphics card for outputting movies text and the like via a display device e.g. of .

Continuing with media storage device is received by media storage device drive . Autorun protocol initiates a process to determine the presence of a usage compliance mechanism and a secure media player e.g. operable on computer system . If either and or both usage compliance mechanism and secure media player are not present on computer system autorun protocol initiates installation of the components as described herein with reference to A D A C and . If UCM and secure media player are both present autorun bypasses the installation thereof. Media storage device file system driver accesses the content e.g. M on media storage device and reads the data.

File system filter driver intercepts the read operation being performed by driver and dynamically decrypts a second encryption e.g. P applied to media content M via decrypter and a second decryption key stored on and retrieved from servers and or . In one embodiment if file system filter driver is not communicatively coupled with server and or thereby enabling retrieval of the second decryption key presentation of the content of media storage device is not permitted.

Continuing with subsequent to the second encryptions P being decrypted media content M which is still encrypted with a first encryption e.g. N respectively is output to secure media player via line . Secure media player in conjunction with UCM communicates with server and or and determines if computer system and the user thereof are authorized to experience media content M. If system and the user thereof are authorized to experience media content M secure media player commences to render the media content for presentation via media hardware output device .

Concurrent with rendering media content secure media player can in one embodiment communicate with server and or and retrieve the decryption key associated with each encryption e.g. N and with decrypter of in order to dynamically decrypt each instance of media e.g. M as the content is being rendered and output via line to media hardware output device .

Because rendered content is vulnerable to capture and or imaging and thus becoming subject to ripping burning copying and the like secure media player can watermark e.g. via watermarker the outgoing data stream that is output to media hardware output device via line . In one embodiment utilizing watermarker the outgoing data stream is watermarked concurrent with the rendering performed by secure media player . Further secure media player can attach a unique identifier e.g. with each rendered media content e.g. M . In one embodiment the unique identifier is a serial number that is attached to each media content e.g. M as it is being rendered and output to media hardware output device . In this manner if the rendered content being output is somehow captured imaged etc. by virtue of the association of unique identifier e.g. serial number with media storage device and the media content disposed thereon e.g. content M and computer system with which the recipient of media storage device is associated unauthorized presentation and reproduction of the media content is prevented.

It is noted that flowchart is described in conjunction with A D A C and to more fully describe the operation of the present embodiment. At operation an autorun mechanism e.g. autorun protocol disposed on a media storage device e.g. is activated in response to a computer system e.g. receiving the media storage device in an appropriate device drive e.g. media storage device drive .

At operation of a monitoring program disposed on media storage device determines if a usage compliance mechanism e.g. UCM is installed on the computer system e.g. which received media storage device . In one embodiment agent programs may perform the determination at operation . However in another embodiment combinations of components of a CCM as described herein with reference to A C may be utilized to perform the determination at operation . If a usage compliance mechanism is not present on computer system at operation process proceeds to operation . Alternatively if a usage compliance mechanism is present on computer system at operation the process proceeds to operation .

At operation a usage compliance mechanism can be installed on computer system . It is noted that the installation of the usage compliance mechanism on computer system at operation may be performed in a wide variety of ways in accordance with the present embodiment. For example the installation can be implemented at operation as described herein with reference to A D A C and but is not limited to such.

At operation a monitoring mechanism e.g. of UCM disposed on media storage device determines if a secure media player e.g. is present and operable on computer system . In one embodiment agent program of CCM of can perform the determination at operation . If a secure media player e.g. is not present and operable on computer system at operation the present method proceeds to operation . Alternatively if a secure media player e.g. is present and operable on computer system at operation the present method proceeds to operation .

At operation of a secure media player e.g. can be installed on computer system . It is noted that the installation of the secure media player on computer system at operation may be performed in diverse ways in accordance with the present embodiment. For example the installation can be implemented at operation as described herein with reference to A D A C and but is not limited to such.

At operation a determination is made as to whether the installation e.g. of a usage compliance mechanism and or a secure media player at operation was successful. If so process proceeds to operation . However if it was determined at operation that the installation at operation was not successful process proceeds to operation .

At operation a determination is made as to whether computer system and the user thereof are authorized to experience media content e.g. M of media storage device . It is noted that the determination at operation may be performed in a wide variety of ways in accordance with the present embodiment. For example the usage compliance mechanism e.g. can communicate with servers and or in networks and or to determine whether computer system and its user are authorized to experience media content e.g. M on media storage device as described herein with reference to operations of and but is not limited to such. If computer system and its user are not authorized to experience the content on media storage device at operation process proceeds to operation . Alternatively if computer system and its user are authorized to experience the content on media storage device at operation process proceeds to operation .

At operation of a determination is made e.g. by UCM as to whether secure media player usage compliance mechanism and computer system are all communicatively coupled with a network e.g. and or in accordance with the present embodiment. If one or more of the conditions are not met at operation the present method proceeds to operation . Alternatively if secure media player usage compliance mechanism and computer system are all communicatively coupled with the network e.g. and or at operation the present method proceeds to operation .

At operation the presentation of content e.g. M of media storage device to the user of computer system is prevented. Alternatively computer system and the user thereof may communicate with the network e.g. and or and attempt to establish credentials and or to re establish a communicative coupling with the network that would allow presentation of the content as described herein with reference to and steps of .

At operation of media content e.g. M of media storage device can be presented to the user of computer system . It is noted that operation can be implemented in a wide variety of ways in accordance with the present embodiment. For example the media content e.g. M on media storage device can be read by media storage device drive . File system filter driver can intercepts the read operation being performed by media storage device file system driver and dynamically decrypts a second encryption e.g. P applied to media content M via decrypter and a second decryption key stored on and retrieved from servers and or . Within an embodiment if file system filter driver is not communicatively coupled with server and or enabling retrieval of the second decryption key presentation of the content on a media storage device is not permitted.

Continuing with an exemplary implementation of operation subsequent to a second encryption e.g. P being decrypted media content M which is still encrypted with a first encryption e.g. N respectively is output to secure media player . In one embodiment secure media player in conjunction with UCM communicates with server and or and commences to render the media content for presentation via a media hardware output device e.g. .

It is noted that concurrent with rendering media content e.g. M secure media player can in one embodiment communicate with server and or and retrieve the decryption key associated with each encryption e.g. N and with decrypter of dynamically decrypt each instance of media e.g. M as the content is being rendered and output the rendered content to media hardware output device .

Since rendered content is vulnerable to capture and or imaging and thus becoming subject to ripping burning copying and the like secure media player can watermark e.g. via watermarker the outgoing data stream that is output to media hardware output device . In one embodiment the outgoing data stream is watermarked concurrent with the rendering performed by secure media player . Further secure media player attaches a unique identifier e.g. with each rendered media content M. In one embodiment a unique identifier e.g. a serial number is attached to each media content e.g. M as it is being rendered and output to media hardware output device . In this manner if the rendered content being output is somehow captured imaged etc. by virtue of the association of unique identifier with media storage device and the media content e.g. M disposed thereon and the computer system with which the recipient of media storage device is associated unauthorized presentation and reproduction of the media content is prevented.

In another implementation embodiments of the present invention can be utilized in a distributed network topology to control media sharing among computer system within the network. Some of the distributed network topologies in which embodiments of the present invention can be utilized are but is not limited to a centralized a ring a hierarchical and a decentralized distributed topology. A decentralized distributed network topology is commonly referred to as a peer to peer P2P network. In a P2P network each computer system node in the network is able to communicate with any other computer system node within the network. A computer system in a P2P network can request data from the network as well as provide data to the network. Thus a computer system can be both a requesting computer system requesting node and a source computer system source node within a P2P network. Additionally there may be a host server or a plurality of host servers present in the network that may be utilized alone or in combination with each other e.g. as an administrative node supernode etc. to provide administrative functionalities to the computer systems therewithin and for providing content to the P2P network.

It is known that many implementations of a distributed network topology e.g. a decentralized topology are not configured to adequately control and or monitor the exchanging or trading of media among computer systems in the P2P network. Embodiments of the present invention provide a novel and inventive solution to this problem.

In one embodiment client node may be implemented in a manner similar to a client computer system as described herein with reference to and . Source node may in one embodiment be a client computer system that makes available to network media content that may be stored therewithin. In another embodiment source node may be a media distribution point MDP as described herein with reference to configured to make available to network media content that may be stored therewithin. By virtue of the functionality inherent to a P2P network source node can function as a client node while client node can function as a source node.

Still referring to administrative node may in one embodiment be implemented in a manner similar to a web server and or content server as described herein with reference to . As such administrative node may also be coupled to a database e.g. database and or of . Accordingly administrative node can in one embodiment be configured to provide management functionalities to a network e.g. network or network of . Types of management functionalities that can be provided by administrative node can include but is not limited to network management user management encryption and decryption key management authorization management media management transaction management player application management and cache management. Administrative node can also be implemented as a source node and or as a media delivery point as described herein with reference to .

Network management can include but is not limited to determining the route through which an instance of media is transferred to another computer system in network . For example and referring to an instance of media is located in a plurality of locations within network e.g. media delivery points San Jose Tokyo and New York City . Client node located in Washington D.C. requests that particular instance of media content. Administrative node is able to determine for this example that the least amount of network resources needed to transfer the media content to requesting client node would be transferring the instance of media content from media delivery point New York City .

It is anticipated that many instances of a particular instance of media may be disposed throughout the network e.g. in which there may be varying degrees of quality among the instances media content. Further it is known that differing source nodes e.g. can have varying rates of transfer. For example a source node may be coupled to network via a digital subscriber line DSL whereas another source node may be coupled to network via a 56K modem which is substantially slower than a DSL connection. Additionally transfer routes that would go through a network connection that may be experiencing downtime or technical difficulties can be rerouted. Advantageously administrative node can incorporate quality of media content connection health and or delivery speed information into its determination from which source node the instance of media is to be delivered.

Still referring to user management in one embodiment can include but is not limited to maintaining and verifying current user information such as user name password billing address valid credit card number valid online payment or alternative electronic payment service MAC media access control address etc. as described herein with reference to and steps of .

In one embodiment encryption and decryption key management includes but is not limited to storing an encryption key associated with a client computer system for use by the client computer system to encrypt media content thereon into an encryption local to that client computer system managing a plurality of intermediate encryption and decryption keys for utilization with media content that is being transmitted to a client computer system etc.

In one embodiment encryption and decryption key management includes but is not limited to storing an encryption key associated with a client node e.g. for use by the client node to encrypt media content thereon into an encryption local to that client node managing a plurality of intermediate encryption and decryption keys for utilization with media content that is being transmitted to a client node etc.

In one embodiment authorization management may include verifying that a client node is authorized to be connected to network thus being associated with the network. Alternatively authorization management may also include but is not limited to authorizing sharing of an instance of media with network that does comply with copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements applicable to the particular instance of media. Furthermore authorization management may include but is not limited to prohibiting sharing of an instance of media with network that does not comply with copyright restrictions and or licensing agreements applicable to the particular instance of media.

Still referring to media management can include but is not limited to storing a list of available instances of media content and its associated location within network storing information related to each instance of media e.g. title artist genre length duration of media content bit pattern information related to a particular instance of media for identification storing information regarding royalty fees where applicable that may be assessed to an instance of media content each time it is transmitted within the network storing information to enable expiring the media content on a computer system when the computer system is no longer authorized to access and or is no longer associated with network and the like.

Additionally media management can also include utilizing an Ethernet filter and other mechanisms to obtain information related to transmitted and or received instances of media instances of media that have recently entered the network and the like. In one embodiment an Ethernet filter may be coupled to a network interface device e.g. coupled to the computer system receiving the instance of media content. It is noted that the network interface may include but is not limited to a modem a NIC network interface card a wireless receiver etc. Information obtained by an Ethernet filter can be used in identifying a particular instance of media determining appropriate royalty fees etc.

In one embodiment transaction management can include generating a transaction for each successful transfer of media content from one node e.g. source to another node e.g. client in the network e.g. from source computer system to client computer system in the network e.g. . In one embodiment the receiving client node acknowledges successful receipt of the media content and accordingly administrative node generates a transaction applicable to the receiving client node and which is associated with that particular instance of media. Since different instances of media content may have differing usage and or royalty fees associated therewith embodiments of the present invention can provide the mechanisms to account for each transfer such as generating a transaction for each transfer generating a payment from the recipient of the instance of media and or delivering an appropriate remuneration to the media content copyright holder.

Advantageously a royalty transaction can also be applied to a copyrighted instance of media where no royalty payment was previously possible. For example assume that a bootleg copy of an artist s live performance has been freely available for years. This bootleg copy may have been made from a portable recorder brought into a live performance and was used to record the performance. In this example a person acquires an analog bootleg copy and converts it to a digital format or acquires a digital format of the bootleg copy. The digital copy is then availed to network for sharing among the nodes coupled therewith. It is noted that when an instance of media enters network it becomes protected as described herein with reference to and .

Accordingly when a client node successfully receives the digital copy a transaction is generated thus invoking a royalty payment when no such royalty payment was previously possible. Advantageously this can provide a means to distribute appropriate remuneration to copyright holders and licensees that would otherwise receive no payment.

Continuing when an instance of media can be freely distributed a transaction is still generated. This advantageously provides a record of the numbers of requests for a particular instance of media the location from where those requests originated and the like thereby providing data which can be utilized in marketing studies and implementing marketing strategies etc.

It is particularly noted that in an alternative implementation embodiments of the present invention can be readily configured to provide a mechanism that can generate a sales use tax transaction related to transfer of a instance of media. Embodiments of the present invention can be readily configured to calculate appropriate sales use tax amounts relative to the location of the receiving client computer system. Advantageously this would enable municipalities counties states and other governmental agencies to increase revenue thus possibly realizing a reduction in a deficit associated with a government. It is anticipated that generating sales use tax transactions could provide from tens to hundreds of millions of dollars in previously untapped revenue to those governmental agencies.

Still referring to player management in one embodiment can include but is not limited to maintaining secure player application integrity adding additional player applications to a list of approved player applications removing player applications that do not meet usage restriction requirements applicable to a media file modification of a secure player application to improve its functionality modification to counteract nefarious hacking attempts disabling the secure player application when the computer system on which it is operable is no longer authorized to participate in or is associated with network etc.

Cache management in one embodiment can include but is not limited to maintaining protected media container file integrity modification thereof to improve functionality or to counteract detected nefarious activities disabling the protected media container file when the computer system upon which the protected media container file is disposed is not authorized to access and or is no longer associated with network .

In the present embodiment client node and source node each have an instance of a usage compliance mechanism UCM coupled therewith. In the present embodiment UCM of and as described with detail in is similar to a copyright compliance mechanism and or a usage compliance mechanism and or as described herein with reference to A D A and or and respectively.

UCM further includes a secure player application a client communication application and a media storage container creator . Media storage container creator is configured to allocate a portion of a memory unit coupled to the computer system in which UCM is installed e.g. and or coupled to the computer system e.g. into which UCM is installed. Media storage container creator utilizes the allocated portion of a memory unit and creates a protected media container file e.g. a custom file system into which received and or availed instances of media e.g. audio files video files multimedia files documents software and the like are stored. It is noted that in one embodiment media content that is stored in a protected media container file not shown is in addition to other encryptions applicable to the instance of media encrypted local to the computer system on which the protected media file container is disposed. In an example an instance of media is stored on both client node and source node of . Accordingly media content is uniquely encrypted local to node and is uniquely encrypted local to node . Additionally in the context of the present invention the term availed and or availing refers to making available to a network e.g. an instance of media that may be stored in a protected media container file.

Still referring to UCM also includes in one embodiment a client communication application . Client communication application is a custom client communication application configured to provide communication functionality between the nodes in a decentralized distributed network e.g. . Alternatively client communication application is also well suited to be implemented in nearly any network including but not limited to network . Client communication application can be a well known and readily available communication application and which may be written in a commonly utilized programming language including but not limited to C C Java Fortran etc.

In one embodiment client communication application is configured to decrypt media content from an encryption local to a computer system on which application is operable. Client communication application can also be configured to encrypt media content into an intermediate encryption for transferring the media content to another computer system communicatively coupled with a network e.g. . Application is additionally configured to decrypt media content that is received in an intermediate encryption from a computer system coupled with network . Client communication application is further configured to encrypt the media content into an encryption local to the computer system on which application is operable.

In one embodiment client communication application can utilize an intermediate encryption key provided by an administrative node e.g. to encrypt the media content into the intermediate encryption for transfer. Application can also utilize an intermediate decryption key also provided by administrative node to decrypt media content that is received in an intermediate encryption from a computer system coupled with network .

In one embodiment client communication application can transmit an indicator or an acknowledge signal indicating that the media content delivered from another computer system in network was successfully received. In one embodiment an acknowledge signal received by administrative node can generate a transaction applicable to the computer system receiving the media content and which is associated with the media content that was received.

Still referring to UCM further includes a secure player application that can be configured to access contents of a protected media container file e.g. an instance of media and provide presentation of the media content to the computer system on which the media content is stored. Secure player application can be further configured to utilize its access to the protected media container file and make available to the network the contents thereof. In one embodiment secure player application can present the media content to the computer system on which it is operable while the computer system is offline e.g. not coupled with network but still associated therewith .

Secure player application can be media type specific such as a secure audio player application for audio files a secure video player application for video files a secure alphanumeric application for text files a secure software player application for software files and so on. It is noted that secure player application can be configured to interact with nearly any media type.

In one embodiment secure player application can be a custom media device which can be an emulation of a custom media device driver e.g. as described herein with reference to and . In another embodiment secure player application can be an approved player application as described herein with reference to .

In an embodiment source node and client node have logged on to network as described herein with reference to and steps of . Client node requests an instance of media from network e.g. shown as communication . Network transfers the request to administrative node which determines the location of an instance of media . Administrative node responds to client node with the location of instance of media shown as communication .

In this example administrative node is cognizant that source node has an instance of media disposed therein. In the present embodiment instance of media content is stored in a protected media container file by memory coupled to source node . Additionally instance of media is encrypted local to source node shown as dotted line encompassing media .

Within source node sends a request to administrative node for an intermediate encryption key to encrypt instance of media for transfer to client node shown as communication . Administrative node transmits an intermediate encryption key e.g. key to source node . Upon receipt of intermediate encryption key by source node a client communication application operable on source node decrypts media from its encryption local thereto e.g. encryption and encrypts media into an intermediate encryption as indicated by dotted line encompassing media .

Still referring to once client communication application on source node encrypts media into intermediate encryption client communication application transmits media in intermediate encryption to client node shown as communication . Upon client node receiving media in intermediate encryption client node sends a request to administrative node for an intermediate decryption key e.g. key shown as communication . Intermediate decryption key enables a client communication application operable on client node to decrypt media from its intermediate encryption . It is noted that until intermediate encryption is decrypted secure player operable on client node is unable to present media to system . It is further noted that if another computer system in network has intercepted media during transfer the intermediate encryption prevents use of media by the intercepting computer system.

Continuing administrative node responds to client node request for an intermediate decryption key and transmits key to client node shown as communication . Once key is received by client node a client communication application operable on system decrypts media out of intermediate encryption and encrypts media into an encryption local to client computer system e.g. encryption encompassing media .

When media has been successfully received by and encrypted into an encryption local to client node e.g. media with encryption client node transmits an acknowledge indicator indicating successful receipt of media shown as communication . Accordingly upon receipt of an acknowledge indictor administrative node generates a transaction applicable to client node and which is associated with media .

Advantageously embodiments of the present invention provide components that enable controlled media sharing in a decentralized distributed network a p2p network e.g. network of and or network of . Further advantageous is that embodiments of the present invention can also track the sharing generate royalties applicable to a receiving computer system and associated with a particular instance of media. Also advantageous is that embodiments of the present invention allow for outside instances of media to enter the network and provide compliance with copyright restrictions and licensing agreements associated with the instance of media.

It is noted that one or more embodiments in accordance with the present invention described herein can be utilized in combination with a delivery system similar to delivery system of . For example any network of one or more of the embodiments in accordance with the present invention can be substituted with a delivery system similar to delivery system . Alternatively a delivery system similar to delivery may be implemented to include any combination of source nodes e.g. client nodes e.g. and or administrative nodes e.g. that operate in any manner similar to that described herein but are not limited to such.

As an overview in one embodiment the Macintosh operating system receives the incoming media from a source such as server . The incoming media passes through the client main thread and is received by the multimedia framework . From that point a codec that knows how to decrypt the MPB encrypted incoming media is activated. The codec will decrypt the incoming media and then pass the decrypted data to a codec for transcoding and then passed to rendering software e.g. AAC MP3 WMA or the like . The multimedia framework will then pass the data to the carbon framework or directly to the audio framework audio HAL for playback to the currently selected output device. The Audio HAL will transfer the audio data across the user kernel boundary adding it into the IOAudioStream mix buffers. In general IOAudioStreams represent the channels of an IOAudioEngine. IOAudioEngines represent a configuration of an IOAudioDevice and IOAudioDevices represent a physical output device. Each IOAudioStream will format and clip its mix buffer into its sample buffer. The IOAudioEngine object negotiates with a specific protocol e.g. USP FireWire or a private protocol to transfer the sample buffers to the device. The samples are transferred over the appropriate physical layers and played.

In general the copyright compliance mechanism of is broken into three parts on the Macintosh operating system of . In one embodiment the three parts include a framework a Codec and a kernel extension . Although three portions of the copyright compliance mechanism are described there may be more or fewer portions on the Macintosh operating system. For example in one embodiment there may be a plurality of frameworks . In another embodiment there may be no kernel extension . In yet another embodiment there may be a plurality of kernel extensions each monitoring a single or a plurality of driver s e.g. drivers . In yet another embodiment there may be more than one Codec or there may be more than one media layer abstraction e.g. multimedia framework monitored by a single Codec .

Referring still to framework is similar in function to that of the application API s of CCM described in detail herein. In general frameworks are used in a Macintosh environment to control various applications which may not be accessible at the kernel level. Frameworks for the Macintosh environment are well known in the art. In one embodiment the framework is attached to a Macintosh operating system on a client computing system e.g. system to implement the MPB interface . In one embodiment the interface includes register unregister enable disable and update calls.

Register of framework occurs when the application informs the operating system O S of its functionality. At register the framework will ensure that all the other components of the CCM are valid e.g. that none have been spoofed added changed removed or the like . In addition the framework will check to ensure that all the components of the CCM are up to date and that a bad boy list is updated if necessary. The framework will then ensure that no bad boy processes are running as described herein . In one embodiment the framework will then verify that all relevant frameworks are in the expected locations and are valid. The framework then opens an initial instance of multimedia framework component which will stay open until unregister. If during the register process a compromise of the CCM system is found all components will be informed. In addition in one embodiment if a compromise of the CCM system is found the framework will decide whether to shut down any media playback operation with or without warning.

With reference still to in one embodiment at enable a monitoring thread will be created. Monitoring threads are independent pieces of code well known in the art. As described herein the monitoring thread will keep a constant eye out for illegal input devices e.g. input devices banned by CCM protocols as detailed herein . In addition the monitoring thread will periodically interact with kernel extension to obtain lower level information. If the monitoring thread finds any illegal input devices the thread will pass back a message to framework . As described in detail herein framework will then disable the media playback operation with or without warning. In general the monitoring thread is similar in function to monitor.exe described herein. The monitoring thread may be updated at start up during a restart or may be updated after start up with changes to take effect after the next restart.

The framework may disable the media playback utilizing any of the methods described in detail herein. For example in one embodiment the framework may inform Codec to disable the media playback capabilities to include encryption decryption capabilities of the media player e.g. Quicktime iTunes Player or other Macintosh O S media players thereby stopping output of the controlled media.

In general the framework in conjunction with Codec will be able to detect any application with taps into the audio framework e.g. illegal applications such as audio hijack or the like at the user level and block their capabilities. For example if the framework detects an illegal application trying to access the core audio framework the framework informs the codec to disable the media playback e.g. stop decryption or the like . In another embodiment the framework will initiate a gate between the illegal application and the core audio framework thereby preventing the illegal application from accessing the media. In general the gate may be any type of switch disconnect etc. such as those described in detail herein.

Referring still to the kernel extension is used to thwart kernel level recorders e.g. wiretap by using an IOProvider IOResources which loads at startup and remains open permanently even though it matches no physical device. In general kernel extension presents a standard IOUserClient interface that will allow any user space process to communicate with it through a private API. In one embodiment the kernel extension will provide unfettered access to the machine s resources and the kernel data space. In one embodiment the kernel extension includes a kernel level driver or a plurality of kernel level drivers which may be turned on or off in contingent with the business rules described in detail herein. By controlling media framework copyright compliance mechanism can prevent unauthorized output of incoming media of .

With the addition of the kernel extension the kernel level sound pathways will be protected by kernel extensions which may be small drivers e.g. the Macintosh version of the shims described in detail herein operating at the kernel level . For example the drive speaker may be unhindered but the kernel extension may use drivers at the driver microphone e.g. the analog hole described herein the driver full duplex the driver Ipod and any other output drivers within the system to control or block output. For example the kernel extension small drivers may provide gates e.g. and which will stop access to the media if the business rules described herein necessitate it. For example depending upon the copyright restrictions and licensing agreements applicable to an incoming media file e.g. kernel extension controls whether gates and are open shown thereby preventing incoming media of from reaching a media recording application or closed not shown to allow recording of incoming media . In addition to utilizing drivers to control gates to access known output drivers within the system in one embodiment kernel extension also includes a kernel driver which may be applied to a driver previously unnamed. For example once the kernel level recorder e.g. wiretap or other illicit Macintosh O S driver is recognized e.g. by monitoring thread kernel extension or the like the kernel extension will prevent access from the kernel recorder via a gate .

In one embodiment as described herein copyright compliance mechanism is shown as being communicatively coupled with a content server e.g. . As described in detail herein in one embodiment incoming media may originate from content server . In another example incoming media may originate from a personal recording electronic device e.g. a MP3 player recorder or similar device coupled to system . Alternatively incoming media may originate from a magnetic optical or alternative media storage device inserted into a media device player coupled to system e.g. a CD or DVD inserted into a CD or DVD player a hard disk in a hot swappable hard drive an SD secure digital card inserted into a SD reader and the like. In yet another example incoming media may originate from another media player application or media recording application. Incoming media may also originate from a satellite radio feed e.g. XM radio a personal communication device e.g. a mobile phone a cable television radio input e.g. DMX digital music express a digital distribution and or a public presentation source via a network Internet or other communication connection pay per view and or pay per play system or a set top box. It is noted that incoming media can originate from nearly any source that can be coupled to system . Regardless of the source of incoming media embodiments of the present invention will prevent unauthorized recording of the media .

With reference now to a flowchart of a process for preventing unauthorized recording of media on a Macintosh operating system is shown in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In one embodiment the media is from a source coupled with the client system wherein the source is from the group consisting of a network a personal communication device a satellite radio feed a cable television radio input a set top box an media device a media storage device a media storage device inserted in a media device player a media player application and a media recorder application.

Referring now to step of and to in one embodiment a compliance mechanism e.g. CCM is registered on a client system having the Macintosh operating system operating thereon. As described herein the CCM may be installed via a network download e.g. from server a CD a Floppy disk a DVD or any other media which may be inserted downloaded or received by the computing system. As described herein the CCM may include a plurality of business rules e.g. copyright sharing access etc. . In addition in one embodiment the CCM business rules may be altered in response to a change in a usage restriction. For example a usage restriction comprising a copyright restriction or licensing agreement applicable to the media.

With reference now to step of and to in one embodiment the CCM includes a framework which is used for validating the CCM on the operating system . In one embodiment the framework will disable audio playback from the multimedia component until the components of the compliance mechanism are validated. Additionally the framework accesses a network e.g. server to ensure that the components of the CCM are up to date. Furthermore the framework establishes a monitoring thread which maintains a constant search for output devices.

Referring now to step of and to in one embodiment a multimedia component for decrypting the media content on the Macintosh operating system is opened by the framework . As described herein the multimedia component may be a media rendering or processing application such as a Quicktime framework iTunes Player or the like.

In one embodiment the CCM may further include a kernel level extension providing kernel level driver information to the framework wherein when an invalid kernel level extension is recognized the framework directs the kernel level extension to selectively restrict output of the media content. In one embodiment the kernel level extension matches no physical device on the client system. In general the kernel level extension recognizes a kernel level recorder capturing an audio stream and informs the framework of the kernel level recorder e.g. wiretap or the like . The CCM may further comprises a bad boy list such as those described herein.

With reference now to step of and the decryption of the media content on the client system having the Macintosh operating system operating thereon is prevented if a portion of the CCM is invalidated.

Thus embodiments of the present invention provide a method that prevents unauthorized recording of media files on a Macintosh operating system. Further embodiments of the present invention provide a method that prevents unauthorized recording of media files on a Macintosh operating system that can be updated over a network. Embodiments of the present invention also provide a method that prevents unauthorized recording of media files on a Macintosh operating system which is compatible with industry standards.
