This application is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 750 019 filed on Mar. 30 2010 now allowed which is related to and claims priority benefits from U.S. Provisional Application Ser.

Many vehicle seats such as those on passenger aircraft buses trains and the like have installed thereon an extendable foot rest or leg rest for the reclining comfort of the passenger. Typically these extendable foot rests or leg rests are located in a stowed position below the seat cushion bull nose.

In certain situations however it is desirable to reduce the length of the cushion bull nose. For example by reducing the overall length of the seat cushion the amount of space between rows of seats may be reduced thus increasing the number of seats that may be included within the same area. In these circumstances the amount of space below the cushion bull nose is not sufficient to adequately stow foot rests or leg rests. As a result these seats do not include leg rests or foot rests which significantly reduces the level of comfort experienced by passengers in these seats.

Because many people must sit and sometimes even sleep for long hours in passenger seats there is a need for a leg rest or foot rest design that can be adequately stowed below more compact seat designs.

Embodiments of the present invention include a leg rest assembly comprising a leg rest pan a first frame a slider bar a second frame and at least one deployment link. An interior surface of the leg rest pan is coupled to the first frame. In some embodiments the first frame includes at least two slides that are coupled to the slider bar. The at least one deployment link is pivotally coupled at one end to an upper pivot bar and pivotally coupled at an opposing end to a vertical support. In some embodiments at least one link extension couples the upper pivot bar to the slider bar.

Some embodiments include a coupling structure with a coupling pivot bar and at least two pivot arms wherein each pivot arm is pivotally coupled at one end to the coupling pivot bar and coupled at an opposing end to the second frame. In other embodiments the leg rest assembly includes at least two seat diaphragm mounts wherein the at least two seat diaphragm mounts are coupled at one end to the coupling pivot bar and coupled at an opposing end to a seat diaphragm. In some embodiments a cushion is coupled to the leg rest pan exterior surface.

In yet other embodiments the leg rest assembly includes a foot rest pan and a frame with at least two foot rest slides. The foot rest pan is coupled to the foot rest slides. In these embodiments the leg rest assembly may also include a foot rest bar. Some embodiments include a recessed area within the cushion that is configured to receive the foot rest bar.

Embodiments of the invention provide leg rest assemblies for use with a vehicle seat. While the leg rest assemblies are discussed for use with aircraft seats they are by no means so limited. Rather embodiments of the leg rest assemblies may be used in vehicle seats or other seats of any type or otherwise as desired.

As shown in the cushion is located adjacent the leg rest pan . The cushion may have any suitable shape that provides sufficient surface area to support a passenger s legs while properly stowing below a vehicle seat . For example the cushion may have a rectilinear or other similar shape. The covering of the cushion may be formed of any suitable material including but not limited to textiles woven or nonwoven fabrics leather synthetic materials plastics or other similar materials. The thickness of the cushion may be determined by the total amount of space available below a passenger seat bull nose to stow the leg rest assembly . The thickness of the cushion typically may range from 0.5 inches to 4 inches. In some embodiments the thickness of the cushion may be approximately 2 inches. The internal composition of the cushion may include any suitable material that provides a comfortable resting location for a passenger s legs while providing a durable material that will withstand repeated usage. The type of internal cushion material includes but is not limited to viscoelastic materials foam materials honeycomb shaped materials cushioning materials or other similar materials. The cushion is coupled to the leg rest pan by any suitable means. For example the cushion may be coupled to the leg rest pan by a releasable fastening means that may allow the cushion to be replaced without the need to remove the leg rest assembly . Alternatively it may be desirable to permanently couple the cushion to the leg rest pan via glue or other similar attachment means that may improve the useful life of the cushion .

The leg rest pan has a shape that generally conforms to the shape of the cushion . The leg rest pan is formed of aluminum stainless steel other metallic materials composite materials or other similar materials that provides sufficient strength to withstand the load exerted by a passenger s legs. In some embodiments the leg rest pan may include a design having multiple apertures throughout the surface to reduce the amount of weight created by the leg rest pan . The leg rest pan may also include at least two flanges that are coupled to the upper and lower edges of the leg rest pan .

The lower pivot bar is pivotally coupled to the second frame . The second frame is shaped to fold within the confines of the first frame when the leg rest assembly is stowed. The second frame is likewise constructed of any suitable material including but not limited to aluminum stainless steel other metallic materials composite materials or other similar materials. The second frame is formed by the lower pivot bar two side bars and an upper pivot bar . The second frame may also include support bars that provide additional structural integrity to the second frame . The upper pivot bar is coupled to a slider bar via link extensions . The slider bar is in turn coupled at each of its ends to slides that are positioned adjacent each side bar .

The upper pivot bar is coupled to the deployment link . The deployment link is constructed of any suitable material including but not limited to aluminum stainless steel other metallic materials composite materials or other similar materials. The deployment link is in turn coupled at its opposing end to the mounting structure .

As shown in the mounting structure includes a pivot bar at least two pivot arms at least one vertical support and at least two seat diaphragm mounts . Each pivot arm is coupled at one end to the pivot bar and at its opposing end to the second frame .

Each vertical support may include a slot through which the pivot bar passes. The slots allow a seat diaphragm as illustrated in to articulate during recline while keeping the mounting structure rigid. However the vertical support may be coupled to the pivot bar in any suitable manner that allows the seat diaphragm to articulate during recline. In some embodiments as shown in each vertical support may also be coupled at its lower end to a baggage bar via a baggage bar mount . The baggage bar mount provides additional coupling locations to the baggage bar below the vehicle seat . The secondary attachment to the baggage bar may provide additional load distribution between the seat diaphragm and the baggage bar should the load on the seat diaphragm require additional support. The end of the deployment link is pivotally coupled to a point along the length of the vertical support .

Finally in some embodiments each seat diaphragm mount is coupled at one end to the pivot bar . The opposing end of each seat diaphragm mount is then coupled to the seat diaphragm of the vehicle seat . The seat diaphragm mounts may be coupled to the seat diaphragm via any appropriate fastening device including but not limited to pull pins snaps screws or any other device that provides for easy removal and access to the areas under the vehicle seat .

By coupling the leg rest assembly to the front of the seat diaphragm as illustrated in the leg rest assembly moves with the seat diaphragm throughout the recline motion. As a result the cushion and the passenger seat bull nose maintain a desirable orientation to one another for maximum comfort when the leg rest assembly is deployed. When the seat is reclined while the leg rest assembly is in a stowed position as shown in the leg rest assembly is tilted forward but remains stowed behind a vertical line tangential to the edge of the passenger seat bull nose .

In some embodiments the leg rest assembly is actuated via a gas spring . Deployment of the leg rest assembly is automatic when a passenger actuates the gas spring . A passenger actuates the gas spring by pulling a lever or pushing a button that is connected to the gas spring via a cable or other similar mechanical fastening device. When the lever or button is engaged the cable releases a valve on the gas spring allowing a piston to move within the gas spring . When the lever or button is released the valve on the gas spring closes and the piston is no longer allowed to move within the gas spring . Because the gas spring is in a compressed position when stowed the stored energy of the compressed gas forces the piston to move upward when the lever or button is engaged thereby automatically deploying the leg rest assembly . In other embodiments the leg rest assembly deployment and stowage may be controlled by an electrically operated deployment where the passenger uses a display screen or electrical switch to deploy and stow the leg rest assembly .

The gas spring is pivotally coupled at a lower end to the vertical support . The gas spring is then pivotally coupled at the upper end to the deployment link . In this manner the gas spring applies force to the deployment link that is coupled to the frame structure . The deployment link then deploys the frame structure . The deployment link also engages the link extensions to cause the slider bar to move to the lower ends of slides . The lower position of slider bar causes the leg rest pan to adjust to a deployed position so that the plane of the exterior surface of the cushion is tangentially aligned with the curve of the passenger seat bull nose . The alignment between the cushion and the passenger seat bull nose provides a comfortable support and transition between the passenger s thigh and calf.

To return the leg rest assembly to its stowed location a passenger again actuates the gas spring by engaging the lever or button that is connected to the valve on the gas spring . While releasing the valve allows the piston to move within the gas spring there is no stored energy within the gas spring in a deployed orientation. Thus the passenger must press the leg rest assembly back into its stowed position while engaging the lever or button. When the leg rest assembly has reached its stowed position the passenger then releases the lever or button which closes the valve on the gas spring and prevents the piston from moving within the gas spring .

Some embodiments of the present invention include an extendable foot rest mechanism as shown in . In some embodiments the foot rest mechanism may be located between the leg rest pan and the frame structure . In other embodiments the foot rest mechanism may be located in any suitable location that allows the foot rest mechanism to extend a sufficient distance to properly support a passenger s legs without impairing the compact stowing capabilities of the leg rest assembly .

In some embodiments the foot rest shroud may be formed of similar material used for the covering of the cushion which includes but is not limited to textiles woven or nonwoven fabrics leather synthetic materials plastics or other similar materials. The foot rest shroud may optionally include additional internal material to provide additional support between the passenger s legs feet and the foot rest pan . The type of internal cushion material includes but is not limited to viscoelastic materials high density foam or other similar materials. In some embodiments where the foot rest mechanism is located between the leg rest pan and the frame structure the thickness of the foot rest shroud may be limited by the space between the leg rest pan and the frame structure . However the foot rest shroud may be coupled to the foot rest pan in any appropriate location and by any suitable means. For example the foot rest shroud may be coupled to the foot rest pan by a releasable fastening means that may allow the foot rest shroud to be replaced without the need to remove the leg rest assembly . Alternatively it may be desirable to permanently couple foot rest shroud to the foot rest pan via glue or other similar attachment means that may improve the useful life of the foot rest shroud .

The foot rest pan has a shape that generally complements the shape of the foot rest shroud . The foot rest pan may be formed of any suitable material including but not limited to aluminum stainless steel other metallic materials composite materials or other similar materials that provides sufficient strength to withstand the load exerted by a passenger s legs. In some embodiments the foot rest pan may include a design having multiple apertures throughout the surface to reduce the amount of weight created by the foot rest pan . The foot rest pan may also include flanges along the side edges of the foot rest pan . The flanges are substantially parallel to flanges of the foot rest shroud . However the width of foot rest pan is dimensioned such that a space is created between the flange and the flange .

The foot rest pan is then coupled to the at least two foot rest slides . Each foot rest slide include a stationary portion and a sliding portion . The stationary portion has an internal surface that is configured to confront the support bar of the frame structure . The stationary portion may be coupled to the support bar via any suitable mechanical fastening device including but not limited to rivets screws or other similar devices. The stationary portion also has a stationary mating surface that is configured to confront a sliding mating surface of the sliding portion . The stationary mating surface and the sliding mating surface are mounted via any suitable manner that allows sliding portion to travel along the length of stationary portion without becoming disconnected from the stationary portion . For example sliding portion may include a series of male projections not shown that are inserted into a female receptacle track not shown so as to allow the sliding portion to remain slidingly coupled to the stationary portion .

The sliding portion also has an external surface that is configured to contact the flanges of the foot rest pan . The flanges may be coupled to the external surface via any suitable mechanical fastening device including but not limited to rivets screws or other similar devices. In one embodiment the flange also includes a projection extending outwardly from the flange into the space between the flange and the flange . The spring is positioned in the space between the flange of the foot rest pan and the flange of the foot rest shroud . The spring is coupled at one end to the upper bar and coupled at an opposing end to the projection . The flange is positioned adjacent the spring to conceal the spring and the projection from view from above or the sides when the foot rest mechanism is in use.

The foot rest bar is pivotally coupled to a location on the flange below the projection . The foot rest bar may have any appropriate shape that provides a structure to accommodate a passenger s feet while being retractable into the leg rest assembly when not in use. For example the foot rest bar may have any shape including but not limited to rectilinear curved oval or other similar shape. Moreover the foot rest bar may have any appropriate surface design including but not limited to an aperture surrounded by a frame a solid surface having multiple apertures throughout the surface mesh wire or any other appropriate surface. The foot rest bar is constructed of any suitable material including but not limited to aluminum stainless steel other metallic materials composite materials or other similar materials. In some embodiments the foot rest bar may be coated or covered by a protective material including but not limited to soft plastic elastomer extrusions.

In some embodiments the existing components of the leg rest assembly may be slightly modified to accommodate the addition of the foot rest mechanism . For example in some embodiments the cushion includes a recessed area that is shaped to receive and stow the foot rest bar . The recessed area may have any appropriate shape including but not limited to rectilinear curved oval or other similar shape. While the recessed area may have any appropriate depth the maximum depth is determined by the thickness of the cushion whereas the minimum depth is determined by the thickness of the foot rest bar .

As shown in the cushion may also include an aperture to allow placement of the mechanical control lever to operate the foot rest mechanism . The aperture may have any appropriate shape that allows a passenger to access the mechanical control lever . The mechanical control lever is then coupled to the leg rest pan via any suitable mechanical fastening device including but not limited to rivets screws or other similar devices.

To release the foot rest mechanism a passenger engages the mechanical control lever . The mechanical control lever is coupled to a mechanical control which is in turn coupled to the foot rest pan and releasably coupled to the frame . Engagement of the mechanical control lever operates to disengage the mechanical control from the frame . When the mechanical control is disengaged from the frame the sliding portions are capable of moving relative to the stationary portions of the foot rest slides so that the foot rest mechanism is free to slide. To extend the foot rest mechanism from a retracted position the passenger places pressure on the foot rest bar to overcome the force of the springs while continuing to engage the mechanical control lever . When the foot rest mechanism is at the desired extended position the passenger releases the mechanical control lever which in turn engages the mechanical control to the frame to restrain the movement of the sliding portions relative to the stationary portions of the foot rest slides so that the foot rest mechanism is no longer free to slide.

To retract the foot rest mechanism the passenger actuates the mechanical control lever again disengaging the mechanical control from the frame to allow the sliding portions to move relative to the stationary portions of the foot rest slides so that the foot rest mechanism is free to slide. The springs then operate to retract the foot rest mechanism into the retracted position. When the foot rest mechanism is fully retracted the passenger releases the mechanical control lever which in turn engages the mechanical control to the frame to restrain the movement of the sliding portions relative to the stationary portions of the foot rest slides so that the foot rest mechanism is no longer free to slide.

In other embodiments a gas spring may perform both the mechanical and braking features of the foot rest mechanism . In yet other embodiments the foot rest deployment and stowage may be controlled by an electrically operated deployment where the passenger uses a display screen or electrical switch to deploy and stow the foot rest mechanism .

The leg rest pan may include both flanges and flanges where flanges are coupled to the leg rest pan along the upper and lower edges and flanges are coupled to the leg rest pan along side edges . The flanges extend along the outer sides of the upper bar and the lower pivot bar and the flanges extend along the outer sides of the side bars . The leg rest pan is then coupled to the first frame via mechanical fastening devices such as rivets screws or other similar devices. In some embodiments the flanges have been shortened to accommodate attachment of the foot rest mechanism to the frame structure .

As shown in in this embodiment the frame structure no longer requires the use of the second frame . Instead the slides are relocated to the bottom ends of the side bars . By relocating the sliding surface to the bottom of side bars the slider bar is eliminated and the support bars and the link extensions are coupled directly to the upper bar . The pivot arms of the mounting structure are then coupled directly to the slides in their modified location. The vertical support is also coupled to the upper pivot bar . In some embodiments the upper pivot bar has a U shaped configuration to provide for additional space for operation of the two foot rest slides . However one of skill in the art will understand that the upper pivot bar may have any suitable shape.

By relocating the slides to the bottom ends of the side bars vertical support moves to the upper end of the slides during deployment causing the leg rest assembly to travel away from the seat . The link extensions still push the leg rest pan out so that the cushion is tangentially aligned with the curve of the passenger seat bull nose but a larger space is formed between the cushion and the passenger seat bull nose . By changing the direction that the leg rest assembly travels during deployment the amount of distance needed for the foot rest mechanism to travel is minimized. In some embodiments the leg rest assembly travels at least 1 inch to provide added length for the foot rest mechanism . In other embodiments the leg rest assembly travels at least 2.5 inches to provide added length for the foot rest mechanism . In yet other embodiments the leg rest assembly may have no significant downward movement during deployment.

The foot rest mechanism may be deployed after the leg rest assembly has been deployed. A passenger first rotates the foot rest bar out of its recessed area within the cushion . The passenger then actuates the mechanical control lever that allows the passenger to extend the foot rest mechanism from its recessed position until the foot rest bar reaches a desired position.

The foregoing is provided for purposes of illustrating explaining and describing embodiments of the present invention. Further modifications and adaptations to these embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art and may be made without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention.
