These and other aspects their implementations and other features are described in detail in the drawings the description and the claims.

Although the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to multiple embodiments it will be understood by persons skilled in the relevant art that various changes in form and details can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

Referring to a network based image service system provides services for image sharing image storage and image project creation via wired or wireless networks over the Internet . The network based image service system can be managed by a service provider such as Shutterfly Inc. The network based image service system can be in communication with a plurality of devices owned by a user or a user s family members such as a computer e.g. an iMac a computer Window based a mobile phone e.g. an iPhone an Android phone etc. a tablet computer e.g. iPad or wearable devices e.g. digital watch .

The network based image service system can include a data storage and can include or be in communication with a product fulfillment center. A user can upload images to the network based image service system . The images can be organized and stored in image albums . The network based image service system also provides tools such as a web interface or client application to allow users to create image product designs and image projects . The image products can be fulfilled for the users by fulfillment centers within or in connection to the network based image service system . Examples of image products include photobooks photo cards and stationeries photo calendars photo gifts photo collages photo home decors etc. Examples of the image projects can include photo stories photo slideshows digital scrapbooks virtual greeting cards and videos produced from images.

The network based image service system includes a registry server and a transaction server . The registry server is in communication with cloud storages . The cloud storages can be enabled by the same service provider for the network based image service system or a third party service provider such as Dropbox Carbonite and Amazon . The cloud storages enable users to store and share files and folders across the Internet using file synchronization. For example the cloud storages can allow users to store and retrieve files from variety of desktop laptop and mobile devices such as the computers the mobile phone and the tablet computer .

The registry server can also be in communication with a social network e.g. Facebook . A user of the network based image service system can also be a user of the social network . The user s account at the social network can be registered at the network based image service system .

Conventionally photos are captured by cameras and transferred to computers and then uploaded to the network based image service system . A major trend in digital imaging is that photos are captured and stored by an increasing number of smart devices such as the mobile phone the tablet computer or wearable devices and received and stored at different sites such as the cloud storage and the social network in addition to the computers and the network based image service system . As a result managing and finding photos have become a difficult task.

In accordance with the present invention to help a user to access and manage all her photos or photos taken by her family the plurality of devices that a user or her family owns are registered at the network based image service system such as Shutterfly Inc. For example the computers the mobile phone and the tablet computer can be registered in a registry to allow the network based image service system to provide communications and facilitate data transfers among these devices.

Referring to a user interface can be implemented on the computers the mobile phone and the tablet computer to facilitate secure communications with the registry server in the network based image service system . The user interface can be implemented by a client application in the computer which includes a mobile application in the mobile phone or the tablet computer . The user interface allows a user to register the user s or her family s devices at the network based image service system . For example the registry can include the computers the mobile phone and the tablet computer as well as the user or her family s accounts at the cloud storages and the social network . The registry can be private for the user or her family members or close friends.

In registrations the client application on the computer or the mobile phone or the tablet computer receives an authenticated token and a registration ID from the registry server . The communications and data transfer between the devices can be kept private by using secure protocols such as TCP and Http.

Once a device or cloud storage or social network is registered in a registry whenever the device is on the device can establish communications with the registry server using its authenticated token and registration ID. The client application regularly or frequently sends notifications to the registry server to inform that the device is on and is available for image data transfers. The availability status of the devices is represented and visible on a user s device as shown in and described below.

When user starts an image project or product design such as a photobook or a photo calendar at a registered device such as the computer the user can incorporate images from the local drive or a plurality of registered devices or systems. The client application on the device the registry server and the transaction server allow the user to review and select images from the computer as well as her or her family s other devices.

Referring to a user interface is provided on the computer e.g. an iMac to enable the user to view and select photos stored on a local drive . The user interface also allows the user to access the network based image service system to retrieve and use some of the content in the image albums image product designs and image projects for a new project. The user can start an image project on the computer as described above or retrieve and continue an unfinished image project already stored in the user s account in the network based image service system .

In addition referring to the user account at the network based image service system the devices cloud storages user account in a social network registered in the registry are graphically represented at the user interface . Since the devices such as the computer the mobile phone the tablet computer and cloud storages and the social network are already registered they can appear on the user interface on the computer just like the local diver . The availability status can be indicated by a solid full color graphic symbol representing the respective devices or by for example a star symbol next to the graphic symbol of the respective devices. If a registered device happens to be off or off line that device can be shown in grey or with the star symbol not shown on the user interface and the data in that device is temporarily not available.

The user can select one of the registered devices e.g. the mobile phone by clicking with a mouse touching a touch sensitive screen etc. to browse images in the selected device e.g. the mobile phone . Upon receiving a browsing command from the computer the registry server notifies the transaction server . A transaction session is set up and a session ID is assigned. The transaction server sends a request to the selected device e.g. the mobile phone to upload thumbnail images for the images and image folders to the transaction server which are then sent to the client application of the computer via the registry sever . The thumbnail images are displayed at the user interface . When an image is clicked at the user interface on the computer a high resolution image can be uploaded from the selected registered device e.g. the mobile phone to the transactions server and then downloaded to the computer . In the present disclosure a high resolution image refers to images in screen resolution or full original resolution. A thumbnail image is typically used as a small icon to graphically represent an image file.

Similarly if a user selects cloud storage or a social network file folders or image albums in the user s account on these systems will be downloaded to the transaction server via a predetermined Application Programming Interface API and then made available to be shown at the user interface on the computer .

As such the user can browse and select photos from all registered devices at the user interface on one of the registered devices. The user can drag and drop the selected photos from other devices into the computer to incorporate into her image project. A similar user interface can be provided on other devices for the user or her family member to use all the photos stored in the network of devices and user accounts as registered in the registry .

The image project and the image product include images as well as design components such as text image borders image edit properties e.g. cropping color enhancement image border red eye removal image rotation image background embellishment . . . . Examples of the image projects and image products include photobooks greeting cards photo calendars stationeries photo gifts photo posters photo collage photo d cor etc. The metadata tags and keywords can include descriptors occasions events image capture times image upload times image capture locations image edit properties image captions image borders access levels for different users see details below associated with the images the product designs and the image projects .

Once the design of an image project or an image product is created the high resolution or full resolution versions of the images used in the design for the image project or the image product are transferred from the respective registered devices the cloud storage or the social network to the transaction servers in the network based image service system . The full size images are then stored in the data storage .

The user can order an image product based on the image project from the network based image service system . The user can also share image project with others. The image project can be saved in the computer or any other devices or accounts in the registry . The image project can also include a photo story video photo greeting cards photo stationery photo gifts etc.

In accordance to the present disclosure a client application on a registered device performs at least two important functions first providing secure communications between the registered device and the registry server and secondly upon receiving a request uploading selected images from the registered device to the transaction server. Referring to the process of selecting and acquiring images from a group of devices can include one or more of the following steps a group of devices or systems e.g. user accounts at cloud storage or a social network that belong to one or more users are registered at a network based system step . The registration can involve assigning registration ID and authenticated token for each device and authenticate user accounts at the systems. The registrations are important to create secure and constant communications between the devices and systems such that users can view all image sources as if they are on local memory or local hard drives.

The network based system frequently receives frequent notification from the registered devices and systems about the availability of the registered devices and systems step . A local storage one or more second registered devices one or more cloud storages and a social network are graphically represented on a first registered device step . The availability status of the second registered devices one or more cloud storages and a social network are indicated on the first registered device step . If the availability status of the second device or cloud storage or social network indicates that it is available a user can command to browse on the first registered device images stored on a second registered device or system in the group of registered devices cloud storage or social network step . The network based system requests the second registered device cloud storage or social network to transfer thumbnail versions of the images to the network based image service system and then transfer the thumbnail images to the first registered device step . The thumbnail versions of the images from the second registered device or cloud storage or social network are displayed on the first registered device step .

The user is allowed to select on the first registered device one or more images on the second registered device cloud storage or social network step . The network based system then requests the second registered device or cloud storage or social network to transfer high resolution images to the network based image service system and then to transfer the thumbnail images to the first registered device step so that the high resolution images can be used in the design of the image project or image product. Optionally the high resolution or full resolution versions of the images are displayed on the first registered device. After the image project or image product is created the high resolution or full resolution versions of the images used are transferred from respective registered devices cloud storage or social network to be stored at the network based image service system step so that the full resolution images can be used for printing sharing etc. Optionally the high resolution or full resolution versions of the images are stored on the first registered device. The user can create an image project or a design of an image product using images stored in the first device the second device the cloud storage and or the social network step .
