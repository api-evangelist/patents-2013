This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 705 566 entitled Quantum Based Information Transmission System and Method filed Feb. 12 2010 by Ronald E. Meyers and Keith S. Deacon the inventors herein which in turn claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 11 196 738 filed Aug. 4 2005 which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7 646 797 on Feb. 9 2010 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 598 537 filed Aug. 4 2004 all three of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

This invention relates in general to methods and apparatus for processing compression and transmission of data based upon quantum properties and in particular to high density transmission of data employing the quantum teleportation of information as the means to transfer quantum information from the sender to the receiver. Quantum teleportation of information is linked to the property of quantum entanglement. Quantum entanglement can exist between any two quantum systems such as between two photons two atomic ionic systems or between a photon and an atom ion based quantum system. Prior art is a layout for the demonstration of DLCZ protocol 1 wherein atoms L and R are entangled and a Bell state measurement is performed with detection by detectors D and D. In a phase stable scheme is proposed for entangling distant atomic ensembles through two photon Hong Ou Mandel type interference. Note that a Bell state measurement is depicted in the center of .

The combination of combining the data compression of application Ser. No. 12 705 566 entitled Quantum Based Information Transmission System and Method with the teleportation of quantum information provides an efficient use of the quantum entanglement resources.

Generally speaking quantum computing represents a revolutionary frontier technology undergoing intense development. Quantum computing for example may render classically intractable computations feasible. In spite of theoretical calculations showing enormous efficiency increases for quantum computers relative to classical computers such improvements have made slow progress. Transmission of voice image video and holographic signals in a lossy extremely highly compressed format would impact a variety of fields of human endeavor. As the usage of cell phones television signals and internet communications crowds the bandwidth available there exists a need for compression of data communications.

As disclosed in application Ser. No. 12 705 566 entitled Quantum Based Information Transmission System and Method one compression technique in quantum communication is the usage of qubits which are units of quantum information that may be visualized by a state vector in a two level quantum mechanical system. Unlike a binary classical bit a qubit can have the values of zero or one or a superposition of both. A qubit may be measured in basis states or vectors and a conventional Dirac symbol is used to represent the quantum state values of zero and one herein as for example 0 and 1. For example on a physical qubit this may be implemented by assigning the value 0 to a horizontal photon polarization and the value 1 to the vertical photon polarization. The pure qubit state is a linear superposition of those two states which can be represented as combination of 0 and 1 or q A 0 B 1 or in generalized form as A 0 and B 1 where Aand Brepresent the corresponding probability amplitudes and A B 1. is a diagrammatic visualization of a three qubit quantum binary tree which has an information storage index space equivalency to eight classical bits i.e. 3 qubits provide an index space of 8.

Unlike classical bits a qubit can exhibit quantum properties such as quantum entanglement which allows for higher correlation than that possible in classical systems. When entangled photon pairs are split the determination of the state such as polarization or angular momentum of one of the entangled photons in effect determines the state of the other half of the entangled photon pair since entangle photon pairs are the conjugates of one another.

Quantum teleportation of information has the capability to transfer the information of one quantum state from a sender to a receiver using a joint measurement known as a Bell state measurement and the transmission to the receiver of two bits of classical information which informs the receiver of the operation they need to perform on their remaining portion of the initially entangled quantum pair to reproduce the state of the quantum system that the sender transferred or teleported. Thus using two classical bits the quantum information contained in a single qubit involving multiple bits of information unrelated in nature to the two bits may be transferred from the sender to a receiver.

The present inventive method provides inter alia a method for higher correlation of data through the usage of entangled photons. As disclosed in application Ser. No. 12 705 566 entitled Quantum Based Information Transmission System and Method a preferred methodology comprises splitting a wave function representative of an input data set into an arbitrarily oriented elliptical polarization state and a comparator wave function state the comparator wave function state being transmitted to a detector or receiver . In preferred embodiments shown in a quantum Fourier transform is performed on the arbitrarily oriented elliptical polarization state using optical components comprising interferometers or as depicted in the respective figures to yield a quantum computational product. A quantum Hadamard transform may be performed on the quantum computational product to yield one of two possible quantum particle outputs via half wave plate . Through feedback circuitry the input data set is processed based upon the coincident arrival of the comparator wave function state and one of the two quantum particle outputs. Data compression and transmission in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention may be performed on either a quantum computer or a digital computer.

A preferred embodiment provides for transfer of information using qubits. A quantum tree formed of qubits is depicted in A B and C. In the example shown 3 qubits are used. However the number of qubits may be changed without departing from the scope and principles of the present invention. As the first qubit is transmitted a measurement takes place and the result is inputted into computer illustrated in et seq. Based upon this measurement as illustrated by the decision tree of either the left L or right R portion of qubit is not used or transmitted . Following the transmission of the portion of qubit another measurement takes place and the result is inputted into computer . Based upon this measurement as illustrated by the decision tree of either branch A or A is followed. In the example shown in where the first and second measured values were zeroes the qubit portions represented by the nodes at the dotted line branches are unused and not transmitted.

Due to the properties of the qubits a preferred embodiment system employs the quantum Fourier transform QFT and a classical or quantum inverse Fourier transform in the measurement process. Data inputted in the form of a wave function generated using for example amplitudes of a given signal is converted into a quantum state or qubits over which in a preferred embodiment of the present invention transforms such as the quantum Fourier transform QFT operate. The conversion of the wave function to a quantum state represented by qubits is described for example in Gui Long Yang Sun Efficient scheme for initializing a quantum register with an arbitrary superposed state Physical Review A Volume 64 014303 2001 hereby incorporated by reference . The quantum Fourier transform is implemented by a series of optical elements implementing quantum operations followed by a measurement as described for example in Robert B. Griffiths et al. Semiclassical Fourier Transform for Quantum Computation Physical Review Letters Apr. 22 1996 hereby incorporated by reference . Although a particular embodiment is described other equivalent formulations processes and configurations are encompassed within the scope of the invention.

In terms of data flow a preferred methodology comprises splitting a wave function representative of an input data set into an arbitrarily oriented elliptical polarization state and a comparator wave function state the comparator wave function state being transmitted to a detector. In a preferred embodiment a quantum Fourier transform is performed on the arbitrarily oriented elliptical polarization state to yield a quantum computational product. A quantum Hadamard transform is performed on the quantum computational product to yield one of two possible quantum particle outputs. Through feedback circuitry the input data set is processed based upon the coincident arrival of the comparator wave function state and one of the two quantum particle outputs. Data compression and transmission in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention may be performed on either a quantum computer or a digital computer.

A data communication system operating on quantum computation principles includes a light source having a photon output coding an input data set. A Type I or Type II nonlinear crystal converts the photon output into an entangled photon output. An arbitrarily oriented polarization state is assured by passing the entangled photon output through a polarization modulator and a phase modulator . A polarization interferometer performs a controlled phase shift transform on the arbitrarily oriented polarization state as an interferometer output. A halfwave plate then performs a quantum Hadamard gate transform to generate one of two possible photon states from the interferometer output thus completing the operations required for a quantum Fourier transform. Coincidence electronics reconstruct the input data set a distance from the light source. The reconstruction is based on the coincident arrival of the one of two possible photon states and at least one of the entangled photon output or the interferometer output. The result is then fed back via computer and associated circuitry whereupon the computer in conjunction with polarization modulator and a phase modulator based upon the branch determinations processes only portions of the succeeding qubits resulting in reduction in the amount of data which is transmitted.

The embodiments of the invention and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. It should be noted that the features illustrated in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale. Descriptions of well known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments of the invention. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments of the invention may be practiced and to further enable those of skilled in the art to practice the embodiments of the invention. Accordingly the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments of the invention.

The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to limit the full scope of the invention. As used herein the singular forms a an and the are intended to include the plural forms as well unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms comprises and or comprising when used in this specification specify the presence of stated features integers steps operations elements and or components but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features integers steps operations elements components and or groups thereof.

It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being connected or coupled to another element it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast when an element is referred to as being directly connected or directly coupled to another element there are no intervening elements present.

It will be understood that although the terms first second etc. may be used herein to describe various elements components regions layers and or sections these elements components regions layers and or sections should not be limited by these terms. For example when referring first and second entangled photon regions these terms are only used to distinguish one entangled photon source region element component layer or section from another source region element component layer or section. Thus a first source region element component layer or section discussed below could be termed a second source region element component layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.

Furthermore relative terms such as lower or bottom and upper or top may be used herein to describe one element s relationship to other elements as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example if the device in the Figures is turned over elements described as being on the lower side of other elements would then be oriented on upper sides of the other elements. The exemplary term lower can therefore encompass both an orientation of lower and upper depending of the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly if the device in one of the figures is turned over elements described as below or beneath other elements would then be oriented above the other elements. The exemplary terms below or beneath can therefore encompass both an orientation of above and below. Furthermore the term outer may be used to refer to a surface and or layer that is farthest away from a substrate. Embodiments of the present invention are described herein with reference to cross section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments of the present invention. As such variations from the shapes of the illustrations are to be expected. Thus embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result for example from manufacturing. Regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.

Unless otherwise defined all terms including technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.

It will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art that references to a structure or feature that is disposed adjacent another feature may have portions that overlap or underlie the adjacent feature.

The present invention has utility in data transmission. A quantum computing algorithm for processing data has greater than classical efficiency when run on a quantum computer. It is appreciated that embodiments of the present invention comprises a method for data compression and transmission that is operative in a classical digital computing environment although without the superior speed and information storage properties of qubits that are realized on a quantum computer. While the embodiments of the present invention are described inter alta in the context of sound compression and transmission it is appreciated that data corresponding to any number of media are equally well suited for transmission in a highly compressed and lossy manner such as light transmission. Data set types other than sound readily transmitted according to the present invention illustratively include images video holograms digital instrument output and numerical streams.

Challenges are presented in the transmission and exfiltration of quantum information or qubits over long distances or in challenging environments. To overcome the absorption or scattering losses inherent in long distance transmission of quantum information networks of quantum repeaters have been proposed to entangle remote quantum memories because Quantum information is typically fragile and not readily amplified. Quantum information transmission between two nodes in such a quantum network may be accomplished using quantum transfer techniques involving photon entanglement. The transfer of information using Quantum entanglement is a process by which the information in a qubit the basic unit of quantum information can be transferred from one location to another based upon the principles explained herein without the qubit being transmitted through the intervening space.

In some of the preferred embodiments the quantum transfer communication of information involves performing a Bell state measurement between the qubit containing the information to be transferred and the state of one part of an entangled pair of nodes on the quantum network. A Bell state measurement has four possible outcomes which correlates to two bits of classical information being transmitted to the other receiving node of the quantum network. The receiving node then uses the two bits of information to perform a unitary transformation on their remaining portion of the entangled state to locally reproduce the qubit that the sender used to perform their Bell state measurement. As an example the identity function is trivially a unitary operator and rotations in R are a nontrivial example of unitary operators. Rotations do not change the length of a vector or the angle between 2 vectors.

Generically a quantum repeater is a quantum memory coupled to at least one other quantum memory. The quantum memories may be composed of atoms ions nitrogen vacancy NV diamonds quantum dots superconducting quantum interference devices SQUIDs or other systems capable of representing and storage of quantum states. Quantum memories can be entangled with each other and transfer of information from one such quantum memory node to another quantum memory node is accomplished with Bell measurements and transmission of two bits over classical i.e. fiber optic electronic wireless radio free space optical communications channels representing the result of the Bell measurement.

A Bell measurement is a joint measurement between the states of two qubits that determines which of the four Bell states the pair of qubits is in. Typically the four Bell states are labeled as and . For example in terms of polarization HV VH HV VH HH VV and HH VV where H and V indicate the Horizontal and Vertical polarization components of a photon wavefunction.

Quantum teleportation refers to the exact transfer of quantum information a qubit from one location to another without that qubit being transmitted directly through the space between the sender and the receiver. As an example this can be accomplished by the sender and the receiver each sharing one half of an entangled quantum system. When the sender wishes to send a qubit quantum teleportation the sender will perform a Bell measurement with sender s half of the shared entangled quantum system and the qubit to be transferred to the receiver. The outcome of the Bell measurement will be sent to the receiver over classical channels and consists of two bits. When the receiver gets the two bits the receiver then applies to their remaining portion of the initially shared entangled state one of four unitary operations depending upon what the two bits indicate. Typically these operations can be represented by a matrix and correspond to the Identity matrix and three other matrices. For example 

The terminology data exfiltration as used herein relates to the clandestine or stealthy transfer or collection of data from a computer that may be collected by a remote or distant person. Exfiltration may involve the transmission or recovery of information or data collected in a manner that has a low likelihood of revealing the existence position or information collected by the perpetrator. Exfiltration may involve the use of an optical transceiver such as a telescope to direct one part of an entangled photon towards a distant device or target and to collect the entangled photons returning from the device or target. Exfiltration of information to support enhanced situational awareness is useful for maintaining safety in hostile or dangerous environments. For example it is important for safety to know if and when hostile combatants may threaten friendly troops. In such cases unattended sensors may collect information to help achieve improved situational awareness. The exfiltration of the collected information to friendly troops provides them with needed situational awareness. Exfiltration of information without the hostile troops getting the information or discovering the location of the sensor provides enhanced security for the friendly troops.

It can be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that entangled distant quantum memories are a precious resource and application of the methods of data compression and information exfiltration described in this disclosure provide a means to efficiently use this entanglement resource for transmission of information via the transfer of qubits.

A preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a system for the transmission and reconstruction of a data set through the utilization of a quantum Fourier transform QFT operation on qubits coding the data to be transferred from a sender to a receiver.

A preferred embodiment of the present invention prepares a wave function in a n data set as described for example in Long G. et al. Efficient scheme for initializing a quantum register with an arbitrary superposed state Physical Review A vol. 64 Issue 1 014303 2001 hereinafter Long et al. hereby incorporated by reference . In Long et al a scheme is presented that can most generally initialize a quantum register with an arbitrary superposition of basis states as a step in quantum computation and quantum information processing. For example Long et al. went beyond a simple quantum state such as i i i . . . i with ibeing either 0 or 1 to construct an arbitrary superposed quantum state. Long et al. utilized the implementation of O Nn standard 1 and 2 bit gate operations without introducing additional quantum bits. Long et al. presents a general scheme that initializes a quantum register without introducing additional qubits wherein the quantum circuit of a 3 qubit system transforms the state 000 to an arbitrary superposed state with N 2basis states. The terminology arbitrary superposed quantum state as used herein correlates to the construction of an arbitrary superposed quantum state as described inter alta in Long et al.

As depicted in a series of optical elements are provided to act as quantum operators followed by a measurement to implement the quantum Fourier transform. See Griffiths R. et al. Semiclassical Fourier Transform for Quantum Computation Physical Review Letters 76 3328 3231 1996 herein incorporated by reference . An optical bench with appropriate electronics is well suited to function as a quantum computer for the compression and transmission of data corresponding to sound. Those of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that although an optical bench is described as the platform for generating and performing operations on qubits it is appreciated that three plus qubit quantum computers are known to the art such as for example those computers utilized in conjunction with ion trapping and the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. Although sound is used as an example for the data set amplitudes represented by a quantum wave function the present invention is not limited to sound.

A wave function in quantum mechanics describes the quantum state of a particle as a function of space and time. The laws of quantum mechanics such as for example the Schr dinger equation describe how the wave function evolves over time. The symbol for a wave function is a complex valued function however is real and corresponds to the probability density of finding a particle in a given place at a given time if the particle s position is measured.

In conjunction with the present invention the wave function may be coded into qubits of quantum particles. Preferably the quantum particles are photons but trapped ions or magnetic spin states can also be utilized to practice the principles of the present invention.

The present invention may be utilized in conjunction with a classical computer and the data series may be derived from for example sound that is broken into a series of segments each represented by the number of qubits for classical computer storage and computation. In the operation of a preferred embodiment of the present invention on a quantum computer the quantum particles preferably photons may be operated on by optical components to perform the inventive method steps.

A preferred method of the present invention utilizes qubits in a quantum computer setting or the simulation of qubits in a classical computer. Qubits comprise superpositions of ones and zeros where both simultaneously exist. Photons that define the wave function are subjected to a quantum Fourier transform operation. In the process the photons are measured thereby destroying the quantum state but providing the measured probability in terms of the wave function and its complex conjugate 1 

An inverse Fourier transform FT is then applied to the square root of the measured probability to recover a lossy intelligible data compression in the form of quantum particle detection. It is appreciated that the inverse Fourier transform may be either a classical or quantum transform. A classical fast Fourier transform is readily performed by optical bench elements or through a classical computer program. The forward and inverse transforms are conducted using a relatively small sample of the wave function Fourier modes which has the property of preserving much of the intelligibility of the data while providing a compression and communication efficiency. Using the quantum computing simulation of a classical computer according to the present invention a sound data set for example is intelligibly reproduced with a lossy compression factor utilizing a classical computation. Computational efficiency with the present invention may be increased by increasing the set of qubits. In practice the inventive method allows for the transmission of information over a long path using a small number of photons. Data transmission with a small number of photons carrying the data in a quantum particle form is amenable to free optical path transmission through air or vacuum through optical fibers and via satellite transmission.

In one preferred embodiment communication between remote locations can be accomplished utilizing a comparatively small number of qubits of quantum particles relative to the data exchanged. Photons are amenable to transit in an environment exposed to climactic weather between the locations. It is appreciated that co linear transmission of a comparator wave function state and an information carrying state facilitates long range data transmission.

According to the present invention a data set is modeled by or in the form of a wave function. Using sound transmission as an example the sound is characterized by intensity amplitudes at uniformly spaced intervals

A superimposed quantum form is applied to the sound data set to facilitate quantum computer manipulation. To accomplish the quantification data amplitudes are equated to a wave function in the form of a series

is the quantum state key. The qubits are characterized as the quantum state superpositions 0 1. 6 A quantum probability conservation condition is imposed such that 1 7 

To account for the quantum superposition the quantum data is organized in terms of a conventional quantum binary tree. A prior art quantum binary tree is depicted as a branching between 0 and 1 outcomes for successive steps in . Using the qubit representation shown in the first step is to determine whether a one or zero exists at the first branch located at the top of the triangle depicted in . If a zero value is present Branch A is followed and the right side of the triangle or the Branch B becomes unnecessary to future determinations. Elimination of either the A Branch or B Branch results in data compression inasmuch as the remaining ones or zeros in the A or B Branch need not be considered. is a depiction of the second level branching following the determination depicted to the left in . If the value is zero Branch A is followed. If the value is one Branch A is followed. In each case the other branch is eliminated resulting in data compression. is a depiction of the third level branching following the determination depicted to the left in . If the value is zero Branch A is followed. If the value is one Branch A is followed. In each case the other branch is eliminated resulting in further data compression. The particular values selected for depiction in are merely exemplary. Results of a one determination at first level are not shown in to make the diagram easier to follow. Results of a one determination at the second level are not shown in to make the diagram easier to follow.

The outcomes of the successive steps sum to the values 0 through 2n 1 where n is the number of qubits. The means of obtaining the 0 or 1 depends on the specific experimental and corresponding simulation implementation. There are several conventional rules that are possible for determining the 0 or 1 value. For example a 0 state may correspond to a horizontal measurement and the 1 may correspond to a vertical measurement or the reverse may be true. In general the series of qubit measurements are prepared such that each value of the state preparation is conditioned to determine the 0 or 1 at each branch. An alternate qubit architecture operative herein is termed winner takes all. In the simulation depicted in Quantum Binary Tree n qubit measurements are made. The n value is determinative of the first branch.

The 2 where n is the number of qubits are divided into two parts lower 0 to 2 2 1 and higher indices 2 2 to 2 1. The side with the greatest sum of the indices measured determines the path of the first branch. The second level branch has one half the number of indices of the first branch. Consecutive indices assigned are from the selected half from the first branch. The same process is used for the second branch level as from the first branch but with half of the indices. This process repeats until all the branching is determined and the selected single index is determined. The quantum binary tree depicted in prior art for three qubits provides an index space of eight. The quantum binary tree is expandable to n qubits which is equivalent to an index space of 2over which transforms such as the Quantum Fourier Transform QFT operate.

The quantum superposition amplitudes at any qubit level in the binary tree may be constructed from for example sound amplitudes

The amplitudes are approximated in the quantum computation by identification with probabilities which can then be sampled. For one realization it is noted that 11 and 12 where is the product of a sequence operator. The classical index k is given in terms of the quantum qubit indices n of the quantum binary tree made of n qubits

Superpositions of qubits are used to store and process data such as sound. The amplitude of the data can be stored as the amplitudes of a superposed quantum state 15 where k is the eigenstate of the wavefunction . The term can be decomposed as a direct product of qubits 5 16 which compacts storage requirements by a factor of log 2 relative to a classical computation. A data set of size 2can be stored and operated on in n quantum bits. Mathematical transforms can also be performed on the quantum stored signal with the associated computational savings.

Preferred embodiments for the system for quantum data compression and transmission that are preferably performed using photons as quantum particle qubits will now be described. In the preferred embodiments of the present invention depicted in like numerals described with reference to subsequent figures correspond to previously detailed elements.

Referring now to a preferred embodiment is depicted generally at . A data encoder converts the data set to a set of qubit amplitudes that satisfies the expression of Equation 15 and triggers a light source accordingly. The light source may be a laser such as Nd YAG ion lasers diode lasers excimer lasers dye lasers and frequency modified lasers. Photons in path emitted from the light source are optionally passed through a spatial filter . Filter converts the photons in path in an image space domain to a spatial frequency domain and serves the purpose of removing for example stripe noise of low frequency and or high frequency noise. Examples of noise associated with the system comprise fluctuations typically include line noise powering the light source thermal gradients detector noise and inherent quantum noise. The photons having passed through spatial filter are then passed through a Type II nonlinear optics crystal . Examples of Type II nonlinear optic crystals that may be utilized include potassium dihydrogen phosphate potassium titanyl phosphate beta barium borate cesium lithium borate and adamantyl amino nitro pyridine. An optional dichroic mirror or bandpass filter that is operative to transmit specified wavelengths and reflect all others is used to selectively reflect out of the beam path those photons that have reflected wavelengths as a result of passing through the crystal into a stop . After passage through mirror the remaining entangled photons are split by interaction with a polarization beam splitter into two paths a known photon state path and a comparator wave function state path . The comparator wave function state path is directed onto a single photon counting module by an optional mirror set . It is appreciated that a reorganization of beam paths in the system obviates the need for mirror set . The detection of the photons from the comparator wave function state path by the single photon counting module is fed to coincidence electronics and is used to reconstruct the data set. The entangled photons in the known photon state path are then passed through a polarization modulator and a phase modulator . Exemplary polarization phase modulators illustratively include liquid crystals Kerr cells and Pockel cells. Preferably a series of two liquid crystal devices and a quarter wave plate may be used to achieve arbitrary polarization. Upon the entangled photons known photon state path interacting with the polarization and phase modulators and respectively the entangled photons are transformed into an arbitrarily oriented elliptical polarization state for passage via path based on the data set signal being transformed and any previously measured photon state if any is known. Note that both the polarization modulator and phase modulator are controlled by processor or computer which in turn is connected via lines to the coincidence electronics . The entangled photons in the arbitrarily oriented elliptical polarization state passing via path are optionally reflected from a mirror and then enter a polarization interferometer depicted generally at . The interferometer has the geometry of a polarization Mach Zehnder interferometer and includes a polarization beam splitter that transmits one portion to a phase modulator resulting in a phase shift in the light component reaching polarization beam splitter relative to the other polarization component . Polarization beam splitter recombines beam components and to complete a controlled phase shift transform on the recombined state from the interferometer . Three ancillary mirrors each numbered are provided to reflect light in desired directions. The controlled phase shift transformed light component representing a recombined phase state then interacts with a half wave plate oriented at 22.5 degrees in order to implement a quantum Hadamard gate transformation therein and thus complete a quantum Fourier transform. The half wave plate provides a qubit prioritized input to a polarization beam splitter . Note that the half wave plate may optionally be positioned following the Unitary Transformation circuitry as shown by dotted lines .

The process that computes the Quantum Fourier Transform QFT of a signal may be described as follows. First the computer or device that holds the signal divides the signal into a series of sections. Each section contains N samples of the signal. This section of N samples is then used to prepare the first qubit. As shown in one qubit is representative of 8 contemporary bits as illustrated by the base of the quantum binary tree. In accordance with a preferred embodiment the qubit of the quantum state utilizes a prescribed technique for the Quantum Fourier Transform. This quantum state is then passed though a device that applies a particular phase shift via phase shifters appropriate to this qubit of the Quantum Fourier Transform. The qubit is then measured and the result of that measurement is recorded as a 0 or 1. This measurement is also used to determine which half of the N samples of the current signal section are used as a subsection to prepare the next qubit as the other half is not needed to prepare the next qubit for reasons described above in connection with . This qubit and all the remaining qubits generated for the original signal section are prepared and measured in a similar way with each qubit measurement using only half of the remaining signal subsection to prepare the next qubit. This process ends when the last qubit that is prepared using only 2 samples of the signal section. When all these qubits have been measured for one section a binary number remains that results in the adding of 1 to the bin addressed by that binary number for instance the binary number 010 would indicate address and the binary number 110 would indicate address . These steps are repeated a number of times on the same signal section to generate a power spectrum representation of the signal section. Signal processing techniques such as a classical inverse Fourier transform or compressive sensing sampling can be used on this power spectrum to reconstruct the initial signal section in a lossy but still recognizable manner.

In the Quantum Fourier Transform a number of photons each with prepared qubit states are sent sequentially through quantum controlled phase transforms followed by quantum Hadamard transforms associated with the half wave plate . The state preparation is accomplished by setting the values of the phase and setting the photons to particular elliptical polarization values.

The Hadamard transform is a quantum transform operating on one qubit at a time. The Hadamard transform in connection with the embodiments of may be performed after the unitary transformation operation or in the alternative after the interferometers or as depicted in the respective figures. The Hadamard gate transform is given as

Hadamard transforms in the order of the most significant qubit to the least significant qubit. The initial state of each photon qubit is conditioned on the previously measured values of prior photon measurements.

A single photon is operated upon by a Hadamard transform with the effect of Hadamard transforms on multiple photons representing an entire wave function is represented by the combined Hadamard transform.

The total wave function made of arbitrary superposed states is operated on by the combined Hadamard transform 19 where 5 20 Here the direct product of the identities is repeated until all of the qubits are taken into account.

With reference now to single photon counting modules and count individual photons with a different given polarization respectively and report a counting event to coincidence electronics . Only when coincidence is noted between a photon counting event at module and or between module and module is the count considered a valid probability density function measurement. The probability density function is defined by 21 where represents the wave function and is the complex conjugate of the wavefunction and sets the number of times on the average that a photon lands in an index space interval. For n qubits there are 2index space intervals . provides an example of the index space for 3 qubits .

A determination as to the polarization of each photon is provided by signal measurement at one of the single photon counting modules and . The polarization of each photon is measured by the counting modules which represent the end of the photon path through the Hadamard gate and electro optics. If horizontal 0 is measured for example by single photon counting module then no phase operations are applied to the remaining qubits. Otherwise a controlled phase operation Ris applied to remaining operations. Note that the phase polarization and phase modulator are controlled by the computer or processor which is connected to the coincident circuitry which is in turn receives the outputs of the detectors . The Rset is defined as

Turning to another facet of the preferred embodiments depicted in as an option quantum teleportation of information may be utilized. Quantum teleportation refers to the exact transfer of quantum information a qubit from one location to another without that qubit being transmitted directly through the space between the sender and the receiver. As an example this can be accomplished by the sender and the receiver each sharing one half of an entangled quantum system. When the sender wishes to send a qubit quantum teleportation the sender will perform a Bell measurement with their half of the shared entangled quantum system and the qubit to be transferred to the receiver. The outcome of the Bell measurement will be sent to the receiver over classical channels and consists of two bits. In each of a unitary transformation operation is performed in element . The following analysis applies to each of with respect to Unitary Transformation element . When the receiver gets the two bits from the detectors the receiver then applies to the receiver s remaining portion of the initially shared entangled state one of four unitary operations depending upon what the two bits indicate. Typically these operations can be represented by a matrix and correspond to the Identity matrix and three other matrices. For example 

With reference now to preferred embodiments of though shown therein are entangled photon source that provides a source for entangled photons P and P. For ease of understanding the second entangled photon P is repeated as an input into the Bell state measurement element represented by the square with a diagonal line . The Bell states are a concept in quantum information science representing an EPR pair ie. a pair of qubits which jointly are in a Bell state that is entangled with each other. In the embodiments of the Bell state measurement element the entangled photon pair are the entangled photon P and the informational photon passing via the path in and through the half wave plate in . Note that as discussed above the informational photon may have passed though the half wave plate which implements a quantum Hadamard gate transformation thereon. In the Bell state measurement element the joint measurement takes place between the entangled photon P and the informational photon. This interaction is depicted in also with photon P and qubit Q. In the case of though the qubit Q is the resultant of the interferometers or . The determination of the Bell measurement a joint quantum mechanical measurement of two qubits that determines which of the four Bell states the two qubits are in is recorded by the photodetectors also referred to as the two bit measurement. In the context of the entangled photons being separated with photon P being at the receiving side and the photon P being at the sender information contained in the qubit Q may be transmitted from the sender to the receiver with only the two bit measurement being physically transmitted. That is the information contained in the qubit Q as shown in appears on the receiving side bottom left of due to the quantum properties of entanglement. Specifically entangled photon P enters a unitary transformation at element labeled unitary transformation operation wherein the result or output is the information contained on qubit Q by detector . Thus the information contained in qubit Q is passed from the sender to the receiver with only the physical transfer of the two bit measurement via classical channels. Thus data relating to how to perform the Bell state measurement is transferred while the properties of entanglement between photons P and P result in the transference of information by teleportation of information i.e. when the photon P encounters the qubit Q in the bell state measurement element the other photon P is effected by the encounter so as to in effect impart information from qubit Q to the entangled P P photon state. Photons P and P may be significant distances from each other and still achieve the effects of entanglement.

Note that while the entanglement of two photons is shown in and the concept is shown in alternative uses of entanglement are represented in . In instead of entangled photons P and P an entangled atom pair A and A is illustrated. Similar circuitry from may be utilized in conjunction with the implementation of the embodiments of to integrate or substitute the atom pair A A for the photon pair P P of . is similar to but includes an optical delay .

It is noted that with respect to the Bell state measurement for entanglement using a single qubit variable difficulties are presented when only three distinct classes out of four Bell states are generally distinguishable. By using multiple qubit variables for example polarization orbital angular momentum or energy states tracing or redundancy of variables can be used to in effect achieve complete Bell state measurements.

Preferably the crystal is tuned for non degenerative down conversion with regard to dichroic mirror . The known polarization beam of entangled photons in path is incident on polarization beam splitter that operates to transmit one polarization component and reflect other polarization components and that component with a known photon polarization state in path is directed to a polarization modulator . As in all of the embodiments in the polarization modulator and phase modulator are controlled by computer which determines which half of the data to process as explained with reference to based upon the last measurement fed back from coincident detector which is connected to the computer by lines and . The component with a known photon state is directed through a polarization modulator and phase modulator to yield an arbitrarily oriented elliptical polarization state in path that is reflected off mirror and into an interferometer shown generally at that has the geometry of a polarization Sagnac interferometer. The arbitrarily oriented elliptical polarization state in path retains characteristics of the data set signal to be subsequently transformed in any previously measured photon state if such is known. The interferometer comprises like elements referenced by the same numerals as the interferometer of and receives the arbitrarily oriented elliptical polarization state in path incident on a polarization beam splitter that splits the arbitrarily oriented elliptical polarization state in path to phase shift a polarization component in path through interaction with a phase modulator . Phase Modulator is also connected to computer by lines and . The computer controls the phase modulator depending upon the stage of the Fourier transform.

In connection with the embodiments depicted in and optionally a second computer may be used to control phase modulator if the phase modulator is at a remote location. The second component of the entangled photon pair Q Q in path is recombined with the phase shifted component of the entangled photon pair Q Q through coincidental reflection with the mirrors collectively labeled . The combined state is transmitted through a half wave plate oriented at so as to perform a quantum Hadamard transform to yield recombined transformed output . Note that the half wave plate may optionally be positioned following the Unitary Transformation circuitry as shown by dotted lines . The recombined transformed output is such that one of the photon components thereof is reflected by dichroic mirror to single photon counting module while the other photon component is processed as follows.

Continuing to the left side of entangled photon source provides entangled photons P and P. In the drawing for explanatory purposes the second entangled photon P is repeated as an input into the Bell state measurement element represented by the square with a diagonal line . Within the Bell state measurement element entangled photon P and the informational qubit Q which passes through the interferometer and which passes via the path interact via quantum interference. Note that as discussed above the informational photon may have passed though the half wave plate which implements a quantum Hadamard gate transformation thereon. In the Bell state measurement element the measurement takes place between the entangled photon P and the informational photon. This interaction is depicted in which depicts photon P and qubit Q undergoing a joint Bell state measurement. The determination of the Bell measurement a joint quantum mechanical measurement of two qubits determines which of the four Bell states the two qubit system Q and P exists. This is recorded by the photodetectors and the results are referred to herein as the two bit measurement. 

It is noted again that in the general context of the entangled photons P and P being separated with photon P being at the receiving side and the photon P being at the sender information contained in the qubit Q may be transmitted from the sender to the receiver with only the two bit measurement recorded by detectors being physically transmitted. The half wave plate provides a qubit prioritized input to a polarization beam splitter and yields a single photon registered on one of the single photon counting modules or . Note that the half wave plate may optionally be positioned following the Unitary Transformation circuitry as shown by dotted lines .

As explained in the foregoing regarding the unitary transformation operation when the sender wishes to send a qubit quantum teleportation the sender will perform a Bell measurement with sender s half of the shared entangled quantum system and the qubit to be transferred to the receiver at elements . The outcome of the Bell measurement will be sent to the receiver over classical channels and consists of two bits. When the receiver gets the two bits transferred via computer to the unitary transformation element the receiver applies to their remaining portion of the initially shared entangled state one of four unitary operations depending upon what the two bits indicate. Typically these operations can be represented by a matrix and correspond to the Identity matrix and three other matrices. For example 

Continuing in the left side of single photon counting modules and count individual photons with a given polarization and report a counting event to coincidence electronics . Only when coincidence is noted between a photon counting event at module and or between module and module is the count considered a valid probability density function measurement.

The coincidence electronics feed the result back to the computer via lines and so that the computer determines which portion of the data to process next and how to prepare the data bases on the last measurement detected by the coincident electronics. The feature is depicted in where dotted lines are used to show data paths which are no longer in use and the BINS labeled R are no longer used while the BINS labeled L remain to be processed. By making a determination not to use the 4 BINS labeled R as depicted in data compression is achieved.

It is noted the foregoing depicts the functions of respective elements that are controlled or implemented by a computer. Such operations may be performed for example by or in conjunction with the computer labeled as Computer in which depicts a classic computer and the capabilities of computer or associated computers may include the loading with an input signal. The computer or associated computers then performs a quantum Fourier transform and either a classical inverse Fourier transform or a quantum inverse Fourier transform.

From the buffer store it may be provided to an output device on either a real time or delayed basis as still images video images movies audio sound representations and the like. Computer or processor may be loaded with the input signal that determines the wave function amplitudes that satisfy Equation 15 controls modulators and and controls the phase shift elements e.g. in . Processor is also operatively connected to coincidence electronics . The coincidence electronics serve to determine when a valid Bell State measurement has occurred by a coincidence between a detection event at for example detector in and the Bell State measurement indicated by detectors and . Processor would then classically communicate e.g. via the Internet etc two bits that represent the outcome of the Bell State measurement to processor optionally with a time stamp provided by indicating when the coincidence took place. Computer may be operationally connected to Unitary transformer coincidence electronics and one half of an entangled pair of photons P and detectors and . On receiving two bits from Processor computer then sets the Unitary transformer to the appropriate matrix values as described above to transform photon P into the quantum photon state at path to complete the quantum teleportation of information operation. Computer records the result of the measurement at and communicates to Processor that result so that the next qubit can be teleported along the correct branch of the quantum binary tree . Computer can then perform either a classical inverse Fourier transform or a quantum inverse Fourier transform to recover the signal communicated by processor . The output of system may be provided to a buffer store not shown . From the buffer store it may be provided to an output device on either a real time or delayed basis as still images video images movies audio sound representations and the like.

In order to evaluate the ability of the inventive quantum algorithm to compress and transmit a signal representative of the data set with a comparatively small number of photons 32 sound samples defining a normalized arbitrary spectrum are provided in the top left panel of .

An example of a Bell state measurement device is shown to the right in wherein the Bell state measurement device comprises a beam splitter and includes four number resolving detectors. A photon number resolving detector is able to tell whether it measured one photon or two within its measurement. Birefringent elements on each outlet side of the beam splitter delay polarization components with respect to the other of the same photon wavefunction. As shown to the right in after the birefringent elements two polarizing beam splitters are aligned to 45 degrees that measure the four Bell states. Note that there are two birefringent elements are at each arm and two detectors at each arm going through 45 degree coincidence for example as to the Bell state double clicking for . Note that the qubit and the second entangled photon are interfering in Bell state device and that the Bell state measurement is a joint measurement corresponding to the interaction of the photons interaction. Each photon has a polarization and phase their wavefunctions are going to exit the beam splitter in certain superpositions. The result is the measurement of the components of the wavefunctions that interacted at . Q will interact with P and because of the interaction and entanglement between P and P some information on Q is transferred to P.

Referring again to the arrow double lines represent the travel paths of the photon wavefunctions prior to measurement at a detector. The dash dot dot dash line indicates a classical communication channel that extends between the sender and the receiver where two bits of information representing the outcome of the Bell State measurement conducted in element are transmitted to the receiver. In Bell state measurement element a joint measurement is performed between 1 part of an entangled pair represented as P in and the photon to be communicated represented as Q . The two bits in channel tell the receiver and in particular element how to measure the remaining entangled photon. The element in represents a device that performs a unitary transformation specified by the two bits of classically transmitted information from the sender resulting from the outcome of detectors on the remaining portion of the initial entangled photon pair. In element a unitary transformation operation is performed to complete communication. These unitary transformations are often represented by a Pauli matrix. The solid arrowed line indicates the travel path of the transferred qubit represented by the double lined crossed circle towards a detector as explained above in conjunction with . In the representation Q refers to the transferred photon information state and can be many bits per photon transferred. Elements and operationally connected to Computer serve to complete the measurement of the transferred information. The results of the measurement would be transmitted to Processor not shown to be used to prepare the next qubit Q of information to teleported to .

An alternate embodiment comprises a system for quantum cloud computing in support of tactical intelligence operations and other operations. Utilizing more than one computer processor and computing resources to solve a problem nearly simultaneously is referred to as parallel processing. Even though the processors are relatively far apart they can be connected by communications systems networks and links to enable problem solving also know as distributed computing. The collection of the distributed computing resources is often called cloud computing. Resources may include but are not limited to quantum and classical computer nodes quantum and classical memory quantum and classical computer codes quantum and classical storage quantum and classical communications and the like.

D Wave and PiCloud have announced a joint venture to develop cloud computing software for remote access to one or more D Wave quantum computers at a center or centers. The D Wave PiCloud quantum computing cloud is for a central computing resource available remotely. The communications between the quantum computers and the remote devices in this instance are classical.

One problem is that it is not designed or built to be used in support of tactical operations intelligence or otherwise. Tactical communications resources are different from commercial enterprises which depend heavily on stationary infrastructure support. A tactical environment has a connectivity which needs to be ad hoc and continually changing to account for mobility. Bandwidth is often restricted because of the smaller throughput of fielded system vs. commercial infrastructure supported systems.

A new method for quantum cloud computing improves security and compression between the nodes by applying the methods and techniques of quantum security and compression of data in transmission described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 705 566 entitled Quantum Based Information Transmission System and Method filed Feb. 12 2010 by Ronald E. Meyers and Keith S. Deacon to provide the communications links between quantum computing or classical computing nodes operating in a tactical environment. As described in the 566 Application the information sent to each location at each step in the process depends of the information previously measured by one or more receivers in the preceding step or steps.

Over short transmission distances photons of different frequencies may propagate satisfactorily for quantum communications between the sender and the receiver. However over longer distances photons at some frequencies may be susceptible to appreciable absorption by the transmission media such as optical fiber the atmosphere or water. If the photon is absorbed then the quantum information associated with that photon would be lost. One way to extend the distance over which quantum information may be transmitted through a media is to convert the frequency of the photon carrying the quantum information to a frequency which is less readily absorbed see Shahriar et al Connecting processing capable quantum memories over telecommunication links via quantum frequency conversion J. Phys. B At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 45 2012 124018 . A difficulty in doing this is that conventional frequency conversion methods tend to destroy the quantum information. In the following we describe an invention to convert photon frequency while preserving the quantum information associated with that photon. A preferred embodiment is directed to mitigation of transmission loss specifically towards mitigating the transmission loss of photon based qubits when propagating through absorbing and transmitting media and improving the efficiency for the detection of a photon based qubit. As an example for a photon based qubit propagating through a typical optical fiber there are minima of attenuation at approximately for frequencies corresponding to 1310 nm and 1550 nm wavelengths. Other media such as the atmosphere or underwater would have different transmission properties that make it advisable to convert the frequency of the photon based qubit to minimize absorption and scattering losses along the path from the sender to the receiver.

A further advantage to be attained with frequency conversion is for detection efficiency. Many silicon based photon detectors have peak detection efficiencies at frequencies corresponding to approximately 780 nm wavelengths. However for example cold atom ensembles or ion quantum systems have peak emissions at frequencies corresponding to wavelengths for instance at 240 nm for one type of quantum system to 1400 nm for another type of quantum system.

In practice one means by which frequency conversion of a photon based qubit would be to 1 convert the frequency of the photon based qubit to a frequency optimized for transmission through the media between the sender and the receiver 2 the receiver would then convert the frequency of the transmitted qubit to a frequency optimized for their detection system.

Generally speaking transmission of quantum information or qubits over long distances or in challenging environments is problematic. To mitigate absorption or scattering losses inherent in long distance transmission of quantum information the choice of an appropriate photon frequency or wavelength for transmission is desirable. Typically frequency wavelength conversion for lasers is accomplished using the non linear processes of Sum Frequency Generation SFG or Difference Frequency Generation DFG . To bridge the difference in wavelength between photons suited for fiber based communication and the photons emitted and absorbed by the atomic memories two strategies have been demonstrated. One strategy is sum frequency generation SFG and difference frequency generation DFG which are second order nonlinear processes that must satisfy energy conservation and phase matching conditions. For SFG the processes involves three frequencies interacting in a non linear crystal subject to the condition v v vwhere vis the frequency of the photon that one wants to change to a more desirable frequency v and a pump source at frequency v. Similarly in difference frequency generation the conservation condition is v v v. The nonlinear crystals used typically have phase matching conditions where the momentum and polarization of the light interacting with the crystal must be considered. Typically in order to preserve quantum state information often encoded in the polarization of a single photon the wavefunction of that single photon needs to be split into orthogonal polarization components and each component would then be frequency individually before the wavefunctions is recombined for transmission or interaction with some device.

Difference frequency generation and Sum Frequency Generation typically occur in materials with large such as periodically poled lithium niobate PPLN and conversion efficiencies can approach 100 . Another proven method to bridge the wavelength gap is the third order nonlinear process of four wave mixing FWM . Under the correct conditions a near IR photon can be converted to a telecom wavelength photon via four wave mixing using two pump lasers and an atomic ensemble. Cold Rb atoms in a magneto optical trap MOT combined with the correct pump lasers can achieve high efficiency four wave mixing with very little noise added to the signal. See in this regard A Quantum Network with Atoms and Photons QNET AP bRonald E. Meyers et al. US Army Research Laboratory Adelphi Md. 20783 Proc. SPIE 8518 Quantum Communications and Quantum Imaging X 85180G Oct. 17 2012 doi 10.1117 12.97414 herein incorporated by reference.

It is to be appreciated that frequency conversion may also be done to transform the frequency of light from some quantum system that may be difficult to manipulate or detect into another frequency where those operations such as photon detection are more efficiently accomplished see L. Ma et al. Single photon frequency up conversion and its applications Proc. SPIE 8163 81630N 2011 . The non linear media used may be bulk crystals such as BBO or LBO newer periodically poled media such as periodically poled lithium niobate PPLN or even nonlinear interactions in doped optical fibers. Each type of nonlinear media must be engineered to meet the requirements of the particular application i.e. what frequencies to be converted between what polarizations and what momentum are to be phase matched. A further concern with many non linear crystals is their inherent property of birefringence. This birefringence property leads to a delay in the time it takes one planarization to travel across these crystals relative to a different polarization. With respect to quantum frequency conversion any such delay must be accounted for and corrected or quantum information would be lost in the frequency conversion process. A further motivation to perform quantum frequency conversion would be to mitigate temporal dispersion effects which would typically lead to timing and synchronization problems between a sender and a receiver.

The qubit Q travels along path to Quantum Frequency Converter A which is implemented to convert the frequency of the qubit Q to a frequency suitable for propagation to the receiver along path A. That is the frequency is changed as shown in . The frequency is converted via one of devices A or B which are as described in . When the qubit Q interacts with for example B the photon Q with frequency will combine with a laser with an appropriate frequency for the desired wavelength conversion inside of wave division multiplexer . The laser pump provides a high intensity source of photons at frequency . This high intensity laser illumination then interact with the optical element which sets the polarization of the high intensity photons to 45 degrees. The combined Q and high intensity photons then interact with polarizing beam splitter . is operative to split the polarization wavefunction components of Q into clock wise CW and counter clock wise CCW propagating paths each path with a unique polarization the high intensity pump beam is also split into the clock wise and counter clock wise paths each path having equal intensity of pump beam light. For the Q components and pump beam traveling the clock wise propagation path first interact with a half wave plate A which operates to rotate the polarization of the photons to the correct phase matching condition for non linear media NL. The non linear media NL operates to convert the frequency of the wavefunction components of Q traveling the clock wise propagation path. After exiting NL the clock wise propagating wavefunction components of Q and pump beam interact with half waveplate B which operates to rotate the polarization of the clock wise propagating wavefunction components of Q and the clock wise propagating pump beam to a phase matching condition for non interaction with nonlinear media NC. Note that frequency conversion requires that the correct phase matching conditions be met for the nonlinear media. The clock wise path propagating components may optionally interact with delay line to ensure wavefunction overlap on polarizing beam splitter to recombine the clock wise and counter clock wise propagating components. The Q components and pump beam traveling the counter clockwise path first interact with the optional delay line to ensure wavefunction overlap on polarizing beam splitter to recombine the clock wise path and counter clock wise path propagating components. For the Q components and pump beam traveling the counter clock wise path then interact with nonlinear media NC. The nonlinear media NC operates to convert the frequency of the wavefunction components of Q traveling the counter clock wise propagation path. The frequency converted components of Q and pump beam then interact with halfwave plate B which operates to rotate the polarization of light on the counter clock wise path to a non interacting phase matching condition with nonlinear media NL. After passing through NL the counter clockwise path wavefunction components and pump beam then interact with half wave plate A to rotate the counter clockwise path propagating polarizations to enable wavefunction recombination on beam splitter . The recombined frequency converted Q and pump beam then interact with wave division multiplier which operates to transmit the frequency of the converted Q and reflect all other frequencies to beam stop . After propagating to the receiver the qubit Q interacts with Quantum Frequency Converter B which operates to convert the frequency of the qubit Q from the propagation frequency such as 1550 nm in optical fiber to a frequency more suitable for operation such as measurement by detectors and e.g. 700 nm for some silicon avalanche photodiode detectors. It is to be appreciated that the interactions of the frequency converted Q from path with the components of are substantially equivalent to those recited above with optionally a different pump laser frequency and phase matching criteria for the non linear media NL and NC. Continuing in the left side of single photon counting modules and count individual photons with a given polarization and report a counting event to coincidence electronics . Only when coincidence is noted between a photon counting event at module and or between module and module is the count considered a valid probability density function measurement. The result of the coincidence measurements by and or and are transmitted over classical channels to processor for the preparation and transmission of the next qubit.

The outcomes of the successive steps sum to the values 0 through 4 1 where n is the number of Bell state qubits. The means of obtaining the 0 1 2 or 3 depends on the specific experimental and corresponding simulation implementation. There are several conventional rules that are possible for determining the 0 1 2 or 3 value. For example a 0 state may correspond to a Bell state measurement of the 1 may correspond to a measurement of the 2 to a measurement of and the 3 to a measurement of or other alternative assignments may be true. In general the series of Bell state measurements are prepared such that each value of the state preparation is conditioned to determine the 0 1 2 or 3 at each branch.

In the simulation depicted in Quantum Quad Tree n Bell state measurements are made. The n value is determinative of the first branch. The 4lower branches where n is the number of Bell states are divided into four parts . The side with the greatest sum of the indices measured determines the path of the first branch. The second level branch has one fourth the number of indices of the first branch. Consecutive indices assigned are from the selected half from the first branch. The same process is used for the second branch level as from the first branch but with half of the indices. This process repeats until all the branching is determined and the selected single index is determined. The quantum quad tree depicted in prior art for two Bell state measurements provides an index space of sixteen. The quantum quad tree is expandable to n Bell states which is equivalent to an index space of 4.
