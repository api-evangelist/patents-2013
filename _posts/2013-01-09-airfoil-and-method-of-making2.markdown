This invention was made with government support under Contract No. N00019 12 D 0002 awarded by the United States Navy. The government has certain rights in the invention.

Turbine engine components such as turbine blades and vanes are operated in high temperature environments. To avoid deterioration in the components resulting from their exposure to high temperatures it is necessary to provide cooling to the components. Turbine blades and vanes are subjected to high thermal loads on both the suction and pressure sides of their airfoil portions and at both the leading and trailing edges. The regions of the airfoils having the highest thermal load can differ depending on engine design and specific operating conditions. Casting processes using ceramic cores now offer the potential to provide specific cooling passages for turbine components such as blade and vane airfoils and seals. Cooling circuits can be placed just inside the walls of the airfoil through which a cooling fluid flows to cool the airfoil.

An airfoil includes leading and trailing edges a first exterior wall extending from the leading edge to the trailing edge and having inner and outer surfaces a second exterior wall extending from the leading edge to the trailing edge generally opposite the first exterior wall and having inner and outer surfaces and cavities within the airfoil. A first cavity extends along the inner surface of the first exterior wall and a first inner wall and has an upstream end and a downstream end and a feed cavity is located between the first inner wall and the second exterior wall.

A method of forming an airfoil includes forming a first ceramic core having a first side with a first length and a second side generally opposite the first side with a second length forming a second ceramic core having a length generally greater than or equal to the first length forming a core assembly and casting the airfoil. Forming the core assembly includes positioning the second ceramic core so that it is proximate but spaced from the first side of the first ceramic core. The core assembly is used during casting to provide the airfoil with a central core passage and a first internal cooling circuit located on one side of the central core passage. The first internal cooling circuit has a length generally greater than or equal to a length of the side of the central core passage proximate to the first internal cooling circuit.

An airfoil includes a leading edge wall a trailing edge and first and second exterior side walls extending between the leading edge wall and the trailing edge a central feed cavity an impingement cavity located between the central feed cavity and the leading edge wall and a first cooling circuit insulating the central feed cavity from the first exterior side wall.

Cooling circuits for components such as airfoils can be prepared by investment casting using ceramic cores. Advances in ceramic manufacturing permit the formation of thinner ceramic cores that can be used to cast airfoils and other structures. Thinner ceramic cores enable new cooling configurations for use in blade and vane airfoils.

Investment casting is one technique used to create hollow components such as compressor and turbine blades and vanes for gas turbine engines. In some investment casting methods ceramic core elements are used to form the inner passages of blade and vane airfoils and platforms. A core assembly of a plurality of core elements is assembled. A wax pattern is formed over the core assembly. A ceramic shell is then formed over the wax pattern and the wax pattern is removed from the shell. Molten metal is introduced into the ceramic shell. The molten metal upon cooling solidifies and forms the walls of the airfoil and or platform. The ceramic cores can form inner passages for a cooling fluid such as cooling air within the airfoil and or platform. The ceramic shell is removed from the cast part. Thereafter the ceramic cores are removed typically chemically using a suitable removal technique. Removal of the ceramic cores leaves one or more feed cavities and cooling circuits within the wall of the airfoil and or platform.

As shown in feed cavity is generally centrally located within airfoil . Cooling fluid can be delivered to feed cavity from a source such as air bled from a compressor stage of a gas turbine engine. In the case of blade cooling fluid can enter feed cavity of airfoil from root section or platform . In the case of vanes cooling fluid can enter feed cavity of airfoil from inner diameter or outer diameter platforms. In some embodiments cooling fluid travels from feed cavity to impingement cavity . Impingement cavity is located generally upstream from feed cavity . Feed cavity and impingement cavity are generally separated by internal rib but fluidly communicate through one or more channels or crossovers present in rib .

Cooling fluid that flows from feed cavity to impingement cavity can exit impingement cavity through cooling holes . Cooling holes are openings in leading edge wall that communicate with impingement cavity . Cooling holes along leading edge wall are sometimes referred to as showerhead cooling holes. Cooling fluid that exits impingement cavity through cooling holes cools the interior and exterior surfaces of leading edge wall and can form a cooling film as the cooling fluid is directed downstream by the mainstream hot gas path flow along pressure side wall and or suction side wall . The leading edges of airfoils are often subjected to the mainstream air flow having the highest temperature. Thus when the cooling fluid exiting impingement cavity through cooling holes has a low temperature the cooling fluid provides the best cooling to the exterior of leading edge wall . In order to provide the cooling fluid that exits cooling holes with the lowest possible temperature feed cavity is insulated from the heat carried by the mainstream air flow. Feed cavity is insulated from the mainstream air flow and high temperature portions of airfoil by pressure side cavity and suction side cavity .

Pressure side cavity is a cooling circuit located between feed cavity and pressure side wall . Pressure side cavity is separated from feed cavity by internal wall . Cooling fluid flows through pressure side cavity which provides cooling to both internal wall and pressure side wall .

In the embodiment shown in pressure side cavity includes upstream plenum section A intermediate section B and downstream plenum section C. Upstream plenum section A and downstream plenum section C are located at respective upstream and downstream ends of pressure side cavity . In one embodiment cooling fluid enters pressure side cavity from root section at a region near downstream plenum section C. As the cooling fluid flows through pressure side cavity from platform towards tip section a network of trips strips and pedestals not shown in present within pressure side cavity direct the cooling fluid upstream towards intermediate section B and upstream plenum section A. The trip strips and pedestals create tortuous paths for the cooling fluid which enhances heat transfer in pressure side cavity . The cooling fluid travels upstream from downstream plenum section C through intermediate section B and to upstream plenum section A where the cooling fluid exits pressure side cavity through cooling holes . As the cooling fluid flows through pressure side cavity it cools a portion of pressure side wall . Depending on the temperature of internal wall the cooling fluid flowing through pressure side cavity can cool internal wall and or insulate internal wall from the high temperatures experienced by pressure side wall . Once the cooling fluid exits pressure side cavity through cooling holes the cooling fluid forms a cooling film along the exterior of pressure side wall thereby providing additional cooling to pressure side wall . In alternate embodiments cooling fluid can enter pressure side cavity from root section at upstream plenum section A and flow through intermediate section B to downstream plenum section C.

In the embodiment shown in upstream plenum section A and downstream plenum section C have a lateral thickness greater than intermediate section B i.e. plenum sections A and C extend farther from pressure side wall towards the center of airfoil . The increased lateral thickness of upstream plenum section A can provide a backstrike region that can aid in the formation of cooling holes . Cooling holes can be drilled through pressure side wall into upstream plenum section A. Due to the generally small lateral width of pressure side cavity the drilling of cooling holes can be difficult in some circumstances. To reduce the likelihood that a hole is unintentionally drilled through internal wall when cooling holes are drilled through pressure side wall upstream plenum section A includes backstrike region which allows additional clearance between pressure side wall and internal wall . Cavities having the shape of pressure side cavity shown in are herein referred to as dog bone cavities.

Suction side cavity is similar to pressure side cavity but located on the opposite side of feed cavity . Suction side cavity is a cooling circuit located between feed cavity and suction side wall . Suction side cavity is separated from feed cavity by internal wall . Cooling fluid flows through suction side cavity which provides cooling to both internal wall and suction side wall .

In the embodiment shown in suction side cavity includes upstream plenum section A intermediate section B and downstream plenum section C. Upstream plenum section A and downstream plenum section C are located at respective upstream and downstream ends of suction side cavity Like pressure side cavity in some embodiments cooling fluid enters suction side cavity from root section at a region near downstream plenum section C. As the cooling fluid flows through suction side cavity from platform towards tip section a network of trips strips and pedestals present within suction side cavity direct the cooling fluid upstream towards intermediate section B and upstream plenum section A. The cooling fluid travels upstream from downstream plenum section C through intermediate section B and to upstream plenum section A where the cooling fluid exits suction side cavity through cooling holes A. As the cooling fluid flows through suction side cavity it cools a portion of suction side wall . Depending on the temperature of internal wall the cooling fluid flowing through suction side cavity can cool internal wall or insulate internal wall from the high temperatures experienced by suction side wall . Once the cooling fluid exits suction side cavity through cooling holes A the cooling fluid forms a cooling film along the exterior of suction side wall thereby providing additional cooling to suction side wall . In alternate embodiments cooling fluid can enter suction side cavity from root section at upstream plenum section A and flow through intermediate section B to downstream plenum section C.

Like pressure side cavity suction side cavity can include plenum sections A and C that are laterally thicker than intermediate section B. In the embodiment shown in upstream plenum section A and downstream plenum section C have a lateral thickness greater than intermediate section B. The increased lateral thickness of upstream plenum section A can provide backstrike region which allows additional clearance between suction side wall and internal wall so that cooling holes A can be drilled through suction side wall into upstream plenum section A.

In some embodiments pressure side cavity extends along pressure side wall both upstream i.e. toward the leading edge of feed cavity and downstream i.e. toward the trailing edge of feed cavity . That is pressure side cavity has an axial length greater than that of feed cavity and extends farther both upstream and downstream than feed cavity . By sizing pressure side cavity larger than feed cavity and locating feed cavity between the ends of pressure side cavity feed cavity can be insulated from the heat conducted through pressure side wall by the high temperature gases flowing past wall . In some embodiments suction side cavity can have an axial length greater than that of feed cavity and extend both upstream and downstream of feed cavity . By locating feed cavity between suction side cavity and pressure side cavity feed cavity can be insulated from the heat conducted through suction side wall and pressure side wall by the high temperature gases flowing past walls and . In some embodiments both pressure side cavity and suction side cavity can have axial lengths greater than that of feed cavity and both side cavities and can extend upstream and downstream of feed cavity to insulate feed cavity from the heat conducted through both pressure side wall and suction side wall .

Feed region receives cooling fluid from root section or platform . The cooling fluid flows from feed region through cooling leg and exits airfoil through cooling holes . Once the cooling fluid has exited through cooling holes the cooling fluid forms a cooling film along the exterior of pressure side wall Like pressure side cavity and suction side cavity cooling leg can contain a plurality of pedestals and trip strips to create tortuous paths for the cooling fluid to travel through cooling leg before exiting through cooling holes . The cooling fluid flowing through feed region cools the surrounding rib pressure side wall and suction side wall . The cooling fluid flowing through cooling leg cools the surrounding wall surfaces pressure side wall and internal wall in the embodiment shown in . In some embodiments cooling holes are formed in pressure side wall or suction side wall during casting.

Trailing edge cavity is located downstream of intermediate cavity . As shown in trailing edge cavity is separated from intermediate cavity by internal wall . Trailing edge cavity includes feed region and cooling leg . Cooling leg extends generally downstream from feed region between downstream portions of pressure side wall and suction side wall . Feed region receives cooling fluid from root section or platform . The cooling fluid flows from feed region through cooling leg and exits trailing edge of airfoil through cooling slots . Like pressure side cavity suction side cavity and cooling leg cooling leg can contain a plurality of pedestals and trip strips to create tortuous paths for the cooling fluid to travel through cooling leg before exiting through cooling holes . In the embodiment shown in the cooling fluid flowing through feed region cools a portion of internal wall and suction side wall . The cooling fluid flowing through cooling leg cools the surrounding wall surfaces internal wall pressure side wall and suction side wall .

The pressure side and suction side cavities are shaped differently from pressure side cavity and suction side cavity of airfoil . Pressure side cavity includes upstream plenum section A intermediate section B and downstream plenum section C. Suction side cavity includes upstream plenum section A intermediate section B and downstream plenum section C. Instead of pressure side cavity generally minoring suction side cavity downstream plenum section C is located just downstream of feed cavity and downstream plenum section C is located downstream of downstream plenum section C. Feed cavity is insulated by all portions of pressure side cavity upstream plenum section A intermediate section B and downstream plenum section C and upstream plenum section A and intermediate section B of suction side cavity .

Pressure side cavity and suction side cavity also span a greater distance laterally than pressure side cavity and suction side cavity of airfoil shown in . Airfoil A includes camber line . Camber line represents a line that is midway between the exterior surfaces of pressure side wall and suction side wall . As shown in downstream plenum section C crosses camber line so that portions of downstream plenum section C are located on both sides of camber line . Downstream plenum section C also crosses camber line so that portions of downstream plenum section C are located on both sides of camber line . As shown in downstream plenum section C extends from suction side wall to pressure side wall . Additionally pressure side cavity includes one row of cooling holes while suction side cavity includes one row of cooling holes A.

Airfoil B includes pressure side cavity and suction side cavity . Pressure side cavity includes upstream plenum section A intermediate section B and downstream plenum section C. Suction side cavity includes upstream plenum section A intermediate section B and downstream plenum section C. In the embodiment shown in upstream plenum section A and downstream plenum section C both include a row of cooling holes . In one embodiment both rows of cooling holes are drilled through pressure side wall . also illustrates that downstream plenum section C and downstream plenum section C are offset with respect to each other where downstream plenum section C extends farther upstream and downstream plenum section C extends farther downstream.

Airfoil B also includes intermediate cavity second intermediate cavity A and trailing edge cavity . Intermediate cavity and second intermediate cavity A are separated by internal wall which extends between intermediate cavity and second intermediate cavity A and intermediate cavity and trailing edge cavity . Second intermediate cavity A can receive cooling fluid from root section or platform and expel the cooling fluid through cooling holes on suction side wall or to other cavities within airfoil B through openings in the internal walls i.e. intermediate cavity through openings in internal wall .

Airfoil D in illustrates intermediate cavity and trailing edge cavity that extend upstream the same distance. Airfoil E in illustrates pressure side cavity that extends downstream between intermediate cavity and second intermediate cavity A. Each of these different configurations provides a different airfoil cooling solution.

As shown in the arrangement and shape e.g. dog bone flag or combination of internal cavities and cooling holes within airfoils E provide for different airfoil cooling schemes. While these embodiments do not exhaust all of the various design possibilities they illustrate that airfoil cooling solutions can be tailored to specific needs based on the temperatures experienced by different portions of the airfoil. In each of the embodiments shown feed cavity is insulated from the high temperature regions of the airfoil and cooling holes that allow the expulsion of cooling fluid from the internal cavities of the airfoil can be formed by different methods e.g. drilling and casting .

Some of the ceramic cores include openings and or slots or depressions for forming pedestals and trip strips. Openings generally extend through the entire width of a ceramic core and are filled in by material during casting to produce solid pedestals within the cooling circuit that block and shape the flow of the cooling fluid through the cooling circuit. Slots or depressions generally extend through a portion of but not the entire width of a ceramic core and are filled in by material during casting to form trip strips within the cooling circuit that modify the flow of cooling fluid flowing past the trip strips.

Cast cooling holes and slots such as cooling holes and cooling slots can be formed using lands . Lands can have various shapes to produce cooling holes and slots of different shapes. For example lands can have a trapezoidal shape to produce diffusion cooling holes through pressure side wall .

Drilled cooling holes such as cooling holes and A are formed after casting has been completed. Cooling holes and A are drilled through pressure side wall and or suction side wall so that the holes communicate with one of the internal cavities of airfoil e.g. pressure side cavity suction side cavity . The increased cavity thickness of plenum sections A C A and B provide backstrike regions to prevent unintentional drilling of the internal walls of the airfoil. The ability to drill cooling holes and A rather than casting the holes provides additional flexibility in the manufacturing of airfoils .
