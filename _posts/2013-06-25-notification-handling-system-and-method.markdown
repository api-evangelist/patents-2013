title: Notification handling system and method
abstract: A notification handling system determines a notification type for a notification received at a first device of a group of associated devices. The system determines at least a second device from the group that has a capability related to the notification type and accordingly routes the notification to the second device. The second device may be paired to the first device via a wireless link. The notification handling system also augments the notification with additional information for the second device based on the capability of the second device. The augmented information is obtained by extracting data from the notification and augmenting the notification based on the extracted data. The notification handling system may also send or receive a global notification dismissal that dismisses the notification from all associated devices that may have received the notification.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 781 295 filed on 14 Mar. 2013 the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present disclosure relates generally to wireless communication systems and mobile devices and more particularly to methods and apparatuses for handling notifications.

Notifications provide information to a communication device user that a message has arrived or that some event has occurred is occurring or is about to occur. For example notifications may be displayed on a communication device to indicate calendar events various alarms waiting messages etc. Such notifications may be displayed to the user in various ways. For example some notifications may be displayed as an icon positioned on some section of the communication device display or by displaying a pop up message that covers a portion of the display screen and that must be closed by the user by taking some specific action. Notification messages may be generated by various applications resident on a communication device or may be sent by a network or from the communication device operating system.

Many users employ multiple communication devices however a user typically can only use a single device at any one period of time. A notification message received on a particular device may not be particularly useful in that the particular device may not have capability to respond to the notification and a useful way.

The disclosed embodiments provide a notification handling system and various methods of operations. One method of operation of the notification handling system determines a notification type for a notification received at a first device of a group of associated devices and determines at least a second device that is capable of responding to the notification. The notification handling system then routes the notification to the second device. The notification handling system may also augment the notification with additional information for the second device based on the capability of the second device.

The augmented information is obtained by extracting data from the notification and augmenting the notification based on the extracted data. The notification handling system may also send or receive a global notification dismissal that dismisses the notification from all associated devices that may have received the notification.

The notification handling system parses the received notification and extracts data such as time sent related content that is related to the notification identity of a sender or identity of an application that generated the notification. The notification handling system then augments the notification using at least a portion of the extracted data as additional information.

In some embodiments the notification handling system obtains sensor data from a set of sensors of the second device and analyzes the sensor data to determine the environment in which the second device is present. The notification handling system then routes the notification to the second device if the determined environment is suitable for the user to receive the notification. For example if the notification type is related to audio data that notification may not be routed to a device if the device is found to be in a high noise level environment. The sensor data could be an accelerometer a gyroscope a light level sensor a temperature sensor or an audio sensor or some other type of sensor. Other types of environments may include being in motion due to the user running or walking being in motion in a vehicle being in motion on a train or being in a high noise level environment etc.

The notification handling system may also obtain location information from the second device and may determine whether the second device is in the proximity to the first device prior to routing the notification to the second device. The notification may be routed according to a notification priority and a determined response action based on the related content of the notification.

In another method of operation of a notification handling system the system may receive a notification at a first device of a group of associated devices route the notification from the first device to each device of the group of associated devices receive a notification dismissal from one device of the group of associated devices in response to the one device having received the notification and route the notification dismissal to the first device and each other device of the group of associated devices.

The notification may be dismissed on the first device and each device of the group of devices in response to the notification dismissal received by the first device and by each device of the group of associated devices. In other words the dismissal from one device is a global notification dismissal that dismisses the like notification from any devices in a group of devices that received the particular notification.

The present disclosure also provides a device the has at least one wireless transceiver a memory and a notification handling system operatively coupled to the at least one transceiver and to the memory. The notification handling system is operative to perform the methods of operations described herein.

A disclosed system includes a communication device and a wearable device such as a wristwatch. The wearable device can receive the notification over a wireless link with the communication device and can send a global notification dismissal to the communication device using the wireless link. The global notification dismissal dismisses the notification from the communication device and any other device of a group of associated devices that received the notification.

One disclosed embodiments includes a device that has at least one programmable processor and memory operatively coupled to the programmable processor. The memory contains executable instructions for execution by the programmable processor where upon executing the executable instructions the programmable processor is operative to provide a notification handling system in an application framework layer of a software stack. The notification handling system is operatively coupled to a notification manager of the application framework layer and to various applications in an application layer of the software stack.

The notification handling system operative to intercept received notifications obtained by the plurality of applications by communicating with the various applications through the notification manager. The notification handling system may parse the received notifications to determine notification content origin and priority and generate new notifications containing augmented information related to the received notifications. The notification handling system selects one or more associated devices capable of receiving and responding to the new notifications and routes the new notifications to the one or more associated devices using a network.

The notification handling system may select one or more associated devices capable of receiving and responding to the new notifications by assessing user behavior based on a user history. The user behavior provides information about how a user has responded to notifications of a given type and having a given notification content origin and priority in the past. The notification handling system selects one or more associated devices capable of enabling the user to respond to the new notifications accordingly to past assessed user behavior.

The notification handling system may also assess a device environment for each of the one or more associated devices based on sensor data obtained from each of the one or more associated devices and by using device environment along with the user behavior to determine when to send the new notifications.

Turning now to the drawings illustrates an example of the inputs and output for a notification handling system in accordance with an embodiment. A notification handling system receives various inputs from each communication device of a group of communication devices including notification data device capabilities device environment analysis user preferences and user behavior analysis . Based on one or more of these various inputs the notification handling system makes decisions and may create an augmented notification useful for a particular communication device or for a group of communication devices that may have limited capabilities for responding to the notification. The notification handling system appropriately sends the augmented message to one or more communication device using a notification routing module .

The smart watch may communicate with one or more of the other communication devices such as the mobile telephone or the laptop computer using a wireless link technology that facilitates the wireless link between the smart watch and the respective communication devices as shown. Any one communication device of the group of communication devices may receive notifications from the network or may generate notifications based on applications or operating systems operating on the respective communication device.

In one example illustrated by the communication device may receive a notification from the WAN over the wireless link . In accordance with one embodiment the communication device may route the notification to one or more communication devices of a group of communication devices . In the example shown in the group of other communication devices includes communication device A B and C and possibly other communication devices not shown. Each communication device of the group of communication devices is operative to communicate with server using the network . The communication device forms connection to the server by for example logging into the server . The user of the communication device will also be the user of the group of communication devices and each device will be associated with the user s account with server . The user will also have associated the communication device and each one of the group of communication devices with the user s account. In one example the user may associate each of the communication devices with the user s account login ID.

The notification handling system which is present on at least communication device may automatically establish the connection between the communication device and server without any intervention from the user. Likewise each one of the communication devices of the group of communication devices may receive information or send information over a connection to the server . Returning to the example under discussion the communication device may receive a notification from the WAN over the wireless link or alternatively a notification may be generated by an application resident on the communication device . The notification handling system will analyze the notification and take appropriate action. For example the notification handling system may create an augmented notification that has information additional to the initial notification displayed and communication device . The notification handling system may send the augmented notification to the entire group of communication devices or to a specific communication device. In the example illustrated in augmented notifications A through C are sent to the respective communication devices by utilizing a routing push mechanism of the server . The server receives the augmented notifications A B and C and appropriately pushes them to the corresponding communication device. Therefore augmented notification A is sent to communication device A augmented notification B is sent to communication device B augmented notification C is sent to communication device C and so forth. The smart watch may also receive an augmented notification D over the wireless link between the smart watch and the communication device .

Therefore in one example illustrated in a notification received by communication device is handled by the notification handling system and is augmented for each communication device associated with the user communication device and is routed to that specific communication device using a routing push mechanism of the server or some other appropriate routing mechanism.

In some embodiments the notification response may be a dismissal of the notification. Furthermore the notification response may be a global dismissal in that it appropriately dismisses the notification from being displayed on each of the communication devices to which the notification response is sent. That is the notification response may be considered a control or command signal that controls or commands the receiving communication devices to dismiss the notification from the respective communication device display.

Further details of the notification handling system are illustrated in which is a partial schematic block diagram of the communication device . The notification handling system may consist of several components including notification routing module notification data mining module behavior analysis module and environment analysis module .

Likewise the notification handling system may send command or control signals to perform various functions related to the notifications of the applications such as but not limited to dismissing the notifications from display on the particular communication device or responding to the notifications in any of various ways.

Another notification or an input query may be displayed by communication device that enables the user to perform a global dismissal of the notification and clear all devices of the notification. The notification may also be forwarded to the smart watch and displayed as notification . By pressing one of the buttons for example the user may clear the prior notification . In the example of if the user pressed the appropriate one of the buttons the smart watch would send a global dismissal command signal to the communication device over the wireless link . The communication device would then route the global dismissal through the appropriate server to any other communication devices associated with that user so that the notification would be appropriately dismissed from each communication device.

Alternatively the user may use the respond to notification using the communication device and clear the notifications from the communication device which would likewise send a global dismissal signal to all other associated communication devices including the smart watch .

In another example the user may take some action other than dismissal such as responding to a notification on an appropriate device. For example if the notification is related to a received text message the user may wish to respond by sending a like text message in reply to the text message sender. However the smart watch may be incapable of sending a responding text message due to its lack of a keypad. In this case the notification handling system would determine which device or devices to route the notification to based on the known capability of each device. That is the smart watch would not receive the notification in some instances when the smart watch was not the appropriate device to respond to the notification.

In accordance with the embodiments other criteria may also be used for deciding when to send given notifications to particular devices based on the environment of the particular device and other factors as will be described in further detail below.

Turning to in decision block the notification handling system determines if any behavioral data exists for the particular notification type received. If yes then the notification handling system may apply weighting factors based on the behavioral data as shown in block . If no behavioral data is found to exist in decision block then the method of operation proceeds to decision block and determines whether the sender of the notification is known entity or not. The entity may be a person when the notification is related to a telephone call text message an e mail message etc. or may be a specific application such as a calendar application informing the user of an upcoming appointment. If the sender is not identifiable in decision block then the method of operation proceeds to block . However if the sender of the notification is identified in decision block then the notification handling system checks to see if any behavioral data exists related to the particular sender as shown in decision block . If not the method of operation again proceeds to block . If behavioral data does exist then weighting factors are applied as shown in block .

Proceeding with the operation related to block the notification handling system reviews any content including searching for keywords message status or other information. Then as shown in block the notification handling system assigns a priority level for the notification. The assigned priority level may be different than the priority level the notification inherently had assigned and which may have been assigned by an application or by a person sending a message related to the notification. Put another way a notification may be re prioritized by the notification handling system.

The method of operation then returns to block and the process flow shown in continues. In block the notification handling systems determines the appropriate response action. Further details of operation related to the operations of block are shown in . Thus the method of operation proceeds to input blocks and . At input block the notification handling system obtains sensor inputs from a set of sensors operative in one or more of the communication devices that are candidates for receiving and augmented notification. The sensors may include but are not limited to accelerometer an ambient audio sensor a gyroscopic sensor a temperature sensor or light level sensor etc. The notification handling system may also obtain other inputs as shown in input block such as some of the inputs that were discussed with respect to the various component modules in or .

Based on the sensor data or other data received the notification handling system determines if the environment is discernible as shown in decision block . For example the notification handling system may determine one of the environments such as that the user is running walking on a train in a vehicle in a crowd or other high noise environment in a meeting etc. For example ambient audio information may be an indicator that the user is in a high noise environment while calendar information obtained as other inputs at input block may indicate that the user is at an outdoor concert. In that case sending a certain type of notification to the user s mobile telephone at the concert would not be useful. Thus if the environment is discernible in decision block then the notification handling system will decide whether to provide the notification at the current device only as shown in decision block that is to display the notification and not route the notification any further. If yes and the notification should remain at the local device then the notification handling system may check for device capabilities as shown in block and may further decide whether to augment the notification for the particular device as shown in decision block .

If the notification handling system decides that the notification should be routed to another device in decision block then the notification handling system may check with the appropriate server to determine what other devices are available as shown in decision block . If other devices are not available in decision block then the notification handling system may make a decision as to whether to automatically respond as shown in decision block . If auto respond is not desirable in decision block then the method of operation may return to operation block and check for device capabilities of the current device. However if auto respond is desirable in decision block then the notification handling system may take appropriate action as shown in operations block .

The appropriate action for auto responding may be ending a call muting a call sending an automatic text reply sending an automatic e mail reply automatically calling back sending the call to voicemail performing a global dismissal of the notification or some other action etc. The notification handling system then creates a new notification in operation block to inform the user that the auto reply was sent in response to the received notification.

The notification handling system may then check for device capabilities in block and may augment the notification in decision block based on the device capabilities. Returning to decision block if other devices are available the notification handling system may select one or more of the available devices as shown in operation block . For each device the notification handling system will check the device capabilities as shown in operation block and will for each device determine whether the notification should be augmented as shown in decision block . Depending upon whether the notification should be augmented or not the method of operation will return to the process flow in either of operation block which augments the notification or operation block which immediately precedes to route the notification to the selected device or devices. The method of operation then ends in block as shown.

Therefore in light of the above description various use case scenarios may be envisioned by those of ordinary skill. In one example use case scenario a communication device may receive an incoming notification that an e mail message has been received. However based on the user history the notification handling system may determine that the user rarely if ever responds to e mail messages from a particular sender and either files the e mail message or immediately deletes it. The notification handling system may automatically respond by taking the appropriate action such as deleting the e mail and performing a global dismissal of the notification from the receiving device and any other device to which the notification was routed.

In another use case scenario a user may receive the e mail message and the user history may show that the user has a history of responding immediately by sending a responsive e mail. The notification handling system may determine that the notification should be sent to the user s personal computer which has a keyboard and at which environment analysis shows the user is most likely present and using at the time of the incoming notification. The user may then receive the notification at the personal computer and type a responsive e mail and subsequently clear the notification message from all communication devices.

The user may receive a notification of an incoming telephone call at a mobile telephone communication device and the notification handling system may determine that the user is in an important meeting based on calendar data and location information obtained from the user s mobile telephone. Assuming that the behavior analysis indicates the call is not particularly urgent based on its content the sender and other information collected as was described above the notification may not be routed to the user s mobile telephone. Instead the notification may be routed to the user s smart watch. At that point the user may be able to see the caller s name and press a button or utilize some other user interface of the smart watch to perform a global dismissal of the call.

As will be understood by those of ordinary skill in view of the detailed description of various embodiments provided herein many other various use case scenarios may be realized using the features of the embodiments described above. Therefore the features and functions described above for the notification handling system provide many advantages over prior systems such that the wide variety of use case scenarios may be realized and a more intelligent system for providing notifications to a user can likewise be achieved.

While various embodiments have been illustrated and described it is to be understood that the invention is not so limited. Numerous modifications changes variations substitutions and equivalents will occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.
