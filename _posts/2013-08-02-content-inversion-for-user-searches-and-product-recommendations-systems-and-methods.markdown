The present application is related to and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 678 893 filed Aug. 2 2012 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present application generally relates to content inversion for use in user searches and product recommendations and more specifically to linguistic processing of sentiment expressions and need expressions from syntactic parse trees to determine topics and features of semantic statements for use in natural language searching.

User may conduct natural language searches using search engines that return results simply based on number and commonality of key words found in the search input. While often helpful key word searches only perform term searches and may return a multitude of irrelevant results or results that simply repeat key words frequently but offer little content. Thus the semantic understanding of phrases and sentences is not utilized. Additionally it is becoming more common for users to visit blogs and forums prior to purchasing product in order to read user reviews. However user reviews may be skewed towards opinions about subjects one user finds pertinent to their interests while other users do not. For example one purchaser of a camera may rate a product with five stars due to the durability and or waterproof features of the camera. However a second user may rate the camera with zero or one star due to the low tech features or minimal zoom of the camera. Depending on the interests and sentiments of those interests reviews may only be relevant to certain new purchasers. Additionally with no way to trust or rate the authors of reviews their assigned rankings may not correspond to the new purchaser s rankings i.e. be over or under valued. Thus the new purchaser must wade through a multitude of reviews without finding relevant information.

Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.

In certain embodiments a content processing and or search server processes various forms of content to obtain feature centered information from author centered structures. Content inversion may refer generally to the operation of taking author centered structures and transforming them or inverting them into syntactic information for the purpose of understanding analyzing and correlating their semantic properties. The forms of content may include but are not limited to forum postings online blog or other social media posting including micro blogging user reviews or other media content. Once the content is received by the server the content may be inverted from a semantic form into syntactic structures. In doing so an application of the server may analyze the content to identify a sentence with a sentiment expression. The sentiment may be identified in the sentence where the sentiment corresponds to a user feeling and or expression concerning a specific subject. The sentiment corresponds to a particular polarity such as good great bad etc. Once the sentiment is identified a user needs expression may be determined that is acted upon by the sentiment. The user needs expression may correspond to a particular statement of desire for the user. For example the sentiment may be good while the user need may be food travel travel with children or other need statement. The needs expression may have a particular subject acted on by the sentiment and further have a feature that affects the needs expression. For example where the needs expression is directed to travel or food the feature may correspond to a type of food or travel location such as Indian or Hawaii.

In some embodiments prior to determining a sentiment of a sentence syntactic parse trees representing the syntactic structure of a sentence may be formed for a plurality content sentences containing sentiment expression. Once a syntactic parse tree is formed the above described method may be utilized to determine particular user sentiments to subjects and the subject s features. The subjects may be included in a user needs statement and the user needs statement containing the subject and any additional features may form a sub tree of the syntactic parse tree. Similar user sentiments subjects and or features may then be correlated based on generalizing the sub trees to find commonality. After sub trees are grouped topicality of the subjects is formed to organize the sentences.

In one embodiment a plurality of contents containing sentences with consumer sentiment expressions are translated to syntactic parse trees then sub trees containing subjects are grouped by topicality of subject. The contents may include blog postings and user reviews. Then a user may utilize a search engine to browse the contents by inputting a search query containing a subject and in various embodiments a feature. The search engine may retrieve results from the plurality of contents showing similar contents and features by searching the topic corresponding to the subject and finding sub trees expressing commonality with the search query. User sentiments in the search results may also have an effect on the results. For example if the user searches for travel with beaches the search engine may return contents where users expressed positive polarity sentiments about travel that included beaches. The user may initially designate both the subject and the feature or may refine the subject with the feature while searching. Thus the user is not required to sift through user reviews and or blog postings that contain other sentiments or use the words but do not express sentiments concerning the travel. Instead the user is able to view reviews and blog postings that contain the subject with a user sentiment about the subject. Additionally advertisements may be constructed using the user search including sentiment expressions directed to the users search.

System includes a user utilizing a user device with a search server a content provider server and an advertisement server over a network .

In addition to identifying a sentiment expression in a semantic structure content inversion application may identify needs expression corresponding to the sentiment. In some embodiments such as search queries only a needs statement has to be identified. The needs statement includes a sub tree of the syntactic parse tree. The needs expression may be normalized in order to transform the needs expressions into sequences of words in a normal format without prepositions and articles such as a subject of the needs expression. Thus the subject of the needs expression is determined and any additional feature s are further determined. The features may correspond to subcategory or further clarifier of the subject. Additionally content inversion application may group the needs expressions by the main noun of the needs expression i.e. the subject to create topics and further into sub categories by features. Once the content is inverted to topicality groups the content and or content identifiers i.e. content links or other identifying information may be stored according to topicality groups in a database.

Thus network may correspond to small scale communication networks such as a private or local area network or a larger scale network such as a wide area network or the Internet accessible by the various components of system .

Sentence of is shown after processing into syntactic parse tree . Syntactic parse tree is a parse tree having an ordering that shows the syntactic structure of sentence . Syntactic parse tree takes the semantic structure of sentence and converts the semantic structure into syntactic information i.e. separated into syntactic properties or units for analysis. The syntactic information can be analyzed to determine the semantic differences between sentences that contain similar words.

For example sentence of states The quality is great in bright daylight. In this example sentence refers to the picture taking quality of a camera. However in normal natural language searches a user may search for great quality in bright daylight when looking for quality of picture taking. Sentence may be returned in a search result with relevance the same as a sentence that states The camera casing quality looks great in bright daylight using such search terms.

Thus in sentence is converted to syntactic parse tree having sentiment expression and needs expression . Sentiment expression circled in is shown with sentiment . A content inversion application may identify sentiment from sentiment expression . Sentiment may correspond to a user statement of feeling or expression containing a polarity such as good great bad worse etc. As shown in sentiment corresponds to great.

Next a content inversion application may determine the needs expression corresponding to sentiment . In needs expression corresponds to sentiment . Needs expression corresponds to a user concern affected by the sentiment or is a sub tree of syntactic parse tree dependent on sentiment . Needs expression includes phrasings of nouns adjectives and or verbs that correspond to an expression of need by a user such as a desire or want the user possesses. In search queries a sentiment expression may not occur thus only a needs expression may be determined. However as the search result is concerned only with matching and similar needs expressions using sub trees sentiment expression in results may affect result rankings placement or other user or administrator chosen feature.

Needs expression may be normalized after it is determined. Normalizing needs expression may remove excess words such as prepositions and articles to identify the subject and any feature affecting the subject. Thus after normalizing needs expression subject and feature may be identified. In addition to normalizing needs expression to remove extraneous words subject and feature may be filtered to remove the trivial and very rare subjects and or features.

The content inversion application may group needs expressions having subjects and or features by topicality i.e. form categories and or subcategories of concerns or needs. Thus and are two syntactic parse trees of two different sentences showing common sub trees having similar syntactic information. and are syntactic parse trees of two different sentences. However the sub trees of the syntactic parse trees having the same subject show similar sub trees. Thus when a search using a similar needs expression is submitted and may be retrieved if commonality exists between sub trees of the search and and .

Syntactic parse tree is formed for the sentence How can I get short focus zoom lens for digital camera. Syntactic parse tree may be formed by a content inversion application. Syntactic parse tree contains subject which may be determined and correlated to other same or similar subjects called topicality grouping. Syntactic parse tree further contains sub tree which corresponds generally to a user needs statement having further information including features affecting subject .

Commonality between sub tree and sub tree can be determined by generalizing expressions between syntactic parse tree and syntactic parse tree . At the phrase level generalization starts with finding alignment between two phrases thus attempting to set correspondences between as many words as possible in the two phrases. The alignment should retain the integrity of the phrase. In particular two phrases should only be aligned if their head nouns subjects are established.

For a pair of phrases generalization includes all maximum ordered sequences of words forming generalization nodes for words in phrases so that the order of words is retained. In the following example To buy digital camera today on Monday and Digital camera was a good buy today first Monday of the month generalization is where the generalization for noun phrases is followed by the generalization by adverbial phrase. Verb buy is excluded from both generalizations because it occurs in a different order in the above phrases. Buy digital camera is not a generalization phrase because buy occurs in different sequence with the other generalization nodes. For a pair of sentences their generalization is a set of maximum common subgraphs sub trees of their syntactic parse trees or in terms of phrases set of all generalization of all phrases from these sentences.

Multiple maximum generalizations occur depending how correspondence between words is established multiple generalizations are possible. To obey the condition of maximum generalizations are scored. Scoring weights of generalizations are decreasing in following order nouns and verbs other parts of speech and nodes with no lemma but part of speech only.

To optimize the calculation of generalization score the POS weights are introduced to deliver the most accurate similarity measure between sentences possible. W 1.0 W 0.32 W 0.71 W 0.64 W 0.83 W 0.35 excluding common frequent verbs like get take set put for which W 0.57. Also W 0.2 different words but the same POS and W 0.3 the same word but occurs as different POSs in two sentences .

Generalization score or similarity between sentences sent sent then can be expressed as sum through phrases of the weighted sum through words wordand word score sent sent word generalization wordword .

Maximal generalization can then be defined as the one with the highest score. This way is defined a generalization for phrases sentences and paragraphs. Result of generalization can be further generalized with other parse trees or generalization. Below is an example of generalization between two sentences. Intermediate sub trees are shown as lists for brevity. Generalization of distinct values is denoted by . Consider the three following sentences 

One can see that the second and third trees are rather similar so it is straight forward to build their common sub tree as an interrupted path of the tree. MD can PRP I VB get NN focus NN lens IN for JJ digital NN camera.

At the phrase level Noun phrases NN focus NN JJ digital NN camera Verb phrases VB get NN focus NN NN lens IN for JJ digital NN camera 

One can see that common words remain in the maximum common sub tree except can which is unique for the second sentence and modifiers for lens which are different in these two sentences shown as NN focus NN NN lens . When sentences are not as similar as sentences 2 and 3 and their generalization proceeds on a phrase by phrase basis. Below is the syntactic parse tree via chunking using the format .

Parse 1 0 S I am curious how to use the digital zoom of this camera for filming insects 0 NP I 2 VP am curious how to use the digital zoom of this camera for filming insects 2 VBP am 5 ADJP curious 5 JJ curious 13 SBAR how to use the digital zoom of this camera for filming insects 13 WHADVP how 13 WRB how 17 S to use the digital zoom of this camera for filming insects 17 VP to use the digital zoom of this camera for filming insects 17 TO to 20 VP use the digital zoom of this camera for filming insects 20 VB use 24 NP the digital zoom of this camera 24 NP the digital zoom 24 DT the 28 JJ digital 36 NN zoom 41 PP of this camera 41 IN of 44 NP this camera 44 DT this 49 NN camera 56 PP for filming insects 56 IN for 60 NP filming insects 60 VBG filming 68 NNS insects

Now we group the above phrases by the phrase type NP VP PP ADJP WHADVP. Numbers encode character position at the beginning. Each group contains the phrases of the same type since the match occurs between the same type.

In this manner the level of generalization may be determined between sub trees. Thus search results containing sub trees with corresponding levels of generalization may be returned instead of simple occurrence of search terms.

As shown in search results contain forum results and and user reviews . Forum results and display forum searched results using the methods described herein. For example forum results and contain sentences with syntactic parse trees having generalized sub trees to search query . Additionally user reviews also contain sentences with syntactic parse trees having generalized sub trees to search query . may be grouped by sentiments contained in sentiment expressions found in the syntactic parse trees by ranking the sentiments based on polarity of number of polarity values or other sentiment grouping.

Moreover search engine may contain or work with an advertising application to present advertisements . Advertisements may be built by the advertising application including subjects and features taken from search query . Moreover advertisements may be described using advertising language including sentiment expressions such as positive sentiments.

At step a server such as search server receives a first content wherein the first content includes a first sentence having at least one first sentiment expression. The first content may correspond to a blog posting micro blog posting user review or other content such as those previously discussed. The content contains some general statement of sentiment such as a statement of the users feeling sentiment and or expression about a user need statement.

Once a sentence with a sentiment expression is received the server creates a syntactic parse tree of the first sentence at step . As previously discussed the syntactic parse tree corresponds generally to a parse tree having an ordering that shows the syntactic structure of sentence for example syntactic parse tree of sentence .

At step a content inversion application of the server identifies a first sentiment in the at least one first sentiment expression wherein the first sentiment corresponds to a polarity expression. The content inversion application may identify the sentiment in the sentiment expression by removing extraneous wording. Additionally the sentiment may be determined to correspond to a polarity expression such as positive negative or neutral polarity.

Once the sentiment is determined a first needs expression correspond to the first sentiment is determined wherein the first needs expression includes a first subject at step . The first needs expression may correspond to a sub tree of the syntactic parse tree. The first needs expression corresponds to a user interest need or desire such as a subject corresponding to the sentiment.
