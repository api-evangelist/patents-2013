This disclosure relates to systems and method for providing recommendations to users of a game based on the capabilities and specification of the client devices used to access the game.

Different classes of devices such as laptops tablet computers gaming consoles smartphones smart TVs and or other classes of devices may have technical capabilities that are different from one another. For example laptop computers may have different technical capabilities than smartphones such as different processing and graphical display capabilities. Furthermore different types of devices within a given class of device may have different capabilities from one another. For example a particular model of smartphone may have different technical capabilities than another model of smartphone such as different screen resolutions processing capabilities and or connectivity capabilities.

Different devices may have different input mechanisms such as gesture controls voice controls touch controls e.g. soft or mechanical buttons joysticks gamepads and or other input mechanism. The different input mechanisms may each have different characteristics that lends better to certain game activity or content than others.

Leveraging the differences in the capabilities of the devices for gameplay of a game may provide dynamic gaming experiences for users depending on the class and or type of device used to access the game.

One aspect of the disclosure relates to providing recommendations to users of a game based on the specification of the client device used by the users to access the game. Recommendations of content may be provided to users of a game based on the specification of the client device used by the users to access the game. Recommendations may be provided automatically to users of the game. For example recommendations may be automatically provided by the system for providing recommendations to users of a game. Systems for providing recommendations of content to players of an online game may be configured to determine the specification sets of device a user is using to access the game. The system may be capable of obtaining and or determining the minimum threshold requirements of sets of content and provide recommendations to users of in game content to users based on the obtained and or determined minimum threshold requirements of the sets of in game content and the specification sets of the device a user s using to access the online game. The recommended content may include actions or activities within the game such as attacking an enemy gathering troops securing resources performing research training troops playing certain game levels attending virtual meetings and or other actions or activities. The recommended content may include virtual items usable in the game virtual services that can be acquired used virtual locations that may be visited and or purchased and or other content that is usable in the game. The recommended content may include content external to the game such as websites forums other games videos chat rooms e commerce websites and or applications and or other content external to the game.

The user may access the game using a client computing device having a touchscreen input system. Typing on touchscreen devices may not be as easy or convenient as a device having a physical keyboard. The system may present the user using a touchscreen device a recommendation for an activity or action that does not require extensive typing. When using such devices the recommended activities presented to users may include those that can be easily controlled or otherwise interacted with using gestures on the touch screen or voice controls. On the other hand the system may provide a player using a laptop computer to play the game with a recommendation related to activities or actions that are controlled or otherwise interacted with using typed commands.

Users using devices having greater processing capabilities may be presented with recommendations for activities or actions which have a higher degree of complicated gameplay or require better graphical capabilities compared to devices having less processing capabilities. Additionally larger devices may have input devices or mechanisms that are better suited to using both of the user s hands when interacting with the game. The system may recommend to users of such devices activities and or actions which are better suited to using two hands.

In some implementations the system may include one or more servers. The server s may be configured to communicate with one or more client computing platforms according to a client server architecture. The users may access the system and or a virtual space e.g. a virtual world a game space etc. via the client computing platforms.

The server s and or client computer platforms may be configured to execute one or more computer program components to provide recommendations to users. The computer program components may include one or more of a game component a device specification determination component a content recommendation component and or other components.

The game component may configured to execute an instance of a virtual space in which a game is conducted and to implement the instance to facilitate presentation of a view of the virtual space to users through client computing devices associated with the users users including a first user associated with a first client computing device. Such games may be an online game. The instance of the virtual space may be executed on a server in electrical connection with a client computing device where a presentation of the virtual space is facilitated through the client computing devices. Users may use the client computing device to control actions within the virtual space. The client computing device may be electrically connected to the server through a network. The network may include one or more of a local area network the internet a wireless network a wired network and or other networks.

In other examples the game component may be configured to execute an instance of a virtual space in which a game is conducted and to implement the instance to facilitate presentation of a view of the virtual space to users through the client computing devices associated with the users including a first user associated with a first client computing device.

A device specification determination component may be configured to obtain device specification sets of the client computing devices associated with the users such that a first device specification set is determined for the first client computing device. Device specification sets may include information regarding the client computing device specifications. Such information may include processing ability user input mechanisms graphical display information screen size age number of previous users storage capacity location connectivity options and or other information related to the client computing device.

The content recommendation component may be configured to determine recommendations in the game for the users based on the obtained device specification sets and to effectuate communication of the recommendations to the users such that the content recommendation component determines a first recommendation in the game for the first user based on the first device specification set and to effectuate communication of the first recommendation to the first user. Such determination and communication of recommendations may occur automatically within the system.

The first recommendation may be an offer to interact with specific content in the game purchase a virtual item establish a relationship with one or more other users and or one or more other actions. The first recommendation may be an offer to participate in activities in the game suited to the interface of the first client computing device. The first recommendation may be an offer to participate in activities suited to the processing and or storage capabilities of the first client computing device. The recommendation may be an invitation to participate in one or more event sets associated with the online game.

The first recommendation may be an offer to participate in activities suited to the input capabilities of the first client computing device. The input capabilities of the first client computing device may include one or more of a touchscreen a keyboard a joystick a directional pointing device a controller a remote control a gesture recognition device a video input device an audio input device and or any other input device. For example where the input capabilities of the first client computing device include a touch screen the first recommendation may be an offer to participate in activities suited to interactions by the first user through a touchscreen such as an activity adapted to client computing devices that typically have touchscreen input devices and require the user to interact with the game through a swiping motion or touching a particular area of the screen. As another example where the input capabilities of the first client computing device include a keyboard the first recommendation may be an offer to participate in activities suited to interactions by the first user though a keyboard such as online chatting and or typing various commands.

The first recommendation may be an offer to purchase one or more virtual items having an associated cost to the user. The associated cost to the user may be related to the device specification sets of the client computing devices associated with the users such that the associated cost to the user for the offer to purchase one or more virtual items is related to the one or more device specification sets of the client computing devices associated with the first user. For example the device specification set associated with a client computing device associated with the first user may include information related to the propensity of the user to make in game purchases such as purchasing virtual items using that given client computing device. Such a client computing device may have one or more input devices or communication devices making it easier to purchase items with it such as a keyboard access to the internet or some other specification. The client computing device may have stored information related to the users purchase mechanisms such as credit card information bank account information online payment system information and or other payment information of the first user indicating a propensity to make purchases using the given client computing device.

The associated user cost of the in game purchase may be based upon the device specification sets and may be modified based upon the device specification sets of the client computing devices associated with the first user. For example the user component may include information related to the user s client computing devices. Users having more expensive client computing devices or users having two or more client computing device which are used to access the online game may be more or less likely to make in game purchases. Accordingly the associated user cost of the in game purchase may be increased or decreased in order to incentivize the user to make in game purchases.

In other implementations the user component may include a first user account wherein the first user account includes information related to the client computing devices associated with the user and used to access the online game. Upon an indication that the user has a higher propensity to make in game purchases using a first client computing device associated with the user compared to other client computing devices associated with the user the content recommendation component may be configured to determine recommendations for in game content accessible by the first client computing device in order to increase the likelihood that the user will make an in game purchase.

The device specification determination component may be further configured to determine a second device specification set for a second client computing device associated with the first user. In response to a determination of the second device specification set for a second client computing device the content recommendation component may be further configured to determine a second recommendation in the game for the first user based on the second device specification set and to effectuate communication of the second recommendation to the first user. Where there are first and second device specification sets for first and second client computing devices associated with the user the first recommendation and the second recommendation may be an offer to participate in an activity suited to the specification sets for the first client device and the second client device such that both the first client device and second client device may be used simultaneously and or interchangeably by the user when participating in the activity.

Where there are two client computing devices associated with the first user one of the client computing devices may be the main client computing device and the second client computing device may be an auxiliary client computing device. The main client computing device may have superior computing and or graphical capabilities than the auxiliary client computing device. As such the first recommendation for the first or main client computing device may be an activity which requires superior computing capabilities for example the main game play. The second recommendation for the second or auxiliary client computing device may be an activity which requires less computing capabilities for example a mini game map chat room message board and or other activity associated with the main game play.
