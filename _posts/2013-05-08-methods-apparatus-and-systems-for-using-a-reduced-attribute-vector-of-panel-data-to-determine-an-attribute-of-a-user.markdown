title: Methods, apparatus, and systems for using a reduced attribute vector of panel data to determine an attribute of a user
abstract: Methods, system, and media for scaling a panel of users with known attributes to determine an unknown attribute of a user are disclosed. An unclassified attribute vector of the user may be received. The unclassified attribute vector may comprise first attributes and first attribute values. A reduced attribute vector may be produced using the unclassified attribute vector and a projection matrix. The reduced attribute vector may have fewer attributes than the unclassified attribute vector. A plurality of reduced panel attribute vectors may be produced using a plurality of classified panel attribute vectors of users from the panel and the projection matrix. The reduced panel attribute vectors may have fewer attributes than the classified panel attribute vectors. The unknown attribute of the user may be determined based on the reduced attribute vector, the plurality of reduced panel attribute vectors, and the known attributes.
