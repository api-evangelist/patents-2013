Augmented or mixed reality devices may be used in a variety of real world environments and contexts. Such devices may provide a user with a real time view of the physical world surrounding the user and may augment the view with holographic objects and other virtual reality information.

Large amounts of virtual reality information may be available for presentation to a user. Some of this information may be associated with a particular location that may be within view of the user. With so much virtual reality information available managing the presentation of this information to a user and the user s interaction with such information can prove challenging. Presenting too much virtual reality information may clutter a user s experience of a mixed reality environment and overwhelm the user making the information difficult to process. Additionally in some cases the user may be interested in viewing only a small portion of the total amount of virtual reality information available. Further even when a smaller portion of the available virtual reality information is presented the amount of information and manner of presentation may still create a user experience that is less than desirable.

Various embodiments are disclosed herein that relate to presenting a filtered collection of geo located data items in a mixed reality environment via a display device. For example one disclosed embodiment provides a method for selectively filtering a plurality of geo located data items that include geo located hologram items and other geo located data items in a mixed reality environment. The method includes receiving the plurality of geo located data items and selectively filtering the data items based on one or more modes. The modes comprise one or more of a social mode a popular mode a recent mode a work mode a play mode and a user interest mode. Such filtering yields a filtered collection of the geo located data items. The filtered collection of data items is then provided to a mixed reality display program for display by a display device.

Outward facing sensor may also capture two dimensional image information and depth information from a physical environment and physical objects within the environment. For example outward facing sensor may include a depth camera a visible light camera an infrared light camera and or a position tracking camera.

The HMD device may include depth sensing via one or more depth cameras. In one example each depth camera may include left and right cameras of a stereoscopic vision system. Time resolved images from one or more of these depth cameras may be registered to each other and or to images from another optical sensor such as a visible spectrum camera and may be combined to yield depth resolved video.

In other examples a structured light depth camera may be configured to project a structured infrared illumination and to image the illumination reflected from a scene onto which the illumination is projected. A depth map of the scene may be constructed based on spacings between adjacent features in the various regions of an imaged scene. In still other examples a depth camera may take the form of a time of flight depth camera configured to project a pulsed infrared illumination onto a scene and detect the illumination reflected from the scene. It will be appreciated that any other suitable depth camera may be used within the scope of the present disclosure.

Outward facing sensor may capture images of the physical environment in which a user is situated. In one example the mixed reality display program may include a 3D modeling system that uses such input to generate the virtual environment that models the physical environment surrounding the user.

The HMD device may also include a position sensor system that utilizes one or more motion sensors to enable position tracking and or orientation sensing of the HMD device. For example the position sensor system may be utilized to determine a head pose orientation of a user s head. In one example position sensor system may comprise an inertial measurement unit configured as a six axis or six degree of freedom position sensor system. This example position sensor system may for example include three accelerometers and three gyroscopes to indicate or measure a change in location of the HMD device within three dimensional space along three orthogonal axes e.g. x y z and a change in an orientation of the HMD device about the three orthogonal axes e.g. roll pitch yaw .

Position sensor system may also support other suitable positioning techniques such as GPS or other global navigation systems. Further while specific examples of position sensor systems have been described it will be appreciated that other suitable position sensor systems may be used.

In some examples motion sensors may also be employed as user input devices such that a user may interact with the HMD device via gestures of the neck and head or even of the body. The HMD device may also include a microphone system that includes one or more microphones . In other examples audio may be presented to the user via one or more speakers on the HMD device .

The HMD device may also include a processor having a logic subsystem and a storage subsystem as discussed in more detail below with respect to that are in communication with the various sensors and systems of the HMD device. In one example the storage subsystem may include instructions that are executable by the logic subsystem to receive signal inputs from the sensors and forward such inputs to computing device in unprocessed or processed form and to present images to a user via the transparent display .

It will be appreciated that the HMD device and related sensors and other components described above and illustrated in are provided by way of example. These examples are not intended to be limiting in any manner as any other suitable sensors components and or combination of sensors and components may be utilized. Therefore it is to be understood that the HMD device may include additional and or alternative sensors cameras microphones input devices output devices etc. without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Further the physical configuration of the HMD device and its various sensors and subcomponents may take a variety of different forms without departing from the scope of this disclosure.

With reference now to descriptions of example use cases and embodiments of the mixed reality filtering system will now be provided. is a schematic illustration of a user wearing HMD device and viewing through the device a physical environment in the form of a city intersection. In this example the HMD device takes the form of HMD device .

As viewed by the user and with reference also to the virtual environment combines with the physical environment to create the mixed reality environment . The mixed reality environment includes geo located data items that are associated with particular locations within the physical environment . In this example and with reference to such geo located data items include a holographic wizard recommendation icons and a social network post a customer review a photo a popularity icon and an alert icon .

As explained in more detail below numerous additional geo located data items may also be associated with locations within physical environment . In various examples such additional geo located data items may number in the tens hundreds thousands or more. Where a large number of additional geo located data items are present it will be appreciated that displaying all such data items may overwhelm the user make the information difficult to process and or create undesirable visual clutter that degrades the user s perception of the physical environment . Advantageously and as explained in more detail below the mixed reality filtering system of the present disclosure creates a filtered collection of geo located data items that enables a user to easily locate and navigate among data items relevant to the user thereby providing an improved user experience.

In one example the mixed reality filtering program is configured to selectively filter a plurality of geo located data items based on one or more modes to yield a filtered collection of the geo located data items . The filtered collection may then be provided to the mixed reality display program for display by the HMD device . In one example the mixed reality filtering program may utilize a social mode that filters the plurality of geo located data items to yield those data items that are associated with a friend family member or other social acquaintance of the user .

With reference to in one example a first friend of the user may have previously visited the lounge and left recommendation icon associated with the lounge to indicate the friend s approval of the lounge. A second friend of the user may have lunched at the food cart and left recommendation icon to indicate this friend s endorsement of the food cart. While in the social mode in this example the mixed reality filtering program may include only the recommendation icons and in the filtered collection of data items that are displayed to the user via the HMD device .

Additionally and as shown in each recommendation icon and may also take a different form that associates the icon with the first friend and the second friend respectively. It will be appreciated that many other types of data items that are associated with a friend family member or other social acquaintance of the user may also be included in this filtered collection of data items .

In another example the mixed reality filtering program may utilize a popular mode that filters the plurality of geo located data items to yield those data items that are associated with at least a threshold popularity level. With reference again to the theatre may be hosting a musical that is receiving rave reviews from critics in the local media attendees blogs commentary via social media and other online sources with such reviews averaging 3.9 stars out of 4 stars. In one example the threshold popularity level may correspond to an average review of 3 stars out of 4 stars. As the reviews for the musical average 3.9 stars while in the popular mode the mixed reality filtering program may include the popularity icon in the filtered collection of data items . The mixed reality filtering program may display the popularity icon above the theatre to indicate that a popular event is associated with the theatre. It will be appreciated that many other types of data items that are associated with at least a threshold popularity level may also be included in this filtered collection of data items .

In another example the mixed reality filtering program may utilize a recent mode that filters the plurality of geo located data items to yield those data items that have been created or updated within a threshold time frame. With reference again to the customer review of the lounge may have been posted just one hour ago. In one example the threshold timeframe may be within the last week. As the customer review of the lounge was posted one hour ago while in the recent mode the mixed reality filtering program may include the customer review in the filtered collection of data items and may display the review next to the lounge . It will be appreciated that many other types of data items that have been created or updated within a threshold time frame may also be included in this filtered collection of data items .

In another example the mixed reality filtering program may utilize a work mode that filters the plurality of geo located data items to yield those data items that are relevant to the user s work life. With reference again to the user may work in commercial real estate and a colleague of the user may have posted the social network post regarding a potential leasing opportunity at that particular city intersection. While in the work mode the mixed reality filtering program may include the social network post in the filtered collection of data items and may display the post at the street address corresponding to the potential leasing opportunity. It will be appreciated that many other types of data items that are relevant to the user s work life may also be included in this filtered collection of data items .

In another example the mixed reality filtering program may utilize a play mode that filters the plurality of geo located data items to yield those data items that relate to leisure entertainment and or other recreational activities. With reference again to the lounge may host regular swing dance events. An attendee of a swing dance event at the lounge may have posted a photograph of people dancing at the event. While in the play mode the mixed reality filtering program may include the photograph in the filtered collection of data items and may display the photograph next to the lounge . It will be appreciated that many other types of data items that relate to leisure entertainment and or other recreational activities may also be included in this filtered collection of data items .

In another example the mixed reality filtering program may utilize a user interest mode that filters the plurality of geo located data items to yield those data items that relate to one or more interests of the user. With reference again to the user may appreciate and enjoy holographic art. In one example the mixed reality filtering program may discern this interest from the user s use of a holographic object creation program and the user s frequent online commentary regarding holographic art. While in the user interest mode the mixed reality filtering program may include the holographic wizard in the filtered collection of data items and may display the holographic wizard at a location designated by its creator. It will be appreciated that many other types of data items that relate to one or more interests of the user may also be included in this filtered collection of data items.

It will be appreciated that the user may select one or more of the above described modes for use by the mixed reality filtering program as described above. It will also be appreciated that other modes in addition to those describe above may be used by the mixed reality filtering program to selectively filter the plurality of geo located data items.

The mixed reality filtering program may also prioritize the filtered collection of data items based on one or more priority factors . Once prioritized the mixed reality filtering program may provide a predetermined number of the prioritized geo located data items to the mixed reality display program for display via the HMD device .

In one example an item age priority factor may be used to prioritize data items according to the most recent data items. For example where multiple reviews of the lounge are available only the most recent review of the lounge may be displayed via the HMD device . In other examples the predetermined number of prioritized geo located reviews may be 2 3 4 5 or more and such predetermined number of reviews may be displayed.

In another example an item rating priority factor may be used to prioritize data items according to those items receiving the most favorable ratings from commercial reviews social graph recommendations etc. For example the holographic wizard may have received ratings from holographic art critics and friends of the user that average 7.5 stars out of 10 stars. Other holographic art creations near the user may have average ratings less than 7.5 stars. Accordingly where only the highest rated holographic art creation is to be displayed only the holographic wizard may be displayed via the HMD device . In other examples the predetermined number of prioritized geo located holographic art creations may be 2 3 4 5 or more and such number of holographic art creations may be displayed.

In another example user preference data may be used to prioritize data items. For example by examining the user s history of creating holographic fantasy characters and indicating the user s approval liking of other holographic fantasy characters the mixed reality filtering program may determine that the user has a preference for holographic fantasy characters. Accordingly the mixed reality filtering program may prioritize the display of the holographic wizard over a holographic abstract art creation that is also geo located near the user .

In another example item popularity may be used to prioritize data items. For example the popularity of a data item may correspond to the number of different comments reviews indications of approval etc. received by the data item. With respect to the holographic wizard may have received 550 comments reviews and indications of approval. A holographic abstract art creation may have received 50 comments reviews and indications of approval. Accordingly the mixed reality filtering program may prioritize the display of the holographic wizard over a holographic abstract art creation based on the higher popularity of the wizard as compared to the abstract art creation.

In another example item source authority may be used to prioritize data items. With reference to in one example a local government agency may operate an authority server that includes an authoring application that may create and serve geo located data items to the mixed reality filtering program . With reference now to road construction may have closed one lane of the street two blocks from the intersection. An alert icon may be generated and geo located at the intersection to warn drivers and pedestrians of the lane closure down the street. The local government agency may have authority to display geo located data items via the HMD device and the mixed reality filtering program may accord such items priority over other data items. Accordingly the mixed reality filtering program may prioritize the display of the alert icon based on the authority of the local government agency.

In another example commercial precedence may be used to prioritize data items. In one example the lounge may pay 1000 to purchase a holographic advertisement promoting a dance contest at the lounge. The food cart may pay 25 to purchase a holographic advertisement not shown promoting the food cart. As the lounge paid more for its advertisement than the food cart the dance contest advertisement may be displayed via the HMD device while the food cart advertisement may not be displayed.

In another example physical proximity to the user may be used to prioritize data items. In one example the user may specify a priority distance from the user within which geo located data items are prioritized over geo located data items located beyond such distance. For example where the user specifies a priority distance of 10 feet holographic characters from an interactive game being played by a first friend standing 20 feet away and across the street from the user may not be displayed via the HMD device . When the user walks across the street to within 10 feet of the first friend the holographic characters from the interactive game will now be prioritized and displayed.

In another example social proximity to the user may be used to prioritize data items. In one example the user may have a social graph that includes the first friend with whom the user interacts via social networking at least once per day on average. The social graph of the user may also include a second friend with whom the user interacts via social networking once per month on average. Accordingly the mixed reality filtering program may prioritize the geo located data items generated by the first friend over those created by the second friend based on the user s more frequent interactions with the first friend.

The mixed reality filtering program may also be configured to enable and disable one or more authoring applications that are configured to provide one or more geo located data items to the mixed reality display program for display by the HMD device . One or more authoring applications may be resident in the mass storage of the computing device or may be external to the computing device such as the authoring application located on the authority server illustrated in .

In one example and to minimize possible distractions the mixed reality filtering program may disable the authoring application when the user approaches a busy street with many cars driving past the user. In another example the authority server hosting the authoring application may be operated by an airport security office. When the user enters the airport and crosses into a geo fenced boundary defined by the interior of the airport building the mixed reality display program may enable the authoring application to provide geo located data items to the mixed reality display program for display via the HMD device .

The mixed reality filtering program may also be configured to selectively filter geo located data items based on one or more data types to yield the filtered collection of geo located data items . Data types may include but are not limited to social networking posts reviews and recommendations photographs advertisements and artwork. For example the user may desire to see only geo located data items corresponding to social networking posts. Accordingly the user may select the social networking post data type and the mixed reality filtering program may correspondingly filter all geo located data items to yield only social networking posts in the filtered collection of data items provided to the HMD device . It will be appreciated that many other data types of geo located data items may also be used to filter geo located data items and are within the scope of the present disclosure.

In another example the mixed reality filtering program may be further configured to selectively filter geo located data items based on one or more third party lenses that apply third party filtering criteria. For example the user may admire the art and style sensibilities of the user s first friend . The user s first friend may have a First Friend Art Style lens that applies filtering criteria to geo located data items to yield a collection of data items that reflect the first friend s art and style sensibilities.

The user may receive the First Friend Art Style lens from the first friend and this lens may be stored in mass storage of the computing device . The mixed reality filtering program may then employ the First Friend Art Style lens to selectively filter geo located data items to yield a collection of items that reflect the first friend s art and style sensibilities. It will be appreciated that in other examples other third party lenses may be received and or purchased by the user .

In another example the mixed reality filtering program may be further configured to receive the plurality of geo located data items from a geo located content channel when the HMD device is located within a bounded environment serviced by the geo located content channel. For example the user and first friend may be sitting in the lounge . The lounge may broadcast a geo located content channel that is accessible when a display device is located within the four walls of the lounge. Advantageously the user and first friend may both set their HMD devices to receive and display only geo located data items broadcast by the lounge s geo located content channel . Advantageously in this manner the user and first friend can ensure that they are both experiencing a similar mixed reality environment which may enhance their interactions.

In another example the user and first friend may create an ad hoc geo located content channel that enables the user and first friend to share geo located data items in a common mixed reality experience. In this manner the user and first friend may also ensure that they are both experiencing a similar mixed reality environment which may enhance their interactions.

In another example and with reference now to the mixed reality filtering program may be further configured to present the filtered collection of the geo located data items in a starfield that depicts a data item density in the mixed reality environment . The starfield includes a plurality of indicators that each represents a different one of the geo located data items in the filtered collection of data items . Advantageously and as schematically illustrated in the starfield provides a user with a conveniently abstracted representation of the density and location of geo located data items within the current view of the user via the HMD device .

In one example each of the indicators in the starfield may correspond to one of a plurality of data types . The mixed reality filtering program may be further configured to provide each of the plurality of indicators with a data type characteristic that identifies the corresponding data type from the plurality of data types. For example the data type characteristic may comprise a particular shape of the corresponding indicator. With reference now to indicators having a triangular or pyramid shape may correspond to a social networking post data type. Indicators having a hexagon or hexahedron shape may correspond to a review or recommendation data type. Indicators having a circular or spherical shape may correspond to a photograph data type.

For example the starfield may include the recommendation icon left by the second friend next to the food cart . In one example the user may select the recommendation icon via interaction with the HMD device . Upon selection the icon may expand to display the full written recommendation of the second friend associated with the icon.

With reference to at the method includes receiving a plurality of geo located data items. At the geo located data items may be received from a geo located content channel when the HMD device is located within a bounded environment that is serviced by the geo located content channel. At the method includes selectively filtering the plurality of geo located data items based on one or more modes to yield a filtered collection of the geo located data items. The one or more modes may comprise one or more of a social mode a popular mode a recent mode a work mode a play mode and a user interest mode.

At the method includes prioritizing the filtered collection of the geo located data items based on one or more priority factors. At the priority factors may include an item age item ratings user preference item popularity item source authority commercial precedence physical proximity and social proximity. At the method includes limiting the filtered collection of the geo located data items to a predetermined number of the data items based on the priority of the data items.
