This disclosure relates generally to the technical fields of communications and in one exemplary optional embodiment to a methods systems software computer readable non transitory media applications devices and the like for providing location based mobile user selected time location and number limited electronic coupon card selection of automatic location based reserve and redeem discounts on products or services with profile picture tag motion enabled watermark or other visual 2D or other mechanism for security.

Financial credit and processing companies attempt to differentiate themselves by offering discounts to customers at particular merchants for using their credit card or payment systems e.g. by offering a 1 rebate on monthly or yearly purchases over 5000. By employing this method the financial company incentivizes end users to use their credit and or payment services over competitors. This method of promotion also tends to increase the amount of credit held by the end user to the financial benefit of the financial company. However such practices do not necessarily benefit particular merchants. Specifically the merchant is forced to attempt to offer discounts directly to consumers which is logistically difficult and costly to the merchant. In a better scenario the merchant would benefit more by offering discounts only to customers that qualify for a discount based on what that customer is interested in and the location of that customer relative to the merchant. However this process is generally difficult and costly for the merchant.

For example a potential customer for the merchant can optionally travel to or be shopping in a particular city. The potential customer can optionally not know what potential products he or she is looking for. As a result the potential customer can optionally prefer to walk or drive around the streets of the city in order to see if there is a merchant he might be interested in.

While merchants can optionally be offering mobile rebates to consumers directly on their mobile device whereby the consumer would be pushed a virtual coupon to their mobile device and then the consumer would then present this coupon for a rebate to the merchant. This method of promotion has not worked well since using the virtual rebate is difficult for the consumer the clerk and the merchant. The consumer finds it difficult to locate the merchant or communicate the rebate to the clerk in the shop and the merchant Point of Sale POS systems are not equipped to handle such types of rebates in an easy fashion. Thus there is a need to improve the ability of merchants to offer rebates or other incentives to lure customers into their retail stores as well as provide offers to location based customers.

The invention provides in non limiting optional embodiments a location based mobile user selected time location and number limited or unlimited automatic location based reserve and redeem discounts offers on products or services with profile picture tag motion enabled watermark or other visual 2D or security mechanism.

The invention provides in non limiting optional embodiments methods systems software non transitory computer readable non transitory media applications devices and the like for reserving a discount on a product or service at a physical location optionally based on location or geospatial environment.

The invention optionally provides one or two or more coupons discounts sales and or deals hereinafter coupon available to reserve and redeem wherein a user reserves a time limited nearby or location based deal by browsing through the deal cards on the display of an internet device e.g. but not limited to a smart phone and tapping or designating the deal they are interested in reserving that is nearby or at a designated location and has a time limit on purchasing the product or service. The invention optionally includes one or more of the following steps or components i Designating the deal card displays the deal detail view which optionally includes a way to reserve the deal. ii When the user taps the reserve button the system checks that the user hadn t already reserved the deal and that there is still a reservation available. iii If there is a reservation available the system creates a reservation record associated with the user and the deal. iv The reservation record optionally includes created at and or expires at timestamps. v The user interface of the application tells the user how much time they have to redeem their reservation and their distance from the physical location of the deal. vi The user cannot leave the reservation screen to reserve another deal unless they cancel their current reservation which will be released back into the available reservation pool . vii The expires at time can be extended by various actions taken by the users including but not limited to sharing the deal with friends or posting a photo to social media. viii To redeem the reservation the user must be within a certain distance of the deal s physical location geo fence before the reservation expires at time has passed and or optionally with other types of location services or mechanism e.g. mobile device locating systems such as but not limited to global positioning systems GPS global navigation satellite systems GNSS wireless or cell phone tower positioning or locating including or additional to international standard IS IEC 24730 and or on real time locating systems RTLS indoor positioning systems IPS e.g. iBeacon Apple Inc. Bluetooth universally unique identifiers radio frequency identification RFID ultrawide band UWB infrared IR visable light communication VLC ultrasound and or any known suitable system and the like. ix If the application is open and running it will show the user their distance and time remaining. If the application is closed or in the background a geofence will send a local notification to the user when they have arrived at the location if the reservation time hasn t expired. Once the user is within the allocated distance to redeem and the reservation hasn t expired it will automatically check them in and mark the deal as redeemed enabling the user to prove they made it on time even if there isn t staff available to verify the on time arrival. The proof of redemption will include a security identification feature e.g. profile picture tag motion enabled watermark or visual 2D tag or URL code security of the user to prevent fraud. If the user fails to get near enough to the deal location before a preset or adjusted time period expires the reservation will expire and the go back into the available reservation pool.

In addition the method can optionally include automatically attaching a present location data e.g. the present location data can optionally be a textual data a visual data an auditory data a video data and or an audio visual data surrounding a place presently being perceived by user the of the mobile device in the present location profile when the user selects a capture function in the present location profile. The method can optionally further include providing a wiki interface that can optionally enable the user of the mobile device to add profiles and or to modify any information associated with the present sense profile and or the set of adjacent profiles when the present sense profile and the set of adjacent profiles e.g. the present location profile and the set of adjacent profiles can optionally include both residential and business listings can optionally not be claimed by another user.

Other features of the present embodiments will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description that follows 

A method apparatus and system of mobile content creation sharing and commerce in a geo spatial environment are disclosed. The invention provides in non limiting optional embodiments a location based mobile user selected time location and number limited automatic location based reserve and redeem discounts on products or services with profile picture tag motion enabled watermark or other visual 2D or security mechanism The invention provides in non limiting optional embodiments methods systems software non transitory computer readable non transitory media applications devices and the like for reserving a discount on a product or service at a physical location based on location or geospatial environment. In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments. It will be evident however to one skilled in the art that the various embodiments can optionally be practiced without these specific details.

In one optional embodiment a method optionally includes communicating a positioning data of a mobile device to a server at a periodic interval automatically generating in the mobile device in response to the server a present location profile associated with a present geographic location of the mobile device simultaneously generating in the mobile device a set of adjacent profiles provided by the server as being a geographically near to the present geographic location of the mobile device and refreshing in the mobile device the present location profile and or the set of adjacent profiles at the periodic interval or intervals.

In another optional embodiment a system optionally includes a server to simplify a geo spatial network to operate through a mobile communications infrastructure in which profiles of the geo spatial network and a mobile device to generate a view of business coupon cards of the geo spatial network that are a threshold radius away from the mobile device and to automatically capture content to be appended to profiles of the geo spatial network by attaching a location data of the mobile device acquired through a positioning module of the mobile device with a particular wiki profile of the geo spatial network.

The mobile device may be implemented as any number of mobile devices including but not limited to a mobile phone a personal digital assistant PDA a laptop computer a net book an eBook reader a personal media player PMP a portable gaming system an automobile navigation system and so forth. The device is location aware or is able to provide information to another entity e.g. a server to allow the other entity to determine a location of the device . A location on the surface of the earth or a geolocation may be provided to the device by a satellite such as a GPS satellite. Alternatively wireless signals such as from a radio antenna may be used to determine a geolocation of the device relative to a known position of the radio antenna . Other technologies and methods for determining geolocation are also envisioned within the scope of this disclosure such as for example calculating geolocation based on a network access point e.g. Wi Fi hotspot or from a locator signal broadcast from a known location such as at the merchant .

The mobile device and the merchant may connect to a network . The network may include any one or combination of multiple different types of networks such as cable networks local area networks personal area networks wide area networks the Internet wireless networks ad hoc networks mesh networks and or the like. In some implementations the satellite and or the radio antenna may provide network connectivity to the mobile device as well as provide geolocation. For example the radio antenna may provide network access to the mobile device according to the International Mobile Telecommunications 2000 standards 3G network or the International Mobile Telecommunications Advanced standards 4G network . Other implementations may include one source of geolocation data such as the satellite and a separate source of network connectivity such as a Wi Fi hotspot. The merchant may connect to the network through the merchant server using any suitable mechanism such as a wired or wireless connection.

A one or more servers may also be connected to the network and configured to manage interaction between the mobile device and server and or the merchant . In some implementations all or part of the interaction between the mobile device and the merchant may be through a direct communications link without passing through the server or the network . The direct communication link may be implemented by radio transmissions e.g. IEEE 802.11 Bluetooth infrared signals radio frequency identification RFID magnetism e.g. magnetic strips such as used on credit cards display of a code on the device to a human operator or to a scanning device at the merchant and or any other method of directly passing information between the mobile device and the merchant .

The server s may house or otherwise have a connection to multiple data stores including user information merchant profiles an advertisement ad database and or other data stores. Generally the user information contains information about the user associated with the mobile device . The user information enables efficient and personalized interaction between the user and the server and or the merchant . The merchant profiles generally contain information about one or more merchants including the merchant with which the user is interacting. One type of interaction between the merchant and the user is advertising in the form of limited reservable coupons provided about the merchant to the device . Information for generating relevant advertisements in the form of discount coupons may be contained in the advertisement database . Each of the data stores will be discussed in greater detail below.

The server s may also comprise an authentication module that compares login information from the mobile device and or the merchant to confirm that the correct user information merchant profiles advertisement database and other information is correctly correlated with the right entity e.g. user and or point of sale device . The authentication module will be discussed in greater detail below.

The device may also contain user information stored locally in the memory . This information may be configurable by the user and can include payment information a home location and or map of the device s past movements past transaction histories and or any other information related to the user .

The transaction module may recognize when the mobile device is located at a merchant location and in response may facilitate a transaction with the merchant . The transaction may be based in part on the user information . The transaction module may be configured with appropriate application programming interfaces APIs to establish a standard communication protocol for receiving information from the merchant e.g. merchant name and requested payment and providing corresponding information about the user e.g. payment information and user identification . In some implementations the transaction module is a software application that a user may install on his or her device such as by downloading from a website. In other implementations the transaction module may be preinstalled by a manufacturer or retailer of the mobile device and or built into the mobile device as a type of firmware or hardware. The transaction module coordinates the user identification user information geolocation and the like to facilitate transactions between the user and the merchant .

There is a need to provide security in order to prevent unauthorized use of the mobile device. The security module addresses this need by limiting functionality of the mobile device and initiating security events in appropriate circumstances. The security module may process login information such as passwords and or biometric information to authenticate the user and prevent other people from using the mobile device . The security module may also analyze behavior such as purchasing patterns and or movement patterns and infer that irregular behavior may indicate fraudulent or unauthorized activity and limit device functionality accordingly as described below in greater detail.

Mobile device also includes one or more input and output devices . The output devices may comprise one or more display devices including touch screen displays that also function as an input device. An accelerometer detects rotation or vibration of the mobile device . The accelerometer may be a convenient mechanism for the user to communicate an input to the mobile device by slapping shaking twisting and or by making a motion that can be detected by the accelerometer . The mobile device may also include a camera capable of taking still or video pictures. An antenna in the mobile device may send and receive wireless signals from sources such as the radio antenna and satellite . The device may further comprise other input output devices such as a microphone and a speaker used for example in an implementation in which the mobile device functions as a telephone.

In some implementations the mobile device may also include a calendar clock a location sensor and a network interface . The calendar clock may calculate time date and other data that can be derived from time data and date data. In some implementations the calendar clock may communicate with the location sensor to determine for example day length at the current location of the device based on the date. This could enable the device to determine whether it is daytime or nighttime based on the time date and geolocation.

The calendar clock and the location sensor may also communicate to create a log of where the device is located at numerous time points. The log of time place data may be compiled into a map that shows movements of the device overtime and throughout different dates. This map may be stored in the memory for example as a part of the user information . The location sensor includes any sort of system that informs the mobile device of its geolocation including but not limited to the Global Positioning System of satellites circling the Earth. Alternatively the location sensor may determine geolocation by radio signal triangulation e.g. triangulation based on radio antenna signal strength .

The network interface may be configured for wirelessly communicating with the network . The network interface may use any standard protocols for network communication. The network interface may be capable of high speed wireless network communication. In some implementations the network interface may use the antenna to send and receive data from the network . In further implementations a network interface may provide information to the location sensor e.g. a closest network access point from which the location sensor can infer or calculate a location of the mobile device .

The user identifier represents a user that is interacting with the server s via a mobile device . The authentication module determines if communications coming from the mobile device should be associated with the user identifier . In some implementations authorization may involve handshaking or other verification between for example the authentication module of the server s and the security module of the mobile device . The authentication module may similarly authenticate the identity of merchants . Providing robust data security may avoid fraudulent transactions from both mobile devices and merchants .

The server s may also include a transaction module . In some implementations the transaction module on the server s is similar to the transaction module on the mobile device . Transactions between the user and the merchant may be facilitated by either or both of the transaction modules and when a geolocation of the device matches or is within a threshold distance of a geolocation of the merchant. The transaction module may be configured with APIs for exchanging information with both the merchant and the mobile device . In some implementations the APIs exposed to the merchant may be regulated to prevent unauthorized merchants from access in the system and to improve data security. The APIs exposed to the mobile device may be generic or customized to specific device hardware and operating systems. Providing multiple sets of APIs may allow the server s to translate communications between mobile devices and merchants that would otherwise not be able to exchange information.

A map stored on the server s may contain geolocations of merchants . Correlation between a particular merchant and a particular geolocation may be used to infer that a mobile device is located at or near a merchant because the mobile device is located at or near a geolocation associated with that merchant in the map . The map may also contain real time information about the geolocations of each of the mobile devices associated with the respective user identifiers . From this information it may be possible to determine how many mobile devices that belong to the system are present at a given merchant location. It may also be possible to identify other mobile devices in proximity to a given mobile device .

The server s may also facilitate advertising via advertisements sent from or on behalf of the merchant to the mobile device . In some instances the bidding module for discount coupon cards may receive and process coupon cards for the privilege to place advertisements on mobile devices . Users may opt in to receive coupon advertising and be presented with relevant coupon advertisements based on a geolocation of the mobile device and user information .

The user information may provide separate data associated with each of the user identifiers shown in . For example User ID 1 may be associated with payment information a user profile a transaction record and a list of trusted merchants . The payment information may include such things as credit card or debit card numbers bank account information electronic payment system information and or the like. The user profile may contain user preferences lists of interests and hobbies indications of which types of communications and or transactions the user has selected to receive personal information such as preferences for a matchmaking service and any other type of information associated with the user and his or her User ID 1 . The transaction record may contain a list of past transaction history comprising the merchant time geolocation and subject of the transaction.

The list of items of interest to the user may provide a list of goods and or services that the user might wish to purchase. The user s desires may be inferred from past activity by the user in which he or she explicitly or implicitly indicated an interest in some good or service. For example a list of previously viewed goods and or services may track those web pages or good service descriptions that the user has viewed previously in a web browser or another format. More definitive indications of the user s interest may be determined by reviewing the contents of a wish list that the user has generated himself or herself. The user may establish a wish list on multiple online retailers on another location such as a personal website etc. and all of the different wish lists may be merged into the wish list stored as part of the user information . An even stronger indication of what the user is likely to buy may be determined by viewing the contents of an online shopping cart . The shopping cart may represent those goods or services that the user has begun but not finished purchasing from an online retailer . For some online retailers a shopping cart may disappear if the user does not complete the purchase within a fixed period of time but for other online retailers a virtual shopping cart may persist indefinitely. A user could have multiple shopping carts at various online retailers each containing one or more goods or services. The shopping cart included in the user information may represent an aggregation of the individual shopping carts from multiple different online retailers .

Out of all the merchants participating in the system the user may select some subset of those merchants as trusted merchants . In some implementations whenever a user conducts a transaction with a merchant the user may be asked if he or she wishes to add that merchant to the list of trusted merchants. This status as a trusted merchant may be part of the user information . The status as a trusted merchant may enable the merchant to engage in transactions with the user via the user s mobile device . The status as a trusted merchant may also decrease the amount of interaction required from the user to complete electronic transaction using the mobile device as compared with other merchants that are not included on the trusted merchant list. Within the list of trusted merchants different merchants may be given different trust levels by the user . For example transactions with the most trusted merchants may be completed automatically merely by the user and the mobile device entering a location of the merchant . For other merchants with whom the user does not desire such use of zero click transactions the user may indicate a lower level of trust that requires some minimal interaction between the user and the mobile device in order to complete a transaction. This may be thought of as a one click interaction although the specific interaction may be something other than a click. For other merchants that the user associates with an even lower level of trust the user may require more than one click such as entry of a password and login before the mobile device is enabled to complete a transaction with the merchant .

Communication between merchants and mobile devices may also include advertising. The mobile device may have a user interface with a designated window or advertisement box for displaying advertisements sent from merchants optionally wherein the advertisement can be in similar or different forms or appearances or portions thereof and or can be in the same form as the card. The advertisement database stores advertisement content such as a set of coupon cards in association with geolocations and merchant information . Because the advertisements are targeted for mobile devices which may include a location sensor the advertisement content is associated with one or more geolocations in order to provide location relevant advertisements. For example advertisements for a merchant may appear when the user carrying the mobile device approaches the geolocations of one of the merchant s retail stores. For instance when a user approaches a coffee shop that coffee shop may serve an advertisement or a promotion for a discounted cup of coffee when the user is near to or is within the coffee shop which can include a discount optionally selected from 1 to 100 off the actual or retail value or cost.

The advertisement content may appear when the mobile device is a predetermined distance from the merchant. In some implementations the predetermined distance may depend upon a speed at which the mobile device is traveling so that someone traveling in a moving car may receive the advertisement content at a greater distance from the merchant then someone walking. In some implementations the display of advertisements may be deactivated based on the speed at which the mobile device is moving. This feature could prevent distractions to drivers by blocking advertisements or at least placing the mobile device into a silent mode when the speed of the mobile device exceeds a speed threshold. The merchant information may designate the merchant supplying the advertisement content . This may be used in conjunction with the user profile of a user to provide advertisements from merchants from which that user has expressed an interest explicitly or implicitly while refraining from providing advertisements from other merchants. The merchant information may also contain a bid amount indicating a maximum amount that the merchant is willing to bid in order to win and display their advertisement on the user s mobile device. This bid amount may be used by the bidding module to determine which advertisement content is displayed on a given mobile device wherein the savings or discount can optionally be provided by one or more of discounts between 1 and 100 percent of the actual sale or MSRP and the like which optionally can be processed and or redeemed using one or more of an electronic or paper form receipt mobile site interaction or entry and the like for any one or more of a product service goods admission to an event coupon rebate or the like.

Next at operation merchants are identified based on the geolocation of the mobile device and on the advertisement preference of the user. The identified merchants may include only merchants within a specified distance from the mobile device. This can limit the possible source of advertisements to only those merchants that are located proximate to the geolocation of the mobile device. For example if the user is walking down a street lined with restaurants restaurants along that street may be eligible to advertise on the mobile device but restaurants located across town would not. A threshold or radius within which merchants are identified as being proximate to the mobile device may vary based on the type of advertisement. For example restaurant advertisements may only be sent to mobile devices that are within a quarter mile of the restaurant geolocation. However hotel advertisements may be sent to users with mobile devices within five miles of the hotel geolocation. Additionally the advertisements may be sorted by time such that restaurant advertisements may be more common or cover a larger geographic area in the hours before dinner time and hotel advertisements may cover a larger geographic area earlier in the day but progressively narrow the geographic focus as it becomes night.

Once a pool of merchants has been identified based on at least geolocation and advertisement preference coupons are received from those merchants at operation . The coupon offers may be received and processed by the module illustrated in . Each of the coupon offers may include different factors that the merchant is providing.

At operation a time limited reservable coupon card advertisement is selected. The selected advertisement may be determined based on user preferences and or other factors. Next at operation the selected advertisement is presented on the mobile device in the form of coupon cards. The advertisement may be supplied from the advertisement database illustrated in . More specifically the advertisement may be generated based on the advertisement content illustrated in . The advertisement may be presented on the mobile device as a banner in a specialized ad window or the like. In some implementations the advertisement may be integrated with a map so that the user can easily identify the location of the merchant that corresponds to the advertisement. The advertisements may remain on the mobile device for variable periods of time. Some advertisements may expire after a fixed amount of time such as one minute. Advertisements may also expire based on geolocation of the mobile device so that when the mobile device leaves a geolocation near the merchant that merchant s advertisement is replaced by a different advertisement.

At operation a computing device such as the server shown in may receive a request for one or more coupons that are relevant to a geolocation of the mobile device. In some implementations a user of the mobile device may initiate the communication by pressing for example a send me coupons button. In other implementations the communication may be initiated automatically by the mobile device. For example the user may have previously indicated a willingness to receive geo relevant coupons when such coupons become available.

At operation the geolocation of the mobile device is determined. The geolocation may be determined by the location sensor of using for example GPS technology.

At operation a user profile such as the user profile shown in may be accessed by for example the server . The user profile may contain information about the user such as a wish list of goods or services for which the user has previously expressed interest. The wish list may be a list of things that the user wishes to purchase for himself or herself or the wish list could be a shopping list or a lists of gifts to buy for other people. The user profile may also contain a transaction record such as the transaction record shown in . The transaction record may identify goods or services that the user previously purchased.

In some implementations the user profile may also include a home location for the user. This may be a geolocation of the user s home workplace or another location specified by the user.

At operation offers for the privilege of sending a coupon to the mobile device may be received from merchants. The coupon may function as a form of advertising and merchants that wish to send coupons to the mobile device may be charged for sending coupons. In some implementations the merchant with the highest bid may be allowed to send coupons to the mobile device. Rather than bidding the merchants may also submit coupons to a coupon repository such as the advertisement database shown in . Coupons may be selected from the coupon repository and sent users that may be interested in the coupons.

At operation geo relevant coupon cards are selected to be sent to the mobile device. The geo relevant coupons may be selected from the coupon repository. The selection may be based on the geolocation of the mobile device. The selected coupon is geo relevant because it is redeemable at a merchant location that is relatively nearby the current location of the mobile device. As discussed above the concept of near may be determined by presence of the mobile device within a predetermined proximity of a merchant location. The selection may also be based on the home location of the user. For example the user may receive coupons on his or her mobile device for merchants within a predetermined proximity of the home location even when the mobile device is not located at that home location.

In some implementations other factors may also be used to select the coupon. For example a coupon may have a limited time span during which it is valid. A coupon for a restaurant may only be valid from Sunday to Thursday. A coupon for a coffee shop may only be valid after 11 00 AM. Thus the user may need to be at the right place i.e. geolocation and be there at the right time in order to use a coupon. Thus sending a coupon to the user that cannot be used in the near future either because of geographic or temporal limitations may be frustrating and of limited use to the user. Therefore the operation may also select the geo relevant coupon based on a time period for which the geo relevant coupon is valid.

A merchant may also determine the validity period for a coupon based on known or forecast excess capacity of the merchant. For example a merchant that provides services on a reservation basis e.g. a beauty shop a spa a restaurant etc. may know that there are few reservations relative to capacity for some upcoming time period. Rather than have beauticians masseuses or chefs sit idle the merchant may choose to create coupons or other discount to increase customers. The coupons may be sent out on a just in time basis such as the merchant realizes that current or projected customers are fewer than desired.

Additionally the user profile may be used to select a geo relevant coupon to send to the mobile device. If the user profile includes a wish list a coupon for a good or service included on the wish list may be selected. Similarly if the user profile includes a transaction record the coupon sent to the mobile device may be based on the transaction record. For example inferences may be made about what the user is likely to buy in the future based on past purchases recorded in the transaction record. Therefore coupons for goods or services that are likely of interest to the user may be selected based on the transaction record or optionally using one or more of other mechanisms processes locations notifications and the like e.g. but not limited to push or other notifications in real time or scheduled or set including optional free or discounted products or services that can include a company logo URL and or QR code for the coupon or advertisement provider or the product or service provider retailer manufacturer and or distributor. As a non limiting example if the user walks past a shoe store they might then receive a coupon advertisement or notification that they can get a discounted or free pair of socks.

Selecting the coupon to send to the mobile device may also be based on bids received from the merchants at operation . For example if the mobile device is near to competing merchants those merchants may wish to send their coupon to the mobile device and prevent the competitor from sending a coupon. Thus the bids may be an additional factor used in selecting the coupon to send to the mobile device. In some implementations the winning merchant may not pay the bid amount unless the user actually redeems the coupon. Any combination of the above factors e.g. geolocation time period user profile and or bids may be used to select the coupon to send to the mobile device.

At operation the selected geo relevant coupon is sent to the mobile device. The coupon may be sent wirelessly as a signal from for example the radio antenna shown in .

At operation login credentials of the user are received. The login credentials may be entered from the mobile device or from another computing device such as a desktop computer. In some implementations the login credentials may also indicate membership in a group that has special privileges or otherwise could receive coupons different from those provided to users who are not members of the group. For example a coupon redeemable at a store where membership is required e.g. Costco Bi Mart etc. may only be sent to users that are members. The login credentials of the user may also be associated with the transaction record of the user.

At operation a plurality of coupons available on a network accessible database such as for example the advertisement database shown in may be presented to the user. The network accessible database may be accessible through the Internet and presented in a user interface as a webpage. In other implementations the network accessible database may be implemented like an app store or in this case a coupon store that is available from a limited network such as a network operated by a mobile phone service provider. The network accessible database may also be accessed automatically by systems of the mobile device or of the server s and the user may not access the database but rather receive a coupon or recommended from the database. In some implementations the plurality of coupons recommended to the user may be a personalized sub set of all available coupons. The personalization may be achieved by filtering a larger set of coupons based on user information such as the user information shown in which can optionally further include wherein the user can stop delete remove and the like by interaction with the mobile device e.g. swiping up on the display of the coupon on the touch screen and designate whether or not they would like to save or display the coupon in the future optionally further comprising wherein the server provides functionality to record and analysis a users input relating to the coupons that is used to help select and or target future coupons or advertisements to the user.

At operation a selection by the user of a coupon redeemable at a merchant from the plurality of coupons is received. The user may also select more than one coupon at a time.

At operation an inactive version of the coupon may be sent to the mobile device. The inactive version may be a placeholder or abbreviated representation of the coupon. This may be characterized by having a small file size but also uniquely identifying the coupon itself. The inactive version may also be implemented by providing a complete coupon with all the information necessary for the coupon to be redeemed but blocking or otherwise inactivating the coupon until a code token key or similar data to activate the coupon is provided.

At operation coupons for which inactive versions are present on the mobile device may be identified. This may be thought of as creating a list of those coupons that the user has already downloaded to his or her device and are ready to be used once activated.

At operation one of the inactive coupons identified at operation may be recommended to the user. The recommendation may be based on any number of factors such as the geolocation of the mobile device the transaction record of the user and the like. The user may forget which coupons he or she has available on his or her mobile device or the user may not realize that a merchant for which he or she has already downloaded a coupon is nearby. Recommending a coupon to the user may help the user fully utilize his or her coupons.

At operation the login credentials are received from the mobile device while the mobile device is located within a predetermined proximity of the merchant. For example after arriving as a merchant or at the parking lot in front of the merchant the user may manually enter his or her login credentials in order to access a coupon inform the merchant that he or she has arrived or for another reason. In some implementations the user may set the mobile device to automatically send a message when the mobile device enters the predetermined proximity of the merchant. By providing the user login credentials automatically friction involved with redeeming a coupon may be reduced optionally provided by links or interaction with social media sites or services e.g. Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn and the like.

At operation a current time is determined. The current time may be determined by the calendar clock shown in . In some implementations the current time may be the time when the login credentials are received in operation .

At decision point a time of receiving the login credentials of the mobile device may be compared with a predetermined time. When the time of receiving the login credentials matches the predetermined time process follows the yes path and proceeds to operation . When the time of receiving the login credentials does not match the predetermined time process follows that no path and returns to operation to re determine the current time. In implementation in which providing the login credentials serves to determine the time the user may need to re enter or re transmit login credentials to reset the current time.

At operation data that activates the coupon is transmitted to the mobile device. The data may be a code a token a key or the like. Once activated the user may elect to use a coupon by presented to the merchant either as a visual image shown on a display of the mobile device e.g. a barcode or another code that an employee enters into a point of sale terminal or in some implementations the coupon can be optionally implemented manually as partially or fully automated or automatically applied when the user makes a visit to the retail store or purchase using the mobile device or in the store.

The present location profile and or the set of adjacent profiles can optionally be refreshed in the mobile device at the periodic interval. The wiki interface that enables the user of the mobile device to add profiles and or to modify any information associated with the present sense profile and or the set of adjacent profiles can optionally be provided when the present sense profile and or the set of adjacent profiles are not claimed by another user. Also certain profiles can optionally be locked e.g. when they have been claimed by a claiming user at the discretion of the claiming user .

Coupons provided by the businesses in the vicinity of the present geographic location of the mobile device can optionally be generated in the mobile device. Temporary messages can optionally be created through the mobile device that can optionally be coordinated based on the positioning information of the mobile device to the geo spatial network location and which resides in the geo spatial network only for the threshold amount of time prior to being purged from the geo spatial network. The markers e.g. visible around profiles of adjacent businesses and or residences can optionally be generated in the geo spatial network to represent the temporary messages.

In the exemplary optional embodiments the user interface view can optionally enable the user to navigate in the different directions and to position the present location and or the set of adjacent locations surrounding the mobile device of the user. Furthermore the triangulation algorithm e.g. the global positioning algorithm and or the radio algorithm can optionally be applied to generate the compass view in the mobile device that represents adjacent profile as being in front of behind to the left of and to the right of the mobile device.

In addition it will be appreciated that the various operations processes and methods disclosed herein can optionally be embodied in a computer system readable non transitory medium and or a computer system accessible non transitory medium compatible with a data processing system e.g. a computer system and can optionally be performed in any order. Accordingly the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.

In a non limiting optional example the invention optionally provides one or two or more coupons discounts sales and or deals hereinafter deal available to reserve and redeem wherein a user reserves a nearby or location based deal by browsing through the deal cards on the display of an internet device e.g. but not limited to a smart phone and tapping or designating the deal they are interested in reserving. Tapping the deal card displays the deal detail view which optionally includes a Reserve button. When the user taps the reserve button the system checks that the user hadn t already reserved the deal and that there is still a reservation available. If there is a reservation available the system creates a reservation record associated with the user and the deal. The reservation record optionally includes created at and or expires at timestamps. The user interface of the application tells the user how much time they have to redeem their reservation and their distance from the physical location of the deal. The user cannot leave the reservation screen to reserve another deal unless they cancel their current reservation which will be released back into the available reservation pool . The expires at time can be extended by various actions taken by the users including but not limited to sharing the deal with friends or posting a photo to social non transitory media. To redeem the reservation the user must be within a certain distance of the deal s physical location geo fence before the reservation expires at time has passed. If the application is open and running it will show the user their distance and time remaining. If the application is closed or in the background a geofence will send a local notification to the user when they have arrived at the location if the reservation time hasn t expired. Once the user is within the allocated distance to redeem and the reservation hasn t expired it will automatically check them in and mark the deal as redeemed enabling the user to prove they made it on time even if there isn t staff available to verify the on time arrival. The proof of redemption will include a profile picture tag motion enabled watermark or other visual 2D or security mechanism of the user to prevent fraud. If the user fails the get near enough to the deal location before the expires at time the reservation will expire and the go back into the available reservation pool.
