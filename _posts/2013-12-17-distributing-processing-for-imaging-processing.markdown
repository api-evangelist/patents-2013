abstract: Approaches are described for managing the processing of images or video on a computing device. A portable computing device can include one or more dedicated components, such as an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or other dedicated processor component, to be integrated into the computing device to perform at least a portion of the imaging processing of captured images or video.

As computing devices offer increasing processing capacity and functionality users are able to operate these devices in an expanding variety of ways. For example computing devices are increasingly offering multiple high quality cameras that enable additional types of functionality. In some devices these cameras are capable of capturing high resolution images and or videos and can also be used to provide three dimensional 3D image capture for both still and video imaging. As such these cameras can provide a large amount of imaging data and therefore present significant opportunities for performing image analysis and other computations. However a downside to providing cameras that can capture high resolution images and or are capable of 3D image capture is the fact that processing such images can be expensive in terms of computation resources and power consumption. This has been due in part on the large number of features and components that have been integrated into the device. Accordingly manufacturers have been looking to improve the battery life and increase the processing performance of these devices.

Systems and methods in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure may overcome one or more of the foregoing or other deficiencies experienced in conventional approaches for managing the processing of images or video via an electronic device. In particular various embodiments provide approaches for enabling one or more dedicated components such as an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other dedicated processor component to be integrated into a computing device e.g. a mobile phone tablet computer wearable computer etc. to perform at least a portion of the imaging processing of captured images or video.

For example the dedicated processor component can enable the offloading of basic image signal processing as well as higher level or machine vision processing from a general purpose processor or other device processor of the computing device. In this way the dedicated processor component can perform image processing for which the input is an image video or audio and where image video or audio data can be analyzed interpreted and or manipulated to generate an output the output being either an image or a set of characteristics or parameters related to the image video or audio. The output can be provided to the general purpose processor or device processor for further processing. The offloading of such tasks can advantageously improve battery life and performance by utilizing lower power consumption than would otherwise be consumed if only the device processor were to be utilized. In accordance with various embodiments the device processor can be any system on a chip SoC designed to support applications running in a computing environment such as on a mobile phone tablet computer or wearable computer e.g. smart classes smart watch etc. . In one embodiment the device processor can be the processor that executes the operating system OS and the applications on a computing device.

In certain embodiments the dedicated processor component can be connected to or included in a camera. In this situation the dedicated processor component can be configured to perform specific tasks for a specific camera. For example a first dedicated processor component connected to or included in a first camera can be configured to perform a first task and a second dedicated processor component connected to or included in a second camera can be configured to perform a second task. For example for the first camera the first dedicated processor can perform head tracking and for the second camera the second dedicated processor component can perform object recognition. In any situation the dedicated processor component can perform at least a portion of the image computational processing before providing the processed image information to the device processor where image computational processing can include image capture processing and manipulation techniques that enhance or otherwise extend the capabilities of image or video data such techniques and approaches further described herein.

In various other embodiments for example the dedicated processor component can be shared between any number of cameras. In the situation where the dedicated processor component is shared between two or more cameras the dedicated processor component can be configured to selectively or alternatively receive image data from one of the cameras at a time process e.g. correct for lens correction depth pixel correction format conversation object identification etc. captured image data based on the selected imaging element and provide the processed image data to a general purpose processor or device processor for further processing such as to perform advanced object tracking features enhance or otherwise modify the image . The multiple cameras can be independently controlled cameras that have different frame rates and or different resolutions. Some of these cameras may be high resolution cameras some may be medium resolution and yet other cameras may be low resolution cameras. For example the standard rear facing digital camera used by a user to obtain a photograph may be a high resolution camera while other cameras e.g. front facing cameras used for gesture detection may be of lower resolution.

The dedicated processor component can be connected to some or all of these cameras by way of a combiner that receives the image data from the cameras over buses capable of carrying image data e.g. MIPI SPI IC . The dedicated processor component can process all of the information coming from the multiple cameras such that the device processor does not need to be woken up or invoked unless a specified event of interest occurs e.g. a gesture is detected by the dedicated processor component a face is recognized etc. . In some embodiments two or more of the cameras may be configured as stereo pairs and provide the image data to the dedicated processor component for stereo processing. The dedicated processor component can enable rectification of the images and generate disparity maps for stereo processing and the like.

As used throughout this disclosure the terms machine vision information and high level information or control information are often used interchangeably and are intended to cover any information or data that can be extracted derived or computed based at least in part on the raw image data received from the one or more cameras to the dedicated processor component. By way of some illustrative examples the machine vision information might include user hand gesture information facial or object recognition information head tracking information or other information which was computed based at least in part on one or more images and which can be used to control a user interface of the device. As another example the machine vision information may include information e.g. disparity map obtained from stereo processing two or more images obtained from cameras that may be configured to function as stereo pairs.

Various other functions and advantages are described and suggested below as may be provided in accordance with the various embodiments.

The device can utilize some of the same elements as a conventional device such as may include a display screen. The device can also include high and or low resolution cameras that can include auto focusing elements for use in still image capture or two dimensional video capture. The device can include other elements useful for imaging as well such as a light sensor for determining an amount of ambient light and a white light LED or other such illumination element useful in illuminating objects within at least a portion of a field of view of the camera. Each imaging element may be for example a camera including a complimentary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS device a motion detection sensor a charge coupled device CCD an infrared sensor a quantum dot imager a gallium arsenide sensor or any other appropriate image capturing technology.

In accordance with an embodiment the four corner cameras can be low resolution cameras designed specifically for user interface controls e.g. detecting gestures without touching the mobile device etc. . These cameras can be operating autonomously such that the device processor need only be woken up in the event of a particular event being detected. For example the device processor may be awakened upon detecting that the user made a predetermined gesture that would cause the device processor to unlock the computing device answer an incoming telephone call or the like. Further the cameras can acquire be used to acquire images and the image information for each image can be used by the device to determine a relative position and or orientation of the user with respect to the device. Such image information can also be used for object recognition object tracking or various other purposes.

However as mentioned above in conventional hardware implementations image computational processing would need to be performed by providing all of the image data from a camera to the device processor over high speed and high power consuming image buses and processing the image data at the device processor. For example image computational processing such as machine vision algorithms are computationally intensive and are typically run on the device processor. These algorithms usually contain multiple steps such as identifying an object of interest e.g. a hand face head or some other object and analyzing the object to identify features useful in recognizing the object. In conventional hardware implementations the device processor computes the machine vision algorithms. However individually or the combination of the components contributes to the overall power consumption. Performing the machine vision algorithms on device processor as opposed to a dedicated processor or set of components optimized for a particular algorithm is expensive in terms of power consumption and computing resources.

Accordingly in accordance with various embodiments rather than utilizing these power costly processes a dedicated processor component can instead perform the majority of the image computational processing locally and only provide the extracted higher level information e.g. machine vision information to the device processor for further processing. For example such image computational processing can include analyzing an image acquired by at least one camera to determine an area of interest. The area of interest can be for example a specific portion or object of the image such as a face head hand foot etc. The dedicated processor component can define a portion e.g. a window of the image that includes the area of interest. The window can range in size such as 50 50 pixels 100 100 pixels or any size that includes at least a portion of the area of interest. The dedicated processor component can provide the area of interest to the device processor for further processing e.g. feature extraction . In this way the time and power required to transmit the entire image to the device processor and process the entire image can be saved.

In yet another example image computational processing can include informing the device processor whenever it detects that a gesture has been made or whenever a facial recognition has been detected. In some embodiments the dedicated processor component can interrupt or wake up the device processor that is in a standby mode e.g. sleep mode upon detecting that a specific type of machine vision information has been detected. This can significantly reduce the battery power consumption as the device processor can remain in standby mode and does not need to continuously obtain all of the image data captured by the cameras and process it. At the same time if the device processor determines that further processing of the image data needs to be performed based on the received machine vision information it can initiate the transfer of the image data from the dedicated processor component to the device processor. For example the device processor can continuously inspect the high level information being received from the dedicated processor component determine that the image data may be of interest for additional processing based on the received information and instruct the dedicated processor component to transfer image data to the device processor as needed. In this manner the device processor can determine when image data should be transferred to implement computationally intensive algorithms or processes which can result in a substantial power savings.

In various embodiments the dedicated processor component can include an image signal processor ISP that performs image computational processing such as low level image signal correction and a digital signal processor DSP that performs image computational processing such as high level machine vision processing. Image computational processing such as image signal correction performed by the ISP can include actions such as dead pixel correction lens correction geometric correction data compression generating a histogram of the pixel information automatic exposure control automatic gain control automatic white balance de mosaicing smoothing edge enhancement blob identification image thresholding and various other processing. For example dead pixel correction can refer to any process executed by a processor to correct defective stuck dead or otherwise malfunctioning pixels on a liquid crystal display LCD . Lens correction can include any process to correct flaws caused by camera lens distortion such as barrel or pincushion distortion chromatic aberration and the like. Geometric correction can refer to any process for manipulating image data to make the image s projection match a specific projection surface or shape. A histogram of an image can be any representation of pixel intensity values of the image. Demosaicing can refer to any process that can be used to reconstruct an image from incomplete samples. Blob identification can refer to any process that can be used to identify distinct shapes in an image without actually determining what those shapes are. Image thresholding can be any process used to mark individual pixels in an image as object pixels if their value is greater than a threshold value e.g. assuming an object to be brighter than the background and as background pixels otherwise.

Image computational processing such as higher level machine vision processing performed by the DSP can include gesture tracking head face tracking object tracking face object recognition multiple image stereo processing e.g. image rectification generating stereo disparity maps three dimensional image capture metadata tagging of the image data e.g. geo tagging time stamping symbol reading e.g. barcodes 2D ID codes optical character recognition OCR one or more image fusion algorithms sensor fusion algorithms and the like. Other tasks can include basic level image processing including additions and subtractions of image data that can be used for object detection windowing of a detected object image segmentation exposure duration determination ambient light determination etc. As used herein machine vision processing can include any process that can be used to analyze an image and extract deduce or learn information about that image. For example the dedicated processor component can process image data to determine when a user has made a particular hand gesture e.g. gesture tracking detect when a specific face is recognized e.g. face recognition identify that a barcode has been read and provide the value of the barcode e.g. symbol reading or determine other information that can be provided to the device processor and be used to control the user interface of the device.

In accordance with an embodiment each dedicated processor component can include local memory for storing some or all of the image data received from a respective camera. This can enable the dedicated processor component to locally process the one or more images without reading writing the data from the main memory of the device. In some embodiments the dedicated processor component can also have an interface to the device memory of the device to which it can write read the data if that is deemed necessary. In accordance with various embodiments the local memory can be accessed by the DSP to read and or write the images or the machine vision information. In addition the computing device may comprise its own memory which is accessible by the device processor and or the dedicated processors. As described herein the term memory can encompass any physical device capable of storing data such as flash memory solid state drive SSD random access memory RAM disk based memory and the like.

In accordance with various embodiments an application programming interface API can be used to control aspects of the dedicated processor component and or other components of the device. For example the APIs can be used to control a camera in communication with the dedicated processor component such as to control a camera speed window size of a detected object image resolution among others. The APIs can also be used to specify an object to detect e.g. hand face foot landscape animal etc. and a portion of the image including the detected object can be provided to the device processor for further processing. The dedicated processor component can interface with various other components as well such as ambient light sensor motion detection sensor e.g. a gyroscope an accelerometer etc. or any sensor that can increase the processing of an image captured by the camera.

As shown in each camera can have a direct or dedicated connection to a dedicated processor component. For example camera can be connected to dedicated processor component and camera can be connected to dedicated processor component . Dedicated processor components and can be connected to the device processor . The device processor can be utilized for various timing control image processing functions image computational processing functions and in at least some embodiments can perform additional processing on image or video data captured by the imaging elements where the additional processing and or at least some of these actions can be beyond the capability of the dedicated processor component. For example the in various embodiments the general purpose processor or device processor can be configured to perform at least one of gesture detection object tracking object recognition stereo processing of two or more images three dimensional 3D image capture image metadata tagging time stamping geographical tagging symbol reading depth mapping image rectification edge detection image scaling object character recognition audio recognition or video recognition.

Dedicated processor components and can include respective image signal processors and MP DSPs and to perform various image computational processing approaches and local memory components and . In accordance with various embodiments the dedicated processor components can implement image computational processing functions or other functions and the local memory or other storage element can be used to store the functions and or other data such as at least a frame s e.g. image worth of data. For example in accordance with an embodiment each dedicated processor component can analyze the image data coming in from a respective camera video data and or audio data. In the situation of image data the data can be analyzed and the dedicated processor component can send small packets of information to the device processor containing high level information e.g. machine level information . In various embodiments at least some system level control and image computational processing functions can be implemented by the dedicated processor components. Such functions enable a sensor and related components to function as a camera without accessing external control circuitry principally sourcing of clocks to serially read out the data including options for decimation skipping pixels or groups of pixels during readout binning summing adjacent groups of pixels windowing limiting serial readout to a rectangular region of interest combinations of decimation and windowing aperture correction correction of the lens vignetting and lens correction correction of the lens geometric distortion at least the radially symmetric portion . Other examples of image computational processing functions include blob or region detection for segmenting fingers for hand gestures and face detection and tracking for head gestures. In certain situations the dedicated processor component is operable to run one or more image computational processes in parallel wherein the one or more image computational processes include one of gesture detection object detection object recognition or image enhancement or any of the other image computational processes described herein. Performing these functions and others on the dedicated processor component enables the device processor to remain in standby mode or perform other functions thereby alleviating the amount of power used by the device processor.

As illustrated the dedicated processor component includes both an ISP for performing correction and other low level image processing and a MP DSP for performing higher level computations and data analysis on the image data. The ISP can perform bad pixel correction relative illumination correction and de mosaicing on the images received from the cameras. The microprocessor MP or digital signal processor DSP can be configured to perform machine vision processing of the image data. In a first example the MP or DSP can analyze an image acquired by at least one camera to determine an area of interest. The area of interest can be for example a specific portion or object of the image such as a head of a user of the computing device a facial feature of the user a hand of the user a foot of the user an object audio information or other information such as character information or video information among others. The MP or DSP can define a portion e.g. a window of the image that includes the area of interest. The window can range in size such as 50 50 pixels 100 100 pixels or any size that includes at least a portion of the area of interest. The MP or DSP can provide the area of interest to the device processor for further processing e.g. feature extraction . This can include providing the window of the image that is the pixels values including in the window to the device processor. In various other embodiments the entire image may be provided to the device processor as well as coordinates or other information indicating the area of interest.

In a second example the dedicated processor component can be used to process gesture and face tracking information. In the illustrated embodiment the device can be placed on a surface with the display screen facing up. In this example the device can include a number of front facing corner cameras as previously described in . When a user makes a gesture in the view of the four cameras one or more of the cameras can capture the information and provide it to a respective dedicated processor component for processing. For example a first camera may continue capturing images and the dedicated processor component of that camera can process those images to extract the gesture information or the like. When the dedicated process detects that a predetermined gesture has been made it can awaken the device processor by sending the high level information to the device processor. The device processor can in turn inspect the received information and then decide whether to retrieve the image data from the dedicated processor component for further processing. Similarly when a user s face moves into the view of one or more of the cameras e.g. front facing camera the dedicated processor component may process the image to perform facial recognition. For example if the dedicated processor component determines that the face of the user corresponds to the owner it may invoke the device processor to perform some processing e.g. unlock the phone etc. .

The cameras and can be any type of camera that can be integrated into a computing device. For example the cameras connected to a respective dedicated processor component may be high resolution medium resolution or low resolution cameras. Some or all of the cameras may have special modes e.g. global shuttering rolling shuttering . Some of the cameras may be monochrome while others may be full color. Some of the cameras may be configured as stereo pairs while others may function independently of each other. Some cameras may have different frame rates from other cameras. In accordance with an embodiment each camera feeds into a respective dedicated processor component. It should be noted that although the illustration shows two cameras connected to the dedicated processor components the number of cameras should not be perceived as a limitation to all the various embodiments contemplated herein and that in alternative embodiments the number of cameras and or dedicated processor components can include any number.

In accordance with an embodiment the cameras can be connected to a respective dedicated processor component by way of any link that is appropriate for sending image data. For example the higher definition cameras can be connected using a Mobile Industry Processor Interface MIPI bus while the lower resolution cameras may be connected by way of serial peripheral interface SPI or an Inter Integrated Circuit IC bus. The interface between the dedicated processor components and the device processor can also be any link such as a lower power and low speed interface such as an IC bus.

In accordance with various embodiments the dedicated processor components can access various device sensors such as a camera controller and or any other element sensor or controller. These and various other components can be controlled or otherwise managed using the dedicated processor component and or device processor using an application programming interface API or other interface device or system component or service. In various embodiments various APIs can be used to control aspects of the dedicated processor component as well as the various other device sensors components and or controllers of the device. These device sensors controllers and or other components can include an ambient light sensor motion detection sensor e.g. a gyroscope an accelerometer etc. an illumination controller that can be used to control and or adjust an amount of illumination used to capture image or video data or any sensor that can be controlled or accessed by the device processor and or dedicated processor. Further the APIs can be used to control a camera in communication with the dedicated processor component such as to control a camera speed window size of a detected object image resolution among others. Further still the APIs can be used to specify an object to detect e.g. hand face foot landscape animal etc. and a portion of the image including the detected object can be provided to the device processor for further processing. In various embodiments the device sensor and other components can be controlled by the dedicated processor component and or the device processor. It should be noted that although device sensors are shown separate from the general purpose processor or device processor and dedicated processor component in various embodiments certain device sensors or at least a portion of their functionality can be included in the dedicated processor component device processor and or distributed between the dedicated processor component and device processor.

In accordance with various embodiments the camera controller can be used to enable disable an image or video capture mode where the camera controller can send a signal or other such communication to the dedicated processor component that one of the imaging elements is in operation. The camera controller can perform other functions such as control the operation of a lens system such as to control photographic lens functions such as zoom focus etc. It should be understood however that other elements or controllers such as the illumination controller and the camera controller can alternatively or additionally be part of the dedicated circuitry or part of the device processor and that other controllers can be used in conjunction with or used instead of the illumination and camera controller.

In accordance with various embodiments camera may be a rear facing high resolution camera integrated into the device camera may be a front facing medium resolution camera designed for optimizing face to face video communication over a network and camera may be low resolution front facing camera designed for sensing gestures and other user interface controls. In various embodiments all of these cameras may be independently controlled have different frame rates etc.

The dedicated processor component includes a processing component and local memory . As described the processing component can include an ISP and MP DSP as described in regard to . The dedicated processor component can communicate with the device processor such as by transmitting image data to the device processor. In some embodiments the dedicated processor component can provide image data from certain cameras e.g. rear facing high resolution camera directly to the device processor so that it can be manipulated stored in the main device memory or otherwise processed by the device processor. In other embodiments the device processor may initiate the transfer of image data over from the dedicated processor component over a high speed bus if it determines that further processing is needed as previously described. For example the device processor may periodically receive high level machine vision information from the dedicated processor component and analyze the information according to various instructions e.g. application operating system etc. . If the device processor determines that it needs the original image data to perform further computations on the data the device processor can cause to be transferred the bulk of the image data from the dedicated processor component to the device processor. In this manner the dedicated processor component can analyze the images from a number of cameras and interpret the meanings of those images all without turning on the device processor which may be expensive in terms of power consumption.

In some embodiments the dedicated processor component can read write data directly to the device memory bypassing the device processor. This allows the dedicated processor component to write the image data and or the high level machine vision information directly to memory bypassing the need to provide the data to the device processor. This can provide improvements for certain applications and can further offload some processing from the device processor. For example a camera e.g. a rear facing camera can be enabled and the dedicated processor component can receive image data from the rear facing camera. This can occur for example when a user starts an image capture program on a computing device where starting the program can enable the rear facing camera. The user can switch or otherwise optionally enable the front facing camera by e.g. selecting an option on the device that switches between the rear facing camera and the front facing camera and the dedicated processor component can then receive image data from the front facing camera. Additionally or alternatively the user can start a video chat program or other such program that can enable use of the front facing camera. In any situation captured image data from the front rear or another camera can be received and processed by the dedicated processor component.

In accordance with various embodiments a camera can be used to capture image or video data and the dedicated processor component can access a configuration file to determine how to process captured image or video data for the camera. For example the configuration file can include image signal processing algorithms and or settings operable with one or more imaging elements where in some instances the signal processing algorithms are particular to a camera and in other instances the signal processing algorithms can be used with any camera. Thus based at least in part on the selected camera the circuitry can use the configuration file to perform one or more image signal processing algorithms such as to process a digital image data or to compress video data and or set one or more settings such as a frame rate or exposure time or some other functionality associated with an imaging element.

In accordance with an embodiment in the situation where multiple cameras are operating at the same time the combiner multiplexer mux or other such component can be used to select and or switch between the cameras such that the cameras have access to the dedicated processor component. For example the combiner can be used to select camera where image or video data captured by the camera is forwarded or otherwise communicated to the dedicated processor component. In this way the data captured by the cameras is processed concurrently using the dedicated processor component. In other embodiments the combiner can route image data captured by one of the cameras to the dedicated processor component and can route image data captured by the other imaging element to the device processor or other processor separate from the dedicated processor component. In this way the image data being captured by the cameras can be processed concurrently i.e. some data by the dedicated processor component and other data by the device processor . In various other embodiments the combiner can route data captured by any one of or both of the imaging elements directly to a device processor and thus can bypass the dedicated processor component.

As described other arrangements are also possible where a combiner is not used to route the captured data. In this case any of or all of the cameras can directly communicate captured data to a dedicated processor component to a device processor between the dedicated processor component and device processor or in the situation where each camera has dedicated processor component each camera can communicate captured data directly to their respective dedicated processor component.

It should be noted that although the dedicated processor components of and are illustrated as independent components in alternative embodiments these components can be integrated into other elements and structures. For example the dedicated processor components can be integrated into a camera another processor and the like. For example illustrates an example alternate implementation of a computing device that includes a dedicated processor component integrated into a camera in accordance with various embodiments. As shown in a first camera includes dedicated processor component or other control processor that can implement image computational processing functions or other functions. The dedicated processor component includes a processing component and local memory to store the functions and or other data similar to those described in regard to . Camera further includes at least one imaging element configured to capture an image and or an image. A second camera includes dedicated processor component . The dedicated processor component includes a processing component and local memory . Camera further includes at least one imaging element .

As described at least some system level control and image computational processing functions can be implemented by the dedicated processor component. Such functions enable a sensor and related components to function as a camera without accessing external control circuitry principally sourcing of clocks to serially read out the data including options for decimation skipping pixels or groups of pixels during readout binning summing adjacent groups of pixels windowing limiting serial readout to a rectangular region of interest combinations of decimation and windowing aperture correction correction of the lens vignetting and lens correction correction of the lens geometric distortion at least the radially symmetric portion . Other examples of on chip image processing functions include blob or region detection for segmenting fingers for hand gestures and face detection and tracking for head gestures. Various other types of functionality can be provided on the cameras as well in other embodiments.

Each camera can access a device processor or other such element and or any other element or controller such as an illumination controller that can be used to control and or adjust an amount of illumination used to capture image or video data. It should be understood however that other elements or controllers such as the illumination controller and the camera controller can alternatively or additionally be part of the dedicated processor component or part of the device processor and that other controllers can be used in conjunction with or used instead of the illumination and camera controller. In accordance with an embodiment the device processor can be utilized for various timing control and image computational processing functions and in at least some embodiments can perform additional processing on image or video data captured by the imaging elements where the additional processing and or at least some of these actions can be beyond the capability of the dedicated processor component processing of the imaging elements.

For example the device processor can perform image enhancement image restoration image compression or other image processing. In accordance with an embodiment image enhancement can include accentuation or sharpening of image features such as boundaries or contrast to make a graphic display more useful for display and analysis image enhancement can include gray level and contrast manipulation noise reduction edge crispening and sharpening. filtering interpolation and magnification pseudo coloring and so on and image restoration can include filtering the observed image to minimize the effect of degradations and image compression can include minimizing the number of bits required to represent an image.

For example the dedicated processor component can be configured to analyze the image to determine an area of interest and define a portion of the image that includes the area of interest. In another example the dedicated processor component can inform the device processor whenever it detects that a gesture has been made or whenever a facial recognition has been detected. In yet another example in some embodiments the dedicated processor component can interrupt or wake up the device processor that is in a standby mode e.g. sleep mode upon detecting that a specific type of machine vision information has been detected. This can significantly reduce the battery power consumption as the device processor can remain in standby mode and does not need to continuously obtain all of the image data captured by the cameras and process it. In yet another example the dedicated processor component can include gesture tracking head face tracking object tracking face object recognition multiple image stereo processing e.g. image rectification generating stereo disparity maps three dimensional image capture metadata tagging of the image data e.g. geo tagging time stamping symbol reading e.g. barcodes 2D ID codes optical character recognition OCR and the like.

In response to determining that the processing of the image by the dedicated image processor meets a threshold the dedicated processor component can initiate transfer of the portion of the image to the device processor. For example in various embodiments the device processor can determine that the processing of the image by the dedicated processor component meets a predetermined threshold test criteria or other threshold metric and can cause machine vision information or other information corresponding to the image to be provided to the device processor. In this way when the processing meets the threshold the dedicated processor component is triggered to cause the image information to be provided to the device processor. In various embodiments the threshold can be an amount or percentage of processing for a certain task e.g. object detection identification recognition etc. . For example the threshold can represent a certain decision transition or break in a decision tree a number of processing steps preformed a minimum or maximum amount of processing time etc. In some embodiments this can include detecting a certain object such as a face a number of objects detecting movement of an object performing a predetermined number of processing steps etc. In some situations the threshold can be changed or altered can be specific to particular cameras or the same for each camera. In this way the device processor can set new add remove or adjust an existing threshold. In this manner the device processor can determine when image data should be transferred to implement computationally intensive algorithms or processes which can result in a substantial power savings. At the same time if the device processor determines that further processing of the image data needs to be performed based on the received machine vision information it can initiate the transfer of the image data from the dedicated processor component to the device processor. For example the device processor can continuously inspect the high level information being received from the dedicated processor component determine that the image data may be of interest for additional processing based on the received information and instruct the dedicated processor component to transfer image data to the device processor as needed.

When the processing does not meet or otherwise satisfy the threshold the dedicated processor can perform further processing of the image before initiating transfer of the portion of the image to the device processor. Further processing can include object detection image segmentation etc. When the further processing meets the threshold the dedicated processor component can initiate transfer of the portion of the image to the device processor.

Thereafter the device processor can perform at least one image process on the portion of the image. For example in certain embodiments upon receiving the portion of the image from the dedicated processor component the device processor analyzes the image to identify a plurality of feature points generates based at least in part upon the plurality of feature points a plurality of feature vectors representative of an object in the image and identifies the object based at least in part on the plurality of feature vectors. In various embodiments other processing by the device processor can be performed. Such processing can include advanced object tracking features enhance or otherwise modify the image.

In this example the computing device has a display screen e.g. an LCD element operable to display information or image content to one or more users or viewers of the device. The display screen of some embodiments displays information to the viewers facing the display screen e.g. on the same side of the computing device as the display screen . The computing device in this example can include one or more imaging elements in this example including two image capture elements on the front of the device and at least one image capture element on the back of the device. It should be understood however that image capture elements could also or alternatively be placed on the sides or corners of the device and that there can be any appropriate number of capture elements of similar or different types. Each image capture element and may be for example a camera a charge coupled component CCD a motion detection sensor or an infrared sensor or other image capturing technology.

As discussed the device can use the images e.g. still or video captured from the imaging elements and to generate a three dimensional simulation of the surrounding environment e.g. a virtual reality of the surrounding environment for display on the display element of the device . Further the device can utilize outputs from at least one of the image capture elements and to assist in determining the location and or orientation of a user and in recognizing nearby persons objects or locations. For example if the user is holding the device the captured image information can be analyzed e.g. using mapping information about a particular area to determine the approximate location and or orientation of the user. The captured image information may also be analyzed to recognize nearby persons objects or locations e.g. by matching parameters or elements from the mapping information .

The computing device can also include at least one microphone or other audio capture elements capable of capturing audio data such as words spoken by a user of the device music being hummed by a person near the device or audio being generated by a nearby speaker or other such component although audio elements are not required in at least some devices. In this example there are three microphones one microphone on the front side one microphone on the back and one microphone on or near a top or side of the device. In some devices there may be only one microphone while in other devices there might be at least one microphone on each side and or corner of the device or in other appropriate locations.

The device in this example also includes one or more orientation or position determining elements operable to provide information such as a position direction motion or orientation of the device. These elements can include for example accelerometers inertial sensors electronic gyroscopes and electronic compasses.

The example device also includes at least one communication mechanism such as may include at least one wired or wireless component operable to communicate with one or more electronic devices. The device also includes a power system such as may include a battery operable to be recharged through conventional plug in approaches or through other approaches such as capacitive charging through proximity with a power mat or other such component. Various other elements and or combinations are possible as well within the scope of various embodiments.

The device typically will include some type of display element such as a touch screen electronic ink e ink organic light emitting diode OLED or liquid crystal display LCD although devices such as portable media players might convey information via other means such as through audio speakers.

As discussed the device in many embodiments will include at least one imaging element such as one or more cameras that are able to capture images of the surrounding environment and that are able to image a user people or objects in the vicinity of the device. The image capture element can include any appropriate technology such as a CCD image capture element having a sufficient resolution focal range and viewable area to capture an image of the user when the user is operating the device. Methods for capturing images using a camera element with a computing device are well known in the art and will not be discussed herein in detail. It should be understood that image capture can be performed using a single image multiple images periodic imaging continuous image capturing image streaming etc. Further a device can include the ability to start and or stop image capture such as when receiving a command from a user application or other device.

The example computing device also includes at least one orientation determining element able to determine and or detect orientation and or movement of the device. Such an element can include for example an accelerometer or gyroscope operable to detect movement e.g. rotational movement angular displacement tilt position orientation motion along a non linear path etc. of the device . An orientation determining element can also include an electronic or digital compass which can indicate a direction e.g. north or south in which the device is determined to be pointing e.g. with respect to a primary axis or other such aspect .

As discussed the device in many embodiments will include at least a positioning element for determining a location of the device or the user of the device . A positioning element can include or comprise a GPS or similar location determining elements operable to determine relative coordinates for a position of the device. As mentioned above positioning elements may include wireless access points base stations etc. that may either broadcast location information or enable triangulation of signals to determine the location of the device. Other positioning elements may include QR codes barcodes RFID tags NFC tags etc. that enable the device to detect and receive location information or identifiers that enable the device to obtain the location information e.g. by mapping the identifiers to a corresponding location . Various embodiments can include one or more such elements in any appropriate combination.

As mentioned above some embodiments use the element s to track the location of a device. Upon determining an initial position of a device e.g. using GPS the device of some embodiments may keep track of the location of the device by using the element s or in some instances by using the orientation determining element s as mentioned above or a combination thereof. As should be understood the algorithms or mechanisms used for determining a position and or orientation can depend at least in part upon the selection of elements available to the device.

The example device also includes one or more wireless components operable to communicate with one or more electronic devices within a communication range of the particular wireless channel. The wireless channel can be any appropriate channel used to enable devices to communicate wirelessly such as Bluetooth cellular NFC or Wi Fi channels. It should be understood that the device can have one or more conventional wired communications connections as known in the art.

The device also includes a power system such as may include a battery operable to be recharged through conventional plug in approaches or through other approaches such as capacitive charging through proximity with a power mat or other such component. Various other elements and or combinations are possible as well within the scope of various embodiments.

In some embodiments the device can include at least one additional input component able to receive conventional input from a user. This conventional input can include for example a push button touch pad touch screen wheel joystick keyboard mouse keypad or any other such component or element whereby a user can input a command to the device. These I O components could even be connected by a wireless infrared or Bluetooth or other link as well in some embodiments. Some devices also can include a microphone or other audio capture element that accepts voice or other audio commands. For example a device might not include any buttons at all but might be controlled only through a combination of visual and audio commands such that a user can control the device without having to be in contact with the device.

In some embodiments a device can include the ability to activate and or deactivate detection and or command modes such as when receiving a command from a user or an application or retrying to determine an audio input or video input etc. In some embodiments a device can include an infrared detector or motion sensor for example which can be used to activate one or more detection modes. For example a device might not attempt to detect or communicate with devices when there is not a user in the room. If an infrared detector i.e. a detector with one pixel resolution that detects changes in state detects a user entering the room for example the device can activate a detection or control mode such that the device can be ready when needed by the user but conserve power and resources when a user is not nearby.

A computing device in accordance with various embodiments may include a light detecting element that is able to determine whether the device is exposed to ambient light or is in relative or complete darkness. Such an element can be beneficial in a number of ways. In certain conventional devices a light detecting element is used to determine when a user is holding a cell phone up to the user s face causing the light detecting element to be substantially shielded from the ambient light which can trigger an action such as the display element of the phone to temporarily shut off since the user cannot see the display element while holding the device to the user s ear . The light detecting element could be used in conjunction with information from other elements to adjust the functionality of the device. For example if the device is unable to detect a user s view location and a user is not holding the device but the device is exposed to ambient light the device might determine that it has likely been set down by the user and might turn off the display element and disable certain functionality. If the device is unable to detect a user s view location a user is not holding the device and the device is further not exposed to ambient light the device might determine that the device has been placed in a bag or other compartment that is likely inaccessible to the user and thus might turn off or disable additional features that might otherwise have been available. In some embodiments a user must either be looking at the device holding the device or have the device out in the light in order to activate certain functionality of the device. In other embodiments the device may include a display element that can operate in different modes such as reflective for bright situations and emissive for dark situations . Based on the detected light the device may change modes.

Using the microphone the device can disable other features for reasons substantially unrelated to power savings. For example the device can use voice recognition to determine people near the device such as children and can disable or enable features such as Internet access or parental controls based thereon. Further the device can analyze recorded noise to attempt to determine an environment such as whether the device is in a car or on a plane and that determination can help to decide which features to enable disable or which actions are taken based upon other inputs. If voice recognition is used words can be used as input either directly spoken to the device or indirectly as picked up through conversation. For example if the device determines that it is in a car facing the user and detects a word such as hungry or eat then the device might turn on the display element and display information for nearby restaurants etc. A user can have the option of turning off voice recording and conversation monitoring for privacy and other such purposes.

In some of the above examples the actions taken by the device relate to deactivating certain functionality for purposes of reducing power consumption. It should be understood however that actions can correspond to other functions that can adjust similar and other potential issues with use of the device. For example certain functions such as requesting Web page content searching for content on a hard drive and opening various applications can take a certain amount of time to complete. For devices with limited resources or that have heavy usage a number of such operations occurring at the same time can cause the device to slow down or even lock up which can lead to inefficiencies degrade the user experience and potentially use more power.

In order to address at least some of these and other such issues approaches in accordance with various embodiments can also utilize information such as user gaze direction to activate resources that are likely to be used in order to spread out the need for processing capacity memory space and other such resources.

In some embodiments the device can have sufficient processing capability and the imaging element and associated analytical algorithm s may be sensitive enough to distinguish between the motion of the device motion of a user s head motion of the user s eyes and other such motions based on the captured images alone. In other embodiments such as where it may be desirable for the process to utilize a fairly simple imaging element and analysis approach it can be desirable to include at least one orientation determining element that is able to determine a current orientation of the device. In one example the at least one orientation determining element is at least one single or multi axis accelerometer that is able to detect factors such as three dimensional position of the device and the magnitude and direction of movement of the device as well as vibration shock etc. Methods for using elements such as accelerometers to determine orientation or movement of a device are also known in the art and will not be discussed herein in detail. Other elements for detecting orientation and or movement can be used as well within the scope of various embodiments for use as the orientation determining element. When the input from an accelerometer or similar element is used along with the input from the camera the relative movement can be more accurately interpreted allowing for a more precise input and or a less complex image analysis algorithm.

When using an imaging element of the computing device to detect motion of the device and or user for example the computing device can use the background in the images to determine movement. For example if a user holds the device at a fixed orientation e.g. distance angle etc. to the user and the user changes orientation to the surrounding environment analyzing an image of the user alone will not result in detecting a change in an orientation of the device. Rather in some embodiments the computing device can still detect movement of the device by recognizing the changes in the background imagery behind the user. So for example if an object e.g. a window picture tree bush building car etc. moves to the left or right in the image the device can determine that the device has changed orientation even though the orientation of the device with respect to the user has not changed. In other embodiments the device may detect that the user has moved with respect to the device and adjust accordingly. For example if the user tilts their head to the left or right with respect to the device the content rendered on the display element may likewise tilt to keep the content in orientation with the user.

As discussed different approaches can be implemented in various environments in accordance with the described embodiments. For example illustrates an example of an environment for implementing aspects in accordance with various embodiments. As will be appreciated although a Web based environment is used for purposes of explanation different environments may be used as appropriate to implement various embodiments. The system includes electronic client devices and which can include any appropriate device operable to send and receive requests messages or information over an appropriate network and convey information back to a user of the device. Examples of such client devices include personal computers cell phones handheld messaging devices laptop computers set top boxes personal data assistants electronic book readers and the like. The network can include any appropriate network including an intranet the Internet a cellular network a local area network or any other such network or combination thereof. The network could be a push network a pull network or a combination thereof. In a push network one or more of the servers push out data to the client device. In a pull network one or more of the servers send data to the client device upon request for the data by the client device. Components used for such a system can depend at least in part upon the type of network and or environment selected. Protocols and components for communicating via such a network are well known and will not be discussed herein in detail. Communication over the network can be enabled via wired or wireless connections and combinations thereof. In this example the network includes the Internet as the environment includes a Web server for receiving requests and serving content in response thereto although for other networks an alternative device serving a similar purpose could be used as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.

The illustrative environment includes at least one application server and a data store . It should be understood that there can be several application servers layers or other elements processes or components which may be chained or otherwise configured which can interact to perform tasks such as obtaining data from an appropriate data store. As used herein the term data store refers to any component or combination of components capable of storing accessing and retrieving data which may include any combination and number of data servers databases data storage components and data storage media in any standard distributed or clustered environment. The application server can include any appropriate hardware and software for integrating with the data store as needed to execute aspects of one or more applications for the client device and handling a majority of the data access and business logic for an application. The application server provides access control services in cooperation with the data store and is able to generate content such as text graphics audio and or video to be transferred to the user which may be served to the user by the Web server in the form of HTML XML or another appropriate structured language in this example. The handling of all requests and responses as well as the delivery of content between the client devices and and the application server can be handled by the Web server . It should be understood that the Web and application servers are not required and are merely example components as structured code discussed herein can be executed on any appropriate device or host machine as discussed elsewhere herein.

The data store can include several separate data tables databases or other data storage mechanisms and media for storing data relating to a particular aspect. For example the data store illustrated includes mechanisms for storing content e.g. production data and user information which can be used to serve content for the production side. The data store is also shown to include a mechanism for storing log or session data . It should be understood that there can be many other aspects that may need to be stored in the data store such as page image information and access rights information which can be stored in any of the above listed mechanisms as appropriate or in additional mechanisms in the data store . The data store is operable through logic associated therewith to receive instructions from the application server and obtain update or otherwise process data in response thereto. In one example a user might submit a search request for a certain type of item. In this case the data store might access the user information to verify the identity of the user and can access the catalog detail information to obtain information about items of that type. The information can then be returned to the user such as in a results listing on a Web page that the user is able to view via a browser on anyone of the user devices and . Information for a particular item of interest can be viewed in a dedicated page or window of the browser.
