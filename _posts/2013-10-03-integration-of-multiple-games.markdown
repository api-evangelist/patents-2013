This application is a Continuation Application under 35 USC 120 and claims priority from U.S. application Ser. No. 13 297 533 entitled INTEGRATION OF MULTIPLE GAMES and filed on Nov. 16 2011 and is herein incorporated by reference.

The present invention relates to methods for improving social interactions in online games and more particularly methods computer programs and systems for providing a better integration of related online games.

Online games that allow players to interact with other players have become popular. Some online games such as chess or bridge have a small number of players that play together at the same time. Online game operators also referred to as social game operators harness the power of online social networks to design games that allow players to interact with their friends within the games.

Most online games are autonomous games because game activities performed inside a game affect only that one game. If a player likes to play several related games there is no continuity between the games. For example the player must define friends for each of the online games and a virtual currency must be carried in each of the online games. This separation does not provide an appealing environment to online game players. It is in this context that embodiments arise.

Methods systems and computer programs are presented for providing online games. It should be appreciated that the present invention can be implemented in numerous ways such as a process an apparatus a system a device or a method on a computer readable medium. Several inventive embodiments of the present invention are described below.

In one embodiment a method includes an operation for providing access to a plurality of online games and to a wrapper game. Each of the online games and the wrapper game is directly accessible to be loaded utilizing a corresponding internet address which is different for each online game. The wrapper game includes options to load any of the plurality of online games. In addition the method includes another operation for providing a chat interface in the plurality of online games and in the wrapper game. The chat interface allows users accessing any of the online games to exchange messages with other users accessing any of the online games and the chat interface is unavailable to users currently absent from the online games and absent from the wrapper game. Each online game and the wrapper game is a non monolithic program that requires execution to enable play. The non monolithic program when loaded and executed provides access to one online game and accessing another online game from the non monolithic program requires that another non monolithic program be loaded and executed by a computing device. In one embodiment the operations of the method are executed by a processor.

In another embodiment a method includes an operation for providing access to a plurality of online games and to a wrapper game. Each of the online games and the wrapper game is directly accessible to be loaded utilizing a corresponding internet address which is different for each online game and the wrapper game includes options to load any of the plurality of online games. Further the method includes an operation for providing a chat interface in the plurality of online games and in the wrapper game. The chat interface allows users accessing any of the online games to exchange messages with other users accessing any of the online games and the chat interface is unavailable to users currently absent from the online games and absent from the wrapper game. Further yet the method includes an operation for providing a playing together interface to players of the plurality of online games where a first player and a second player playing together will move together from online game to online game and from room to room within an online game. Each online game and the wrapper game is a non monolithic program that requires execution to enable play.

In yet another embodiment a non transitory computer readable storage medium storing a computer program for providing online games is provided. The computer readable storage medium includes program instructions for providing access to a plurality of online games and to a wrapper game where each of the online games and the wrapper game is directly accessible to be loaded utilizing a corresponding internet address which is different for each online game. Further the wrapper game includes options to load any of the plurality of online games. The storage medium further includes program instructions for providing a chat interface in the plurality of online games and the wrapper game where the chat interface allows users accessing any of the online games to exchange messages with other users accessing any of the online games. The chat interface is unavailable to users currently absent from the online games and absent from the wrapper game. Each online game and the wrapper game is a non monolithic program that requires execution to enable play.

Other aspects will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The following embodiments describe methods computer programs and systems for providing online social games. It will be apparent that the present embodiments may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present embodiments.

In the embodiment shown in the casino game includes poker bingo and slots but other combinations of casino games are possible. Each casino game has a tab in the game navigation bar which means that there are three tabs in the embodiment of poker tab bingo tab and slots tab . In one embodiment the tab associated with the current game is highlighted in some fashion such as by having a different color background having a larger tab having a name with a bigger font etc. In another embodiment the tabs are similar for all the games and the current game is identified via other signals in the webpage such as having the game name somewhere else on the page.

In one embodiment the persistent navigation bar is exactly identical in all the casino games and in other embodiment the persistent navigation bar may show slight variations depending on the game. For example in one embodiment the persistent navigation bar includes a tab to go to the casino lobby i.e. to the casino game but in another embodiment the navigation bar does not include a tab for the casino lobby. The navigation bar may also include game dependant items such as the skill level achieved in the current game. Since the skill level varies from game to game the skill level for the current game will be different in each of the games.

Further the game navigation bar may include one or more of a user picture a first game currency a second game currency a skill level area in the current game an energy level shortcuts to other games or applications a global casino skill level not shown etc. The global casino skill level is a game level indicating the progress of the player in the casino and is calculated based on the progress made in all the casino games.

In one embodiment each of the games in the casino is a different application that can be invoked by itself without having to go through the casino application. For example each of the casino games may be played on a Facebook page and each of the games may be included as a shortcut on the Facebook page as described in more detail below with reference to . In addition the casino game may also be played on the Facebook page and may also be a shortcut on the Facebook page.

Although all the casino games are separate applications the casino games share some game data. In one embodiment the casino games use the same virtual currency . This means that the player may increase the chip count i.e. virtual currency by winning a bingo game and decrease the chip count by losing a poker game. In another embodiment some game data is shared among two or more games but is not shared by other games. For example the energy level is shared by the bingo game and the slots game but does not apply to the poker game. Therefore as the user plays several game bingo games the energy level may decrease and as the user plays slots games this energy level may also decrease. The user may purchase more energy with virtual currency such as second currency .

In addition to sharing game data the casino games may also share other settings also referred to herein as global settings. In one embodiment the casino games may share one or more of a privacy setting e.g. allowing friends to see my activities allowing some friends to see my activities allowing everyone to see my activities etc. game buddies language email notifications etc. In another embodiment the user has an option in the game to set settings and privacy options for the casino global settings another option to set the in game settings that are pertinent to the current game.

In one embodiment the player has the ability to define game friends or buddies. The friends may be linked to the player on a social site or may have been added directly from within the game. Friend bar provides information to the player on the current activities of friends. Friend bar may include for each player a picture of the player which is obtained from a social networking site or from a profile of the player in the casino or the bingo game. If a friend is currently in the casino playing a game information area includes information about the friend such as the game that the friend is playing and the room or location where the player is within the game. For example the game might indicate that a friend is in bingo parlor CA 1 so the player may join the friend by going to room CA 1.

In one embodiment the game provides a suggested friends bar also referred to as suggested casino buddies with one or more suggestions for new friends in the casino. When the player clicks on one of the suggested friends the game provides user information such as profile information relationship to the player e.g. friend of Lewis Facebook friend etc. Additionally the game may display friendship requests from other players and the player is given the option to accept or reject the requests.

The casino game enables friends to play together casino games. In one embodiment a player may select to move around the casino with a friend. This means that if a first player and a second player decide to play together when the first player goes to a room in the casino to play a game the second player will be taken to the same room by the game. In other embodiment if the player wants to join a friend in a game the player may click on the information area associated with the friend and the game will take the player to the same room.

The game of also includes a button to start playing the game another button to select a bingo room and another button to purchase more tickets or chips .

It is noted that the embodiments illustrated in are exemplary. Other embodiments may utilize different layouts different options or different games in the casino. The embodiments illustrated in should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

The game navigation bar is persistent across the casino game and the games associated with the casino. As previously described with reference to the game navigation bar includes among other things a first currency a second currency and a casino skill level . The global casino skill level indicates the progress of the player in the casino and is calculated based on the progress made in all the games associated with the casino.

The game selection buttons include buttons to play Texas Holdem Poker Bingo 21 Slots Craps and Spin the wheel . If the player selects one of these buttons the player will be taken to the corresponding game such as being transported to the lobby of the Texas Holdem Poker game.

In one embodiment a special item obtained in one game may be utilized in another. For example a gun acquired in a Mafia Wars game opens a special table in the craps game reserved for mafia members in the Mafia Wars game. Additionally the special item may be acquired in one casino game and then used in another casino game. For example a player that wins a bingo game may get a reward that allows access to a VIP poker room.

The casino game may also integrate some of the activities the player performs in the different casino games. Although each casino game is independent from other casino games at least independent in the way progress is made within each game the casino game may have a progress measure that requires progress in two or more casino games. Similar to a decathlon in the Olympic Games where players compete in ten different events to obtain a global decathlon score players may perform tasks in multiple games to obtain a reward in the casino. For example the player is given one week in which to play poker bingo and slots and the more time spent playing these games or the more chips are purchased the higher the score will be. Players are allowed to compete with friends for multi game competitions. For example two friends may choose to play a competition over the weekend to see who wins more chips by playing poker bingo or slot machines.

In addition the lobby also includes the persistent navigation bar which is available in the casino games. In one embodiment the persistent navigation bar is identical for all the games but in other embodiments there may be some variation of the persistent navigation bar such as including options available only for the particular game the user display. Therefore when the player is in the poker lobby the player has an option to select another game by selecting the tab associated with that game. If the player clicks on the bingo tab then the player will be taken to the bingo game.

In one embodiment players can chat with any friend that is currently in the casino even if the players are not in the same game or in the same room. In another embodiment the chat includes a plurality of friends.

In the player clicks in the Poker tab the player will leave the Bingo game and be transported to the Poker game such as for example to the lobby of the Poker game or to a room where one of the player s friends is playing poker. The bingo game includes a Bingo card for the current Bingo game. The game also includes other players in the current game. As discussed above the chips utilized to buy the Bingo cards are the same chips that can be used to play poker or the slot machines.

Although the persistent navigation bar is a common element in the interface for the casino games other interface elements i.e. GUI elements may also be shared by the different casino games. For example the shared interface may include one or more of a navigation bar situated on the left side of the GUI a navigation bar situated on the right side of the GUI a navigation bar situated at the bottom of the GUI single addressable elements within any part of the GUI e.g. a button to purchase chips a link to go to the casino lobby a link to chat with friends anywhere in the casino etc. etc. The persistent navigation bar illustrated herein should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

Web page is one embodiment of a page designed for playing games online via web browsers. In this embodiment a list of games is presented for selection by the player and a list of featured games identifies popular games. In one embodiment the game is played in game area as an embedded component that may use any technology for presenting multimedia dynamic content such as Hyper Text Markup Language 5 HTML5 Adobe Flash etc. The game area includes a persistent navigation bar as previously described with reference to .

Adobe Flash formerly known as Macromedia Flash is a multimedia platform for adding animation and interactivity to web pages. A Flash component e.g. game area may be embedded in a web page e.g. web page to create animation advertisements or games and to integrate video into the web page. Adobe Flash can manipulate vector and raster graphics and support bidirectional streaming of audio and video. In one embodiment Adobe Flash libraries are used with the Extensible Markup Language XML capabilities of the web browsers to render rich content in the browsers. This technology is known as Asynchronous Flash and XML.

Another technology for displaying dynamic content in a web page is HTML5. HTML5 s features include media playback and offline storage. With a predecessor version to HTML5 named HTML4 sites have to reach for Adobe Flash or Silverlight to show a video or play music. However HTML5 lets sites directly embed media using Hyper Text Markup Language HTML tags e.g. and and plugins are not required.

In one embodiment games include objects such as characters currencies tools assets social relations etc. For example in a war game the characters may be the soldiers fighting on respective sides of the war. In addition there may be weapons used by the soldiers and objects around the battlefield e.g. buildings trees animals mountains rivers and so on . Each game object may be defined according to a predetermined syntax. For example the definition of a game object may include shape texture physical capabilities connection or relationship with other game objects etc.

In another embodiment a game application is embedded in a web page e.g. web page and the players play the game via web browsers. The display of a game is sometimes referred to as the stage of the game. Thus the stage of the game may be implemented as Adobe Flash or HTML5 component embedded in the web page. For example the stage is essentially a data structure that defines some of the basic elements of the game such as aspect ratio and display size. At any given time a game scene may be rendered and displayed on the stage by attaching one or more game objects to the stage.

It is noted that each of the casino games is a separate Facebook application that can be invoked from the Favorites menu or from some other link provided while browsing in the Facebook site. For example in one embodiment each of the casino games has a Facebook page. Players may visit the Facebook page of one casino game and select playing the game by clicking on a link in the Facebook page of the casino game.

Some casino games in the market provide a link in Facebook to load the casino game and once the player is in the casino game the player is given the option of selecting one of the games in the casino. However these casino games are monolithic applications that do not provide a direct access to the individual games in the casino because to access a game in the casino the player must always go through the casino application. As used herein a monolithic application is a program that when loaded and executed provides access to all the individual games without having to load and execute another program. In contrast a non monolithic program is a program that when loaded and executed provides access to one individual game and to access another individual game from the non monolithic program another non monolithic program must be loaded and executed by a computing device. Embodiments of the invention allow a player to access each casino game directly without having to go through the Casino wrapper game because each casino game is a non monolithic program. Further the Casino wrapper game is also a non monolithic program that can be used to provide access to the individual non monolithic online games. In one embodiment one monolithic program may be utilized to access more than one individual games but there is no monolithic program that may access all the individual games.

When the player selects the Poker game the Poker game is loaded in the stage area . The Poker game includes the persistent navigation bar with tabs for the several casino games. In one embodiment persistent navigation bar includes besides the tabs to access the individual casino games a tab to access the casino game.

If the player wants to change casino games the player has two options the player may click on one of the tabs in persistent navigation bar e.g. bingo tab or the player may select one of the shortcuts in Favorites area e.g. bingo link . In either case the selected casino game will be loaded in stage area .

It is noted that the embodiments illustrated in are exemplary. Other embodiments may utilize different layouts shortcuts buttons etc. The embodiments illustrated in should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

In another embodiment the player is able to access the casino games directly from a website that is not a social website. For example the player may access the casino and the casino games directly by selecting a hyperlink in the website such as the website presented in . Again the player does not have to access the casino game to reach one of the individual games in the casino. For example a player may select a hyperlink that loads the poker game in the webpage without having to first go to the casino game.

The casino includes game modules and the casino wrapper module . Each of the games may include game storage holding information for the corresponding game and each game may access shared game storage such as shared game data social data and user and social data . Game modules may be implemented in a distributed fashion where each game module is implemented in one or more game servers but several game modules may also be hosted in one game server.

The games may be played on a web browser and the games may be played from within a social network site or from other Internet websites. As discussed previously with reference to the social website includes in one embodiment a game stage area with shortcuts to one or more casino games and a shortcut to the casino wrapper game . Further web browser page includes an instance of the casino wrapper game . The game stage for the casino wrapper includes shortcuts to the casino games so the player may access the casino games from within the casino wrapper game.

Game utility module is shared by all the games and provides utilities accessible by the games. The utilities include one or more of management of a first shared virtual currency management of a second shared virtual currency skill level within each of the games assets owned by the player accessible via the inventory option in the game players social and profile information tournament information log of past playing times etc.

In one embodiment the game utility is implemented as a separate process that provides an interface to the different games. In another embodiment the game utility is implemented as shared code e.g. program instructions that may be utilized by the different games.

The shared data is managed by the game utility although it may also be accessed directly from each of the games. The shared game data is stored in shared game data database and the user and social data is stored in user and social data database . Shared game data database as its name implies is used to store data shared by the different games such as virtual currency links to other casino games a persistent navigation bar chat information tournament information etc. The user and social data database includes information about the user e.g. cached profile information from a social website user profile information for the casino user preferences etc. and user social data e.g. cached social information from the social website friends in the casino past history of social interactions friendship requests suggested new friends etc. .

Social network provides an Application Programming Interfaces API that may be accessed by the game utility or may be accessed by one of the games directly. Social network provides access to social data stored in database . As discussed above the social data may be cached by the gaming infrastructure such as a user and social data database but it may also be stored in other game infrastructure servers see for example .

From operation the method flows to operation where a currency which is shared by the plurality of online games is provided. Each of the online games is operable to increase or decrease the amount of shared currency i.e. as the player performs game activities in the different online games the amount of currency is increased or decreased. Further in one embodiment the amount of currency may be increased with the purchase of currency utilizing cash or credit.

From operation the method flows to operation where a shared navigation bar is provided. Each of the online games includes the shared navigation bar in a graphic user interface GUI of the game see for example the embodiments illustrated in . At least one operation of the method is executed through a processor.

When a player provides an input into the player s client device the client device may in response send a message via the communications network to the social networking server. The social networking server may update the player profile save the message to a database send messages to other players etc. The social gaming network may include a social graph database which stores player relationships social player profiles player messages and player social data.

The gaming servers host one or more gaming applications and perform the computations necessary to provide the gaming features to the players and clients. One or more gaming realm databases store data related to the gaming services such as the gaming applications and modules virtual gaming environment realm data player gaming session data player scores player virtual gaming profiles game stage levels etc. The gaming servers may utilize the data from the gaming realm databases to perform the computations related to providing gaming services for the players. In some implementations a server load database stores gaming server load statistics such as computational load server responses times etc. The social gaming network may include one or more load balancing servers .

Game Utility Servers provide game utilities shared by a plurality of casino games and game utility information database stores shared gaming data. In addition one or more game integration servers deliver functionality to make available games e.g. casino rapper game that integrate two or more independently accessible games e.g. poker bingo slots etc. . Database stores data for the game integration game e.g. skill level reached at the integration game .

Each game server has access to one or more game databases for keeping game data. In addition a single database can store game data for one or more online games. Each game server may also includes one or more levels of caching. Game data cache is a game data cache for the game data stored in game databases . For increased performance caching may be performed in several levels of caching. For instance data more frequently used is stored in a high priority cache while data requiring less access during a session will be cached and updated less frequently.

The number of game servers changes over time as the gaming platform is an extensible platform that changes the number of game servers according to the load on the gaming infrastructure. As a result the number of game servers will be higher during peak playing times and the number of game servers will be lower during off peak hours. In one embodiment the increase or decrease of bandwidth is executed automatically based on current line usage or based on historical data.

One or more social network management servers provide support for the social features incorporated into the online games. The social network management servers access social data from one or more social networks via Application Programming Interfaces API made available by the social network providers. An example of a social network is Facebook but it is possible to have other embodiments implemented in other social networks. Each social network includes social data and this social data or a fraction of the social data is made available via API . As in the case of the game servers the number of social network management servers that are active at a point in time changes according to the load on the infrastructure. As the demand for social data increases the number of social network management servers increases. Social network management servers cache user data in database and social data in database . The social data may include the social networks where a player is present the social relationships for the player the frequency of interaction of the player with the social network and with other players etc. Additionally the user data kept in database may include the player s name demographics e mail games played frequency of access to the game infrastructure etc.

It is noted that the embodiment illustrated in is an exemplary online gaming infrastructure. Other embodiments may utilize different types of servers databases APIs etc. and the functionality of several servers can be provided by a single server or the functionality can be spread across a plurality of distributed servers. The embodiment illustrated in should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

One or more links couple a server or a client to network . In particular embodiments one or more links each includes one or more wireline wireless or optical links . In particular embodiments one or more links each includes an intranet an extranet a VPN a LAN a WLAN a WAN a MAN a portion of the Internet or another link or a combination of two or more such links .

Each server may be a stand alone server or may be a distributed server spanning multiple computers or multiple datacenters. Servers may be of various types such as for example and without limitation web server news server mail server message server advertising server file server application server exchange server database server or proxy server. Each server may include hardware software embedded logic components or a combination of two or more such components for carrying out the appropriate functionalities implemented or supported by server .
