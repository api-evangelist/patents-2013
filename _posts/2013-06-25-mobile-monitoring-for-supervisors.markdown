The present disclosure is generally directed toward communications and more specifically toward contact centers.

A supervisor walking a typical contact center floor is generally only able to hear one side of a customer conversation ambient noise permitting. Additionally the supervisor doesn t always have immediate access to customer information or current statistics though the supervisor may be able to see a display of some statistics if collocated with agents on the contact center floor. It is important for the supervisor to monitor the quality of customer service that the agents provide. Sometimes the supervisor needs to intervene if an agent is having problems getting angry providing incorrect information or failing in some other capacity. Other times the supervisor needs to assess performance of the agents including outstanding performance.

A common method for the supervisor to monitor the agent is to physically go to a telephone and connect to a call to participate in call monitoring recording and flagging for later review. The method is known as service observing SO . A typical SO feature allows the supervisor to listen in and possibly participate on calls routed to the agent or group of agents to a particular agent station or calls that come into a particular directory number. The service observer may request to observe a particular type or set of calls. It is possible and common to service observe a Vector Directory Number VDN where the Automatic Call Distributor ACD sets up specific routing e.g. service observing for all calls that come in to the VDN which may be serviced by more than one agent. The service observer can listen in for a portion of a call or for an entire call.

SO features have some limitations. An effective SO strategy requires knowledge in advance that a call or calls need service observing. The current way to connect to a call via a desk telephone requires that the agent is within close physical proximity to the supervisor which precludes certain types of monitoring for remote agents and or by remote supervisors. SO can also be highly stressful for the agent prone to error and or introduce a delayed analysis and response.

SO is a common and useful feature and most contact centers just live with the limitations. Typically supervisors are collocated with agents for observation and are on the same server or the same network to make SO as widely available as possible. Certain agents or groups are often designated as a set that can be tagged for monitoring. However SO is traditionally inflexible meaning it has to be initiated a certain way from a hardphone means of performing observations are limited and there are limits on how many SO sessions can take place simultaneously.

These and other needs are addressed by the various aspects embodiments and or configurations of the present disclosure. The present disclosure is directed to a mobile monitoring solution that can allow a contact center supervisor to observe calls using smart devices from any location thereby enabling a new level of efficiency for service observing SO . A mobile SO module is proposed herein that is capable of displaying content dynamically from several sources to the smart devices through one or more application programming interfaces APIs . The smart devices concurrently display native content integrated with content delivered by each of the APIs.

As an illustrative example a supervisor would dial a Feature Access Code FAC get a dial tone and then dial an extension number or agent login code. There may be two Feature Access Codes FACs from which to choose one for listen only and one for listen and speak. An optional tone may be played periodically to remind a caller and an agent that the call is monitored. Class of Restriction COR typically needs to be set to enable SO for a supervisor s extension an agent extension or a VDN to be monitored.

In one embodiment the supervisor can passively listen in on agent conversations regardless of location and or proximity. This can be accomplished by allowing the supervisor to choose the agent s to be monitored and have a service observing call initiated using a mobile device carried by the supervisor.

In this non limiting example the mobile device is not doing the SO it is accessing the SO media via a centralized server that has access to the communication session between the agent and customer. The recording mechanism is handled by a recording server which can be triggered by the supervisor s mobile device. Text based assistance can also be achieved on the mobile device and the agent desktop via a Peer to Peer P2P connection.

In one embodiment the centralized server may create a display or pop up that the mobile device can present giving the supervisor information on the agent and or the customer. With the inclusion of recordings and real time transcripts the supervisor can access the contact in its entirety to be well prepared to join the call. Since this removes the dependency of the supervisor to physically be located with the agents remote agents as well as remote supervisors also benefit from this capability.

The term automatic and variations thereof as used herein refers to any process or operation done without material human input when the process or operation is performed. However a process or operation can be automatic even though performance of the process or operation uses material or immaterial human input if the input is received before performance of the process or operation. Human input is deemed to be material if such input influences how the process or operation will be performed. Human input that consents to the performance of the process or operation is not deemed to be material. 

The term computer readable medium as used herein refers to any storage and or transmission medium that participate in providing instructions to a processor for execution. Such a medium is commonly tangible and non transient and can take many forms including but not limited to non volatile media volatile media and transmission media and includes without limitation random access memory RAM read only memory ROM and the like. Non volatile media includes for example NVRAM or magnetic or optical disks. Volatile media includes dynamic memory such as main memory. Common forms of computer readable media include for example a floppy disk including without limitation a Bernoulli cartridge ZIP drive and JAZ drive a flexible disk hard disk magnetic tape or cassettes or any other magnetic medium magneto optical medium a digital video disk such as CD ROM any other optical medium punch cards paper tape any other physical medium with patterns of holes a RAM a PROM and EPROM a FLASH EPROM a solid state medium like a memory card any other memory chip or cartridge a carrier wave as described hereinafter or any other medium from which a computer can read. A digital file attachment to e mail or other self contained information archive or set of archives is considered a distribution medium equivalent to a tangible storage medium. When the computer readable media is configured as a database it is to be understood that the database may be any type of database such as relational hierarchical object oriented and or the like. Accordingly the disclosure is considered to include a tangible storage medium or distribution medium and prior art recognized equivalents and successor media in which the software implementations of the present disclosure are stored. Computer readable storage medium commonly excludes transient storage media particularly electrical magnetic electromagnetic optical magneto optical signals.

Moreover the communication network may comprise a number of different communication media such as coaxial cable copper cable wire fiber optic cable antennas for transmitting receiving wireless messages and combinations thereof.

The communication devices may correspond to customer communication devices. In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present disclosure a customer may utilize their communication device to initiate a work item which is generally a request for a processing resource . Exemplary work items include but are not limited to a contact directed toward and received at a contact center a web page request directed toward and received at a server farm e.g. collection of servers a media request an application request e.g. a request for application resources location on a remote application server such as a SIP application server and the like. The work item may be in the form of a message or collection of messages transmitted over the communication network . For example the work item may be transmitted as a telephone call a packet or collection of packets e.g. IP packets transmitted over an IP network an email message an Instant Message an SMS message a fax and combinations thereof. In some embodiments the communication may not necessarily be directed at the work assignment mechanism but rather may be on some other server in the communication network where it is harvested by the work assignment mechanism which generates a work item for the harvested communication. An example of such a harvested communication includes a social media communication that is harvested by the work assignment mechanism from a social media network or server. Exemplary architectures for harvesting social media communications and generating work items based thereon are described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 12 784 369 12 706 942 and 12 707 277 filed Mar. 20 1010 Feb. 17 2010 and Feb. 17 2010 respectively each of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The communication device may correspond to a supervisor communication device or collection of devices. In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present disclosure a supervisor may utilize the communication device to evaluate or help the servicing of a work item by a resource . The supervisor may utilize the communication device to initiate or respond to interaction regarding work items with the work assignment mechanism a mobile service observing module elements within or outside of the communication network and to processing resources .

The work assignment mechanism may employ any queue based or queueless work assignment algorithm. Examples of queue based work assignment skill based algorithms include without limitation a fairness algorithm pacing algorithm which inserts rests into the agents work queue value based algorithms limited algorithms such as Business Advocate by Avaya Inc. and outsourcing algorithms. Other algorithms may consider other types of data inputs and or may treat certain data inputs differently.

The format of the work item may depend upon the capabilities of the communication device and the format of the communication. In particular work items are logical representations within a contact center of work to be performed in connection with servicing a communication received at the contact center and more specifically the work assignment mechanism . The communication may be received and maintained at the work assignment mechanism a switch or server connected to the work assignment mechanism or the like until a resource is assigned to the work item representing that communication at which point the work assignment mechanism passes the work item to a routing engine to connect the communication device to the assigned resource .

Although the routing engine is depicted as being separate from the work assignment mechanism the routing engine may be incorporated into the work assignment mechanism or its functionality may be executed by the work assignment engine .

In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present disclosure the customer communication devices and the supervisor communication device s may comprise any type of known communication equipment or collection of communication equipment. Examples of a suitable communication device include but are not limited to a personal computer laptop tablet cellular phone smartphone telephone or combinations thereof. In general each communication device may be adapted to support video audio text and or data communications with other communication devices as well as the processing resources . The type of medium used by the communication device to communicate with other communication devices or processing resources may depend upon the communication applications available on the communication device .

In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present disclosure the work item is sent toward a collection of processing resources via the combined efforts of the work assignment mechanism and routing engine . The resources can either be completely automated resources e.g. Interactive Voice Response IVR units processors servers or the like human resources utilizing communication devices e.g. human agents utilizing a computer telephone laptop etc. or any other resource known to be used in contact centers.

As discussed above the work assignment mechanism and resources may be owned and operated by a common entity in a contact center format. In some embodiments the work assignment mechanism may be administered by multiple enterprises each of which has their own dedicated resources connected to the work assignment mechanism .

In some embodiments the work assignment mechanism comprises a work assignment engine which enables the work assignment mechanism to make intelligent routing decisions for work items. In some embodiments the work assignment engine is configured to administer and make work assignment decisions in a queueless contact center as is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 882 950 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

More specifically the work assignment engine can determine which of the plurality of processing resources is qualified and or eligible to receive the work item and further determine which of the plurality of processing resources is best suited or is the optimal processing resource to handle the processing needs of the work item. In situations of work item surplus the work assignment engine can also make the opposite determination i.e. determine optimal assignment of a work item resource to a resource . In some embodiments the work assignment engine is configured to achieve true one to one matching by utilizing bitmaps tables and other data structures.

The work assignment mechanism can communicate with the mobile service observing module which may provide SO features. The work assignment mechanism can communicate with a Call Management System CMS which may provide integrated analysis and reporting on the performance of one agent a group of agents a single contact center site or multiple contact center sites. The mobile service observing module may additionally integrate CMS data and application data for display on a user interface of the communication device . Applications may work in conjunction with the mobile service observing module providing both native functionality and third party functionality provided by an API.

The contact center floor can contain one or more large wall mounted displays commonly referred to as wallboards operable to integrate with data sources. The wallboard may display many types of information including but not limited to RSS feed data statistics e.g. Key Performance Indicators KPIs metrics graphs images announcements alerts thresholds and messages. The contact center can include more or fewer elements and elements of the contact center can be arranged differently and interact differently than those shown in .

Contact center resources may be agents at workstations and may be seated with a view of one or more wallboards . For example Elizabeth Lani and Josh may be resources for the contact center operable to receive and complete work items. Generally the agent can have a workstation that includes a telephone a computer a smart device and other communication devices. As can be appreciated the contact center floor and the agent workstations may comprise more or fewer of the elements listed. One or more supervisors may be available to monitor activities on the contact center floor and to assist restrain and train agents . Omar for example may have a workstation inside the facility or remote from the contact center floor . The supervisor workstation may include a land line telephone a computer a smart device or other communication devices.

In one embodiment the supervisor may have a communication device . One non limiting example of the device is a mobile or cordless device that is connected to other contact center components via wireless connections e.g. 802.11N 3G 4G etc. and capable of browsing telephony and or location. The device may be a telephone or a tablet. More specifically the supervisor communication device may be a telephone or tablet operable to run applications related to the supervision of the contact center floor . The supervisor communication device may be operable to receive calls short message service SMS texts pop ups and data as well as operable to communicate with a wallboard module and other contact center elements.

A smartphone display can present icons for application and or feature invocation to access capture and or store information. Native applications or applications that are installed directly on a smartphone may include applications that are designed to run on a device s operating system and machine firmware. Examples of native applications on the smartphone might include a Text Agent application and a Terminate application . Additionally developers may develop third party applications for use on the smartphone . APIs may allow the third party applications to better integrate with the communication device s operating system and machine firmware. The API on the smartphone may also allow third party applications to multitask thus increasing the available feature functionality of the smartphone . Examples of third party applications might include a third party Call Record application and a Screen Capture application

The smartphone display may display additional elements containing information in addition to icons for application and or feature invocation. A spreadsheet and or table may be rendered from information provided by a CMS. Data presented may include typical contact center report information including but not limited to agent name agent extension time of the agent s last call caller information e.g. caller ID telephone number indicator as to whether the call was inbound or outbound and the amount of time that the agent put the caller on hold.

Moreover the information can be generated through one or more communications modes APIs channels or facilities that are in communication with the mobile service observing module such as but not limited to email voice messaging calendar information reminders tasks instant messaging text messaging CMS metrics statistics KPIs RSS feeds and the like. The generated information may be provided by applications native and or third party and shown on the smartphone display . A mobile contact center application on the device may provide queue information including KPIs detailed agent statistics agent availability etc. Examples of the mobile contact center application capabilities are more fully described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 348 412 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Additional data transfer may be done over the Internet via file sharing via Bluetooth data mapping and additional forms of data query sharing and retrieval from servers workstations applications and or communication devices. The display may also receive information in the form of images video text and or any data that the smartphone can receive and process. The mobile service observing module is operable to receive transfer pull push and aggregate data from multiple sources to the display .

The method for smart device integrated service observing in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure is shown in . Generally the method begins with a start operation and runs as a continuous loop. While a general order for the steps of the method are shown in the method can include more or fewer steps or the order of the steps can be arranged differently than those shown in . The method can be executed as a set of computer executable instructions executed by a computer system and encoded or stored on a computer readable medium. Further the method may also be embodied by a set of gates or other structures in an Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC a Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA or other configurable hardware component module or system. Hereinafter the method shall be explained with reference to the systems components modules software data structures etc. described in conjunction with .

Typically the process monitors at step to see how well agents are handling work items. A supervisor may log into a mobile contact center application to access contact center statistics with which to evaluate agents . Statistics might include but are not limited to Average Call Handle Time ACHT which may include total talk time and wrap time divided by the total number of calls Service Level SL which may indicate the percentage of calls answered within a certain amount of time e.g. 30 seconds Abandon Rate ABN which may be the number of dropped calls divided by total incoming calls Average Speed Answer ASA which may be the average number of seconds or minutes it takes to answer a call Longest Wait Time LWT and Average Wait Time AWT for incoming calls and Calls in Queue CIQ which may indicate how many calls are pending waiting for agent handling.

In step the agent may signal to the supervisor that he has a problem. For example Josh may have a question about an application that he is using to run a test trace on a call. Josh may raise his hand if Omar is on the contact center floor or Josh may send Omar an email if Omar and Josh are not collocated and or Josh may send an SMS text alert or other message to Omar on his smart communication device . For example Josh may send a text to Omar that reads The dashboard is giving me some weird trunk information. Can you take a look at this with me In step either independent of or concurrently with Josh sending the communication to Omar the CMS may send an alert or a report to Omar indicating that Josh has a problem.

In step the supervisor the mobile service observing module and or the CMS may make a determination that the agent needs assistance. If the answer to the assistance query is no the process returns to the start and may begin to monitor agents in step . If the answer to the query is yes the supervisor may join the call in step . In response to the need to join the call the supervisor may check data from the CMS in step . The supervisor may be able to check the work item ticket thresholds statistics metrics and or see the agent s desktop using native and or third party applications. If the supervisor feels that action is warranted the supervisor may initiate service observing features in step .

Omar seeing that Josh is struggling may launch an application on his supervisor communication device . Omar is able to access information from the mobile service observing module and the CMS . Omar is able to touch an icon allowing him to invoke the service observing feature Join Call. Omar works with Josh and a field agent Len to solve the problem. Once Omar is sufficiently satisfied that Josh has the issue in hand Omar may disconnect from the call in step . Once Omar disconnects in step the process may loop back to the beginning and monitoring agents may resume in step .
