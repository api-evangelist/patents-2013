This application is related to and claims the benefit of priority to Provisional Application U.S. Ser. No. 61 662 712 titled Discrete Groundwater Sampling System for Open Borehole Bedrock Wells in Fractured Rock by Philip T. Harte filed Jun. 21 2012 in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon.

The present invention relates in general to fluid sampling of zones in wells intersected by fractures and in long screen wells in unconsolidated aquifers.

The GroundWater Protection Council 1999 indicates that thousands of waste disposal sites are present in the northeastern United States where fractured rock aquifers predominate. Innovative sampling systems that can effectively and efficiently sample fluids in heterogeneous aquifers are particularly relevant in helping to identify contaminant distribution and pathways.

Fluid sampling in open boreholes tapping fractured rock aquifers is particularly challenging because of vertical mixing of fluid within the borehole from flow from multiple fractures. The use of downhole pumps to pump water or other fluid from long open hole bedrock wells or long screen sections of wells is problematic because the well bore acts as a conduit and induces vertical flow and mixing of fluid from multiple fractures at different zones depths throughout the entire well opening based on the transmissivity of each fracture Shapiro 2002 . The source of the pumped fluid in an open borehole is a mixture of the well bore fluid and the flow weighted contribution of fluid from multiple fractures. The unknown source origin of the resultant fluid sample is less than ideal for the identification of natural and anthropogenic contaminant pathways.

Packers that straddle the pumps have been used to isolate flow from discrete fractures or fracture sets to reduce capture of well bore fluid Shapiro 2002 . However the use of packers can be time consuming and logistically difficult. An easier and more efficient sampling system is needed.

A sampling system with a multilevel pumping system is described herein that uses hydraulic containment to collect specific discrete zone fluid samples in wells having long open hole non cased bedrock wells or long screen sections of wells without mixing and drawing of fluid from different zones depths . The sampling system couples hydraulic control of flow in open hole or long screen wells with differential logging of vertical flow to surgically remove well fluid samples and quantitatively assess zonal transmissivity. The hydraulic control of flow uses pumps to isolate samples from discrete fractures within specific zones without mixing the fluid samples with fluid throughout the well. The absence of mixing is confirmed through differential flowmeter logging or dual tracer tracking. The sampling system aids scientists and water managers tasked with the challenge of identifying contaminant pathways and sources in complex fractured rock aquifers or heterogeneous unconsolidated aquifers.

In accordance with an embodiment of the invention a sampling system for use in a well has a sample pump disposed in a target zone of the well to collect a fluid sample from the target zone. An upper pump is disposed above the sample pump and a lower pump is disposed below the sample pump. A first flow device is disposed between the upper pump and the sample pump and a second flow device is disposed between the sample pump and the lower pump. The upper pump the lower pump and the sample pump have extraction flow rates set to generate a first hydraulic zone between the first flow device and the sample pump and a second hydraulic zone between the sample pump and the second flow device. The first and second hydraulic zones isolate the fluid in the target zone from fluid in other zones of the well and the first flow device and the second flow device monitor fluid flow within the well to confirm isolation of the target zone.

In accordance with another embodiment of the invention a sampling system for use in a well has a hydraulic flow control system and a differential logging system. The hydraulic flow control system has a plurality of multi level vertically disposed pumps with fluid extraction rates set to generate hydraulic zones above and below one of the pumps used as a sample pump. The hydraulic zones isolate fluid flow in a target zone surrounding the sample pump and the sample pump collects a sample from the isolated target zone without mixing fluid from other zones of the well. The differential logging system has a plurality of flow devices. Each of the plurality of flow devices is disposed near the respective hydraulic zones to monitor vertical flow in the well and confirm isolation of the target zone.

In accordance with another embodiment of the invention a method is provided for sampling fluid from a target zone within a well bore without commingling fluid from other zones in the well. In the method locations and flow rates of fractures in a geologic formation surrounding the well and the total extraction flow rate of the well are determined by performing conventional flowmeter logging. A fracture to sample is selected and a fracture target zone is determined based upon the log results. A hydraulic flow containment system having a plurality of pumps is provided that isolates fracture fluid in the target zone from the well bore fluid. A differential flow logging system having a plurality of flow devices is disposed above and below the target zone to confirm isolation of the target zone. A fluid sample is collected from the isolated target zone using one of the pumps located in the target zone.

A sampling system is described for the collection of specific discrete zone depth dependent fluid samples in long open hole non cased bedrock wells or long screen sections of wells without mixing and drawing of fluid from different zones depths . The sampling system couples differential logging of vertical flow with hydraulic control of flow to surgically remove the well fluid samples.

A differential coupled flow logging system hereinafter flow logging system is illustrated in . The flow logging system allows for synchronous recording of vertical flow differences in an open borehole . In the exemplary embodiment shown in the flow logging system uses synchronous measurements of vertical flow from two vertically positioned flow devices and in the well bore to facilitate estimation of vertical flow indicated by arrows from discrete fractures A to C in bedrock within an aquifer. Fracture flow such as fracture flow from the fracture B enters the borehole and mixes with fluid from the well bore .

The flow devices and are attached to surface instrumentation that interprets vertical velocity up and down the borehole . The flow devices and can be for example flowmeters that synchronously measure vertical flow or dual tracer devices that track direction of flow. Synchronous measurement of vertical flow using flowmeters reduces the error associated with the repositioning of a single flowmeter during logging caused by transient hydraulics and small fluctuations in ambient and pumped flow. Differential flowmeter logging can be accomplished using for example heat pulse flowmeters Hess 1982 incorporated herein by reference and borehole dilution logging Pitrak et al. 2007 incorporated herein by reference . Estimates of discrete fracture flow can be facilitated using the analytical solution FLASH developed by the U.S. Geological Survey Day Lewis et al. 2011 incorporated herein by reference . Alternatively flow logging can be done using emplaced tracer devices rather than flowmeters to determine vertical flow directions.

In rates of extraction from the pumps and are adjusted to create stagnation or minimal velocity flow zones i.e. hydraulic zones between adjacent vertically positioned pumps. These hydraulic zones contain the vertical extent of the fluid source of the target sample zone . In the embodiment shown in the waste pump extracts well fluid and the sample pump extracts well fluid and as well as fluid from the target fracture B and the waste pump extracts well fluid and . The rates of extraction of the pumps and are adjusted to create stagnation zones and between the sample pump and the waste pumps and respectively. The principles of hydraulic boundaries and zones including no flow zones are described in image well theory Ferris et al. 1962 incorporated herein by reference .

Alternatively isolation of the target zone is also achievable by inducing divergent flow away from the target zone using a sampling system as shown in which prevents mixing of borehole fluid with fluid in the target zone . In the embodiment of the upper and lower waste pumps and are set at flowrates greater than the rate of the sample pump causing a predominance of vertical flow and to move away from the target zone excluding the fluid captured by the sample pump .

The duration of extraction of the waste pumps and and the sample pump is dependent on the total pump rate from the three pumps the flow rate from the fracture B the summation of flow rates from all other fractures excluding the target fracture B in the borehole and the amount of fluid in the target zone . A minimum of about 2.3 times the volume of fluid in the target zone is evacuated prior to sampling. These same principles with regard to flow in the target zone and flow outside of the target zone can be used to deploy the pumping systems and in long screen wells set in unconsolidated aquifers.

The flow logging tool and the multilevel pumping system are combined to yield the sampling system that generates the stagnation zones and as illustrated in . Also the flow logging tool and the multilevel pumping system are combined to yield the sampling system that generates the diverging flows as illustrated in . The sampling systems and allow for hydraulic containment and isolation of flow from discrete fractures using the multilevel pumping systems and while isolation is confirmed with the differential flow logging system .

Prior to deployment of the sampling systems and conventional flowmeter logging ambient and stressed is performed to identify locations of fractures in the geologic formation surrounding the well and to determine their flow rates and the total extraction rate of the well . Additional differential logging can be done to better quantify flow from the fractures. The sampling systems and are configured based on the fracture flow distribution which is used to design the proper pump rates of the waste and sample pumps and to create either the stagnation zones and or the divergent i.e. outward flow . The fracture to be sampled is selected. For purposes of illustration the fracture B has been selected in the embodiment shown in . A preliminary extraction zone is determined which is the distance between the target fracture B and the next adjacent upper and lower fractures A and C. The precise target sample zone is determined after the positioning of the lower and upper waste pumps and and the formation of the stagnation zones and between the waste pumps and and the sample pump of or the formation of the divergent flow conditions as shown in . The target sample zone is defined as the borehole capture zone of the sample pump . Under divergent conditions the target zone is restricted to the location of the sample pump .

The pumps and flow devices are then positioned in the well . The lower waste pump is positioned in the well below the target fracture B and between the target fracture B and the next adjacent lower fracture C. The exact placement distance of the lower waste pump below the target fracture B is determined based on well hydraulics including fracture inflow rates and rates of extraction of the waste and sample pumps and . The lower flow device is positioned between the lower waste pump and the target fracture B.

The sample pump is positioned adjacent to the target fracture B. The upper flow device is positioned between the sample pump and the planned position of the upper waste pump . The upper waste pump is positioned above the sample pump and the upper flow device between the sample fracture B and the next adjacent upper fracture A. The exact placement distance of the upper waste pump above the sample pump is determined based on well hydraulics including fracture inflow rates and rates of extraction of the waste and sample pumps and . For long screen wells the sample pump is positioned at a desired depth within a selected screen interval target zone and the waste pumps are set based on the volumetric flow of the well screen anticipated extraction rate of the waste pumps and and the length of the well screen.

The upper waste pump is set a minimum distance of about 3 feet above the sample pump to a maximum distance of about 1 foot below the upper fracture A. The lower waste pump is set a minimum distance of about 3 feet below the sample pump to a maximum distance of about 1 foot above the lower fracture C. The Theis equation Theis 1935 incorporated herein by reference can be modified to further constrain the locations of the waste pumps and within the minimum and maximum specified distances by calculating a distance between the waste pumps based upon the expected volume pumped in a desired sample time subtracted by the estimated Darcian radial flow over the target zone during that same sample time divided by 4.6 times the volume of fluid along the distance in the borehole .

The extraction flow rate of the sample pump is set at a rate equal to or less than the flow rate of the flow from the target fracture B as determined from the conventional and differential flowmeter logging. The extraction flow rates from the upper and lower waste pumps and are initially set at the total extraction flow rate of the well minus the extraction flow rate of the sample pump . The rate of extraction from each waste pump is based on the position of the pump relative to the well opening the flow rate of the target fracture B and the summed inflow rates of the non target fractures A and C as determined by the conventional flowmeter logging. The flow rate of the upper waste pump is the sum of the upper borehole flow and the flow rate of the lower waste pump is the sum of the lower borehole flow.

When initiating the pump sequence the waste pumps and are turned on first. The extraction flow rate of the lower waste pump is set initially at the summation of flow from the lower borehole. The extraction flow rate of the upper waste pump is set initially at the summation of flow from the upper borehole. After stabilization of the extraction rates from the waste pumps and the sample pump is turned on at the extraction rate commensurate with the flow rate from the target zone . The stagnation zones and are created between the waste pumps and and the sample pump by minimizing vertical flow between the middle sample pump and the upper and lower waste pumps and . After stabilization of the stagnation zones and isolation of the target sample zone is confirmed using the differential flow logging system . Isolation is confirmed under stagnation conditions when there is no flow between the target sample zone and the zones above and below the target sample zone .

Alternatively confirmation that the borehole fluid is not mixing with the sample fluid can be aided by performing injection tracer tests to ensure that the sample fluid is clear from the injected tracer. The exact composition of the injected tracer such as whether it contains a dye is based on the compounds of interest the field geochemistry and whether a dual tracer device was used to confirm vertical flow. The injection tests are performed to insure that the target sample zone is minimally disturbed either by balancing injection with additional extraction or by applying a non fluid tracer e.g. heat . Also confirmation of the stagnation zones can be determined using a borehole dilution technique which involves creating tracer free zones in the target zone after an initial uniform tracer under pre pump conditions is introduced into the entire length of the borehole .

For example the tracers can be frozen in porous bottles and deployed between the sample pump and the waste pumps and . Once in the well bore the tracers thaw and slowly seep out of the bottles. The direction and rate of vertical flow are confirmed by tracking the presence of the tracers in the fluid extracted from the three pumps in the surface instrumentation . The presence of the tracers in the waste pumps and confirms flow away from the target zone and thus no mixing of the borehole water at the target zone . The target zone is recharged only by the flow from the targeted fracture .

Preferably the pump rates are adjusted to create stagnation zones and between the waste pumps and and the sample pump . However divergent flow away from the sample fracture B also facilitates the collection of discrete samples that do not contain mixed borehole water. Isolation of the target sample zone is confirmed using the flow logging system . Isolation is confirmed under divergent conditions when there is vertical flow away from the target zone i.e. there is no downward flow above the target zone or upward flow below the target zone . If tracers are used the absence of tracers in the sample pump and the presence of tracers in the waste pumps and prove that the target zone is isolated from borehole mixing.

Sample collection of the extracted fluid from the sample pump begins after evacuating a minimum volume of fluid equivalent to about 2.3 times the volume of the borehole between the waste pumps and . Samples are collected from the target sample zone using the sample pump while extracting well fluid above the target zone using the upper waste pump and below the target zone using the lower waste pump . The chemistry of the fluid extracted from the sample pump and the waste pumps and is monitored to aid in identifying capture of fluid from the different zones in the well and in the confirmation of tracer movement if dual tracer devices are deployed.

For purposes of hydraulic isolation and sampling from the target sample zone either no flow above and below or vertical flow outward or away diverging flow from the target sample zone produces a representative sample collected by the sample pump from the fracture flow while well fluid above the upper stagnation zone in or above the target zone in is extracted by the upper waste pump and well fluid below the lower stagnation zone in or below the target zone in is extracted by the lower waste pump . Thus the zone above the target zone is a no flow or up flow zone and the zone below the target zone is a no flow or down flow zone.

While the sampling system described herein has been described with respect to sampling in discrete heterogeneous fracture networks it has applications as a zone specific sampling system using hydraulic containment in a variety of geologic formations. The sampling system works in wells with long open holes non cased or long screen sections as well as in short open hole or short screen sections. In screened wells the use of external filter packs outside the screen precludes the use of packers to isolate fluid because of short circuiting whereas hydraulic containment can still be effective in isolating target zones. Also discrete sampling with the sampling system can be used in the identification of emerging contaminants because of its ability to reduce mixing and dilution of groundwater. Further the sampling system can be used as a screening tool to assist in the deployment of well screens in open boreholes. This helps ensure proper well screen placement based on vertical chemistry differences.

The sampling system described herein provides several advantages over conventional zone specific sampling systems. For example it uses hydraulic control to surgically extract water from discrete sample zones in wells minimizing vertical mixing within the open hole bedrock well or long screened section of well to obtain non mixed homogenous samples that are representative of the sample zone. Also the sampling system is not cumbersome to use. It does not require the use of heavy duty equipment e.g. cable tools and rigs to run or physical containment devices such as packers and thus can be deployed quickly and efficiently allowing for quicker data collection of discrete chemistry. In addition in boreholes that have undergone hydraulic fracturing such as boreholes set in the Marcellus Shale Formation the borehole surfaces are rough which prevents the use of conventional zone specific sampling that relies on physical containment e.g. use of packers through sealing of the target zone. Hydraulic containment utilized by the sampling system described herein is unaffected by rough irregular surface walls of the boreholes and can be used as an effective sampling system to isolate flow and collect discrete zone specific samples.

Collection of groundwater samples in open bedrock boreholes is problematic because of the nature of flow in fractures. The sampling system described herein allows samples to be collected in an efficient manner and therefore offers significant cost benefits to the groundwater and petroleum communities as well as the ability to determine solute transport in fractured rock aquifers and the effect of fracture connectivity on borehole flow and sampling such as whether fracture connections outside the borehole can be identified.
