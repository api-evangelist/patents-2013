This application is a continuation in part of and claims priority to prior filed U.S. Provisional application Ser. No. 61 701 976 filed Sep. 17 2012 and titled A System and Method for Providing Loyalty Based Virtual Objects Across Various Media Including Gaming Devices .

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The field of the invention relates to systems and method directed toward development of customer user loyalty. More particularly it relates to systems and method which use configurable virtual objects and associable attributes to reflect and stimulate customer user interaction with an enterprise such as a casino enterprise. In a further embodiment the acquisition of virtual objects are used to qualify the collector for benefits such as promotions and progressive jackpot games.

Many enterprises such as commercial enterprises including chain stores grocery stores airlines and casinos strive to engender loyalty and return business with their customers users or players. It has been known to provide loyalty cards to customers who are for grocery stores often entitled to customer discounts. In exchange the store receives customer purchase information for the purpose of business intelligence marketing and a degree of customer loyalty. Similarly in modern casino enterprises which may include several physical casino venues players may enroll in the casino loyalty program. The casino enterprise includes a communication network by which an operator can monitor player activity such as wagers jackpots games played and the like. Players are identified typically through the player s use of a loyalty card having a machine readable stripe. For a brick and mortar casino an example of such a system is the Bally CMS system sold by Bally Technologies Inc. of Las Vegas Nev. These systems interface with card readers at gaming terminals and table game input devices to provide the aforesaid tracking functions. Based upon the data collected the casino can provide bonuses to players in the way of benefits and incentives to retain a player s loyalty by for example awarding comps in the form of cash back discounts for goods lodging services and gifts or points which can be exchanged for the foregoing. The tracking can be restricted to a single enterprise venue or can be on a national basis such as described in Boushy U.S. Pat. No. 7 419 427 issued Sep. 2 2008 and titled National Customer Recognition System and Method the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. The level of comps available to the player is often related to the player s rating which acts to quantify the value of the player to the casino. A higher rated player is one who spends and gambles more than a lower rated player. A higher rated player is entitled to more valuable or additional comps.

Many casino enterprises also have a presence in electronic media such as by having commercial websites and social media sites accessible via the Internet or through broadband communication devices such as cellular telephones smart phones tablet computers and other devices.

There is an ever growing need to enhance the loyalty of customers players in addition to offering such existing loyalty programs. There is a need to foster loyalty between players and the enterprise through activity associated with the brick and mortar casino venue as well as through associated electronic media. There is further a need to encourage a player or user to return to the brick and mortar physical venue inasmuch as the physical presence at the venue can often lead to the player or user spending money for entertainment food and beverage merchandise or other goods and services.

There is a need to provide entertainment in association with the objective of enhancing player loyalty. Entertainment may be by means of compelling graphics and animations prizes and awards.

In electronic media such as the Internet and broadband communications social networks have been developed such a Twitter Facebook etc. In this media form it is known to provide virtual pets . As understood the user signs up for and selects receives a virtual pet. The user is then required or requested to engage in activity through which the virtual pet may be nurtured or provided for. There are other virtual environments such as Farmville and the like.

It would be advantageous for an enterprise to use virtual objects to engender brand loyalty encourage customer user commercial and non commercial activity provide promotions provide entertainment packages and provide the customer user with an accessible virtual object. It would further be advantageous if such virtual objects could be used as a vehicle to encourage return visitation to the enterprise brick and mortar facility ies . Further it would be advantageous to provide in a brick and mortar or online casino environment qualification to one or more progressive jackpot games responsive to the player s collection of one or more virtual objects.

It would be advantageous if the virtual object would have associable attributes such as accessories fixtures equipment stock upgrades or the like and which attributes are available based upon the user player engaging in certain activity ies as desired by the enterprise.

It would also be advantageous to provide a data structure for storing data for derivation of virtual objects and a mechanism by which the enterprise could purchase data packages from developers to enhance the virtual objects and accessories available.

It has also been known to provide linked progressive jackpots to players playing games. Some examples include non symbol based progressive jackpots such as described in Acres et al U.S. Pat. No. Re. 37 885 titled Method for operating Networked Linked Gaming Devices re issued Oct. 15 2002 the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. According to this reference the operator preselects less than all of the machines on the network and the network tracks the activity of the presented machines. Players play the gaming machines. When a command is sent over the network a bonus is paid to at least one of the machines. Acres et al U.S. Pat. No. 5 655 961 titled Method for Operating Networked Linked Gaming Devices issued Aug. 12 1997 the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference teaches contributing a percentage of the amount wager at gaming machines to a bonus pool i.e. a progressive jackpot pool. The triggering of the payment of money from the bonus pool can be an event such as when the bonus pool reaches a predetermined amount. Eligibility to win a mystery bonus award can be based upon time of play max bet and or recognition of a player s card at the machine as described in Olsen U.S. Pat. No. 6 217 448 issued Apr. 17 2001 and titled Controller based Linked Gaming Machine Bonus System the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. These bonus schemes are not tied to any symbols at the gaming machine and their triggering is a surprise or mystery to the player. Another type of mystery progressive jackpot has a trigger as described in Kelly et al U.S. Pat. No. 8 353 761 titled Progressive Game and Processing System Thereof which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.

Another type of non symbol based progressive award is as described in Olive U.S. Pat. No. 7 582 014 titled Slot Machine Game and System With Improved Jackpot Feature issued Sep. 1 2009 and Torango U.S. Pat. No. 6 592 460 titled Progressive Wagering System and issued Jul. 15 2003 the disclosures of which is incorporated by reference. These disclosures describe another form of a progressive jackpot game where with each play the player is participating in a behind the scenes or hidden lottery. Based upon the amount of the wager for the primary a k a base game the player can increase their odds of triggering a jackpot prize.

It has been taught that some progressive jackpot games have eligibility requirements such as wagering the maximum amount or wagering a certain amount over time to participate in the bonus pool. For example in Acres U.S. Pat. No. 6 319 125 titled Method Apparatus for Promoting Play on a Network of Gaming Devices issued Nov. 20 2001 the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference to become eligible to participate a player must be identified as by their loyalty card and must play a game every ten seconds. In many such systems the eligibility is either determined by the player making a maximum wager or wagering a minimum amount during a session of several plays such as within a short temporal period of for example 20 seconds. Most typically eligibility does not persist over different gaming sessions or several days. By gaming session what is meant is the session where a player plays a gaming machine without significant interruption. Insertion and removal of the player s loyalty card may define a session as well as a significant interruption in play signifying that the player has discontinued gaming or left the casino.

Schneider et al U.S. Pat. No. 5 639 088 titled Multiple Events Award System issued Jun. 17 1997 discloses a linked network of video poker games where the player over several sessions attempts to record over several rounds sessions a set of outcomes such as all thirteen fours of a kind.

In Luciano Jr. U.S. Pat. No. 8 313 371 titled Method and Apparatus for Awarding Component Prizes in a Gaming Environment issued Nov. 201 2012 assigned to the assignee of the present invention and the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference there is a disclosed a game where for certain outcomes the player can win a virtual component of for example a tractor. When a player wins a virtual wheel in a paid for primary game outcome that win results in a coupon or virtual record. When the player has won all of the designated tractor components the player is entitled to the prize which may in fact be a lawn tractor.

Schneider and Luciano teach a persistent effect where the player can work toward a goal over several if not numerous gaming sessions and where the individual wins a four of a kind or a virtual tractor component are saved for the player. A drawback is that the outcomes are outcomes for paid for primary games. That is the player must risk wagers as in a typical pay to play P2P game to obtain the desired outcomes. It would be advantageous to provide a feature which does not require the player to risk a wager and where the player can accumulate virtual items such as virtual objects and accessories accoutrements features of benefits with the user player can interact such as a virtual pet or virtual environment like a virtual farm or city. It would also be advantageous to enable the player through earned or provided free games to be able to work through acquiring virtual objects to qualify for one or more features such as progressive prizes.

There is therefore provided in accordance with one aspect of the present invention improved systems and methods directed toward fostering user loyalty and encouraging repeat visits to a physical venue of an enterprise and providing marketing and advertising opportunities through various media and sources such as the Internet and broadband and commercial websites and social media sites. According to a further aspect of the present invention progressive prizes may be offered to users players.

Toward this end and according to one aspect of the present invention improved systems and methods are set forth for an enterprise of the type having at least one physical venue such as a brick and mortar business resort or casino resort. Located within the venue are terminals each of which has a video display. For example a store may have cash out terminals or user interactive kiosks. In a casino the terminals may be gaming devices terminals interfaces at live table games kiosks and intra property portable devices such as gaming tablets. A host server is configured for tracking a user s interaction with terminals. For example in a store at check out the cashier terminal or self checkout terminal interfaces with the host to track use and other data such as items purchased. In a casino venue the host would track the player s gaming at gaming device such as slot machines video lottery terminals and live table games. Information such as coin in jackpots cash outs plays and the like are modernly tracked in casino enterprises. Other commercial activity or commerce such as the purchase of goods and services may be tracked as well. In other business enterprises the user s purchases site visits or other interactions e.g. surveys inquiries etc. may be tracked. A communication network provides for communication between the terminals and the host server. A data structure stores a data file for each player user. The data file may be anonymous and accessible by the anonymous user player through a personal identification number PIN or biometric identifier. The data file may also be for an identified user player that has enrolled and provided at least identification information. Identifiers such as a PIN or a loyalty card may be used to identify the user player. The data file may include personal biographical information electronic funds promotional credits loyalty points or the like. In one aspect of the present invention an improvement is provided which includes a data resource storing data corresponding to one or more graphical virtual objects and graphic display packages associated with said object one or more of the data resource and user s file storing data associating a virtual object with a user. As but some examples the virtual objects may be virtual pets such as a dog cat parrot bear or monkey virtual gems gold nuggets virtual race car virtual rock band virtual sports team etc. or perhaps a person such as a fisherman or scuba diver or a virtual environment such as a farm ranch home or virtual business. In an embodiment the virtual objects have a plurality of virtual attributes or accoutrements associable with the virtual object s . The attributes accoutrements may be related to the virtual object s condition such for a virtual pet attributes of hunger thirst fatigue energy happiness sadness or accessories accoutrements such as clothing toys collars leashes treats houses equipment stock tools or upgrades. For a virtual environment the attributes may be crops livestock inventory buildings equipment or the like as but an example. Devices enable a user to remotely access the data in their associated file via a remote interface device such as a computer laptop or cellular device to view renditions of their virtual object data at said remote interface device display. One or more of the host and a feature server are configured to store data representing virtual currency awarded to the user and to enable the user to redeem virtual currency to alter the data corresponding to the user s virtual object by at least one acquisition of a virtual object acquisition an attribute assigned to a virtual object and acquisition a virtual accessory for a virtual object.

As but an example where a player at a casino has obtained a virtual pet dog and has earned virtual currency though intercourse with the casino to purchase a virtual collar and leash the virtual currency is redeemed to purchase the virtual pet collar and leash which are then are associated with the player s data file. When the player inserts their player card at a gaming machine graphics software displays the virtual pet dog with its collar and leash to the player and perhaps an endearing animation.

Apparatus is provided to enable a user player to remotely access the data in their associated file to access their virtual object and current attributes at a remote device display i.e. remote from the physical brick and mortar business. The remote device may be a home computer tablet computer cellular telephone smart phone or the like. Providing remote access enables the user player to view and or interact with their virtual object outside of the enterprise physical venue.

One or both of the feature server and host server are configured to display the virtual object and current attributes at a user display terminal display at the physical venue. For example when a player goes to the casino enterprise physical casino property and interacts with a gaming device their virtual object with its current attributes may be displayed to the player periodically on player request at player cash out or continually. As but an example where the virtual object is a virtual pet dog the virtual dog may be displayed at a location on a gaming device display or associated display and may interact to a degree with the player such as by celebrating jackpots barking to draw the player s attention to a message communicating with the player or the like to instill a bonding between the player and his her virtual pet.

One or more of the host and feature server are configured to store virtual currency awarded to the user player. The virtual currency may be awarded for commercial activity such as purchases gaming or may be awarded by the enterprise as a comp reward for past commercial activity or to incentivize future business. For example in a casino enterprise venue when a player identified by the host server plays a gaming device virtual currency would be awarded based upon wagering activity or in exchange for comp points awarded to the player. Virtual currency could be awarded for other consideration such as hotel visits spa or restaurant purchases and visits to the enterprise s website or social media site completing a survey or the like.

The feature server is configured to enable the user player to redeem virtual currency to restore or acquire attributes accoutrements for their virtual object. To encourage the user player to visit the enterprise physical venue virtual currency may be of several types or classes and have different purchasing power or attributes. For example virtual currency earned by P2P pay to play gaming may be designated as first class virtual currency whereas those awarded by the casino for other activity may be designated as second virtual currency. Certain attributes accoutrements may only be available for acquisition redeeming first class virtual currency. For example where the virtual object is a virtual pet attributes such as happiness or satisfaction of hunger or thirst may only be able to be acquired or restored through redemption of first class virtual currency whereas certain other attributes may be acquired restored using second class virtual currency. Alternatively there is a single class of virtual currency but some attributes accoutrements may only be acquired or restored through redemption of virtual currency at a terminal at the physical brick and mortar casino. For example attributes such as happiness or satisfaction of hunger or thirst may only be able to be acquired through redemption at the physical casino venue.

In an embodiment the user player is able to download an application to their remote device to enable them to interact with their virtual object or otherwise remotely interact with their virtual object such as live streaming. The enterprise may offer attributes for acquisition e.g. an accessory store for virtual pets. The user player may redeem virtual currency to acquire attributes for their object such as purchasing a new collar for their virtual pet. The user player may also interact with their virtual pet assisted by animation sequences. The feature server and or cloud server or other source provides executable code to enable the interaction. For example a user player may use a touch screen on their smart phone to touch their virtual pet and executable code streamed or resident in the downloaded application provides animation to simulate scratching or tickling of the pet.

In an embodiment a secondary game and or promotion may be conducted based upon the users players acquisition of objects and or accessories. As but an example the virtual object may be a virtual pet store and the promotion and or secondary game revolves around the users players earning virtual currency to purchase pets for the store. The first user s player s to complete their store and acquire all of the pets for sale win a prize or are entered into a promotion.

An advantage of the foregoing to the enterprise is that the acquisition of and interaction with the object drives loyalty between the user player and the enterprise. When the player is not at the venue and is remotely interacting with the object the user player associates the object with the enterprise. Advertising offers and promotions can be sent to the users players in association with their object. The system graphics may alter the object over time to entice the user player to visit the enterprise to restore the vitality to their object. The enterprise may also give incentives such as virtual cash to market to the users players and enable them to acquire attributes accoutrements fort their object.

Where the enterprise is a casino many casinos provide comp points to players related to their wagering activity. These points are used in exchange for dining entertainment and in some casinos can be exchanged for cash. As such awarded comp points represent a liability to the casino. It would be beneficial if the casino could retire comp points not only through tradition exchange for meals services cash but also to exchange for virtual objects accessories or accoutrements of the type described above. For example a player having comp points could remotely exchange them through their interaction with their virtual object on their cellular phone to purchase for example accessories for their pet.

In another aspect of the present invention the acquisition of virtual objects accessories or accoutrements may provide a basis for a player to become eligible for certain features or benefits. As but an example where the enterprise is a casino players may be entitled to participate in promotions and or progressive jackpot games after they have acquired one or more virtual objects. As an illustrative example and not be way of limitation the feature server including executable code is in communication with one or more of the data resource and the player s file. While at the casino enterprise venue i.e. brick and mortar casino the player s commerce with the casino such as wagering on slot machines or table games or purchasing goods or services entitles the player to free plays of a secondary game. Where the player is playing a slot machine periodically or routinely a free play secondary slot machine game is displayed to the player for example at a secondary display or at a picture in picture display at the main game display. The secondary game provides winning and losing outcomes. For a winning outcome the player is awarded a virtual object such as a virtual dog. The secondary slot machine game may have symbols corresponding to the virtual dog and other virtual animals such as a parrot monkey bear cat or the like. Free secondary games may be awarded for play of a P2P game as promotions or even in exchange for casino provided comp points. The object of the secondary game is for the player to acquire the complete set of virtual animals. This may take a single gaming session or gaming sessions over several days weeks or months. As the items of the virtual set are acquired the player s file is appropriately updated. Once the player has acquired the required set the player is then qualified for a feature such as a progressive jackpot game or a system derived progressive applied to the P2P base slot machine game they are playing or their table game. Once qualification is established contributions from the wagers to play the primary slot machine game or table game are made to the progressive. The progressive may also be funded with marketing dollars alone or in combination with P2P coin in contribution. When a progressive jackpot win is triggered all or a portion of the prize is provided to the winning player s . The trigger may be based upon the jackpot pool reaching a determined amount or other event such as coin in the cumulative amount bet on P2P games on the progressive network coin out the cumulative amount paid out to players on P2P games on the progressive network or running in the background and at the system level a lottery or draw conducted at selected time increments or with each wager or a modified quasi lottery or draw where the lottery draw is conducted at time slices e.g. every few seconds and where the pool of lottery numbers is reduced with each drawing until the trigger number e.g. 1 is selected. Once the award is triggered the winner may be randomly selected from the participating gaming machines. Other triggers could be used as well.

The player may earn free secondary games remotely or even virtual animals to complete their set. For example in social media if a user player invites ten friends to sign up for the promotion they may be awarded a virtual animal. Virtual animals toward qualification may also be earned through commerce with the enterprise such as booking a stay responding to a promotion the purchase of merchandise liking the enterprise in social media or the like. Where permitted the player may remotely earn and or play secondary games the primary game and participate in the progressive.

In an embodiment user players may trade auction or sell a virtual object or accessory accoutrement to another user player. The establishment in this regard may host a virtual trading or auction house for such purposes and take a fee for any or some transactions.

In an embodiment certain virtual objects are rarely offered to entice users players to attempt to acquire those objects when offered. As a non limiting example a virtual bear may only be available to be won or acquired on Fridays between 9 am and 9 pm.

Various progressives can be established for players of different rating relative worth to the enterprise and the player once qualified may be qualified to participate in numerous progressives.

In some embodiments the random generator may be physically separate from gaming device for example it may be part of a central determination host system which provides random game outcomes to the game program. Finally EGM processor board under control of the game program and OS compares the outcome to an award schedule. The set of possible game outcomes may include a subset of outcomes related to the triggering and play of a feature or bonus game. In the event the displayed outcome is a member of this subset EGM processor board under control of the game program and by way of I O Board may cause feature bonus game play to be presented on the primary game display and or any secondary display s .

Predetermined payout amounts for certain outcomes including feature game outcomes are stored as part of the game program. Such payout amounts are in response to instructions from EGM processor board provided to the player in the form of coins credits or currency via I O board and a pay mechanism which may be one or more of a credit meter a coin hopper a voucher printer an electronic funds transfer protocol or any other payout means known or developed in the art.

In various embodiments the game program is stored in a memory device not shown connected to or mounted on the gaming motherboard. By way of example but not by limitation such memory devices include external memory devices hard drives CD ROMs DVDs and flash memory cards. In an alternative embodiment the game programs are stored in a remote storage device. In an embodiment the remote storage device is housed in a remote server such as a downloadable gaming server. The gaming machine may access the remote storage device via a network connection including but not limited to a local area network connection a TCP IP connection a wireless connection or any other means for operatively networking components together. Optionally other data including graphics sound files and other media data for use with the gaming terminal are stored in the same or a separate memory device not shown . Some or all of the game program and its associated data may be loaded from one memory device into another for example from flash memory to random access memory RAM .

In one or more embodiments peripherals may be connected to the system over Ethernet connections directly to the appropriate server or tied to the system controller inside the gaming terminal using USB serial or Ethernet connections. Each of the respective devices may have upgrades to their firmware utilizing these connections.

GMU includes an integrated circuit board and GMU processor and memory including coding for network communications such as the G2S game to system protocol from the Gaming Standards Association Las Vegas Nev. used for system communications over the network. As shown GMU may connect to the card reader shown as in through bus and may thereby obtain player information and transmit the information over the network through bus . Gaming activity information may be transferred by the EGM Processor Board to GMU where the information may be translated into a network protocol such as S2S for transmission to a server such as a player tracking server where information about a player s playing activity may be stored in a designated server database.

PID includes an integrated circuit board PID processor iView CPU and memory which includes an operating system such as Windows CE a player interface program which may be executable by the PID processor together with various input output I O drivers for respective devices which connect to PID processor and which may further include various games or game components playable on PTM or playable on a connected network server and PTM is operable as the player interface. PID connects to card reader shown as in through bus player tracking display shown as iView display in through video decoder and bus such as an LVDS or VGA bus.

As part of its programming the PID processor executes coding to drive player tracking display and provide messages and information to a player. Touch screen circuitry interactively connects PTM display and video decoder to PTM such that a player may input information and causes the information to be transmitted either on the player s initiative or responsive to a query. Additionally soft keys connect through bus to PID and operate together with the player tracking display to provide information or queries to a player and receive responses or queries from the player. PID in turn communicates over the CMS SMS network through Ethernet switch and busses and with respective servers such as a player tracking server.

PTMs are linked into the virtual private network of the system components in gaming terminal . The system components include the player tacking module e.g. Bally iVIEW device iView is a registered trademark of Bally Gaming Inc. PID EGM processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board . These system components may connect over a network to the slot management system such as a commercially available Bally SDS SMS and or casino management system such as a commercially available Bally CMP CMS .

The GMU system component has a connection to the base game through a serial SAS connection and is connected to various servers using for example HTTPs over Ethernet. Through this connection firmware media operating system software gaming machine configurations can be downloaded to the system components from the servers. This data is authenticated prior to installation on the system components.

The system components include the PTM processing board PID and game monitoring unit GMU . The GMU PID and PTM can be combined into one like the commercially available Bally GTM iVIEW device. This device may have a video mixing technology to mix the EGM processor s video signals with the iVIEW display onto the top box monitor or any monitor on the gaming device.

The PTM may also interface with a switcher and router device of the type described above. In such case instead of providing the PTM display the switcher and router device provides for the content normally display at the PTM display to be displayed at one or more of the primary or secondary displays .

In accordance with one or more embodiments is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel of a game program under control of gaming device EGM processor board . The game program uses gaming kernel by calling into application programming interface API which is part of game manager . The components of game kernel as shown in are only illustrative and should not be considered limiting. For example the number of managers may be changed additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention.

As shown in the example there are three layers a hardware layer an operating system layer such as but not limited to Linux and a game kernel layer having game manager therein. In one or more embodiments the use of an operating system layer such a UNIX based or Windows based operating system allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary low level interfaces which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade hardware upgrade or feature upgrade. The game kernel executes at the user level of the operating system layer and itself contains a major component called the I O board server . To properly set the bounds of game application software making integrity checking easier all game applications interact with gaming kernel using a single API in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well defined consistent interface as well as making access points to gaming kernel controlled where overall access is controlled using separate processes.

For example game manager parses an incoming command stream and when a command dealing with I O comes in arrow the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine decides what it needs from a device and sends commands to I O board server see arrow . A few specific drivers remain in operating system layer s kernel shown as those below line . These are built in primitive or privileged drivers that are i general ii kept to a minimum and iii are easier to leave than extract. In such cases the low level communications is handled within operating system layer and the contents passed to library routines .

Thus in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system layer which is why arrow is shown as having three directions between library routines and I O board server or between library routines and certain drivers in operating system layer . No matter which path is taken the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. Operating board server layer is kept as simple stripped down and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus each game cabinet or game machine may have an industry standard EGM EGM processing board connected to a unique relatively dumb and as inexpensive as possible I O adapter board plus a gaming kernel which will have the game machine unique library routines and I O board server components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences i.e. if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound the game application will be able make use of API to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound .

Game manager provides an interface into game kernel providing consistent predictable and backwards compatible calling methods syntax and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware including the freedom to not have to deal with low level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower level managers although lower level managers may be accessible through game manager s interface if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent callable object oriented interfaces to software managers of those components drivers game manager provides access to a set of high level managers also having the advantages of consistent callable object oriented interfaces and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino type games. Game manager providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional game application API as supported by the rest of game kernel thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.

Game manager may have several objects within itself including an initialization object not shown . The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine including other objects after game manager has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function the kernel s configuration manager is among the first objects to be started configuration manager has data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.

The high level managers of game kernel may include game event log manager which provides at the least a logging or logger base class enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger that is it is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The game event log manager s job is to log events in non volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up one embodiment will delete the oldest logged event each logged event will have a time date stamp as well as other needed information such as length providing space to record the new event. In this embodiment the most recent events will thus be found in the log space regardless of their relative importance. Further provided is the capability to read the stored logs for event review.

In accordance with one embodiment meter manager manages the various meters embodied in the game kernel . This includes the accounting information for the game machine and game play. There are hard meters counters and soft meters the soft meters may be stored in non volatile storage such as non volatile battery backed RAM to prevent loss. Further a backup copy of the soft meters may be stored in a separate non volatile storage such as EEPROM. In one embodiment meter manager receives its initialization data for the meters during start up from configuration manager . While running the cash in manager and cash out manager call the meter manager s update functions to update the meters. Meter manager will on occasion create backup copies of the soft meters by storing the soft meters readings in EEPROM. This is accomplished by calling and using EEPROM manager .

In accordance with still other embodiments progressive manager manages progressive games playable from the game machine. Event manager is generic like game event log manager and is used to manage various gaming machine events. Focus manager correlates which process has control of various focus items. Tilt manager is an object that receives a list of errors if any from configuration manager at initialization and during game play from processes managers drivers etc. that may generate errors. Random number generator manager is provided to allow easy programming access to a random number generator RNG as a RNG is required in virtually all casino style gambling games. Random number generator manager includes the capability of using multiple seeds.

In accordance with one or more embodiments a credit manager object not shown manages the current state of credits cash value or cash equivalent in the game machine including any available winnings and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization cash out manager using data from configuration manager sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations. During play a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager the same way all events are handled and using a call back posted by cash out manager cash out manager is informed of the event. Cash out manager updates the credit object updates its state in non volatile memory and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media there will typically be event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager until the dispensing finishes after which cash out manager having updated the credit manager and any other game state such as some associated with meter manager that needs to be updated for this set of actions sends a cash out completion event to event manager and to the game application thereby. Cash in manager functions similarly to cash out manager only controlling interfacing with and taking care of actions associated with cashing in events cash in devices and associated meters and crediting.

In a further example in accordance with one or more embodiments I O board server may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager calls the I O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I O board server receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM manager thread within I O board server to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of 8 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected will be sent as IPC messages to game manager . All of this processing is asynchronous.

In accordance with one embodiment button module within I O board server polls or is sent the state of buttons every 2 ms. These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed in which case the I O board server sends an inter process communication event to game manager that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments the gaming machine may have intelligent distributed I O which debounces the buttons in which case button module may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to get the button events and simply relay them to game manager via IPC messages. In still another embodiment the I O library may be used for pay out requests from the game application. For example hopper module must start the hopper motor constantly monitor the coin sensing lines of the hopper debounce them and send an IPC message to the game manager when each coin is paid.

In various embodiments any of the gaming devices may be a mechanical reel spinning slot machine video slot machine video poker machine video Bingo machine Keno machine or a gaming device offering one or more of the above described games including an interactive wheel feature. Alternately gaming devices may provide a game with an accumulation style feature game as one of a set of multiple primary games selected for play by a random number generator as described above. A gaming system of the type described above also allows a plurality of games in accordance with the various embodiments of the invention to be linked under the control of a group game server not shown for cooperative or competitive play in a particular area carousel casino or between casinos located in geographically separate areas. For example one or more examples of group games under control of a group game server are disclosed in Vallejo et al U.S. Published Application 2008 0139305 entitled Networked System and Method for Group Gaming filed on Nov. 9 2007 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

The gaming system among other functionalities such as slot accounting i.e. monitoring the amount wagered drop awards paid and other casino services includes the player tracking CMS CMP server and or data warehouse storing player account data. This data includes personal data for players enrolled in the casino players club sometimes referred to as a loyalty club. An example of the personal data is the player s name address SSN birth date spouse s name and perhaps personal preferences such as types of games preferences regarding promotions player rating level available player comp points points accumulated based upon commercial spend activity with the enterprise including gaming and which may be redeemed or converted into cash or merchandise and the like. As is known in the industry and according to the prior art at enrolment the player is assigned a created account in the player tracking CMS CMP server and is issued a player tracking card having a machine readable magnetic stripe.

It should be noted in connection to the above that the casino enterprise retains virtually the comp points in the players accounts. These comp points may be considered a liability inasmuch as some time in the future the player may seek to redeem or convert those points. Often such points may be redeemed converted by a player proactively requesting the cash value or though redemption and retirement of points used to pay for things such as meals shows merchandise or lodging. It would be advantageous if an additional means were provided to an enterprise to incentivize redemption and retirement of player comp points to decrease any comp point related carried liability.

When a player plays a gaming device or terminal hereinafter collectively referred to as gaming devices he she inserts their player tracking card into the card reader which communicates data to the CMS CMP server to accumulate loyalty comp points based upon the wagers wins of the player. For example a player may accumulate one comp point for each 5 wagered. Comp points may also be awarded as part of a promotion and for other commercial activity such as the purchase of goods or services.

The system may also include electronic transfer of funds functionality. For example a player having accumulated 100 at a gaming terminal may decide to cash out to play another gaming terminal . The player for example using the PTM to initiate communication with the system for example server to upload the value from the gaming terminal into an electronic account associated with the player s account. The player may choose to upload all or a portion of the funds the player s established electronic account. The system would prompt the player to enter their PIN or obtain biometrical confirmation as to the player s identity and upload the chosen amount to their account. When the player moves to another gaming terminal he she inserts their player loyalty card into the card reader to access their account. A prompt provides for the player to request funds from their account. Entering their PIN or biometric identifier the player can input the desired amount which is downloaded to their gaming terminal for play.

Portions of the present invention may be implemented or promoted by or through a system as suggested in . At is the gaming enterprise system which may be hosted at a casino property enterprise across several casino enterprises or by a third party host. As described above the gaming enterprise system has a network communication bus providing for communication between the gaming devices and various servers as described above with respect to FIGS. A B. To provide the functionality illustrated in a feature server such as a Bally Elite Bonusing Server is connected to the network communication bus for communication to the gaming system the gaming devices and the various servers and other devices as described above. Through a secure network firewall the feature server is in communication with a cloud computing storage service which may be hosted by the casino enterprise a licensed third party or if permitted by gaming regulators an unlicensed provider. For example the cloud service may be as provided by Microsoft Private Cloud Solutions offered by Microsoft Corp. of Redmond Wash. USA. The cloud service provides various applications which can be accessed and delivered to for example personal computers portable computing devices such as computer tablets personal digital assistants PDAs and cellular devices such as telephones and smart phones . For example the cloud service may provide and support the enterprise applications in association with the feature server . The cloud service may also facilitate the delivery of content to user players by supporting updates and advertising through the enterprise applications to the remote device user player. The cloud service includes security provide for secure communication with the cloud service between the player users and the cloud service and between the cloud service and the gaming enterprise system . Security applications may be through encryption the use of personal identification numbers PINS biometric identification location determination or other devices and systems. As suggested in the cloud service stores or accesses player user data retrieved from players users and from the gaming enterprise system and feature server .

The players users may access the cloud service and the applications and data provided thereby through the Internet or through broadband wireless cellular communication systems and any intervening sort range wireless communication such as WiFi. The players users may access the applications and data through various social media offerings such as Facebook Twitter Yelp MySpace or LinkedIn or the like.

As but an example a player user may have a player account with a casino enterprise. That account may include data such as the player s credit level their rating and their available comps. At their smart phone the player user sends a request to the cloud service perhaps through a previously downloaded application to request a the status of their available comps such as how many comp points they have and what may be available through redemption of those points e.g. lodging cash back meals or merchandise . The application for the request may present casino promotions graphics or other advertising to the player user. The application to support such a request would typically require the player user to enter a PIN or some other unique identifier such as a biometric identifier or tag. The cloud service forwards the inquiry to the feature server which in turn confirms the identification and retrieves the requested information from the data warehouse or player history database or player tracking CMS CMP server . The information is formatted by the cloud service application and delivered to the player user. The delivery may be formatted based upon the player user s device operating system OS display size or the like.

The cloud service may also host game applications to provide virtual instances of games for free promotional or where permitted P2P Pay to Play supported gaming. Third party developers may also have access to placing applications with the cloud service through for example a national operations center Bally NOC . A game software manufacturer such as Bally Gaming Inc. may also provide game applications on its own or on behalf of the casino enterprise.

Other media such as advertising notices such as an upcoming tournament promotions and surveys may also be provided to and through the cloud service . When a player user accesses the cloud service certain media may be delivered to the player user in a manner formatted for their application and device.

The cloud service enables the casino enterprise to market to and foster player loyalty. To drive such interaction various incentive programs may be employed including as described above users earning or being awarded mystery game chances which may be redeemed at their next visit to the casino enterprise or where permitted during play on their remote devices. As described herein the cloud service enables the user player to access and interact with their one or more virtual objects.

With reference to the present invention according to an embodiment includes the virtual object server configured to execute code to access maintain and arrange a virtual object library VOL data structure . The virtual object server and VOL data structure may be located in a casino enterprise venue or may be located remotely or may be hosted by third party such as a third party provider of the system and methods described herein. For example a third party provider may co locate the virtual object server and VOL data structure to service various enterprises. The virtual object server and VOL data structure may be embodied as one or more existing servers and data structures at the casino enterprise such as one or more of the of the servers and data warehouses described above with reference to FIGS. A B or as the feature server of .

The virtual object server and VOL data structure are configured to provide for the acquisition and data storage of graphics and software code related to one or more virtual objects and graphics renditions and animations. The virtual object server is in communication with the feature server to coordinate delivery of the content to the players as herein described. The virtual objects as defined herein are graphic objects which are typically animated representations of animals things or environments which preferably are suitable for outfitting with attributes such as accessories equipment or stock or which include an attribute which if not maintained will diminish over time. As but some examples the objects may be pets as shown in zoo animals race horses wild animals automobiles including race cars and classic cars musicians bands aircraft boats and yachts farms ranches business enterprises such as stores or casinos sports teams or people such as models astronauts or the like. These objects can be outfitted upgraded modified or stocked with attributes including accessories and accoutrements which can be acquired. Using a virtual pet dog as a non limiting example graphics are created or subject to creation by a software module to show the pet dog preferably in animated form or at least subject to occasional animation . The pet dog may be outfitted with attributes such clothes leashes collars toys tricks a dog house or training to upgrade the pet. Further the pet dog may have one or more attributes which can be altered over time. These attributes may be exhibited by graphics showing that the pet is hungry thirsty sad bored or lonely. Attributes may relate to maturing evolution or modification such as a kitten becoming an adult cat or tiger or a puppy maturing into an adult dog. A musician may evolve though acquisition of features objects from a novice to an accomplished artist. Using the virtual pet as an example the graphics packages stored at the VOL data structure are configured for rendering the pet when first initialized in a first state with a first set of attributes. These attributes may be youth happiness and very few if any accessory attributes. In an embodiment the pet may be configurable such as a user selecting from a library of dog images and defining the appearance such as color breed size or the like. A user may import an image of their pet to be incorporated into the virtual pet graphic package. As described herein users players according to the systems and methods of the present invention will be able to view and interact with their virtual pet and be awarded acquire trade for barter or restore attributes to their pet such as by re invigorating their pet satisfying their pet s hunger or thirst and acquiring accessories such as toys collars leashes dog houses etc. It should be understood that where the virtual object is for example a farm the user player will be able to view their object and acquire or restore attributes. The user player may acquire or be awarded livestock crops buildings equipment or the like. The farm may include an attribute which can diminish over time such as the health state of the livestock or crops or the condition of buildings or equipment.

Preferably each graphic data package for a virtual object stored at the VOL data structure is configured to include library data representing associable attributes such as accessories which can be awarded and or acquired as well as graphics to support rending of the object showing attribute changes such as the appearance after acquisition of an attribute i.e. the pet with a new collar or the re establishment or restoration of an attribute which has diminished i.e. a lonely pet transformed into a happy pet.

It should be understood that the recitation above of examples of virtual objects is not meant to be limited but is merely set forth by way of example.

As shown in the host enterprise such as a casino resort enterprise at develops or populates the virtual object related data through the virtual object server to the VOL data structure . The host may be provided with a software graphics development kit so their internal developers may create virtual object graphics packages perhaps related to the theme of the enterprise. Additionally and alternatively at third party developers may provide graphics packages as commissioned selected purchased licensed by the enterprise.

With reference to a casino enterprise embodiments the systems and methods of the present invention will now be described. The feature server is in communication with the virtual object server and casino SMS CMS servers and . The servers and data bases are configured for a player at a casino to establish a player account for the player which may include personal information and be associated with a security key such as a PIN personal identification number through which the player may acquire access to their account. As is known in the art when the player enrolls the player is typically issued a player loyalty card with a machine readable element. When a player plays a gaming device they insert their card into the device card reader which reads the machine readable element and associates the player s activity with their account. As is known in the art the casino may award comp points to a player based upon their level of play at the gaming device . Comp points are also awarded based upon the player s play of live games such as Blackjack Craps and like as well. The systems and methods as hereinafter described can also be used with anonymous un enrolled players who may simply choose to use a unique PIN or other identifier such as a biometric identifier rather than engage is a formal enrollment. Remotely the user player as described below accesses their file by using a PIN their account number and if required or available a portable device magnetic stripe reader of the type such as available through Square Inc. San Francisco Calif.

To provide a virtual object to a player according to an embodiment the player first selects their desired virtual object. For example the player may select the virtual object from a library of objects stored at the VOL Virtual Object Library data structure when they enroll with the casino loyalty award program. The player may also establish their virtual object at a gaming device or kiosk not shown . As but an example a kiosk within the casino enterprise physical venue may be linked to the feature server and or SMS CMS servers . The player at a card reader positions their card for reading to establish a communication link between the kiosk and their player account. The kiosk would offer for example one or more virtual objects for selection by the player. The player makes their selection and its configuration if available of their virtual object in its initial state which is then tied to the player s casino account. The tie may be simply a link pointer or tag to a data file at the VOL data structure or the graphics package application s may be stored at the player s account file. Various other links may be employed such as a combination of the foregoing or providing a link to a software or graphics package hosted elsewhere such as at the cloud service . As described herein the user player may also access a website or social network site associated with the casino enterprise from a remote device such as a PC laptop PDA or smart phone to open an account and initialize their selected virtual object or if they already have an account access their account and initialize their virtual object.

At in the user player engages in activities at the enterprise physical venues such as a casino. The activities may be gaming or purchasing of goods or services. One or more of the SMS CMS servers or feature server is configured to award virtual currency at when the user player engages in designated enterprise activities. According to an embodiment virtual currency may be of one of several classes. For example Class A virtual currency may be awarded for commercial activities at the casino venue such as gaming or purchasing of goods servers whereas Class B virtual currency may be awarded for other activities as well such as activities from remote devices. For example the user player may visit a social network site such as Facebook and be awarded class B virtual currency for liking the casino for responding to a survey or for playing entertainment games or the like. Where legal remote pay to play P2P gaming at a user player s computer or smart phone may earn the player class A and or class B virtual currency. The currency awarded or earned by a user player is associated with the player s account for later redemption. In addition to earning virtual currency through providing some type of consideration currency of any class may be awarded to players as part of a promotion for engaging is a specified activity such as playing a new game or dining at a specified restaurant or for frequenting a marketing partner such as purchasing tickets from a partnering airline test driving a vehicle at an auto dealership or the like. As shown in the awarded and earned virtual currency is stored in a data structure be it the SMS CMS servers or feature server and is associated or tied to the user s player s account. Award earning and redemption protocols are stored and executed by the feature server . The user player may also acquire virtual currency though purchase or redemption of comps awarded by the enterprise such as comp points awarded for gaming. Thus the casino may continue with its traditional awarding of comp points but provide a mechanism for the player to either convert the comp points to virtual currency class A and or class B or may enable the player to directly retire the comp points to acquire attributes accessories of accoutrements for their virtual pet.

As described herein the virtual currency awarded to or earned by a player is available for the player to redeem to purchase restore or renew attributes of the virtual object in this example their virtual pet dog. In an embodiment certain attributes may be acquired restored or renewed with only Class A virtual currency. As but an example when the virtual pet dog is first initialized it may be in a well fed happy condition such as a happy puppy. The attributes of emotion and or physical condition may be Class A attributes which can only be affected using Class A currency. If a player has not visited the casino venue for a period of time his her virtual pet dog may become sad and may speak to the owner beckoning the owner to redeem awarded earned Class A virtual currency to make the dog happy. As can be appreciated if the player has expended their Class A virtual currency a return visit to the casino may be suggested. Thus by providing different classes of virtual currency a player may be encouraged to visit the casino enterprise venue. In certain embodiments gaming credits on gaming machines or cash eCash or credit card payments may be used as substitutes for at least Class A virtual currency. Player comp points may also be used or converted to virtual currency. By using player comp points awarded separately from virtual currency the casino may encourage retirement of the carried liability of comp points through servicing the virtual pet. For example if a player does not have any Class A virtual currency and their pet is hungry the player may be able to convert their comp points or pay money to acquire virtual Class A currency which in turn can be used to restore the pet to a fed condition.

When the player accesses their virtual pet and the same is displayed at their remote device or gaming terminal the enterprise may introduce advertising to the player. Advertising can relate to goods service provided by the enterprise or may be for example paid for advertising from a third party such as an airline or automobile company.

In an embodiment in lieu of or in addition to providing different classes of virtual currency certain attributes may only be acquired restored at the casino venue. For example a single virtual currency is awarded or earned however it may be redeemed for certain class A attributes only at the casino venue. Thus if the virtual dog is sad the attribute of happiness may not be restored remotely.

As an example the player may win a 200 jackpot at the gaming device they are playing. This event is detected by the SMS CMS servers or feature server to which the gaming device is linked triggering the display of the virtual pet to call up a menu of available attributes such as a matrix of available attributes . The player may then redeem virtual currency comp points or exchange value such as by using game credits cash or value from an electronic account at to acquire or restore attributes or acquire accessories. The same description applies where the player logs into their account from a remote location.

The enterprise may send these messages to the player through media such as emails Facebook Twitter or the like.

In an embodiment users players are able to buy sell transfer virtual objects inter se. The transactions may be unrestricted subject to reconciliation at one or more of the feature server or player tracking server slot accounting server and or player history database . The enterprise may impose restrictions on transfers such as any transaction is subject to a fee paid with currency or currency equivalents and or virtual cash or comps points that one of the users players be of a certain rating level e.g. if there are rating tiers of Bronze lowest Silver and Gold only users players of the Silver Gold tiers may dispose or receive a transfer or the users players paying currency or currency equivalents and or virtual cash or comps points to be enrolled in a subscription level. Another restriction which may be imposed is that only certain categories of virtual objects may be transferred such as objects which are no longer available for acquisition from the virtual store.

In regards to the virtual objects in an embodiment the virtual store may be configured to offer certain objects on a limited edition basis. For example a virtual luxurious pet bed or a prize bull for a virtual ranch may only be offered at the virtual store at certain times and or be of a limited quantity. The enterprise issues messages to the users players to inform them of the limited nature or acquisition periods. By designating a virtual object as a limited edition would foster frenzy or rush by players to try to acquire the limited edition feature for their own collection or perhaps to sell to or trade with another user player. A virtual registry may be established by the enterprise to list current and prior limited edition virtual objects and or messages or a newsletter may issued periodically to inform the users players about the rare or limited edition objects. In this regard certain objects may be subject to expiration and retirement. That is for a designated virtual object such as a corn field for a virtual farm in the fall of the year this object will expire and be removed from the user s player s accounts who had previously acquired the same.

The evolution may be a feature which can be acquired though trade or purchase.

As stated herein virtual objects may be awarded by the enterprise based upon results from a random number generator drawing or lottery. For example a random number generator RNG may select from a set of outcomes each outcome relating to either an award of a virtual feature or a non award. The outcomes may be weighted such that the random award of a certain feature is more or less likely than others. Periodically or based upon events such as when a player inserts their player loyalty card the winning of a jackpot over a certain amount total wagers in a casino network or purchases at a retail store reaching a trigger amount or other predetermined or random trigger event the RNG drawing or lottery is conducted for one some or all of the users players and the awards of any virtual objects is made. As a non limiting example in a casino enterprise environment when a player inserts their player loyalty card into the card reader and the player is recognized by the system the RNG drawing or lottery is conducted for the player and the player is either awarded or not awarded a virtual object. As stated above certain virtual objects may have a remote chance of being awarded and hence become more rare or limited. This feature acts as a surprise award of a virtual object.

In an embodiment the establishment arranges a quest for earning certain virtual objects. In a casino enterprise a quest is established to play certain games X Y and Z at the venue or remotely within a twelve hour period. Earning the virtual object by completed the quest may entitle the player to participate in a drawing to win a car.

In an embodiment a casino enterprise may link the acquisition of one or more certain objects to an entitlement with respect to one or more primary games. As a non limiting example a player acquiring a virtual dog house for the pet may unlock a feature of certain primary games such as a secondary game different pay table for the primary game free spins or the like.

Turning to an embodiment is shown where the enterprise a third party or a third party on behalf of an enterprise hosts an auction site for the buying and selling of virtual object features accessories accoutrements. A host site is established in this example by a casino enterprise is established. The host site may be represented by an auction server and database. The host site is in communication with the feature server or player tracking server slot accounting server and or player history database shown as player history database for purposes of illustration. The player history database stores for each player data including this virtual object and the acquired attributes accessories accoutrements. The host site and its database includes a data structure storing data representing the virtual attributes accessories accoutrements for sale or trade and the player offering the attributes accessories accoutrements for sale or trade. The host site may be fashioned akin to EBAY QBI DS or the like. Each users establishes communication with the host site to either post their attributes accessories accoutrements for sale or trade or a proposal to acquire a certain attributes accessories accoutrements. When a user sells a virtual object to user a virtual settlement house settles the transaction and the host site reconciles the transfer by reconfiguring the users accounts at the player history database e.g. removing the feature from user s account and adding the feature to user s account. In this embodiment the enterprise operating the site may extract a fee from either the seller buyer or both. This feature enables users players to transfer virtual attributes accessories accoutrements inter se.

According to a further aspect of the present invention virtual object acquisitions may be used to qualify a user player for a feature such as for a casino enterprise to play for one or more progressive jackpots. For a non casino enterprise the feature may be a drawing for a promotional prize such as a new car or television. While the following description is directed to a casino enterprise and progressive games it should be understood that the concepts and feature could well be used by other enterprises such as department or grocery stores airlines car rental companies or the like.

According to an embodiment of the invention the adoption or acquisition of one or more virtual objects and or associated accessories is configured to determine qualification for a user player in the feature such as for a casino participation in a mystery progressive game. This feature may be used in addition to the virtual pet features described above or as a separate feature. That is the virtual pet and the acquisition of accessories as described above may be operated in parallel to the mystery progressive game.

Turning to an embodiment of the invention is described. According to this embodiment for a player to be qualified to participate in a feature of a mystery progressive prize the player must acquire through commerce or intercourse with the casino enterprise a set of virtual objects such as virtual animals or must assemble a complete virtual object. At the feature data structure such as maintained at feature server and or virtual object server and VOL library includes representations of the virtual animals and if desired associated animation packages. When the feature is installed the operator may select the nature of the virtual objects e.g. animals cars people personal property items and the rules regarding collection and qualification. As described above the feature server may interface with the player tracking server slot accounting server and or player history database . At the player logs in to open access to their account or to establish an account . The player may log in for example to the casino enterprise web based site or may log in at a gaming device or kiosk as by inserting their player loyalty card into the card reader . Log in may require the player input a PIN. At login through the feature server or via for example a cloud service access is made available to the enterprise system data structures and servers and virtual object server and VOL library shown collectively at required to support the functionality. Based upon the rules for qualification and the history of the collection of the virtual objects at a determination is made by for example the configured feature server whether the player has qualified for the mystery progressive feature. If he she has qualified at they are entitled to participate in the mystery progressive as described below. If the player has not yet qualified the feature server alone or in conjunction with the slot accounting server and or player history database at continues to query whether the player s activities to determine if the player has earned or been awarded a set item such as a virtual animal. If a virtual animal has been earned or awarded this event is recorded by at least the feature server at . The status of the earned awarded set may also be stored in one or more the enterprise servers data structures. Upon earning or being awarded a virtual animal at the feature server determines at according to the established rules for qualification if the required set has been acquired. If not the player continues to attempt to achieve the set at . If the set has been completed at and the player has qualified to participate in the mystery progressive feature as described below at the player in informed of qualification and at he she is entitled to participate in the mystery progressive feature.

At the player earns or is awarded the free play of a secondary game through which he she can win a virtual animal. The free game may be awarded based upon several criteria alone or in combination. For example the second game may be earned though playing X bought base games reaching an amount wagered on the play s of the primary game obtaining base game outcome s such winning over a certain amount consecutive losses of the base game registering credits at the game inserting a player loyalty card events such as the enterprise issuing a free second game to the player redemption of comps a voucher or coupon a jackpot won by another player or the like. When the free game has been awarded the scale indicates the award and may post a message inviting the player to touch the scale to play the free secondary game. In an embodiment the player may bank the free secondary game for later play and begin to earn another. The banked free game is recorded in one or more of the feature server player tracking server or at an appropriate database and is associated with the player account. Alternatively and additionally a ticket could be printed by the ticket printer including a machine readable element such as a bar code representing the entitlement to the free secondary game. One or more free secondary games may be awarded for an event of the type described above

At there is illustrated an example of the display when a free secondary game has been awarded or is being redeemed or played . The display of the base P2P primary game of may be sized to provide room for the secondary free game shown as a video three reel slot machine having symbols representing the virtual animals of the set. The feature server may stream the secondary game video to the display may select randomly or pseudo randomly the outcome and send a signal to the GMU and or PID which are configured to generate displays for the free secondary game . As but an example upon initiation of the play of a free secondary game at the feature server may select the result for the free game e.g. a three Parrot outcome as shown in . The feature server may then stream the outcome to the gaming device display or may send a signal to a local processor such as the GMU and or PID which in turn control the display to display the determined outcome. It should be noted that where there is no apparatus or method for displaying the free secondary game at the primary game display the results may be displayed at the PTM display or at the secondary display . Continuing with the tally of virtual animals toward the set and those yet to be acquired are displayed at the panel .

The secondary free game may be operated as a Class III or Class II type of game as defined by Title 25 United States Code 2701 et seq. and as is well known in the art. For example a data set representing a universe of outcomes for example five thousand award and non awarding outcomes may be randomly selected and associated with each player. For each free secondary game played and outcome is selected for display. The data set would have the desired population of winning outcomes for each virtual animal thus assuring that the player would fill out the required set within a maximum number of secondary games .

After the play or presentation of each free secondary game the feature server determines at if a virtual animal has been awarded. If so at the virtual animal awarded is added to the set. As described above with respect to if the set is complete at the player is now qualified for play of the progressive at .

As stated above the free secondary game is configured for the player to acquire outcomes such as the awarding of a virtual animal of the required set. The required set may be represented by a virtual race car where the player must complete the car from virtual parts to become qualified a virtual scuba diver who must be fully equipped or a virtual farm which must be completed with the acquisition of virtual livestock. The set may also be configured to reflect the theme of the enterprise or a seasonal theme e.g. a spring season theme.

As described above the user player when not at the enterprise such as the casino may access and view the current tally of the set of virtual objects. The enterprise may provide offers and promotions such as offering one virtual animal if the player visits the casino on a certain day at a certain time. To obtain their virtual animal the player must swipe their loyalty card at a gaming device or casino kiosk. In this way the casino can entice the player to return where they may engage in gaming or other commercial activity.

Once the player has obtained the required virtual items they are qualified for the mystery progressive. The mystery progressive pool may be funded with marketing dollars from the casino enterprise profits third party funds and or contributions from wagers on the primary game made by participating players. In an embodiment the pool is initially funded seeded with marketing dollars and thereafter contributions from the players funds the progressive growth of the pool as well as the amount for re seeding the next jackpot pool. In another embodiment the progressive jackpot may be or include a static jackpot component representing a fixed amount or item such as a new car. For a fixed amount pool the seed amount may come from marketing dollars. The progressive jackpot may be a combination of a progressive pool of money plus an item like a new car. Thus it should be understood that progressive jackpot as used herein includes static as well as jackpots which grow through contributions.

The progressive meter displays the current value of the jackpot. The trigger for the award of the jackpot may be based upon a random or predetermined event. Examples of mystery triggers for progressive jackpots include a coin in trigger which triggers the jackpot to at least the player whose contribution to the progressive pool caused the pool to achieve a randomly or pseudo randomly selected value X a games played trigger paid to the qualified player who has played the randomly pseudo randomly selected Yprimary game since the pool initiated a coin out trigger to the player who was paid on their base game sufficient to cause the aggregate amount paid out to qualified players coin out to meet or exceed a randomly pseudo randomly selected aggregate coin out amount the player winning a hidden lottery or pseudo lottery or drawing the qualified player who next plays a paid for base game when randomly pseudo randomly selected time since the first player qualified or after Z players have qualified or the like. In an embodiment where the trigger is a hidden drawing at random or predetermine time slices and as described in Kelly et al U.S. Pat. No. 8 353 761 titled Progressive Game and Processing System Thereof which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference a hidden drawing of one or more numbers is selected from for example a number pool of the numbers 1 N where 1 is determined to the trigger number. At each time slice draw the drawn number s are compared to the number 1 and if there is no match the drawn numbers may be deducted from the number pool. Thus the odds increase toward a winning draw with each draw. If in a draw the trigger number of 1 is selected the award is triggered. The feature server determines the gaming devices on the network where a the player is qualified i.e. has completed their set of virtual animals and b their P2P history qualifies the gaming device . P2P history qualification can be for example a maximum bet in the previous primary game play and at least five primary game plays including the play of any feature game within the past minute. Other qualifications can be adopted. For the group of qualified devices being played by qualified players the feature server randomly selects one or more gaming devices to which the jackpot will be awarded. Other triggers may an award of all or a portion of the jackpot at a time certain to a qualified gaming device being played by a qualified player. Another trigger may be the lottery style where based upon the player s primary game wager they receive numbers in a virtual lottery. For example if Player A wagers 1 credit they have the number 1 and where Player B wagers 10 units they have the numbers 1 10 . With each primary game play a winning number is selected from a set of lottery numbers 1 L where for example L 1 10 000 000. If a qualifying player s number is selected they are awarded all or a portion of the jackpot pool. This provides the incentive to wager a maximum amount at least after qualification. Further machines of different denominations may use the same trigger while providing the same incentive by defining the unit as the smallest denomination credit on the network. By way of example if the smallest denomination gaming device on the network is a 1 denomination game then the player would have a number for the equivalent of each 1 wagered e.g. a wager of 1.25 would provide the player with the numbers 1 125 in the lottery. This scheme is like that disclosed in Olive U.S. Pat. No. 7 582 014 described above and incorporated by reference. In a variation the scheme described in Torango U.S. Pat. No. 6 592 460 also described above and incorporated by reference could be used as a trigger rather than providing a range of numbers the player has the number 1 and the set of numbers 1 L is proportionately reduced based upon the magnitude of the wager.

In an embodiment the jackpot progressive or static may be a symbol based jackpot. For example gaming machines with like award structures could be liked at the system level to provide the jackpot to a qualified player obtaining for example the top prize award for the game.

More than one jackpot may be offered as suggested in and . For example the set of virtual objects may consist of by way of example five different Gems shown at panel in as a silver Gem a Gold Gem a Ruby an Emerald and a Diamond . The secondary game is illustrated in this embodiment to have a waterfall theme. As described in an embodiment it may be necessary for the player through play of the secondary game to acquire all five Gems to be qualified for the single progressive prize or other jackpot such as a physical object like a car. The progressive meter is shown in as well as a locked icon indicating that the player has yet to qualify and hence the progressive prize is locked to the player. In an alternate embodiment as shown in multiple mystery progressive jackpots or other jackpots as described above may be provided and are unlocked with the acquisition of one or more virtual objects. For example three progressive mystery jackpots and are provided with the player qualifying for the jackpot the larger jackpot shown as 189 563.08 when the player has acquired the Diamond virtual object as by having the secondary game randomly produce an outcome of three Diamonds on a designated pay line for example a single provided pay line scatter or on one of multiple pay lines. The player qualifies for jackpot when he she acquires the Ruby object as by having a three Ruby outcome in the secondary game. The player qualifies for the jackpot when he she has a winning three Gold Gem outcome at the secondary game. As shown the locked icon shows that player that they have yet to qualify for any jackpot. The jackpots may be mixed as between moneyed progressive prizes or physical things such as cars or other prizes. Thus it should be understood that as the player plays earned awarded or provided secondary games as described above they obtain outcomes to award Gems and thus qualify for one or more of the jackpots. If for example the player has collected all three of the Diamond Ruby and Gold Gem they would qualify for all jackpot prizes. The locked icons would be shown in an unlocked condition to indicate player qualification. Each progressive prize may be awarded based upon a trigger as described above. The progressive jackpots may have different triggers.
