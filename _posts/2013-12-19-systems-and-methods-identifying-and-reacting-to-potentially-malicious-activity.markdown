Information security may include defending information from unauthorized access use disclosure modification destruction and so forth. As information processing systems continue to grow in size and complexity identifying and reacting to malicious acts associated with secure information has become challenging.

Certain implementations and embodiments will now be described more fully below with reference to the accompanying figures in which various aspects are shown. However various aspects may be implemented in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the implementations set forth herein. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.

Information security may include defending information from malicious acts. Malicious acts may include for example unauthorized access use disclosure modification destruction and so forth. As information processing systems continue to grow in size and complexity identifying and reacting to malicious acts associated with secure information has become challenging.

This disclosure relates to systems and methods for dynamically identifying and reacting to malicious or potentially malicious acts associated with secure information. A sentinel node is configured to determine whether malicious activity or a potential malicious activity has occurred. The sentinel node is made up of one or more computing nodes which can perform functions described in this disclosure. The computing nodes may comprise one or more computing devices. These functions may be executed as one or more services. As described in more detail below the sentinel node may include an emitter portion a sensor portion a filter portion and a reaction portion.

The emitter portion may comprise emitter nodes configured to generate and provide event data. The event data may represent various information about activities associated with emitter nodes. The event data may comprise recorded information about one or more activities. The event data may comprise at least one of data indicating that information has been accessed data indicating that information was transferred to the computing device data indicating that information was modified and so forth. The emitter nodes may comprise computing nodes having computing devices configured to implement certain functions described in this disclosure as one or more services.

In some implementations the event data includes event entries. A particular event entry may comprise data about an activity associated with an emitter node. For example generated event data may include a first event entry indicating that a particular computing device has been accessed and a second event entry indicating the user that accessed the particular computing device.

The sensor portion may use the event entries to generate parsed data. The parsed data may be described as transformed normalized or otherwise processed event data. The sensor portion may comprise one or more sensor modules configured to implement certain functions described in this disclosure as one or more services. By transforming the event data into parsed data the sentinel node may consume large volumes of different types of event data in near real time. As used in this disclosure near real time may be a period of time less than or equal to twenty seconds. Transforming the event data into parsed data in real time or near real time may include allocating the event data to certain data processing modules when the event data is received by the sentinel node. Transforming the event data into parsed data in real time or near real time may include generating parsed data as the event data is received by the sentinel node.

The event data may be transformed into parsed data as instantaneously as possible. The amount of time to transform the event data may be limited by various factors. The factors may include the ability to receive the event data the ability of the hardware or software to receive or access the event data and perform the transformation and so forth.

In some implementations the event data is transformed into parsed data in real time or near real time because the sentinel node performs the transformation as the sentinel node receives the event data. Once the sentinel node receives the event data the sentinel node may perform its functions by maintaining the event data in the primary system memory as compared to the secondary system memory. Due to faster read write times reduced contention or other factors data transfer with the primary system memory is greater than the secondary system memory. As a result the time for processing the event data is reduced compared to systems which rely on storage in the secondary system memory. This may reduce overall processing time allowing the event data to be transformed into parsed data in real time or near real time as the sentinel node receives the event data.

Transforming the event data into parsed data in near real time may be described as transforming the event data substantially immediately once the sentinel node receives the event data. In some examples substantially immediately may be described as within a designated period of time such as five seconds.

The parsed data may represent various information about activities associated with emitter nodes. For example the parsed data may comprise at least one of data indicating the user or computing device that performed an action data indicating the action which has been performed and data indicating the entity that the action was performed on. The parsed data may also include attribute data which may represent various other information about activities associated with emitter nodes. For example the attribute data may comprise information identifying the time in which a particular action took place information identifying the protocol used to perform a particular network connection.

The filter portion may comprise one or more filter modules configured to generate alert data. The alert data may represent an occurrence of a malicious activity or a potentially malicious activity. A potentially malicious activity may comprise a malicious activity. In one example the filter module may generate the alert data in response to a determination that a particular user accessed a designated computing device.

The reactor portion may comprise one or more reaction modules configured to generate reaction data. The reaction data may comprise information about one or more responses to the occurrence of the malicious or potentially malicious activity. In one example the one or more responses include providing a notification to a designated user device indicating the occurrence of a potentially malicious activity.

Users such as internal business users may configure the emitter portion the sensor portion the filter portion and the reaction portion. A user device may include a user interface configured to receive inputs for configuring the emitter portion the sensor portion the filter portion and the reaction portion. Based on the received inputs the user device may generate configuration data comprising information about configuring the emitter portion the sensor portion the filter portion and the reaction portion. The configuration data enables the user of the user device to continuously make changes as to how certain components of the sentinel node will function. Once the configuration data is generated the user device may provide the configuration data to the sentinel node.

The configuration data may include emitter configuration data comprising information causing one or more emitter nodes to provide the event data to the sentinel node. Based on inputs provided by a user the sentinel node may receive different emitter configuration data at different times which may cause the emitter nodes to start and stop providing the event data. By enabling the user to select which emitter nodes will provide the event data the sentinel node may analyze more relevant data resulting in a more efficient process.

The configuration data may include sensor configuration data comprising information about selecting one or more attributes to be generated by the sensor portion. In one example the attributes include information identifying the computing device that performed an action information identifying the action that was performed and information identifying the time the action was performed. The sensor configuration data may cause the sensor module to map the information identifying the computing device the time the action was performed and the information identifying the action that was performed to one or more designated fields. This process may be described as normalizing or transforming the event data into the parsed data. By enabling the user to select which information to analyze the filter module may analyze more relevant data resulting in a more efficient process.

The configuration data may include filter configuration data comprising information about selecting an algorithm or function for analyzing the one or more attributes. The algorithm may comprise a logical arithmetical or computational process. In some implementations the filter module applies the selected algorithm to the parsed data to determine whether a malicious or potentially malicious activity has occurred. For example the selected algorithm may comprise information about determining the amount of attempted logins by a specific user within a designated time. The filter module may apply the algorithm to the parsed data and determine that a particular user has unsuccessfully attempted to logon to a machine twenty times within the last two minutes indicating a potentially malicious act. By enabling the user to select which algorithm to be applied in the analysis the filter module may conduct more relevant analysis resulting in more identification of malicious or potentially malicious acts.

The configuration data may include reaction configuration data comprising information about selecting one or more responses once a determination of an occurrence of a potentially malicious activity occurs. For example the user may configure the sentinel node to provide an alarm to a particular user device if the sentinel node determines that a potentially malicious act has occurred. In another example the user may configure the sentinel node to terminate a particular network connection if the sentinel node determines that a potentially malicious act has occurred.

By enabling sentinel nodes to be configured or customized different users may configure different sentinels based on unique situations. For example a user may be interested in determining whether a document is being modified and another user may be interested in determining whether a user is providing secure information to an unauthorized party. The customizable sentinels provide different solutions to different users based on the users specific needs.

The network facilitating communication between the sentinel node and the user device and emitter node may include a variety of networks such as a local network a wide area network WAN broadcast network a personal area network a wired and wireless local area network LAN and so forth.

The sentinel node may include an emitter configuration module configured to provide the emitter configuration data to the emitter nodes . The emitter configuration data may comprise information causing the emitter nodes to provide event data to the sentinel node . The event data may comprise recorded information about activities associated with the emitter nodes . For example the recorded information may indicate information was accessed transferred modified deleted and so forth. The event data may also include information indicating that a particular user or a particular computing device performed an action.

The parsed data may represent various information about activities associated with one or more emitter nodes . For example the parsed data may include information indicating the user or computing device that performed a particular action data describing the action which has been performed and data indicating the entity that the action was performed on.

The parsed data may include attribute data . The attribute data may comprise information about activities associated with one or more emitter nodes . For example the attribute data may comprise information identifying the time in which a particular action took place information identifying the protocol used to perform a particular network connection and so forth. The sensor module may generate the attribute data based on the event data . Generating the attribute data based on the event data may be described as enriching the event data . In one example the event data includes an Internet Protocol IP address associated with a particular computing device. The sensor module may generate attribute data comprising a hostname associated with the particular computing device using the IP address.

The process of adding the attribute data using the event data may be described as an enrichment process. The sentinel node may include an enrichment module configured to perform the enrichment process. The enrichment node may enable the user to configure the sentinel node to perform one or more enrichment processes at different stages. For example at a first stage the enrichment module may perform a first enrichment process providing first enriched data. Thereafter at a second stage the enrichment module may perform a second enrichment process on the first enriched data resulting in second enriched data. The filter module may be configured to analyze the second enriched data and may generate alert data based on the analysis.

The enrichment process may include defining a derivation configured to provide an attribute which may be derived from the event data or other already derived attributes. Defining the derivation may include selecting an algorithm or function for analyzing one or more attributes. The function may include for example converting the IP address to a fully qualified domain name FQDN . Defining the derivation may include selecting one or inputs from other already derived attributes. Defining the derivation may also include selecting a unique name for the new derived attribute.

The sensor module may generate the parsed data using the sensor configuration data as an input. The sensor configuration data may comprise information which causes the sensor module to select which data to use as inputs for generating the parsed data . By selecting certain data for analysis the sensor module may generate the attribute data which may result in a more efficient process. The data that may be selected for input may comprise a selectable attribute. In one example the selectable attributes may include actor data and action data. The actor data may indicate a user or a computing device which performed a particular action e.g. modifying deleting and so forth and the action data may describe the action that was performed by the actor.

The sentinel node may include the filter module configured to generate alert data by analyzing the parsed data . The alert data may comprise information indicating an occurrence of a malicious or potentially malicious activity. In one example the filter module is configured to generate the alert data in response to the filter module determining that a particular user accessed an unauthorized computing device.

The filter module may generate the alert data using the filter configuration data as an input. The filter configuration data may comprise information about selecting an algorithm used by the filter module to analyze the parsed data . The algorithm may comprise a logical arithmetical or computational process. In one example the filter module applies the selected algorithm to the parsed data and determines that a user has accessed an unauthorized computing device indicating a potentially malicious act.

In some implementations the filter module is configured to select which data to use as inputs. The data that may be selected for input may comprise a selectable attribute. By selecting certain data for analysis the filter module may ignore irrelevant data resulting in a more efficient process.

In some implementations more than one filter module may be chained together. For example a first filter module may be configured to remove information from first parsed data providing filtered data not shown . A second filter module may be configured to apply a selected algorithm to the filtered data to determine whether a potentially malicious activity has occurred. Such a configuration may be visualized as a hierarchical construction which may increase the efficiency of the sentinel node . Efficiency may be increased because different filter modules that would perform most of the same or similar processing of event data to generate the parsed data may not need to perform the same processing multiple times. That is the root of the hierarchy is processed once for all leaf nodes and each level below the root is processed once as needed for the leaf node. In complex cases such a configuration may reduce a large amount of processing time.

The sentinel node may include a reaction module configured to generate reaction data . The reaction data may comprise information about one or more responses to the occurrence of the malicious or potentially malicious activity. In one example the response includes providing a notification to a selected computing device indicating the occurrence of the potentially malicious activity. In the reaction module generates the reaction data and provides the reaction data to the user device . Once the user device receives the reaction data the presentation module may be configured to provide the reaction data to the user of the user device . For example the presentation module may include an output device e.g. a display device configured to display the notification of the occurrence of the malicious or potentially malicious activity.

By enabling internal business users to configure one or more portions of the sentinel node the sentinel node may increase the identification of malicious or potentially malicious activities thus increasing the security of information.

The event data may include event entries . The event entries may comprise at least one of the actor data the action data the entity data and so forth.

At the sentinel node accesses the sensor configuration data comprising information about selecting attributes representative of information about activities associated with emitter nodes . The user device may provide the sensor configuration data once the user device receives inputs from an internal business user.

At the sentinel node generates the parsed data by transforming the event data according to the sensor configuration data . The parsed data includes the attribute data . In one example the event data includes event entries . The transformation of the event data may include at least one of removing one or more of the event entries or supplementing the event entries with other information such as the attribute data . The transformation of the event data may include assigning the event entries to designated fields. The sentinel node may generate the attribute data based on the event entries .

At the sentinel node determines that a potentially malicious activity occurred by analyzing the parsed data . The potentially malicious activity may comprise a malicious activity. In one example the filter module analyzes the parsed data and determines that a potentially malicious activity occurs when the filter module determines that user has unsuccessfully attempted to log into a computing device at least thirty times within the last ten minutes. The sentinel node may determine that a potentially malicious activity occurred by applying a selected algorithm. For example the sentinel node may enable an internal business user to select one of a plurality of different algorithms to be used by the sentinel node when determining whether a malicious or potentially malicious activity has occurred.

The analysis of the parsed data may include determining whether a designated activity has occurred in an amount exceeding a designated number. For example the designated activity may comprise unsuccessfully logging into a computing device and the designated number may comprise five. In this example if the analysis of the parsed data indicates that a user has unsuccessfully attempted to log onto the computing device more than five times the sentinel node determines that a potentially malicious activity has occurred. In some implementations the user device provides the designated number to the sentinel node based on inputs received from an internal business user of the user device .

At the sentinel node generates the alert data representative of the occurrence of the potentially malicious activity. In one example the alert data may comprise information indicating that a user has unsuccessfully attempted to log into a computing device at least thirty times within the last ten minutes. The reaction module may generate the reaction data using the alert data as an input. Continuing with the example in response to the reaction module receiving the alert data the reaction module may generate the reaction data comprising information structured to cause the computing device to lock up blocking the user from attempting to access the computing device.

The user device may display selectable attributes . In this example the selectable attributes includes actor entity action create action read action update action delete action login action privilege date time and protocol . The selectable attributes may be selected by the internal business customer operating with the user device . By enabling the user to select which attributes to analyze the sentinel node may analyze more relevant data resulting in a more efficient process.

The user device displays attribute field . The attribute field enables the user to customize and name or label a selectable attribute which may be used for analysis by one or more filter modules . For example the user may input a first label having the name IP and a second label having the name region . One or more filter modules may use the IP selectable attribute or the region selectable attribute as an input.

The user device displays the following five selectable algorithms Algorithm A Algorithm B Algorithm C Algorithm D and Algorithm E . The sentinel node may apply the selected algorithm to the selected attributes to determine whether a malicious or potentially malicious activity has occurred.

The user device displays the five selectable algorithms and the selected algorithm which is the algorithm C. The sentinel node is configured to apply the algorithm C to the selected attributes. The estimated time complexity and space complexity may comprise the metric data . The time complexity may comprise information indicating an amount of time for the execution of the selected algorithm to occur. The space complexity may comprise information indicating an amount of memory consumed to execute the selected algorithm .

The user device displays the following four selectable responses 1 Alert when we reach a threshold of 10 2 Provide a ticket to Team A 3 Mitigate by Network Isolation 4 Generate data Your data url is https example.com . In this example as shown by selected responses and the user has selected the following three responses 1 Alert when we reach a threshold of 10 2 Provide a ticket to Team A 3 Generate data Your data url is https example.com .

The first selectable response includes a threshold field configured to enable the user to enter a value for the first selectable response .

The second selectable response includes a team field configured to enable the user to enter a value associated with a team. In this example the user entered Team A resulting in the sentinel node providing a ticket to one or more computing devices e.g. user device in response to a determination of an occurrence of a malicious or potentially malicious activity.

The third selectable response includes a mitigation field configured to enable the user to enter a value for the first selectable response . In this example the user entered Network Isolation resulting in the sentinel node terminating any network connections of the computing device which performed the malicious or potentially malicious activity. The fourth selectable response includes a URL field configured to display a URL in which the user may view data about the malicious or potentially malicious activity.
