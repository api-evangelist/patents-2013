Reference is now made to which illustrates a block diagram of a system for benchmarking environmental data according to some embodiments. System is operable to benchmark current environmental data for an entity e.g. an individual organization building branch site against historical environmental data for the same entity. Current environmental data may be instantaneous real time data. In some embodiments current environmental data may also include historical data that is currently of interest to a user in that the user desires to benchmark the data against other historical data for the entity. By benchmarking environmental data for an entity against other environmental data for the same entity system is operable to compare a wide variety of common environment related data variables as the benchmarked environmental data sets for the entity will have the same common data variables. In contrast environmental data for one entity may not have any common variables or a limited number of common variables with respect to environmental data for another entity. That is one entity may collect and compute different environmental data than another entity and may not have common variables to benchmark.

The environmental data may relate to data for resource consumption by the entity data for emissions generated by the entity data for health or fitness activity by the entity data for socially beneficial activities by the entity and the like. The environmental data may be raw data normalized data processed data calculated data and the like. Resource consumption may include water usage fuel usage and the like. Resource consumption data may be collected by system as raw activity data related to the entity as will be described herein. Environmental data may be calculated by system based on raw activity collected for the entity such as emissions generated by car travel air travel and the like. The health or fitness data may be calculated by system based on raw activity data collected for the entity such as miles walked per week miles biked per month and the like. The environmental data may be received by system via input module as a historical and real time data feed or stream. Environmental data may also include data that indirectly relates to the environment resource consumption emissions generation health activities and so on. For example environmental data may also include building occupancy rates.

In accordance with embodiments described herein system is operable to benchmark environmental data for an entity by determining a distribution for historical environmental data for the entity. In accordance with some embodiments system is operable to assume that the historical environmental data for the entity follows a normal distribution and is operable to estimate the normal distribution for the historical environmental data for the entity. The historical distribution may provide an approximate distribution for the historical environmental data for the entity. System is operable to estimate the normal distribution by estimating a mean and a standard deviation for historical environmental data for the entity.

In accordance with embodiments described herein system is operable to benchmark environmental data for an entity by determining the empirical e.g. real actual distribution for the historical environmental data. As system collects sufficient environmental data for the entity then system is operable to determine the empirical distribution for the environmental data.

In accordance with embodiments described herein the historical environmental data for the entity may include raw activity data normalized activity data computed emissions values and on the like as will further be described herein. For example the historical environmental data may include historical consumption values such as energy consumption values or water consumption values. Each of the historical consumption values may be associated with a time interval such as an hour or 15 minute period for different dates such as the days of a week month year and the like. That is system is operable to collect consumption values or other types of environmental data values for a specific time interval over a date range e.g. collection of different dates .

System is operable to collect current environmental data for the entity using various data collection devices. For the illustrative example the current environmental data may include a current consumption value for the time interval associated with the historical environmental data in order to bench mark the current environmental data for the time interval on the current day against the historical environmental data for the same time interval but on past dates. For a given time interval system is operable to generate a graphical representation benchmarking the current environmental data against the historical environmental data. For example the graphical representation may include three data segments and may represent the current environmental data at a position within one of the three segments.

System may calculate the three data segments based on a distribution of the historical environmental data. In some example embodiments the distribution may approximated by a normal distribution of the historical environmental data where the normal distribution of the historical environmental data is calculated using the estimated mean and the estimated standard deviation. The position representing the current environmental data may indicate how the current environmental data compares to the estimated mean. That is the graphical representation may indicate how the current environmental data differs from the typical environmental data value or average. In other example embodiments the distribution may be the empirical distribution for the historical environmental data.

System is operable to determine the actual or empirical distribution using the collected historical environmental data. System is operable to divide the set of data points of the historical environmental data into segments in order to generate the graphical representation. System may generate a histogram or order the historical environmental data to divide it into groups or segments. There may be two three four or more segments. For example the graphical representation may contain three data segments and system is operable to determine two data points terciles that divide the set data points of the historical environmental data into three groups. A tercile is either of the two data points that divide an ordered distribution e.g. historical environmental data into three parts. System is operable to determine the two terciles that divide the historical environmental data into three parts. Each segment may have a different scale or range of data points as will be described herein.

If the benchmarking for an entity is real time or near real time then determining the empirical distribution may utilize a large amount of processing power and introduce latency. Accordingly in some embodiments the normal distribution may serve as an approximate distribution for the historical environmental data for the entity. Further the amount of historical environmental data for a specific time interval may be limited so the normal distribution may serve as an approximate distribution.

System is operable to create a visual graphical representation to illustrate the benchmarking of the current environmental data against historical environmental data for the entity. The environmental data may relate to resource consumption emissions generation fitness activity socially beneficially activities cost or other computed or collected environmental data values for the entity.

The input module is operable to receive environmental data for one or more entities such as raw activity data for example. The input module is operable to define a record for an activity using the raw activity data and associate the activity data with the related entity using an entity identifier metatag and the like. The input module is operable to receive historical environmental data and real time environmental data. The input module is operable to receive instantaneous usage data data gathered over a period of time change data rate of change data projection data for usage other emission related data. The input module is further operable to receive an entity identifier to associate the environmental data with the user of the system .

The input module may receive the environmental data automatically through connectors to or manually through direct user input spreadsheets defined by templates supplier bills the enterprise client the personal client the API and the bulk data upload module for example. The input module may receive the environmental data from a variety of monitoring or sensor devices such as a utility meter smart meter water meter volt meter amperage meter light meter wind meter hydrometer pedometer etc. The input module may be an indirect data capturing system that process images to extract data readings. Input module may poll for environmental data may periodically request or receive environmental data or may otherwise receive environmental data related to an entity.

Environmental data may relate to an activity. An activity is an event that generates emissions consumes resources or otherwise describes an activity associated with an entity. An activity occurs relative to a geographic location over a defined period of time or a time interval on a specific date. The activity also occurs relative to an entity such as an organization or individual. For example activity related data may include a measure relating to the consumption of a resource e.g. electricity gasoline natural gas water or the release of an effluent e.g. mercury or methane into the environment. An example activity is electricity usage.

The raw activity data defines the record of the activity and may generally include the following data elements an activity type e.g. driving flying electricity heating waste recycling composting and paper a time interval e.g. start time end time a date a location where the activity occurred e.g. Toronto Mike s office a unit of measure e.g. kg kWh ton and a consumption value e.g. amount of gas consumed .

The raw activity data may further include a cost value and a unit of currency. Additional example activity types include accommodation boating office supplies household material goods packaging shipping power generation renewable energy agricultural applications refrigerants food building materials public transportation raw material acquisition manufacturing and material processing.

The data elements of the raw activity data may contain sub data elements or nested data elements. For example the activity type electricity may have nested data elements such as grid green source on site and private contract. The activity type heating may have nested data elements such as fuel and electric cogenerated and geothermal. The activity type flying may have nested data elements such as commercial private leased and private owned.

The calculation engine is operable to compute emission values for the activity in the event the activity relates to the generation or reduction of emissions. The computed emission value is another example of environmental data that may be benchmarked. An emission value may be the amount of emissions for an activity measured in a unit such as watt hour values for electricity values tonnes of CO2e carbon dioxide equivalents tonnes of CH4e methane equivalents and cubic meters of water for example.

The data provisioning module is operable to store standardize validate and classify data received by the system and the input module . The data provisioning module ensures data integrity and converts data into common units of measure so that for example kilograms are not directly compared to pounds.

When the input module receives raw activity data the data provisioning module is operable to interact with storage module to store the raw activity data in a data storage device. The data provisioning module may associate the raw activity data with a user identifier. This enables access to a copy of the data as received and allows a user to review their specific input in order to make edits.

The data provisioning module is further operable to convert the raw activity data into standardized activity data and interact with storage module to store the standardized activity data in a data storage device.

The data provisioning module is operable to convert the raw activity data into a standard unit of measure. The data provisioning module is operable to store the original unit of measure for the raw activity data. This allows the data provisioning module to convert system generated data into a unit of measurement appropriate for the data consumer such as metric measures for Canada and imperial measures for the U.S.

The data provisioning module is further operable to convert the raw activity data into a standard time measure such as one day. To do so the data provisioning module may convert the raw activity data for one activity into multiple standardized activities where the time interval for each standardized activity is the standard time measure. For example the raw activity data may be an electricity bill for thirty days. The data provisioning module evenly distributes raw activity data for the activity into thirty standardized activities each having a time interval of one day. The standard time measure may also be one second one millisecond etc. for real time power monitoring systems and the like. The data provisioning module records the standard time measure to allow for subsequent calculations and comparisons.

The data provisioning module is further operable to associate an input label with each standardized activity. The input label provides the system with a context for the standardized activity and defines how the emission value will be calculated. The input label generally depends on the activity type. For example an input label for the activity type driving may be distance driven and an input label for the activity type waste may be waste consumed .

Benchmarking module is operable to benchmark environmental data for an entity. Benchmarking module is operable to determine a distribution for the historical environmental data in order to segment a graphical representation used for illustrate the benchmarking and position current environmental data within one of the segments. Benchmarking module is operable to determine the empirical distribution for the historical environmental data. Benchmarking module is operable to approximate the distribution for the historical environmental data for the entity using a normal distribution. Benchmarking module is operable to estimate a mean and a standard deviation for historical environmental data for the entity. The historical environmental data includes historical data values e.g. consumption values associated with a time interval over a range of different dates. For example the historical environmental data may include an historical consumption value for the time interval 9 AM to 10 AM for 90 different days.

Benchmarking module is operable to process current environmental data for the entity where the current environmental data includes a current data value e.g. consumption value for the time interval. Benchmarking module is operable to calculate data segments for a graphical representation of the benchmarking. For example the graphical representation may include three data segments one segment for an average one segment for lower than average and another segment for higher than average. The three data segments may be calculated by determining tercile data points for the historical environmental data. The three data segments may also be determined based on a normal distribution of the historical environmental data where the normal distribution of the historical environmental data is calculated using the estimated mean and the estimated standard deviation.

Benchmarking module is operable to determine other quantiles to divide the historical environmental data into different numbers of segments. The quantiles are the data values marking the boundaries between consecutive groups or subsets of the historical environmental data for the entity. The quantiles may be used for dividing ordered historical environmental data into essentially equal or near equal sized data subsets.

Benchmarking module is operable to generate a graphical user interface for display on a device where the graphical user display comprises a graphical representation benchmarking the current environmental data against the historical environmental data. The graphical representation is partitioned into data segments and represents the current environmental data at a position within one of the segments. Further details of benchmarking module will be described herein in relation to .

Storage module is operable to store and manage environmental data such as raw activity data processed activity data records consumption values computed emissions values graphical representations for benchmarking environmental data and the like. Storage module is operable to tag data with a timestamp and entity identifier. Storage module is operable to discard data if it is corrupt erroneous invalid inconsistent out of range or other undesirable.

User interface module is operable to provide graphical representations of benchmarking environmental values for use in generating user interfaces for display via personal client and enterprise client . User interface module is operable to receive commands and parameters from personal client and enterprise client to revise graphical representations and provide the revised graphical representations to personal client and enterprise client .

Personal client and enterprise client may be used to by an individual or organization to provide and access environmental data from system to receive graphical representations benchmarking current environmental data against historical environmental data and otherwise access the functionality of system .

Bulk upload module is operable to receive raw activity data as bulk data from an enterprise client and provide the raw activity data to the input module . A third party system can also interact with bulk upload module for automated bulk data upload into system .

In a further embodiment system includes a payment module . Generally the payment module is operable to manage an emission credit inventory calculate a number of emissions credits required to offset the computed emissions value compute emissions credit market values and initiate an emissions offset transaction based on the number of calculated emissions credits computed emissions credit market values and the emissions credit inventory. Although described as a single module payment module may be implemented as separate inventory and payment modules.

The payment module is related to the concept of emissions credit markets. For example at the international level one carbon credit is equal to one tonne of carbon emissions. Once carbon emissions are capped the free market can be used to allocate carbon emissions among regulated sources. The underlying concept is that free market mechanisms will drive industrial and commercial processes towards lower emissions methods. Under such a model governments industry and individuals could be assigned a pre determined number of carbon credits based on for example current emissions. If an entity reduces its emissions it could sell excess carbon credits on the free market. Conversely if an entity requires more carbon credits it must purchase them on the free market or face penalties. Similar markets could be established for any type of emissions. The payment module is capable of managing the emissions transactions that arise under such a model. Furthermore the payment module and the calculation engine can work together to manage a user s emissions credits and related financial transactions based on computed emissions values.

Management of an emissions credit inventory involves tracking the number of emissions credits that a user owns controls or requires. A user may be given some number of emissions credits by a governmental organization or may be required to purchase credits from an emissions credit bank marketplace or third party. The user may be able to buy or sell emissions credits at any time. Emissions credits may also take the form of services where suppliers purchase bulk amounts of emissions credits and sell them to customers on demand. Regardless of the form that emissions credit markets take the payment module is operable to manage the number of emissions credits in a user s emissions credit inventory using accounting practices.

Calculation of the emissions credits required to offset a computed emissions value requires the payment module to convert the emissions value calculated by the calculation engine into the units of measurement used by emissions credits in the emissions credit marketplace. Once the units of measurement are the same the payment module can calculate the number of emissions credits required to offset the calculated emissions value. Once the emissions offset number has been calculated the payment module can compare the offset number to a user s emissions credit inventory.

An emissions offset transaction can be initiated automatically by the payment module if there is a shortfall of emissions credits in a user s emissions credit inventory. An emissions offset transaction can also be initiated manually when a user wishes to purchase or sell emissions credits. An emissions offset transaction allows users to purchase sell or trade emissions credits via an emissions credit market an emissions credit supplier or a third party. For example assuming the calculation engine calculates that a user s activity has produced 30 tons of CO2 emissions then the payment module is operable to query the user s emissions credit inventory to determine if they have enough emissions credits to cover the emissions debt. If the user only has 20 tons of CO2 credits available in their inventory then the user clearly has a CO2 emissions debt of 10 tons. This debt could be saved in the user s inventory or corrected using an emissions offset transaction.

To associate an emissions offset transaction with a value the payment module is operable to calculate the market value associated with emissions credits. This may involve obtaining pricing information from service providers thirds parties or calculating the cost of emissions credits based on market conditions.

The payment module is also operable to process payments relating to emissions values though not necessarily using an emissions credit trading model as described above. Users may wish to purchase other wares or services in order to offset their emissions. For example an individual may wish to purchase some trees to be planted on their behalf in order to offset a recent flight. These types of transactions can also be processed using the payment module .

Authentication module is operable to authenticate a user or input device associated with an entity prior to providing access to system in order to provide input data to system or receive output data from system in order to verify that it is a legitimate user or input device. Authentication module is operable to associate identifiers and passcodes or other authentication mechanisms in order to authenticate a user or input device associated with an entity.

Translation module is operable to translate and modify the display of text and variant preferences used by any components of the system during user interaction. The translation process may be referred to as internationalization and may extend to concepts such as colors numbers fonts writing conventions input prompts and the like. Text and variant preferences can be translated and modified automatically using the translation module in response to a locale variable that can be set by a client during use or hard coded into the system . In one embodiment a client side filtering mechanism may be used to read the language preferences of a browser to determine a web client s preferred language and to set the locale variable. The web client would then transmit the locale variable when making requests to other modules. In another embodiment a client s account information may be stored and accessed by a security service module not shown to define a preferred locale. Whenever a client uses the system the security service module could set the users locale.

The actual process of translation may be implemented in many ways. In an exemplary embodiment textual elements are stored as strings in a database for a given locale. The translation module is operable to retrieve the appropriate string from the database in response to a request for a specific string and given a locale. For example a button labeled Hello in English and Bonjour in French would be stored as two strings one with a locale of French and one with a locale of English. The identifier for this string would be the same for example hello button label . The system or a client could therefore make a request to the translation module for hello button label in locale French which would return Bonjour or in locale English which would return Hello . Furthermore the translation module allows clients to customize locale settings by inserting their own specific translations for strings that take precedence over the base locale settings. Continuing the above example a company could modify the hello button string so that it reads Welcome for the English locale by adding a client customization or by overwriting the string stored in the database for the English locale. All other base translation strings could be left the same for the English locale.

By internationalizing the system using the translation module the user interface elements of the system can easily be adapted for use globally. This would permit for example more accurate information gathering using native languages and user interface customs. Internationalizations and resource files can be customized.

The components of system are modular and can function independently or together. The emissions equations factors and reference data can be updated changed expanded and tested independently of the other components. The system provides a suite of services to users commonly referred to as SaaS or software hardware as a service and does not require the user to maintain their own software programs server systems or databases. Components of the system can interact with third party system components instead of the local components e.g. use a third party reference data component for example . A third party system can also interact with the entire system or one or more individual components for automated data exchange and bulk data upload into system .

Referring now to there is shown a block diagram of a calculation module according to some embodiments. The calculation engine is operable to compute at least one emission value for the activity defining the environmental data. In accordance with some embodiments benchmarking module is operable to interact with calculation module in order to benchmark current calculated emission values against historical calculated emissions values for an entity. Benchmarking module is operable to determine a distribution for the historical calculated emissions values for an entity to segment a graphical representation in order to benchmark current calculated emission values for the entity. The distribution may be an empirical distribution normal distribution and the like.

Calculation module is implemented using a processor and a memory storing instructions the instructions being executable to configure the processor to provide a number of functional elements such as for example factor data module location module and reference data module . These are examples only and different modules may be used to implement calculation module in order to calculate emissions values or other environmental data values. The components of the calculation module are modular and can function independently or together. Calculation module enables asynchronous communication and data exchange between the components.

The location module manages data relating to locations. The emissions generated by an activity or resources consumed by an activity may depend on the location of the activity. For example the electricity used in Ontario has a significantly lower carbon footprint than electricity used in Alberta because 80 of the electricity provided in Ontario comes from either atomic or hydroelectric sources whereas 80 of the electricity used in Alberta comes from coal fired generators. As another example different countries use different protocols e.g. GHG Bilan Carbone to calculate emissions values. The location must be factored in when determining how an emissions value should be calculated in order to comply with a given protocol.

Calculation engine may use the location module to compute emissions values regarding an activity that occurs at a particular location. In response the location module will compute and return a location hierarchy for the location associated with the activity. The location module may also receive a user identifier along with the request in order to compute a location hierarchy specific to the user. The location module may use location hierarchies as a mechanism to organize geographic locations relative to other geographic locations.

A location hierarchy may include one or more location nodes arranged as a graph or tree relative to other location nodes. A location node may be a parent node e.g. world a child node e.g. third floor or both a parent and child node e.g. Canada . The location module is further operable to customize location nodes for a user to reflect the user s specialized view of the world. By creating custom location nodes a user can create arbitrary levels of abstraction specific to their view of how the world is organized. Examples include multi country regions sales regions buildings offices and electrical outlets. The location module may receive the user identifier along with the location of the activity in order to compute a customized location hierarchy specific to the user. The location module may compute a location hierarchy using standard location nodes e.g. cities states provinces applicable to all users and overlay custom location nodes e.g. downtown office applicable only to specific users. If two users have custom location nodes the location module may compute one location hierarchy comprised of standard and custom location nodes for one user and a different location hierarchy for the other user. The same standard location nodes will be included in both location hierarchies. The location module will use the graph to compute a location hierarchy specific to the user that is a tree or directed graph for the calculation engine . This allows the components to directly traverse up the location hierarchy from a given location node child node without encountering multiple paths due to the child node having multiple parent nodes.

The factor data module manages factor data by associating each factor with at least one source at least one location a valid start date and a valid end date. The factor data module may also associate factors with a user where only a specific user has permission to use the factor.

Factors provide numerical data factor values for use by the calculation engine when calculating emission values. A very accurate way to measure emissions would be to monitor them directly as they are emitted. If real time monitoring is not feasible or possible a factor i.e. an emission factor provides a mechanism to estimate the rate at which a pollutant is released into the atmosphere or captured as a result of the activity or standardized activity . An emission factor is therefore measured in units of an emission type per unit of activity e.g. grams of CO2 per km driven . Other examples include pounds of SO2 per bushel of Wood Burned milligrams of Volatile Organic Compounds per hour of Dry Cleaning and liters of H2O per Dishwasher Cycle.

Emission factors may depend upon numerous variables including the location of the activity e.g. percentage of electricity produced by coal in the United States the product associated with the activity e.g. approximate gas mileage for a Toyota Prius the service associated with the activity e.g. CO2 emitted per passenger for a flight from Toronto to Chicago time intervals e.g. percentage of electricity produced by coal in Toronto in July 2008 the scientific methods used to calculate them the source category of an emission the temperature at which the emission occurred and many others. Emission factors are approximations or averages that reflect constantly changing real world scenarios.

The factor data module can store factor data locally in a database or access data stored remotely in third party databases. The factor data may be derived from protocols e.g. GHG IPCC CDP industry standards emission databases internal calculations industry associations e.g. EPA and user specific databases for example.

Calculation engine may request from the factor data module emission factors for the standardized activity where the request includes the location hierarchy and the time interval. In response the factor data module is operable to determine which factors are valid for the time period of the standardized activity data and the locations defined by the location hierarchy.

As noted above factors may depend on the location of an activity. The factor data module will attempt to determine the most specific factors using the location hierarchy. For example the location hierarchy may be Toronto Ontario Canada World. If factors specific to Toronto are not available or valid for the specified time interval then the factor data module will traverse successively up the location hierarchy to parent nodes of Toronto and attempt to compute factors specific to Ontario and then to Canada etc.

If the factor data module determines that there are multiple valid factors available for a given location and time interval then the factors module ranks the valid factors from most accurate to least accurate to compute a list of ranked valid factors. The factor data module determines which valid factors are the most accurate for the given location hierarchy and time interval.

The reference data module is operable to compute reference data relevant to each standardized activity. The reference data module may access reference data stored locally in a database or remotely in third party databases e.g. EPA fuel guide database . Reference data may have a specific type. Examples of different types of reference data include fuel efficiency fuel type electricity type waste type paper size car name etc.

The data provisioning module may tag raw activity data elements as different types of reference data for access by the reference data module . For example the activity may be the use of 2000 kwh of electricity in the Toronto Office over a period of 3 months where 90 is obtained from the grid and 10 is obtained from green sources. The type of reference data may be electricity type and the specific reference data value for this activity will be 90 grid and 10 green . When an emission value is computed for the grid and another emission value is computed for the green sources the system may use the reference data 90 grid and 10 green in order to compute the emission value for the activity as a whole.

The factor data module and the reference data module are interconnected and tightly coupled. A given factor may be independent of reference data or may depend on some type of reference data. For example an emission factor for compost is independent of reference data and depends only on the location of the activity. However a factor for fuel consumption depends on the reference data fuel type e.g. gas diesel . Accordingly the factor data module may directly access the reference data module when computing factors relevant to the location hierarchy and time interval.

The calculation engine engages the data provisioning module to compute one or more emission values for each standardized activity using the data for each standardized activity e.g. the input label the activity type time interval location . The calculation engine may compute an emission value for the activity as a whole using the emission values computed for the standardized activities that make up the activity. In addition the calculation engine may compute multiple emission values for a given standardized activity.

The calculation engine is operable to use the location module to generate a location hierarchy using the location of the standardized activity. The calculation engine is operable to query the reference data module for relevant reference data and the factor data module for relevant factors using the location hierarchy and the time interval for the standardized activity.

As noted above factors may only be valid for a specific location time interval protocol etc. The factor data module will return the most specific and accurate valid factors for each standardized activity and may return a different set of valid factors for one standardized activity than for another standardized activity even though both are related to the same activity. For example an activity may take place from June 2008 to August 2008 and one factor may be the most accurate but only valid for July 2008. All standardized activities that take place in July will use that factor but the standardized activities that take place in June and August will use another factor.

Dividing an activity into multiple standardized activities allows the most accurate and specific factors to be used to calculate the emission value for that standardized activity even though the factors may not be valid for the entire time interval of the activity. Increasing the granularity of the standardized activity time intervals and the granularity of the factor data time intervals allows for more accurate emission calculations.

If protocols factors or emission equations are added or updated at some point in the time interval for the activity this will be reflected in the calculations for an individual standardized activity as the activity as a whole is broken down into a standard time measure such as days. Further historical data e.g. activity data saved in the activity database may be used to re calculate emission values as factors or protocols are updated and created.

The calculation engine determines one or more optimal emission equations given the data related to the standardized activity e.g. input label activity type reference data factors .

The calculation engine maintains a database of emission equations and associates each emission equation with a valid time period the source of the equation e.g. a protocol and an activity type. Sources for equations include scientific data protocols government programs reports industry standards specific customers etc. For example typically a protocol such as GHG will define a set of equations to use for calculations in order to comply with the protocol. In addition specific customers may develop their own internal equations for use by that specific customer only. The database of emission equations can be updated with new equations as new science is developed new protocols are created or existing protocols are updated. When an existing equation is updated with a new version the system will implement versioning to keep track of the old equation and all subsequent versions.

Equations may be implemented using a domain specific language and are generally made up of one of more of the following variables standardized activity data e.g. input label activity type location time interval consumption value reference data emission factors another equation result e.g. a sub equation within the equation and protocol constants e.g. radiative force of air travel .

The calculation engine determines a set of emission equations that match at least some of the standardized activity data the computed reference data and the computed factor data. Equations may be valid for a protocol location emission type and time interval. The calculation engine queries a database for valid emission equations that match the standardized activity data location hierarchy reference data and factors.

For example if there is no valid equation for the specific location of the activity then the calculation engine will successively traverse up the location hierarchy to the first parent node to determine whether there is a valid equation for that location etc.

If the set of equations includes multiple emission equations then the calculation engine ranks or scores the equations with reference to the specific user standardized activity data location hierarchy reference data and emission factors in order to determine the optimal emission equation for this specific standardized activity. The calculation engine may associate metadata regarding accuracy with each equation in order to rank the emission equations.

Finally the calculation engine selects an optimal emission equation from the ranked set of emission equations for use in calculating the emission value.

Once the optimal emission equation is determined the calculation engine computes emission values for the standardized activity by applying the standardized activity data reference data and factors to the optimal emission equation. The calculation engine will compute at least one emission value for each standardized activity in order to compute an emission value for the activity as a whole. The emission equation may be associated with a specific protocol which may dictate which emission factors should be used for the calculation and returned by the factor data module . Accordingly the optimal emission equation may be selected prior to computing which factors to use for the time interval and location.

The calculation engine is further operable to store the at least one emission value in an emission database or transmit the emission value to the ESB for access by the benchmarking module storage module user interface module the enterprise client the API or the personal client .

If emission equations and factors are added or updated then the calculation engine can re calculate emission values using historical activity data stored in the activity database using the latest and most accurate equations and factors. For tracking purposes the calculation engine can associate each computed emission value with the emission equation and version and factors used for its calculation.

Referring now to there is shown a block diagram of a benchmarking module and a flowchart diagram that illustrates the steps taken by benchmarking module to benchmark current environmental data for an entity against historical environmental data for the same entity according to some embodiments. Benchmarking module is implemented using a processor and a memory storing instructions the instructions being executable to configure the processor to provide a number of functional elements such as for example distribution module historical data module summary module current data module and graphical representation module . These are examples only and different modules may be used to implement benchmarking module in order to benchmark environmental data for an entity such as an organization or individual. The components of the benchmarking module are modular and can function independently or together. Benchmarking module enables asynchronous communication and data exchange between the components.

At historical data module is operable to receive or retrieve historical environmental data for an entity from e.g. storage module input module enterprise client personal client . Historical environmental data may relate to resource consumption emission generation or reduction health activities socially beneficial activities and the like. Historical environmental data may be associated with a data type e.g. emission type fuel type a time interval a location of the environmental data date unit of measure data values e.g. consumption values and the like.

The historical environmental data may be filtered based on a variety of parameters such as data type time interval date range and the like. As an example the consumption values may represent energy consumption e.g. electricity consumption and the data type may be energy usage. The historical environmental data relates to a time interval of interest where the current environmental data for the time interval will be benchmarked against the historical environmental data for the same time interval. The historical environmental data includes historical data values e.g. consumption values associated with a time interval over a range of different dates. For example the historical environmental data may include an historical consumption value for the time interval 9 AM to 10 AM for 90 different days.

The historical environmental data may include historical consumption values where each of the historical consumption values is associated with a time interval and a different date within the date range of interest for benchmarking. The historical consumption values or other historical environmental data may be converted to a standard unit of measure.

The historical environmental data may include activity data standardized activity data calculated emission values and other types of data relating to the environment. For example the historical environmental data may relate to activities for the entity and calculated emission values for activities such as historical flying walking and driving data for an entity. The flying data may include departure location destination location type of the airplane date time interval and the like. The walking data may include number of steps distance traveled time interval date and the like. The driving data may include fuel type vehicle type date time interval and the like. As another example the historical environmental data may relate to energy usage such as electricity usage and calculated emission values for energy usage. The energy data may include the source of energy e.g. broken down into different percentages such as 70 grid 30 green .

As a further example the historical environmental data may relate to waste generation and calculated emission values for waste generation. The waste data may include composition amounts such as metals glass food paper plastics other. As another example the historical environmental data may relate to heating home office with natural gas and calculated emission values for heating home office with natural gas. The heating data may include fuel type and amount consumed for time intervals on different dates. As another example the historical environmental data may relate to paper usage for an office building and calculated emission values for paper usage for an office building. The paper usage data may include paper type amount consumed for time intervals on different dates. These are examples only and other historical environmental related data may be received by system for benchmarking. The benchmarking module is operable to interact with input module and storage module to receive historical environmental data.

Historical data module is operable to convert raw activity data into one or more standardized activities with particular time intervals and dates and distribute the consumption values among the standardized activities. The standardized activity data is an example of environmental data that may be benchmarked by system . The historical environmental data includes historical consumption values where each is associated with a time interval of interest and a different date. The standardized activities may also be associated with a time interval. System is operable to parse received historical environmental data into separate time intervals for benchmarking. In some embodiments the historical and current environmental data is associated with a data type and a location of the environmental data. For example the data type may be electricity usage and the location may be an office building or geographic location.

At distribution module is operable to determine a distribution for the historical environmental data in order to segment a graphical representation used for benchmarking e.g. by positioning the current environmental data within one of the segments. Distribution module is operable to determine the empirical distribution for the historical environmental data. Distribution module is operable to approximate the distribution for the historical environmental data for the entity using a normal distribution. Distribution module is operable to use other types of distributions for the historical environmental data.

Distribution module is operable to use a distribution model that assumes that the environmental data follows a normal distribution. Other distribution models and may also be selected. Distribution module is operable to estimate a mean and a standard deviation for historical environmental data for the entity in order to calculate boundaries to determine segments for the graphical representation. For example the mean and the standard deviation may be calculated using consumption values for the historical environmental data. Distribution module is operable to calculate the normal distribution of the historical environmental data using the estimated mean and the estimated standard deviation.

Distribution module is operable to use the normal distribution to calculate data segments for use in a graphical representation benchmarking current environmental data against historical environmental data for the entity. Benchmarking module may approximate the distribution on an assumption that environmental related data follows normal distribution. This assumption enables use of the 68 95 99.7 rule for normal distributions where this rule implies that 68 95 and 99.7 of the observations would fall within 2 4 6 standard deviations of the mean respectively. That is about 68 of the values lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean about 95 of the values lie within 2 standard deviations of the mean and 99.7 almost all of the values lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean.

Referring now to there is shown a graphical representation of a chart illustrating estimated means for historical environmental data representing electricity consumption values for different dates over the time range 9 AM to 10 AM. In particular the chart plots the estimated mean of historical electricity usage values in kilowatts kW for different dates against time and in particular a time range of 9 AM to 10 AM. The chart illustrates a normal distribution graph for the time interval 9 AM and another normal distribution graph for the time interval 10 AM. The normal distribution graphs are segmented based on the 68 95 99.7 rule for normal distributions. For example a normal distribution graph for the historical electricity usage values at 9 AM shows a line representing the estimated mean a line representing 1 standard deviation of the mean a line representing 1 standard deviation of the mean a line representing 2 standard deviations of the mean a line representing 2 standard deviations of the mean a line representing 3 standard deviations of the mean and a line representing 3 standard deviations of the mean. The chart illustrates three graph lines where one graph line represents the estimated mean for the historical electricity consumption values for different dates over the time range 9 AM to 10 AM another graph line represents 1 standard deviation of the estimated mean for the historical electricity consumption values for different dates over the time range 9 AM to 10 AM and the third graph line represents 1 standard deviation of the estimated mean for the historical electricity consumption values for different dates over the time range 9 AM to 10 AM. As shown the graph lines intersect the estimate mean and 1 standard deviation of the mean on the normal distribution graphs shown for 9 AM and 10 AM. The chart is an example graphical representation and other variations may be used. Based on the 68 95 99.7 rule for normal distributions about a third of all historical electricity usage values for all dates observed will be between two graph lines and another third of all historical electricity usage values for all dates observed will be between the other two graph lines .

At current data module is operable to receive current environmental data for the entity where the current environmental data may include a current consumption value for the time interval for example.

The current environmental data may relate to activity data resource consumption emission generation or reduction health activities socially beneficial activities standardized activity data calculated emissions values or other emission related data. The current consumption value may be converted to a standard unit of measure. The current environmental data may be instantaneous real time data or may be data currently of interest to a user or entity.

Current environmental data values may relate to multiple time intervals and the current data module is operable to parse the current environmental values into individual time intervals each to be benchmarked against historical environmental values for corresponding time intervals. The current data module is operable to interact with distribution module and graphical representation module to determine which data segment the current environmental data should be represented within and the position of the current environmental data within the particular data segment.

At system calculates data segments or boundaries along the scale representing the distribution of environmental data for use in generating a graphical representation to benchmark the current environmental data against the historical environmental data. Graphical representation module is operable to generate the graphical representation benchmarking the current environmental data against the historical environmental data. The graphical representation may comprise data segments and represents the current environmental data at a position within one of the data segments. In some embodiments the position representing the current environmental data indicates how the current environmental data compares to the estimated mean or average calculated based on the historical environmental data.

Graphical representation module is operable to calculate data segments for a graphical representation of the benchmarking by determining a distribution for the historical environmental data. For example the graphical representation may include three data segments one segment for an average one segment for lower than average and another segment for higher than average. The three data segments may be calculated by determining tercile data points for the historical environmental data. The three data segments may also be determined based on a normal distribution of the historical environmental data where the normal distribution of the historical environmental data is calculated using the estimated mean and the estimated standard deviation. Other distributions may also be used to segment the graphical representation and other segmentations techniques may also be used to determine the segments. Any number of segments may be used and three is an example only. The segments may be determined by calculating boundaries for the scale representing the distribution where the boundaries may be a factor of the standard deviation and mean.

Graphical representation module is operable to determine other quantiles to divide the historical environmental data into a different number of segments. The quantiles are the data values marking the boundaries between consecutive groups or subsets of the historical environmental data for the entity. The quantiles may be used for dividing ordered historical environmental data into essentially equal or near equal sized data subsets.

At graphical representation module is operable to generate one or more graphical representations benchmarking the current environmental data against the historical environmental data. The graphical representation includes the data segments and represents the current environmental data at a position within one of the segments. The position representing the current environmental data may indicate how the current environmental data compares to the estimated mean or average range in order to benchmark against historical environmental data. Benchmarking module may return to steps and to receive real time updates for current environmental values and update the graphical representation based on the real time updates. That is the graphical representation may be updated to provide a real time benchmarking of current environmental data against historical environmental data.

At benchmarking module is operable to display print transmit or otherwise output the graphical representation for display as part of a graphical user interface on a device via personal client or enterprise client .

By way of illustrative example benchmarking module is operable to benchmark electricity usage in a building for different time intervals by comparing it to historical usage. Historical data module is operable to receive kilowatt kW e.g. watt hour values for a specific time interval over 7 business days. Distribution module is operable to determine a distribution for the electricity usage such as an empirical distribution or an approximate distribution based on a normal distribution model. For example for real time benchmarking benchmarking module is operable to estimate the mean and standard deviation for these observations. The mean and standard deviation may be used to plot the comparative distribution on a graphical representation for a specific time interval and a summary graphical representation for multiple time intervals.

Referring now to there are shown graphical representations in the form of a gauge for benchmarking current environmental data against historical environmental data for an entity. The graphical representation in the form of a gauge may be displayed using personal or enterprise client or otherwise output. For example gauge may represent electricity usage by an organization. In one embodiment gauge has the form of a semi circle mimicking the layout of a speedometer. Starting point A is located at the bottom left edge of gauge representing the lowest range of data in the dataset. End point B is located at the bottom right edge of gauge representing the highest range of data in the dataset. Scale is located along the perimeter of the semicircle and represents an axis along which data points are plotted representing deviations from the estimated mean. Scale also indicates data points between the lowest and highest deviations from the mean. Markers for specific data points representing specific deviations from the mean may be provided on scale . While gauge appears to be a two dimensional form the data points are effectively in a tabular one dimensional form where all data points reflect deviations from the estimated mean calculated based on the historical emissions values.

Segments may be defined for the dataset. The segments can represent one or more segments dividing the dataset in halves thirds quarters fifths and the like with each segment being approximately the same size in the visual representation of the gauge . For the example gauge shown in the dataset has been divided into three segments A B C of approximately equal size in terms of visual area in gauge . As such boundary A shows a boundary between two data segments A B and boundary B shows a boundary between two data segments B C.

In calculating the segments and boundaries graphical representation module is operable to use the distribution e.g. empirical distribution normal distribution for the historical environmental data points. For example the segments A B C of may be based on the tercile points of the ordered historical environmental data to divide the historical environmental data into three subsets of generally equal size. The scale may not be the same for each of the segments A B C as the range of data points in each of the segments A B C may not be equal depending on the data set. However even if the range for each of the segments A B C is not equal the segments may still be shown to be of approximately equal size.

As another example the segments A B C of may leverage the 68 95 99.7 rule for normal distributions. System may have approximately equal sized segments for all time intervals to enable all time intervals to be represented within a summary chart as shown in . For such an embodiment the segments A B C represent deviations from the estimated mean. Starting point A is located at the bottom left edge of gauge representing data values furthest from the estimated mean calculated based on the historical environmental data. End point B is located at the bottom right edge of gauge representing data values furthest from the estimated mean calculated based on the historical environmental data.

For example a data segment B may represent average consumption e.g. data points in the first subset divided by a tercile data points proximate to the estimated mean a data segment A may represent lower than average consumption e.g. data points in the second subset divided by a tercile data points well below the estimated mean and a data segment C may represent a higher than average consumption e.g. data points in the third subset divided by a tercile data points well above the estimated mean . Accordingly gauge may be used to compare current consumption values to the typical or average values for historical data e.g. estimated mean for the entity.

For ease of identifying segments different patterns shading colors or other visual cues may be used to distinguish between segments . For example a green yellow red color scheme may be used for the segments to provide a go caution stop visual analogy that a user can understand and interpret from gauge . The green segment A may represent ideal or preferred values i.e. least consumption most efficient the yellow segment B may represent acceptable values i.e. average and the red segment C may represent non ideal worst least preferred values e.g. most consumption least efficient .

Further each segment may have approximately the same number of markers representing different values in relation to the average or mean. However the markers may represent a different range of values for each segment depending on the mechanism used to determine the segments. Other distributions can be provided where there is a segment indicating a preferred range and on either side of the preferred range adjacent segments sequentially less preferred. There may be multiple preferred ranges.

The visual presentations can be augmented to show data in two or three dimensions. A two dimensional representation may introduce another parameter on another axis e.g. time location . For example additional slices of gauge may be shown for different time intervals or locations and stacked showing different snapshots of different times. A three dimensional representation may introduce two additional parameters on two additional axes e.g. time and location .

Returning to the illustrative and non limiting one dimensional representation by gauge scale can be linear non linear linear in sections and non linear in other sections so that the scale values along scale differ in different sections e.g. each segment can represent a different range of values . Values for such sections can be based in part on the number of segments defined. Markers show values along scale in major and minor increments. In this representation scale may be linearly scaled within each segment . Gauge shows a graphical representation where each segment is approximately of equal size where each segment spans approximately the same height along the axis of scale . However as noted each segment may not show an equal range of data points along scale each segment covers a range of datapoints that may not be linear to a range of datapoints in another segment .

Referring to in example embodiments using a normal distribution while segments are approximately of the same size a segment A shows datapoints between 3 and a segment B shows datapoints between and and another segment C shows datapoints between and 3 where is the mean and is the standard deviation.

Markers along the scale may be presented in different colours fonts or emphasis to indicated different segments .

Referring back to segments and scale of gauge provide an indication of an overall distribution of datapoints within a dataset. Gauge also provides an indication of the location of a particular datapoint within the distribution through indicator . As scale represents a range of datapoints for historical environmental data indicator provides a visual marker noting a current environmental data value along scale relative to the historical environmental data. In gauge indicator is presented as a needle within the speedometer paradigm of gauge . This is a non limiting example and other forms of indicators may be used such as a marker along scale . Indicator points to a value along scale relative to the historical environmental data for an entity in order to benchmark current environmental data against the historical environmental data. A second indicator may also be used to represent a target value ideal value best value and the like.

Gauge is presented as a speedometer but other forms may also be used such as a circle square rectangle chart table oval bullseye pie chart and the like. General characteristics for gauge are a scale divided into segments and ranging from a start value A to an end value B. The progression may or may not be linear. The position of the indicator A B can be updated to reflect changing current environmental data. The current environmental data may be received in near real time and the position of the indicator may correspondingly update in near real time. Gauge may provide a snapshot of current environmental data benchmarked against historical environmental data for an entity for a specific time interval.

In accordance with some embodiments the gauge may relate to a particular time interval and may represent historical environmental data for the time interval. The values for the scale may be determined based on the distribution of the historical environmental data.

For example the distribution may be an empirical distribution and the values on the scale may represent historical observed data points. As another example the distribution may be a normal distribution determined based on the estimated mean standard deviation and normal distribution for a time interval. The gauge may illustrate the estimated mean as a specific marker that is in the middle of the scale . The scale may be divided into segments roughly based on the normal distribution of the historical environmental data and may focus on values within 1 standard deviation of the mean. Based on the 68 95 99.7 rule for normal distributions roughly 68 of the environmental data will be within 1 standard deviation from the mean. Environmental data outside 1 standard deviation of the mean will be represented at startpoint A and endpoint B of the scale as they are much less likely to occur but will nevertheless be visually represented to the user as an extreme point on the scale . This enables the gauge to effectively display a spread of deviations of the mean will focusing in on more likely values.

As an example one boundary A may represent standard deviation from the mean and another boundary A may represent standard deviation from the mean. The first data segment B may represent average consumption as values between standard deviation and standard deviation of the estimated mean. The second data segment A may represent lower than average consumption as values more than standard deviation of the estimated mean. The third data segment C may represent a higher than average consumption as values more than standard deviation of the estimated mean. An indicator may move from various positions along scale to represent current environmental data and how it compares to the estimated mean. That is indicator may indicate whether current environmental data for a particular time interval is within the first data segment B average consumption or values between standard deviation and standard deviation of the estimated mean the second data segment A lower than average consumption or values more than standard deviation of the estimated mean or the third data segment C may represent a higher than average consumption as values more than standard deviation of the estimated mean.

The gauge may be divided into the same segments in the same manner e.g. as shown in a non limiting example in to be between standard deviation and standard deviation of the estimated mean more than standard deviation of the estimated mean and more than standard deviation of the estimated mean for different time intervals so that when gauge represents a new time interval the indicator only needs to move to a new position to show how the current environmental data for the new time interval compares to the mean for that time interval. Note that the specific values for the estimated mean and standard deviation may change between time intervals but the position representing the mean and the standard deviation will be the same along the scale between time intervals. This enables the same visual representation for gauge and segments to be used for multiple time intervals.

Further by calculating the segments using the mean standard deviation and normal distribution then more commonly occurring environmental data values e.g. those proximate the mean and standard deviation will be spread out along scale e.g. represented by more markers along the scale and the outliers or less common environmental data values e.g. those far from the mean and standard deviation will be compressed at the extreme ends e.g. startpoint A endpoint B of the scale . This recognizes that the indicator will more often hover around the mean then on the extreme ends of scale e.g. startpoint A endpoint B . This may provide a more meaningful visualization to the user.

Referring now to there is shown another graphical representation of a gauge used to benchmark current environmental data against historical environmental data for an entity based on the normal distribution approximating the distribution for the environmental data. In accordance with some embodiments graphical representation module is operable to calculate three data segments A B C such that the one data segment A represents environmental data within the range 3 

In accordance with the 68 95 99.7 rule for normal distributions the startpoint A may represent values that are 3 and the endpoint may represent values that are 3 . Accordingly the scale may represent environmental values as the compare to the estimated mean ranging between the startpoint A 3 and the endpoint B 3 . The position of the indicator represents the current environmental data for the time interval of interest in order to benchmark the current environmental data against the historical environmental data for the entity. The indicator indicates how the current environmental data compares to the mean or average value calculated based on the historical environmental data.

In accordance with some embodiments a first data segment A represents a lower than average consumption a second data segment B represents an average consumption and a third data segment C represents a higher than average consumption. As noted above calculating the segments based on the estimated mean and standard deviations enables an effective visual display of how current environmental data benchmarks or compares to historical environmental data as the more common values are spread out over the scale and the outliers or less common values are compacted at the extreme ends of scale recognizing that the indicator will be more often hovering around the mean 0.491 and u 0.491 and less likely to be on the extreme ends. Otherwise the indicator may mostly be positioned within a small area of the gauge and it may be difficult for a user to notice fluctuations around the mean 0.491 and 0.491 as the may be represented in a smaller portion of the scale .

In this example the gauge positions the indicator to show actual consumption and the color behind the indicator refers to the segment and the location in the segment . Each segment may be assigned a color to represent the low medium and high usage segments . For example a color green may represent low consumption a yellow may represent average consumption and a red may represent high consumption. The segment map directly to the areas in the corresponding normal distribution at the chosen time interval.

Referring back to in accordance with some embodiments summary module is operable to repeat to for each of a plurality of time intervals in order to generate a summary graphical representation covering multiple time intervals. Summary module is operable to generate a summary graphical representation benchmarking current environmental data against historical environmental data over multiple time intervals such as multiple time intervals covering a business day. The summary graphical representation may include overall data segments for all of the time intervals. The summary graphical representation may represent for each of the time intervals the position representing the current environmental data of the respective time interval within one of the overall data segments. By normalizing the data segments for each time interval using a distribution for the historical environmental data summary module is able to scale the data segments over all time intervals.

The summary graphical representation may be gauge where current environmental data for an entity may be benchmarked against historical environmental data for the same entity over multiple time intervals by showing a changing position of indicator for each individual time interval. The segments A B C may have the same size and position within the summary graphical representation for each individual time interval. The segments A B C may cover the same range or a different range along scale for each individual time interval. As noted in some example embodiments the segments may be calculated using the same methodology for each time interval so that the position of the boundaries and the size of the segments may be static across time intervals even though the underlying values for the mean and the standard deviation may change across time intervals. Essentially by analogy a summary graphical representation may be a stack of gauges where the indicator on each gauge will change depending on the current environmental value for the particular time interval.

Referring now to there is shown an example summary graphical representation as a line chart benchmarking current environmental data against historical environmental data across multiple time intervals. In this particular line chart one axis represents how current environmental data compares to the estimated mean or average range for historical environmental data. The other axis represents multiple time intervals and in this example 15 minute time intervals from 2 AM to 2 PM. The chart is divided into three segments where one segment A represents a lower than average consumption generation a second data segment B represents an average consumption generation and a third data segment C represents a higher than average consumption generation. These segments may correspond to segments of gauge shown in . The segments may be calculated using distributions in the same manner such that the chart represents a summary view of all gauges for multiple time intervals.

The trend line indicates how the current environmental data for an entity compares to the mean of the historical environmental data for the entity for its particular time interval across all the time intervals shown. As noted since the segments may be calculated using the same methodology across all time intervals this facilitates generation of a summary line chart as the same segments and position of the current environmental data relative to segments are shown. Essentially the methodology normalizes each time interval to facilitate generation of a summary chart across all time intervals.

As shown by the trend line the current environmental data may change compared to the mean of the historical environmental data across the time intervals. For a particular time interval a gauge may be used to represent current environmental data benchmarked against the mean of the historical environmental data where the position of the indicator corresponds to the value of the line graph for the time interval. The segments A B C of the gauge for the time interval may correspond to the segments A B C of the summary chart as both segments may be calculated using the same methodology based on the distribution e.g. empirical normal of the historical environmental data.

The line chart is an additional example graphical representation of the statistical benchmarking method. For this non limiting illustrative example the trend line represents kW values over 8 hours compared to the historical distribution. Each data interval is scaled relatively to show relative usage by calculating the segments for each time interval using the same methodology. Essentially the line chart displays a summary of the benchmarking analysis for 8 hours of time intervals. Each interval is calculated similar to the calculations used to generate the gauge . The line chart could be seen as multiple gauges over a period of time.

Energy consumption is an example of environmental data and other types of environmental data may be benchmarked by system such as emission generation activity data and the like. In some example embodiments the environmental data is assumed to have a normal distribution in order to approximate the distribution for the environmental data.

For example referring now to there is shown a gauge benchmarking a current amount of time spent walking or other fitness activity by a user against historical amounts of time spent walking for the user or other users for a particular time interval such as from 9 AM to 6 PM. Walking may represent a health activity or a reduction in emissions for a user as they are not driving etc. The gauge may be divided into three segments where one segment A may represent lower than average amount of walking another segment B may represent an average amount of walking and a further segment C may represent a higher than average amount of walking. The historical environmental data may be specific to a user a group or subset of users or all users tracked by system . The segments may be calculated using the same methodology described herein based the distribution of the environmental data. In some example embodiments an empirical distribution may be calculated and used to determine the segments. In other example embodiments a normal distribution may be used to approximate the distribution for the environmental data and system may estimate a mean and standard deviation for the historical environmental data. As an illustrative example the scale may range from a startpoint A of 0 to an endpoint B of 36 based on historical environmental data for walking activities. The position of the indicator may reflect current environmental data and indicate how it compares to the mean or average range of historical environmental data.

System is operable to generate a graphical representation in the form of a gauge e.g. . The sizes and locations of the scale segments and its boundaries at a given time need to be defined. As shown there may be a boundary for each segment or portion of the graphical representation. As noted herein the values of the ranges for the scale and boundaries may be established via distribution analysis based on historic environmental data for the entity. The boundaries may in turn be used to determine and define the segments. In one embodiment one or both of the boundaries may be determined using such a distribution analysis of environmental data such as consumption data emission values activity data and the like.

For example the segments may represent approximate thirds for a range of consumption levels where the one segment represents the middle third of the distribution one segment represents the low third of the distribution and one segment represents the upper third of the distribution. In some example embodiments system is operable to determine terciles to segment the historical environmental data into thirds. In other example embodiments system is operable to determine the ranges for the segments may be based on the mean or median of the distribution. In other example embodiments the environmental data can be assumed to follow a normal distribution in order to approximate the distribution of the environmental data. The center of the distribution can be considered to be the middle of the middle segment. The center of the distribution can be the mean or median of the consumption values or may be the data points between two terciles for ordered environmental data.

In some example embodiments boundaries may be set at values that are a factor of a standard deviation. In some example embodiments boundaries may also be set based on terciles for ordered environmental data or other mechanism to divide the environmental data into segments. For example a boundary in one embodiment may be set to be of a standard deviation lower the center where is half of of the scale. Another boundary can be set at values that are of a standard deviation above the center. Other factors equations and offsets may be used and other distributions may be used e.g. log normal Pareto Poisson exponential empirical normal and others . For example with a normal distribution at a particular point in time the consumption data can be shown as per gauge where each segment is approximately the same size. It will be appreciated that other factors for boundary values can be applied e.g. of a standard deviation quartiles of the environmental data etc. .

Different methodologies may be used to determine specific boundaries for segments for environmental data. In one embodiment a distribution can be generated or determined from environmental data for an entity for a previous period of time. For a business entity the period of time may be measured in business days e.g. consumption data for the previous twenty 20 business days. Any range of historical environmental data may be used e.g. from 0 day to 3 years or more .

One illustrative example embodiment may examinee current energy consumption for an entity at continuous points in time and compares the value to historical consumption values for the entity. In some embodiments system estimates the mean and standard deviation at a particular time point for the data based a modeling assumption that the distribution of data values follows a normal distribution. Other distributions may also be used. A boundary for the medium and higher segment may be set by one or more parameters. In one embodiment one parameter is used and is set to approximately 0.5 in another example embodiment it is set at 0.49 of a standard deviation above the mean. Using the same parameter a boundary for the medium and lower segment is set at approximately 0.5 of a standard deviation below the mean. With these boundaries approximately one third of the consumption values at a point in time over the historical period are located in the higher segment i.e. at or above the boundary between the middle and higher segment approximately one third of the consumption values at that time are located in the middle segment and approximately one third of the consumption values are located in the lower segment. Other values for portions of a standard deviation can be used or other parameters may also be used such as quartiles of ordered environmental data to divide the data into groups. That is different values can be used for the upper and lower segments and the examples provided herein are illustrative and non limiting.

At a given point in time gauge may show its segments as evenly spaced segments with the current datapoint centered in the middle of the middle segment. The boundaries between the segments may be determined using different mechanisms such as based on quartiles of ordered environmental data portions of the standard deviation 0.49 or as noted in the examples and the like. In some example embodiments the boundaries of the segments in gauge may map to the boundaries of bands in chart at the relevant time interval for example. In another embodiment visual presentation of the scale of each of the segments can be varied.

In some distributions the lower and or middle segments may have a concentrated number of values therein thereby leading to a skewing of the weighting of the distributions. As such if the bands or segments were displayed in a linear manner the lower and or middle segments would occupy a very small portion of gauge . In such situations the y axis may be adjusted to widen the scale where there is a higher concentration of values and or shrink the scale where there is a lower concentration. This adjustment of boundaries can be applied to any graphical representation of data described herein for example to gauge and chart .

Referring now to there is shown a flowchart diagram that illustrates the basic steps taken by system to compute emission values for an activity. The emission values and activity data are examples of environmental data that may be benchmarked. Benchmarking module is operable to benchmark current emission values against historical emission values for an entity using the methodology described herein based on an estimated mean and standard deviation for historical environmental data. System is operable to use a distribution model for emission values. For example system may use an empirical distribution for historical emission values. As another example system may assume that emission values follow a normal distribution in order to approximate the distribution for the emission values. System is operable to generate a graphical representation for benchmarking emission values with segmentation based on a distribution of the historical emission values. In some example the segmentation may be based on an estimated mean and standard deviation for historical emission values.

The process begins at where the input module receives raw activity data to define a record for an activity. The raw activity data may include an activity type a time interval a location a unit of measure and a consumption value. System stores the raw activity data in a storage module . This raw activity data is an example of environmental data that may be benchmarked by system .

For example the activity may be a three day SUV rental from Dec. 30 2007 through Jan. 1 2008 and the raw activity data may include 

At the calculation engine converts the raw activity data into one or more standardized activities and stores the standardized activity data in the activity database. The standardized activity data is an example of environmental data that may be benchmarked by system .

For this example the calculation engine converts the raw activity data into three standardized activities each with a 1 day time interval. The calculation engine divides the total distance evenly 250 km day and distributes the fuel consumption evenly 25 L day over the three standardized activities. The calculation engine determines that the input label for each standardized activity is distance driven based on the activity type.

At calculation engine computes a location hierarchy corresponding to the location of the activity. Referring to the example the location hierarchy may be Toronto Ontario Canada World.

At the calculation engine computes factor data corresponding to the location hierarchy and the time intervals for each standardized activity. As noted above in some instances the optimal emission equation will be selected see before the calculation engine computes the factor data because the emission equation may be associated with a specific protocol which may dictate which factors to use. The calculation engine associates each factor with a source e.g. protocol third party database location s a valid start date and a valid end date.

The calculation engine determines which factors are valid for the location hierarchy and the time interval of the standardized activity. If the calculation engine determines that multiple valid factors are available for the standardized activity then the calculation engine ranks the valid factors from the most accurate to the least accurate to compute a list of ranked valid factors each standardized activity. The accuracy of each factor may be associated with each factor as metadata and used by the calculation engine to rank the factors.

The calculation engine is operable to use the list of to calculate the emission values for each standardized activity.

Referring to the example the calculation engine may determine that three emission factors are associated with SUVs 1 a factor sourced from the GHG protocol valid for Ontario for January December 2007 2 a factor sourced from the Ontario Government valid for January December 2008 3 a factor sourced from an independent one day study by a Toronto car company valid for Dec. 31 2007. The factor data module will rank each of these factors based on accuracy and compute the following ranked factor list 3 1 2 . The emission value for the standardized activity for Dec. 30 2007 will be computed using factor 1 as it is the only valid factor available. The standardized activity for Dec. 31 2007 will use factor 1 as it is more accurate than the other valid factor 2 . The emission value for the standardized activity for Jan. 1 2008 will be computed using factor 3 as it is the only valid factor available.

At the calculation engine computes reference data relevant to the standardized activities. As noted above raw activity data may be stored as reference data. For example vehicle type SUV name Ford Escape fuel efficiency averages 10 L 100 km and fuel type gasoline engine may be stored as reference data and retrieved by the reference data module for use in the emission value calculation. If only some raw activity data is provided such as only the name of the SUV Ford Escape then the calculation engine may lookup reference data associated with the provided raw activity data such as the fuel efficiency for a Ford Escape in a database of fuel efficiencies that may be maintained by government or automobile industry association e.g. EPA database of car fuel efficiencies .

At calculation engine determines at least one optimal emission equation using at least some of the standardized activity data the reference data and the factor data.

The calculation engine is operable to store emission equations in the emission database and associate each emission equation with a valid time interval a protocol and an activity type. The calculation engine searches the emission database to determine a set of emission equations that match at least some of the standardized activity data the computed reference data and the computed factor data. The calculation engine ranks each emission equation in the set of emission equations with respect to the accuracy of each emission equation given the standardized activity data the computed reference data and the computed factor data. Finally the calculation engine selects an optimal emission equation from the ranked set of emission equations for use in calculating the emission value.

Referring to our example the calculation engine computes and ranks a set of equations for computing the emission value e.g. CO2 emissions for gasoline consumed for each standardized activity. The ranked set of equations may include the United Nations protocol equation and GHG protocol equation where the UN protocol equation is more accurate but only valid from Jan. 1 2008.

For example the optimal emission equation may be distance driven car fuel efficiency emission factor car fuel type location date where distance driven is the input label car fuel efficiency is reference data emission factor car fuel type location date is factor data and reference data.

At the calculation engine computes at least one emission value for the activity using the at least one optimal emission equation. The calculation engine may compute multiple emission values in order to compute a final emission value for the activity. For example the calculation engine may compute an emission value for each of the standardized activities and then aggregate all the emission values to compute a final emission value for the entire activity. The computed emission values are examples of environmental data that may be benchmarked by system .

For the above example for the first and seconds day of the journey the calculation engine calculates the emission value e.g. CO2 emissions using the GHG Protocol equation. For the third day of the journey the emission equation changes within the time interval of the activity when the United Nations Protocol becomes valid. The emission values calculated for the first and second day using the GHG protocol equation are recorded and the new UN Protocol equation is used to calculate the emission value for the third day of the journey. Accordingly the calculation engine may calculate a value for each standardized activity using the most accurate and valid equation for that standardized activity instead of using the same equation to calculate the emission value for the activity as a whole. This allows the calculation engine to use the most accurate emission equation for part of the calculation even though the emission equation is only valid for a portion of the time interval of the whole activity i.e. Dec. 30 2007 to Jan. 1 2008 . The calculation engine calculates the total emissions for the journey as the sum of the emission values e.g. CO2 emitted for each of the three days standardized activities that comprised the activity.

At the system stores the at least one emission value in storage module which may be implemented using a data storage device. The system may also transmit the emission values. Other components such as the enterprise client or the API can access the computed emission value s e.g. environmental data through the ESB .

Another example activity may be providing 2000 kWh of electricity to a Toronto office from Jan. 1 2007 to Mar. 3 2007 where 90 of the electricity came from the grid and 10 came from green sources. Generally the steps will be as described above subject to modifications described below.

The calculation engine breaks the raw activity data into standardized activities of a standard time measure one for each day and converts to standard units. The emission calculation engine determines two input labels green electricity consumed and grid electricity consumed. Associating two input labels with each standardized activity provides an indication to the calculation engine that two emission values will be calculated for each standardized activity.

The calculation engine compute the factor and reference data for each standardized activity given the location hierarchy and time interval. To avoid repetitive lookups the emission calculation engine may store the computed data in a cache for use in determining the two emission values for each standardized activity green and grid electricity . The cached data may also be re used to compute the emission values for all of the standardized activities as some factor and reference data may be valid for more than one standardized activity.

The calculation engine will determine optimal emission equations and compute two emission values for each standardized activity one emission value for green electricity consumed and another emission value for grid electricity consumed. In order to determine a total emission value for each standardized activity the calculation engine will apply the reference data 10 green and 90 grid and combine the calculated emission values.

This example illustrates that raw activity data may be composed of nested raw activity data elements green and grid which results in multiple emission values being computed for each standardized activity green electricity consumed and grid electricity consumed .

As another example the activity may be the waste generated by the Toronto office from Feb. 1 to 28 2009. The input module receives the raw activity data from a bill issued by the supplier Waste Management Inc. which breaks 1000 KG of waste into the following types of waste 

If a bill issued by a supplier does not provide a break down of waste types and only provides the total amount of waste generated then the data provisioning module may access industry averages or customer averages in order to estimate a break down.

The calculation engine stores reference data for each type of waste e.g. metals 8 for later recall. The data provisioning module also determines that the activity type is composed of 7 reference data types e.g. metals glass . The emission calculation engine converts the raw activity data into standardized activities and determines that the input label is waste consumed based on the activity type. The emission calculation engine determines that the optimal emission equation is waste consumed emission factor waste type 

The calculation engine calculates 7 emission values for each standardized activity one for each type of waste and recalls the reference data relating to the type of waste e.g. metals 8 in order to calculate a final emission value for each standardized activity.

Another example activity similar to waste is recycling. The raw activity data and the reference data is similarly broken down into the types of material recycled e.g. metal glass paper cardboard plastic etc. and the input label is recycling consumed .

As another example the activity may be consuming 200 KG of compost in California in June 2008. The calculation engine will determine that the input label is compost consumed . For this example no reference data may be required since the calculation engine may maintain only one emission factor for all things compostable. The calculation engine compute a negative emission value for this activity type.

As a further example the activity may be flying from Toronto YYZ to London LHR on Aug. 31 2009. The calculation engine will convert the raw activity data into one standardized activity since the system may use the default time interval of one day for all flights regardless if the flight spans multiple days. For the activity type flying the calculation engine pre processes the raw activity data to determine the flight distance. The reference data module is operable to maintain a database of airport information e.g. list of airports IATA code longitude latitude to lookup data for the departure location and destination location. The calculation engine may calculate the flight distance using an iterative approach such as the Vincenty algorithm and then returns the calculated flight distance to the emission calculation engine . The calculation engine may provide the calculation engine with multiple emission factors for the flight depending on the altitude reached during the flight the applicable protocol the type of the airplane etc.

As another example the activity may be heating a home in Vancouver from Mar. 1 to 31 2009 using 1000 mof natural gas. The input module may receive a bill from one or more suppliers. The calculation engine may create a record for each supplier or if a record for the supplier already exists then it may recall previously stored information regarding the supplier. In this example the home is heated using only natural gas however if multiple gas or fuels types are used then the calculation engine can create standardized activities for each gas or fuel type as in the electricity example. Alternatively the different fuel types could form sub types of a single standardized activity as in the waste example. For this example the reference data includes fuel type and the input label is fuel consumed. In this example the amount of fuel used was provided as the fuel dimension volume e.g. 1000 m however the fuel may also be provided in another fuel dimension such as energy e.g. 10 000 BTU .

As a further example the activity may be using 500 sheets of 8.5 11 office paper from Jan. 1 to 31 2008 at the Montreal office. The reference data would be paper type office paper and paper size 8.5 11 and the input label would be paper consumed . The amount of paper used may be expressed in sheet or other units such as reams. The calculation engine may use the following optimal emission equation factor data and reference data paper consumed paper size.area paper type emission factor paper type 

The above described activities are examples only and the system may compute an emission value for many other activities such as dry cleaning washing a car watering the lawn etc.

The components of the system may implement the functionality described herein and organize the data used generated and updated by system by defining multiple data classes and tables.

System is operable to compute emission values for an organization over a period of time and benchmarking module is operable to benchmark computed emission values for the organization against other computed emission values for the same organization. This enables organization to compare its emission values to identify problem areas and reduce its emission generation.
