This application is based on Japanese Patent Application Serial No. 2012 165627 filed with the Japan Patent Office on Jul. 26 2012 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

The present disclosure relates to a fixing device for applying an image fixing process to a sheet and an image forming apparatus provided with the same.

Conventionally in an image forming apparatus for forming an image on a sheet a toner image is formed on a photoconductive drum and transferred to the sheet in a transfer unit. The image forming apparatus further includes a fixing unit and the sheet having the toner image transferred thereto is discharged after a fixing process is applied in the fixing unit.

In the fixing unit the sheet is passed through a fixing nip portion formed between a fixing roller and a pressure roller whereby the fixing process is applied to the sheet. Conventionally a fixing unit is known which includes a fixing roller which is inserted into a fixing sleeve and whose diameter increases with an increase in the temperature of the fixing sleeve and a pressure roller which is held in contact with the outer circumferential surface of the fixing sleeve and sandwiches the fixing sleeve between the pressure roller and the fixing roller. The fixing sleeve is loosely fitted on the fixing roller at an ordinary temperature whereas the fixing sleeve is closely fitted on the fixing roller when the fixing sleeve reaches a fixing temperature.

In the above technology when the pressure roller is nipped by the fixing roller when the fixing roller is heated an elastic layer of the fixing roller is largely compressed. Thus a drive torque for rotating the fixing roller or the pressure roller becomes higher.

The present disclosure was developed in view of the above problem and aims to provide a fixing device capable of suppressing an increase in a drive torque for rotating a roller and an image forming apparatus provided with the same.

A fixing device according to one aspect of the present disclosure includes a heat source a fixing roller a pressure roller an elastic layer a pressing portion a restricting portion and a driving unit. The fixing roller is heated by the heat source. The pressure roller is held in contact with the fixing roller and forms a fixing nip portion through which a sheet is to be passed between the pressure roller and the fixing roller. The elastic layer is formed on a circumferential surface or an inner layer of the fixing roller or the pressure roller. The pressing portion presses one roller of the fixing roller and the pressure roller against the other roller while compressing the elastic layer. The restricting portion restricts a compression amount of the elastic layer lest the compression amount should exceed a preset compression amount when the pressing portion presses the roller. The driving unit drives and rotates one of the fixing roller and the pressure roller in a state where the compression amount is restricted by the restricting portion.

An image forming apparatus according to another aspect of the present disclosure includes an image forming unit and the above fixing device. The image forming unit forms an image on a sheet.

An outer diameter of a base end part of the first shaft portion near the housing side wall portion is set to be slightly larger than that of a leading end part. A contact surface A contacted portion is formed on the circumferential surface of the base end part.

The pressure roller bearing portion is a bearing portion fitted in a substantially vertical central part of the pressing side wall portion . The pressure roller bearing portion rotatably supports a pressure roller shaft S which is a rotary shaft of the pressure roller .

The engaging hole is a hole portion which is open on a downward projecting part of the pressing side wall portion . The base end part of the third shaft portion of the fixing housing is inserted into the engaging hole . As a result the pressing housing is rotatable about the third shaft portion of the fixing housing .

The biasing portion is arranged on an upper left end part of the pressing side wall portion . Further the biasing portion is arranged at a side of the pressure roller bearing portion opposite to the engaging hole . The biasing portion includes an upper wall A and a biasing wall B. The upper wall A is a wall portion extending forward from the upper end edge of the pressing side wall portion . Further the biasing wall B is a wall portion extending forward from an upper end part of the left end edge of the pressing side wall portion . The biasing wall B is arranged to intersect with the upper wall A. Further a hole portion C opening is arranged in the biasing wall B. The hole portion C is a hole portion formed to face the fixing housing .

The restricting contact portion is a projecting piece formed by a part of the left end edge of the pressing side wall portion projecting leftwardly between the biasing portion and the pressure roller bearing portion in a vertical direction. According to the rotation of the pressing housing the restricting contact portion can come into contact with the contact surface A of the fixing housing . In other words the restricting portion for restricting an inter axis distance between the pressure roller and the fixing roller is formed by the restricting contact portion and the contact surface A. The restricting portion restricts a compression amount of the elastic layer B of the fixing roller lest the compression amount should exceed a preset compression amount when the pressing portion to be described later presses the pressure roller . At this time the restricting portion restricts the compression amount of the elastic layer B by restricting the inter axis distance between the fixing roller and the pressure roller lest the inter axis distance should become equal to or shorter than a preset distance.

Further the fixing device includes the pressing portion .

Further the load shaft is a cylindrical member extending rightwardly from an upper end part of the traction piece . The load shaft extends through the hole portion C of the pressing housing . The load shaft includes a base end portion A a main portion B and a flange portion C. The base end portion A is coupled to the traction piece at the left side of the biasing wall B.

When the traction piece is rotated about the supporting point portion first shaft portion the load shaft is laterally slidable. In other words the load shaft is relatively slidable with respect to the biasing wall B.

The detection piece is a projecting piece projecting forwardly from the traction piece . When the traction piece is rotated about the supporting point portion the detection piece is laterally moved. At this time the detection piece is detected by an unillustrated sensor fixed to the fixing housing whereby the rotation of the drive transmission piece is stopped. Specifically if a nip pressure in the fixing nip portion N reaches a preset value in pressing the pressure roller against the fixing roller the above sensor detects the detection piece and the pressing of the pressure roller is stopped.

The biasing spring is externally fitted on the load shaft and compressibly arranged between the jaw portion C of the load shaft and the biasing wall B. When the load shaft is slid leftwardly the biasing spring is compressed and deformed to bias the biasing wall B leftwardly. A pressing force exerted to the fixing roller by the pressure roller is adjusted by the biasing spring . When a fixing process is applied to a sheet P in the fixing device a steady load state is maintained by the biasing spring in the fixing nip portion N of the fixing roller and the pressure roller .

The pressing driving unit includes a pressing motor the drive gear the idler gear and the drive transmission gear . The pressing motor generates a drive force for pressing the pressure roller against the fixing roller . The drive of the pressing motor is controlled by the control unit to be described later. The drive gear is coupled to the pressing motor and transmits a rotational drive force to the idler gear . The drive gear is rotatably mounted on an unillustrated rotary shaft fixed to the drive shaft hole .

The control unit is electrically connected to the pressing motor the drive motor and the IH unit . The control unit controls drive conditions of the pressing motor and the drive gear . Further the control unit heats the fixing roller by controlling the IH unit .

Next a control of heating and driving the fixing device is described with reference to in addition to . is a chart showing nip amounts of the fixing roller and the pressure roller . In NIP 0 means a state where the circumferential surfaces of the fixing roller and the pressure roller start contacting. Further NIP 1 NIP 2 and NIP 3 mean nip amounts in the fixing nip portion N i.e. a sequence of nip pressures and the nip amount increases from NIP 1 to NIP 3 . Note that in this embodiment the nip amount in the fixing nip portion N in a state of NIP 2 is set at 1 to 1.5 mm. Further is a graph showing linear speeds circumferential speeds of the fixing roller and the pressure roller and the temperature of the fixing roller when the fixing roller is heated to a preset temperature.

In when the image forming apparatus is powered on the fixing device starts a warm up operation in preparation for the fixing process. In starting the warm up operation the control unit controls the pressing portion and the pressure roller is pressed against the fixing roller .

The pressing operation of the pressure roller is described in more detail. The control unit drives and rotates the pressing motor . As a result the rotational force of the pressing motor is transmitted to the drive gear the idler gear and the drive transmission gear . At this time the drive transmission gear is rotated clockwise in . When the drive transmission gear is rotated the drive input piece is rotated in a direction of an arrow D by the engagement of the drive transmission gear and the gear portion . Specifically the drive transmission piece is rotated about the supporting point portion and the traction piece is rotated in a direction of an arrow D. According to the rotation of the traction piece the load shaft is pulled leftwardly to compress the biasing spring . When the biasing spring is compressed a reaction force is generated in the biasing spring and the biasing wall B is biased leftwardly by the biasing spring . As a result the pressing housing is rotated in a direction of an arrow D of about the third shaft portion . According to the rotation of the pressing housing the pressure roller supported on the pressure roller bearing portions is pressed against the fixing roller . Note that the pressing operation of the pressure roller against the fixing roller at this time is indicated by STEP in .

When the drive transmission piece is rotated and the fixing roller continues to be pressed by the pressure roller the restricting contact portion of the pressing housing eventually comes into contact with the contact surface A of the fixing housing . As a result the inter axis distance between the fixing roller and the pressure roller distance between the fixing roller shaft S and the pressure roller shaft S is temporarily fixed. As a result the nip amount in the fixing nip portion N between the fixing roller and the pressure roller is substantially fixed at NIP 2 in a state indicated by RESTRICTED POSITION X of .

After the restricting contact portion comes into contact with the contact surface A the drive transmission piece is rotated while the biasing spring continues to be compressed. When the detection piece of the drive transmission piece is detected by the unillustrated sensor the rotation of the drive transmission piece by the pressing motor is stopped. The control unit controls the IH unit to start the warm up operation of the fixing roller after the pressing operation of the pressure roller is finished. The fixing roller is gradually heated from an environmental temperature represented by an ordinary temperature. Simultaneously the control unit controls the drive motor to drive and rotate the pressure roller . As a result the fixing roller is rotated by the rotation of the pressure roller . Note that in this embodiment the control unit drives and rotates the pressure roller at a rotation speed V faster than a rotation speed V of the pressure roller during a normal fixing process in the warm up operation .

With reference to when the warm up operation is performed the temperature of the fixing roller is increased and the elastic layer B of the fixing roller thermally expands. As a result the pressure roller is slightly pushed back in a direction away from the fixing roller by the thermal expansion of the elastic layer B STEP of . At this time the restricting contact portion held in contact with the contact surface A is separated from the contact surface A.

When it is detected by an unillustrated temperature sensor that the fixing roller has been heated to a preset temperature Ready the warm up operation of the fixing roller is completed. As a result a thermal expansion force of the elastic layer B of the fixing roller and a biasing force of the biasing spring are balanced and the nip amount in the fixing nip portion N is set at NIP 1 of . The fixing roller and the pressure roller can perform a sheet fixing process at a preset fixing temperature and the nip amount NIP 1 in the fixing nip portion N. At this time the control unit controls the drive motor to reduce the rotation speed of the pressure roller fixing roller to the normal rotation speed V .

As just described in the warm up operation of the fixing device in this embodiment the pressing portion causes the pressure roller to be pressed against the fixing roller while compressing the elastic layer B arranged on the circumferential surface of the fixing roller before the heating of the fixing roller by the IH unit is started. At this time the restricting portion configured by the restricting contact portion and the contact surface A restricts the inter axis distance between the fixing roller and the pressure roller to be equal to or longer than the predetermined distance in the compression process of the elastic layer B. As a result the compression amount of the elastic layer B is restricted so as not to exceed the preset compression amount NIP 2 . The drive motor drives and rotates the pressure roller with the inter axis distance restricted by the restricting portion . Thus the drive motor can drive and rotate the pressure roller without the elastic layer B being excessively compressed. As a result an increase in a drive torque of the drive motor is suppressed.

Particularly with reference to if the pressure roller continues to be pressed against the fixing roller by the biasing force of the biasing spring when the restricting portion is not arranged the nip amount in the fixing nip portion N reaches NIP 3 STEPA of . This is because the apparent hardness of the elastic layer B is low and the elastic layer B is easily deformed compressed before the warm up operation is started. In this case a rotation load between the fixing roller and the pressure roller is increased by the nip amount NIP 3 larger than the normally used nip amounts NIP 1 and NIP 2 . Thus if the pressure roller is driven and rotated and the warm up operation is started in a state of NIP 3 the drive torque of the drive motor for driving and rotating the pressure roller is drastically increased. If the warm up operation progresses and the elastic layer B thermally expands in a state of increased drive torque the nip amount in the fixing nip portion N changes to NIP 1 STEPA of . As a result a large load acts on the drive motor .

Further according to the above embodiment the pressing portion presses the pressure roller against the fixing roller by biasing the pressing housing toward the fixing housing . Thus the fixing nip portion N between the fixing roller and the pressure roller can be stably formed.

Further the inter axis distance between the fixing roller and the pressure roller is maintained at the predetermined distance by the contact of the restricting contact portion with the contact surface A in the compression process of the elastic layer B by the pressing portion . Thus excessive compression of the elastic layer B is preferably suppressed.

Further when the fixing roller is heated and the elastic layer B thermally expands the restricting contact portion is separated from the contact surface A. Thus a contact load between the fixing roller and the pressure roller is stably maintained while a thermal expansion force of the elastic layer B and a pressing force of the pressing portion are balanced.

Further the drive motor drives and rotates the pressure roller at the rotation speed V faster than at the time of sheet passage until the fixing roller is heated to the predetermined temperature. Thus a temperature increasing time of the fixing roller can be shortened in a state where the drive torque of the drive motor is reduced.

Further the fixing housing includes the pair of housing side wall portions with the fixing roller bearing portion for rotatably supporting the fixing roller and the third shaft portion projecting from the housing side wall portion in the axial direction of the fixing roller . Further the pressing housing includes the pair of pressing side wall portions with the pressure roller bearing portion for rotatably supporting the pressure roller and the engaging hole arranged on the pressing side wall portion and engaged with the third shaft portion . The pressing portion presses the pressure roller against the fixing roller by rotating the pressing housing about the third shaft portions . Thus the fixing nip portion N is stably formed by the rotation of the pressing housing .

Further the pressure roller is pressed against the fixing roller by the drive transmission piece the biasing portion and the biasing spring . When the pressure roller is pressed against the fixing roller according to the rotation of the pressing housing the elastic layer B of the fixing roller is compressed. The restricting contact portion of the press side wall portion comes into contact with the contact surface A of the first shaft portion projecting from the housing side wall portion in the compression process of the elastic layer B. Thus the compression amount of the elastic layer B is preferably restricted by the rotation of the pressing housing relative to the fixing housing .

Further the pressure roller is preferably pressed against the fixing roller by the drive transmission from the pressing driving unit to the gear portion . Although the fixing device and the image forming apparatus according to the embodiment of the present disclosure have been described above the present disclosure is not limited to this and can be for example modified as follows.

 1 Although the elastic layer B is arranged on the fixing roller in the above embodiment the present disclosure is not limited to this. The elastic layer B may be arranged on the fixing roller and the pressure roller or only on the pressure roller . Further the fixing nip portion N may be formed by pressing the fixing roller against the pressure roller . Furthermore the drive motor is not limited to a mode of driving and rotating the pressure roller and may drive and rotate the fixing roller .

 2 Further although the restricting portion is composed of the restricting contact portion and the contact surface A in the above embodiment the present disclosure is not limited to this. Any mode may be adopted if the restricting portion is configured to restrict the inter axis distance between the fixing roller and the pressure roller so that the inter axis distance becomes equal to or longer than the preset distance in the compression process of the elastic layer B. The pressing side wall portions of the pressing housing and the housing side wall portions of the fixing housing may be directly brought into contact.

Although the present disclosure has been fully described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings it is to be understood that various changes and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Therefore unless otherwise such changes and modifications depart from the scope of the present disclosure hereinafter defined they should be construed as being included therein.
