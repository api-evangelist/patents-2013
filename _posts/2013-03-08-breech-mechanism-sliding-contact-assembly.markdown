title: Breech mechanism sliding contact assembly
abstract: A breech mechanism sliding contact assembly that allows for ignition, gun ground, and ammunition data link circuits to be broken while the breechblock is open. The sliding contact assembly further allows these circuits to be reconnected when the breechblock is closed. The breech mechanism sliding contact assembly comprises two separate connectors: a block slide connector that assembles to the breechblock and a ring slide connector that assembles to the breech ring. The two connectors operate in compact, pre-existing headspaces between the breechblock and the breech ring.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.

The present invention relates to a breech mechanism for cannon and it more particularly relates to a breech mechanism sliding contact assembly that provides power and data connections to the ignition gun ground and ammunition data link ADL interconnections from the breech ring to the breechblock of a gun breech mechanism while still maintaining the open and close functionality of the breechblock.

A cannon is generally designed to enable the delivery of a projectile over a great distance or to enable the fired projectile to have greater armor penetration. However when a rapid fire cannon is required a sliding wedge type of breech mechanism assembly is preferably used. This assembly is normally of simple construction and employs a rectangular wedge shaped block securely seated in a slot in the breech ring with its longitudinal axis perpendicular to the bore of the cannon tube. However this assembly must necessarily be of a heavy section to provide the strength necessary to withstand the highly concentrated firing stresses produced therein.

In addition the evolution of large caliber ordnance with sophisticated projectiles firing systems target proximity detection devices precision arming and detonating circuits and other electronic systems have added to the complexity of transmitting power and data to the respective components. This problem is particularly accentuated with the limited accessibility to the breech block assembly without affecting the integrity of the ordnance.

Therefore a need arises for a breech mechanism sliding contact assembly that provides power and data connections to the ignition gun ground and ammunition data link ADL interconnections from the breech ring to the breechblock of a gun while still maintaining the open and close functionality of the breechblock. The need for such a breech mechanism sliding contact assembly has heretofore remained unsatisfied.

The present invention addresses the foregoing concerns and presents a new breech mechanism sliding contact assembly that allows for ignition gun ground and ammunition data link ADL circuits to be broken while the breechblock is open. The sliding contact assembly further allows these circuits to be reconnected when the breechblock is closed.

The sliding contact assembly provides power and data interconnections to the smart ammunition and the munitions firing contact which are bundled together in the breechblock insert assembly. The data link provides bi directional data flow to and from the smart round and fire control system once the round is loaded into the chamber. The firing contact provides a path for electrical ignition of the round.

To this end three signal interconnections and a system ground are packaged into two separate connectors one that assembles to the breechblock and the other to the breech ring of the breech mechanism. The unique geometries of these components allow for the sliding contact assembly to operate in a small pre existing area or spacing between the breechblock and the breech ring. This spacing is referred to as the headspace. 

The compact design of the sliding contact assembly also allows for the breechblock to be removed without having to disassemble either contact housing.

To this end the sliding contact assembly includes two modules or slide connectors that fit within the breechblock headspace and the breech ring headspace. As a result the sliding contact assembly allows for ignition gun ground and ammunition data link circuits to be broken while the breechblock is open. The sliding contact assembly further allows these circuits to be reconnected when the breechblock is closed.

The first module of the sliding contact assembly is the block slide connector which is assembled to the breechblock within the breechblock headspace. The second module of the sliding contact assembly is the ring slide connector which is assembled to the breech ring within the breech ring headspace. The compact design of the sliding contact assembly allows it to function in the head space areas of the breech mechanism which minimizes the overall breech space claim.

Similar numerals refer to similar elements in the drawings. It should be understood that the sizes of the different components in the figures are not necessarily in exact proportion or to scale and are shown for visual clarity and for the purpose of explanation.

With reference to the present invention provides a new sliding contact assembly that is designed for assembly to a breech mechanism of a gun or gun system . In this particular exemplary embodiment the gun generally includes the breech mechanism and a gun tube .

The breech mechanism is generally formed of a breech ring and a breechblock as is known or available in the field. As illustrated in the breech mechanism defines two small chambers or areas . The first chamber is defined between the breechblock and the breech ring and is referred to herein as the breechblock headspace . The second chamber is defined within the breech ring and is referred to herein as the breech ring headspace .

With further reference to the sliding contact assembly includes two modules or slide connectors that fit within the breechblock headspace and the breech ring headspace . As a result the sliding contact assembly allows for ignition gun ground and ammunition data link ADL circuits to be broken while the breechblock is open. The sliding contact assembly further allows these circuits to be reconnected when the breechblock is closed.

The first module of the sliding contact assembly is referred to as the block slide connector and is assembled to the breechblock within the breechblock headspace as it will be explained later in greater detail. The second module of the sliding contact assembly is referred to as the ring slide connector and is assembled to the breech ring within the breech ring headspace as it will be explained later in greater detail.

The unique geometries of the block slide connector and the ring slide connector allow for the sliding contact assembly to operate with minimal design modification to the breech mechanism or the operation of the gun .

The sliding contact assembly provides a signal path for the firing and ADL circuits from the breech ring to the movable breechblock while still allowing the breechblock to operate as designed thereby enabling communication with a smart munition or round that is chambered in the gun tube .

The compact design allows the sliding contact assembly to function in the head space areas of the breech mechanism which minimizes the overall breech space claim. The reciprocating compression springs and unique contact designs of the sliding contact assembly allow for the removal and installation of the breechblock without having to remove either one of the block slide connector or the ring slide connector from the breech mechanism .

Considering now the block slide connector with reference to it is shown assembled to the breechblock . The breech mechanism is illustrated in an open position with the breechblock disengaged from the breech ring . The block slide connector terminates in a set of block slide connector contacts that are positioned to engage and to establish electrical connection with a corresponding set of contacts or contact assembly that form part of the ring slide connector when the breech mechanism is closed.

Considering now the ring slide connector with reference to it is shown assembled to the breechblock . As with the breech mechanism is illustrated in an open position. The ring slide connector includes terminates in a set of ring slide connector contacts that are positioned to engage and to establish electrical connection with the corresponding set of block slide connector contacts upon closure of the breech mechanism .

The block slide connector is assembled to the breechblock of the breech mechanism before the ring slide connector is assembled to the breech ring of the breech mechanism . The breechblock can be installed with the breechblock whether removed or assembled to the gun .

As the breechblock opens and closes compression springs that are housed within the block slide connector reciprocate in and out due to the ramp ring slide connector contacts that are rigidly mounted within the ring slide connector . The compression springs keep a constant force on both the block slide connector contacts and the ring slide connector contacts in order to maintain electrical connectivity until the breechblock is opened again.

The design construction and assembly of the block slide connector will now be described in more detail in connection with . illustrate the block slide connector as generally comprising a housing an electrical connector an insulator cover an insulator block two screws a set of compression springs and a set of block slide connector sliding contacts .

The housing is generally L shaped and is preferably made of an electrically conductive material such as steel to provide a good connection to gun ground. The housing defines an opening in which the electrical connector is firmly seated and secured. The housing further includes a plurality of openings for receiving retaining screws as it will be explained later in connection with .

The electrical connector provides connectivity to external power and or data sources for transmission to the various circuits of the gun system via a set of electrical conductors . Preferably but not exclusively the set of electrical conductors includes three conductors of similar type and gauge. A ground wire is connected at one end to ground by means of a screw and further extends alongside the set of electrical conductors .

The insulator cover and the insulator block ensure the insulation of the set of electrical conductors and the ground conductor .

The two screws lock both the insulator cover and the insulator block to the housing by engaging the openings and respectively.

The set of compression springs preferably includes four compression springs one for each conductor of the set of electrical conductors and the ground wire . The compression springs are housed within four corresponding openings formed within the insulator block .

The compression springs abut at one of their ends a stop or platform defined by the housing and at their other ends they abut the block slide connector sliding contacts . These sliding contacts partly enter the openings of the insulator block and compress the compression springs .

The block slide connector is assembled by seating and securing the electrical connector within the opening of the housing . The insulator block is then seated against the stop of the housing and the insulator cover is placed atop the insulator block . The insulator cover is then fastened to the housing by means of the screws thus securing both the insulator cover and the insulator block to the housing .

The electrical conductors are then passed through openings in the insulator cover and the insulator block . The compression springs are slipped over the electrical conductors and seated within the opening of the insulator block . The ends of the electrical conductors that protrude through the compression springs are secured to the tips of the corresponding block slide connector contacts by for example crimping or soldering.

The block adapter is assembled to the block slide connector by means of two mounting screws or bolts . This assembly is then secured to the breechblock by means of two mounting screws or bolts that penetrate two through openings formed in the block adapter .

The design construction and assembly of the ring slide connector will now be described in more detail in connection with . illustrate the ring slide connector as generally comprising a housing or body an electrical connector assembly and the ring slide connector contacts .

The housing is generally L shaped and is preferably made of an electrically insulating material such as polyether ether keytone PEEK or nylon. The housing defines a platform that is integrally formed with a receptacle . The platform and the receptacle are generally disposed at approximately 90 degrees relative to each other.

The platform is shaped in such a way as to engage the ring slide connector contacts and to retain them securely by means of a set of four screws or bolts .

The receptacle defines an opening shown in a dotted line in in which an electrical connector is firmly seated and secured. The receptacle further defines a plurality of openings whose function will be explained later in more detail.

The electrical connector assembly includes the electrical connector and insulator backing a set of conductors and a set of retaining screws or bolts . The electrical connector provides connectivity to external power and or data sources for transmission to the smart munition via the set of electrical conductors .

The electrical connector includes a flat shoulder that is assembled to a corresponding flat edge of the receptacle by means of a set of retaining screws . The insulator backing is secured between the connector and the edge to provide added insulation to the connector .

The set of conductors preferably includes four electrical conductors that correspond to the electrical conductors and to which they are electrically connected upon closing of the breechblock . To this end the set of conductors are passed through the opening and extend from the opening for connection to the ring slide connector contacts .

This assembly allows the ring slide connector contacts to be readily exposed for contacting the block slide connector contacts upon closing the breechblock as shown in .

It should be understood that other modifications may be made to the present design without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
