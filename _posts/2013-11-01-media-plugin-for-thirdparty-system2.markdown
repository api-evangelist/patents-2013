This disclosure generally relates to social networking and more specifically to providing a media plug in for third party systems.

A social networking system which may include a social networking website may enable its users such as persons or organizations to interact with it and with each other through it. The social networking system may with input from a user create and store in the social networking system a user profile associated with the user. The user profile may include demographic information communication channel information and information on personal interests of the user. The social networking system may also with input from a user create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social networking system as well as provide services e.g. wall posts photo sharing event organization messaging games or advertisements to facilitate social interaction between or among users.

The social networking system may send over one or more networks content or messages related to its services to a mobile or other computing device of a user. A user may also install software applications on a mobile or other computing device of the user for accessing a user profile of the user and other data within the social networking system. The social networking system may generate a personalized set of content objects to display to a user such as a newsfeed of aggregated stories of other users connected to the user.

A mobile computing device such as a smartphone tablet computer or laptop computer may include functionality for determining its location direction or orientation such as a GPS receiver compass gyroscope or accelerometer. Such a device may also include functionality for wireless communication such as BLUETOOTH communication near field communication NFC or infrared IR communication or communication with a wireless local area networks WLANs or cellular telephone network. Such a device may also include one or more cameras scanners touchscreens microphones or speakers. Mobile computing devices may also execute software applications such as games web browsers or social networking applications. With social networking applications users may connect communicate and share information with other users in their social networks.

Particular embodiments enhance a user s media viewing experience by providing contextual media plug ins from a social networking system which may be displayed on a third party website using for example a mobile device a personal computer or any other computing system. A media plug in may include user selectable objects in a graphical user interface that when selected cause specific actions associated with particular media content. For example if a media plug in is displayed on a third party website for a particular TV show the media plug in may include user selectable buttons that cause actions such as for example watching a particular episode of the particular TV show. The particular user selectable objects provided by the social networking system to be displayed in the media plug in on the third party website may be based on whether a user who is viewing the third party website is currently logged into the social networking system or if the user has previously provided certain configuration information to the social networking system.

In certain embodiments the user selectable buttons of the media plug in may include one or more of a watch button a record button a remind button an event button and a message button. The watch button allows the user to immediately begin viewing media content in for example a video player.

In particular embodiments a concept node may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with concept node . In particular embodiments a concept node may correspond to one or more webpages.

In particular embodiments a node in social graph may represent or be represented by a webpage which may be referred to as a profile page . Profile pages may be hosted by or accessible to social networking system . Profile pages may also be hosted on third party websites associated with a third party server . As an example and not by way of limitation a profile page corresponding to a particular external webpage may be the particular external webpage and the profile page may correspond to a particular concept node . Profile pages may be viewable by all or a selected subset of other users. As an example and not by way of limitation a user node may have a corresponding user profile page in which the corresponding user may add content make declarations or otherwise express himself or herself. As another example and not by way of limitation a concept node may have a corresponding concept profile page in which one or more users may add content make declarations or express themselves particularly in relation to the concept corresponding to concept node .

In particular embodiments a concept node may represent a third party webpage or resource hosted by a third party system . The third party webpage or resource may include among other elements content a selectable or other icon or other inter actable object which may be implemented for example in JavaScript AJAX or PHP codes representing an action or activity. As an example and not by way of limitation a third party webpage may include a selectable icon such as like check in eat recommend or another suitable action or activity. A user viewing the third party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons e.g. eat causing a client system to send to social networking system a message indicating the user s action. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge e.g. an eat edge between a user node corresponding to the user and a concept node corresponding to the third party webpage or resource and store edge in one or more data stores.

In particular embodiments a pair of nodes in social graph may be connected to each other by one or more edges . An edge connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes. In particular embodiments an edge may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may indicate that a second user is a friend of the first user. In response to this indication social networking system may send a friend request to the second user. If the second user confirms the friend request social networking system may create an edge connecting the first user s user node to the second user s user node in social graph and store edge as social graph information in one or more of data stores . In the example of social graph includes an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user A and user B and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user C and user B. Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular edges with particular attributes connecting particular user nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes . As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent a friendship family relationship business or employment relationship fan relationship follower relationship visitor relationship subscriber relationship superior subordinate relationship reciprocal relationship non reciprocal relationship another suitable type of relationship or two or more such relationships. Moreover although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected. Herein references to users or concepts being connected may where appropriate refer to the nodes corresponding to those users or concepts being connected in social graph by one or more edges .

In particular embodiments an edge between a user node and a concept node may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user associated with user node toward a concept associated with a concept node . As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in a user may like attended played listened cooked worked at or watched a concept each of which may correspond to a edge type or subtype. A concept profile page corresponding to a concept node may include for example a selectable check in icon such as for example a clickable check in icon or a selectable add to favorites icon. Similarly after a user clicks these icons social networking system may create a favorite edge or a check in edge in response to a user s action corresponding to a respective action. As another example and not by way of limitation a user user C may listen to a particular song Imagine using a particular application SPOTIFY which is an online music application . In this case social networking system may create a listened edge and a used edge as illustrated in between user nodes corresponding to the user and concept nodes corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application. Moreover social networking system may create a played edge as illustrated in between concept nodes corresponding to the song and the application to indicate that the particular song was played by the particular application. In this case played edge corresponds to an action performed by an external application SPOTIFY on an external audio file the song Imagine . Although this disclosure describes particular edges with particular attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes . Moreover although this disclosure describes edges between a user node and a concept node representing a single relationship this disclosure contemplates edges between a user node and a concept node representing one or more relationships. As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent both that a user likes and has used at a particular concept. Alternatively another edge may represent each type of relationship or multiples of a single relationship between a user node and a concept node as illustrated in between user node for user E and concept node for SPOTIFY .

In particular embodiments social networking system may create an edge between a user node and a concept node in social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation a user viewing a concept profile page such as for example by using a web browser or a special purpose application hosted by the user s client system may indicate that he or she likes the concept represented by the concept node by clicking or selecting a Like icon which may cause the user s client system to send to social networking system a message indicating the user s liking of the concept associated with the concept profile page. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge between user node associated with the user and concept node as illustrated by like edge between the user and concept node . In particular embodiments social networking system may store an edge in one or more data stores. In particular embodiments an edge may be automatically formed by social networking system in response to a particular user action. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user uploads a picture watches a movie or listens to a song an edge may be formed between user node corresponding to the first user and concept nodes corresponding to those concepts. Although this disclosure describes forming particular edges in particular manners this disclosure contemplates forming any suitable edges in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments an advertisement may be text which may be HTML linked one or more images which may be HTML linked one or more videos audio one or more ADOBE FLASH files a suitable combination of these or any other suitable advertisement in any suitable digital format presented on one or more webpages in one or more e mails or in connection with search results requested by a user. In addition or as an alternative an advertisement may be one or more sponsored stories e.g. a news feed or ticker item on social networking system . A sponsored story may be a social action by a user such as liking a page liking or commenting on a post on a page RSVPing to an event associated with a page voting on a question posted on a page checking in to a place using an application or playing a game or liking or sharing a website that an advertiser promotes for example by having the social action presented within a pre determined area of a profile page of a user or other page presented with additional information associated with the advertiser bumped up or otherwise highlighted within news feeds or tickers of other users or otherwise promoted. The advertiser may pay to have the social action promoted. As an example and not by way of limitation advertisements may be included among the search results of a search results page where sponsored content is promoted over non sponsored content.

In particular embodiments an advertisement may be requested for display within social networking system webpages third party webpages or other pages. An advertisement may be displayed in a dedicated portion of a page such as in a banner area at the top of the page in a column at the side of the page in a GUI of the page in a pop up window in a drop down menu in an input field of the page over the top of content of the page or elsewhere with respect to the page. In addition or as an alternative an advertisement may be displayed within an application. An advertisement may be displayed within dedicated pages requiring the user to interact with or watch the advertisement before the user may access a page or utilize an application. The user may for example view the advertisement through a web browser.

A user may interact with an advertisement in any suitable manner. The user may click or otherwise select the advertisement. By selecting the advertisement the user may be directed to or a browser or other application being used by the user a page associated with the advertisement. At the page associated with the advertisement the user may take additional actions such as purchasing a product or service associated with the advertisement receiving information associated with the advertisement or subscribing to a newsletter associated with the advertisement. An advertisement with audio or video may be played by selecting a component of the advertisement like a play button . Alternatively by selecting the advertisement social networking system may execute or modify a particular action of the user.

An advertisement may also include social networking system functionality that a user may interact with. As an example and not by way of limitation an advertisement may enable a user to like or otherwise endorse the advertisement by selecting an icon or link associated with endorsement. As another example and not by way of limitation an advertisement may enable a user to search e.g. by executing a query for content related to the advertiser. Similarly a user may share the advertisement with another user e.g. through social networking system or RSVP e.g. through social networking system to an event associated with the advertisement. In addition or as an alternative an advertisement may include social networking system context directed to the user. As an example and not by way of limitation an advertisement may display information about a friend of the user within social networking system who has taken an action associated with the subject matter of the advertisement.

In particular embodiments social networking system may determine the social graph affinity which may be referred to herein as affinity of various social graph entities for each other. Affinity may represent the strength of a relationship or level of interest between particular objects associated with the online social network such as users concepts content actions advertisements other objects associated with the online social network or any suitable combination thereof. Affinity may also be determined with respect to objects associated with third party systems or other suitable systems. An overall affinity for a social graph entity for each user subject matter or type of content may be established. The overall affinity may change based on continued monitoring of the actions or relationships associated with the social graph entity. Although this disclosure describes determining particular affinities in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining any suitable affinities in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may measure or quantify social graph affinity using an affinity coefficient which may be referred to herein as coefficient . The coefficient may represent or quantify the strength of a relationship between particular objects associated with the online social network. The coefficient may also represent a probability or function that measures a predicted probability that a user will perform a particular action based on the user s interest in the action. In this way a user s future actions may be predicted based on the user s prior actions where the coefficient may be calculated at least in part a the history of the user s actions. Coefficients may be used to predict any number of actions which may be within or outside of the online social network. As an example and not by way of limitation these actions may include various types of communications such as sending messages posting content or commenting on content various types of a observation actions such as accessing or viewing profile pages media or other suitable content various types of coincidence information about two or more social graph entities such as being in the same group tagged in the same photograph checked in at the same location or attending the same event or other suitable actions. Although this disclosure describes measuring affinity in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates measuring affinity in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may use a variety of factors to calculate a coefficient. These factors may include for example user actions types of relationships between objects location information other suitable factors or any combination thereof. In particular embodiments different factors may be weighted differently when calculating the coefficient. The weights for each factor may be static or the weights may change according to for example the user the type of relationship the type of action the user s location and so forth. Ratings for the factors may be combined according to their weights to determine an overall coefficient for the user. As an example and not by way of limitation particular user actions may be assigned both a rating and a weight while a relationship associated with the particular user action is assigned a rating and a correlating weight e.g. so the weights total 100 . To calculate the coefficient of a user towards a particular object the rating assigned to the user s actions may comprise for example 60 of the overall coefficient while the relationship between the user and the object may comprise 40 of the overall coefficient. In particular embodiments the social networking system may consider a variety of variables when determining weights for various factors used to calculate a coefficient such as for example the time since information was accessed decay factors frequency of access relationship to information or relationship to the object about which information was accessed relationship to social graph entities connected to the object short or long term averages of user actions user feedback other suitable variables or any combination thereof. As an example and not by way of limitation a coefficient may include a decay factor that causes the strength of the signal provided by particular actions to decay with time such that more recent actions are more relevant when calculating the coefficient. The ratings and weights may be continuously updated based on continued tracking of the actions upon which the coefficient is based. Any type of process or algorithm may be employed for assigning combining averaging and so forth the ratings for each factor and the weights assigned to the factors. In particular embodiments social networking system may determine coefficients using machine learning algorithms trained on historical actions and past user responses or data farmed from users by exposing them to various options and measuring responses. Although this disclosure describes calculating coefficients in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates calculating coefficients in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on a user s actions. Social networking system may monitor such actions on the online social network on a third party system on other suitable systems or any combination thereof. Any suitable type of user actions may be tracked or monitored. Typical user actions include viewing profile pages creating or posting content interacting with content joining groups listing and confirming attendance at events checking in at locations liking particular pages creating pages and performing other tasks that facilitate social action. In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on the user s actions with particular types of content. The content may be associated with the online social network a third party system or another suitable system. The content may include users profile pages posts news stories headlines instant messages chat room conversations emails advertisements pictures video music other suitable objects or any combination thereof. Social networking system may analyze a user s actions to determine whether one or more of the actions indicate an affinity for subject matter content other users and so forth. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user may make frequently posts content related to coffee or variants thereof social networking system may determine the user has a high coefficient with respect to the concept coffee . Particular actions or types of actions may be assigned a higher weight and or rating than other actions which may affect the overall calculated coefficient. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user emails a second user the weight or the rating for the action may be higher than if the first user simply views the user profile page for the second user.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on the type of relationship between particular objects. Referencing the social graph social networking system may analyze the number and or type of edges connecting particular user nodes and concept nodes when calculating a coefficient. As an example and not by way of limitation user nodes that are connected by a spouse type edge representing that the two users are married may be assigned a higher coefficient than a user nodes that are connected by a friend type edge. In other words depending upon the weights assigned to the actions and relationships for the particular user the overall affinity may be determined to be higher for content about the user s spouse than for content about the user s friend. In particular embodiments the relationships a user has with another object may affect the weights and or the ratings of the user s actions with respect to calculating the coefficient for that object. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user is tagged in first photo but merely likes a second photo social networking system may determine that the user has a higher coefficient with respect to the first photo than the second photo because having a tagged in type relationship with content may be assigned a higher weight and or rating than having a like type relationship with content. In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient for a first user based on the relationship one or more second users have with a particular object. In other words the connections and coefficients other users have with an object may affect the first user s coefficient for the object. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user is connected to or has a high coefficient for one or more second users and those second users are connected to or have a high coefficient for a particular object social networking system may determine that the first user should also have a relatively high coefficient for the particular object. In particular embodiments the coefficient may be based on the degree of separation between particular objects. The lower coefficient may represent the decreasing likelihood that the first user will share an interest in content objects of the user that is indirectly connected to the first user in the social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation social graph entities that are closer in the social graph i.e. fewer degrees of separation may have a higher coefficient than entities that are further apart in the social graph .

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on location information. Objects that are geographically closer to each other may be considered to be more related or of more interest to each other than more distant objects. In particular embodiments the coefficient of a user towards a particular object may be based on the proximity of the object s location to a current location associated with the user or the location of a client system of the user . A first user may be more interested in other users or concepts that are closer to the first user. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user is one mile from an airport and two miles from a gas station social networking system may determine that the user has a higher coefficient for the airport than the gas station based on the proximity of the airport to the user.

In particular embodiments social networking system may perform particular actions with respect to a user based on coefficient information. Coefficients may be used to predict whether a user will perform a particular action based on the user s interest in the action. A coefficient may be used when generating or presenting any type of objects to a user such as advertisements search results news stories media messages notifications or other suitable objects. The coefficient may also be utilized to rank and order such objects as appropriate. In this way social networking system may provide information that is relevant to user s interests and current circumstances increasing the likelihood that they will find such information of interest. In particular embodiments social networking system may generate content based on coefficient information. Content objects may be provided or selected based on coefficients specific to a user. As an example and not by way of limitation the coefficient may be used to generate media for the user where the user may be presented with media for which the user has a high overall coefficient with respect to the media object. As another example and not by way of limitation the coefficient may be used to generate advertisements for the user where the user may be presented with advertisements for which the user has a high overall coefficient with respect to the advertised object. In particular embodiments social networking system may generate search results based on coefficient information. Search results for a particular user may be scored or ranked based on the coefficient associated with the search results with respect to the querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation search results corresponding to objects with higher coefficients may be ranked higher on a search results page than results corresponding to objects having lower coefficients.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient in response to a request for a coefficient from a particular system or process. To predict the likely actions a user may take or may be the subject of in a given situation any process may request a calculated coefficient for a user. The request may also include a set of weights to use for various factors used to calculate the coefficient. This request may come from a process running on the online social network from a third party system e.g. via an API or other communication channel or from another suitable system. In response to the request social networking system may calculate the coefficient or access the coefficient information if it has previously been calculated and stored . In particular embodiments social networking system may measure an affinity with respect to a particular process. Different processes both internal and external to the online social network may request a coefficient for a particular object or set of objects. Social networking system may provide a measure of affinity that is relevant to the particular process that requested the measure of affinity. In this way each process receives a measure of affinity that is tailored for the different context in which the process will use the measure of affinity.

In connection with social graph affinity and affinity coefficients particular embodiments may utilize one or more systems components elements functions methods operations or steps disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 503 093 filed 11 Aug. 2006 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 977 027 filed 22 Dec. 2010 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 978 265 filed 23 Dec. 2010 and U.S. patent application Ser.

For example if the determined content is the TV show In the City and the user is logged in to social networking system social networking system may provide event button that allows the user to create an event on social networking system for viewing the next episode of In the City. As another example if the determined content is the TV show In the City and the user is logged in to social networking system social networking system may provide watch button that allows the user to immediately begin watching an episode of In the City. In some embodiments the determined one or more user selectable objects may be additionally based on whether the user has provided configuration information or settings e.g. cable provider information to social networking system as described below. The one or more user selectable objects may include watch button record button remind button event button and message button as described above.

In some embodiments if social networking system determines that the user who is viewing third party website is currently logged in to social networking system social networking system may determine if the user has previously provided configuration information to social networking system . If the user previously provided configuration information to social networking system social networking system may utilize the configuration information in order to determine which user selectable objects to display in media plug in . For example if the user has provided configuration information that indicates he utilizes Comcast as his cable provider social networking system may provide watch button . The provided watch button may be configured to launch a video player of Comcast to view an episode of In the City. As another example if the user has provided configuration information that indicates the user s cable provider and login information for the user s STB or DVR social networking system may provide record button . The provided record button may be configured to send commands or instructions using the configuration information to the user s STB or DVR to record a future episode of In the City. In this case the commands would include the appropriate time and channel for In the City as provided by the user s cable provider.

In some embodiments if social networking system determines that the user who is viewing third party website is not currently logged in to social networking system or has not provided configuration information social networking system may provide a reduced number of user selectable objects in media plug in . For example if social networking system determines that the user who is viewing third party website is not currently logged in to social networking system or has not provided configuration information social networking system may only provide remind button in media plug in . Selecting the remind button may prompt the user to log in to social networking system . If the user has not provided configuration information or if social networking system is unable to otherwise determine the user s content provider remind buttons may cause a generic reminder for the media content of third party website to be set e.g. In the City airs every Thursday at 8 PM Eastern 7 PM Central on HBO. instead of a specific reminder that may include the appropriate time and channel for the user to view In the City. 

In some embodiments the configuration information provided by the user to social networking system may include location information for the user. For example the configuration information may indicate that the user resides in Menlo Park Calif. USA. Social networking system may then utilize this location information to determine which user selectable objects to display in media plug in . For example if the user resides in a country in which online streaming is not available for particular media content social networking system may determine not to provide watch button to the user.

As discussed above some embodiments may provide message button that causes a messaging e.g. chat interface to be presented to the user. The messaging interface may be presented directly on third party website e.g an embedded chat interface a pop up interface etc. or on a website of social networking system . The website of social networking system may provide an interface that allows the user to chat with other users of social networking system about the particular media content of third party website . In some embodiments social networking system may provide additional functionality within the provided chat interface as discussed below.

In some embodiments social networking system may provide a chat interface that displays multiple available chat rooms that the user may join. For example when the user selects message button an interface may appear that graphically lists different chat rooms related to the user or media content e.g. TV shows movies etc. relevant to the user. The user may then select one of the chat rooms in which to participate. In some embodiments each chat room in the provided list may include social content from social graph . For example each chat room may include a graphical representation of how may other users are participating in the chat room. The other users may be connections of the user e.g. friends according to social graph .

In some embodiments the graphical list of available chat rooms may be ordered in any appropriate order. In some embodiments the list of available chat rooms is arranged in order of the number of participants of the chat rooms e.g. listed from most to fewest participants . In some embodiments the list of available chat rooms is arranged in order of available media content for the user e.g. chat rooms for TV shows that the user may view according to the user s cable subscription package are listed first . In some embodiments the list of available chat rooms is arranged in order of time e.g. shows that are currently airing are listed first shows that are almost over are pushed to the bottom etc. .

In some embodiments the list of available chat rooms is arranged in order of social coefficients and or a taste algorithm for the user. Some embodiments may utilize coefficients as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 978 265 entitled Contextually Relevant Affinity Prediction in a Social Networking System which is incorporated herein by reference. Social networking system may utilize the following information from social graph in determining coefficients of specific media content for an individual user 

As discussed above a taste algorithm may be utilized by social networking system to determine the order of available chat rooms. For example social networking system may first determine first media content that a user watched liked or otherwise interacted with on social networking system . In some embodiments the first media content may be determined using social graph . Once the first media content has been determined social networking system may then search social graph to determine other users or friends of the user who also watched liked or otherwise interacted with the first media content on social networking system . Social networking system may then search social graph for second media content that the determined users or friends watched liked or otherwise interacted with on social networking system . In some embodiments weighting factors may be utilized in determining what media content to recommend to a user. For example second media content viewed by a user s friends may have a higher weight in determining recommendations for a user than second media content viewed by users who are not friends.

As an example for illustrative purposes only consider a scenario where a first user has liked the TV show Garage Talk in the past. Social networking system may query social graph in order to determine other users or friends of the first user who have also liked Garage Talk. For example social networking system may determine that Friend A and User B also liked Garage Talk. Social networking system may then query social graph for other media content liked by the other users or friends who also liked Garage Talk. For example social networking system may determine that Friend A and User B who liked Garage Talk also liked Shop Journal and Cars Galore. Social networking system may then display chat rooms for Shop Journal and Cars Galore in the chat interface. If for example Friend A liked Shop Journal and User B who is not a friend of the first user liked Cars Galore then a chat room for Shop Journal may appear higher in the list.

In some embodiments social networking system may provide enhanced tagging of conversations that take place within the chat interface. For example consider a scenario where a user selects message button on NFL.com for a particular football game between the Patriots and the Colts. The user may then be presented with a chat interface that allows the user to have a conversation with other users of social networking system while watching the particular football game. Social networking system may detect the conversation and attempt to determine an appropriate tag e.g. hashtag to apply to the conversation. For example if the conversation takes place during the same time period as a particular football game e.g. the game between the Patriots and Colts social networking system may correlate the times and deduce that the entire conversation was about the particular football game. Social networking system may then apply an appropriate tag e.g. PatsvColts to the conversation. As another example social networking system may examine the conversation for key words in order to determine the appropriate tag for the conversation.

In step media content associated with the request to display the media plug in is determined. In some embodiments the media content is any TV show movie clip video trailer etc. that is displayed on the third party website in which the media plugin of step is to be displayed. For example if the media plugin of step is to be displayed on a third party website for a particular TV show the media content of step may be the particular TV show. In some embodiments information within the request of step is utilized to determine the media content. For example an identification e.g. an ID number text etc. included within the request is utilized to determine the media content. In some embodiments a page ID of the social networking system is utilized to determine the media content.

In step it is determined whether the third party website is being viewed by a user that is currently logged in to the social networking system. In some embodiments information within the request of step is utilized to determine whether the user is currently logged in to the social networking system. For example a user ID or IP address of the user may be utilized to determine whether the user is currently logged in to the social networking system.

In step one or more user selectable objects are determined for displaying within the media plug in of step .
