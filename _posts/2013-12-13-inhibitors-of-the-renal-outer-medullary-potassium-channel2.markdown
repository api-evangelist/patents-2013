This application is a U.S. National Phase application under 35 U.S.C. 371 of PCT Application No. PCT US13 74846 filed Dec. 13 2013 which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. Nos. 61 739 571 filed Dec. 19 2012 and 61 762 079 filed Feb. 7 2013.

The Renal Outer Medullary Potassium ROMK channel Kir1.1 see e.g. Ho K. et al. Nature 1993 362 6415 p. 31 8.1 2 and Shuck M. E. et al. J Biol Chem 1994 269 39 p. 24261 70 is a member of the inward rectifier family of potassium channels expressed in two regions of the kidney thick ascending loop of Henle TALH and cortical collecting duct CCD see Hebert S. C. et al. Physiol Rev 2005 85 1 p. 319 713 . At the TALH ROMK participates in potassium recycling across the luminal membrane which is critical for the function of the Na K 2Cl co transporter the rate determining step for salt reuptake in this part of the nephron. At the CCD ROMK provides a pathway for potassium secretion that is tightly coupled to sodium uptake through the amiloride sensitive sodium channel see Reinalter S. C. et al. Acta Physiol Scand 2004 181 4 p. 513 21 and Wang W. Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens 2004 13 5 p. 549 55 . Selective inhibitors of the ROMK channel also referred to herein as inhibitors of ROMK or ROMK inhibitors are expected to represent novel diuretics for the treatment of hypertension and other conditions where treatment with a diuretic would be beneficial with potentially reduced liabilities i.e. hypo or hyperkalemia new onset of diabetes dyslipidemia over the currently used clinical agents see Lifton R. P. A. G. Gharavi and D. S. Geller Cell 2001 104 4 p. 545 56 . Human genetics Ji W. et al. Nat Genet 2008 40 5 p. 592 9 and Tobin M. D. et al. Hypertension 2008 51 6 p. 1658 64 and genetic ablation of ROMK in rodents see Lorenz J. N. et al. J Biol Chem 2002 277 40 p. 37871 80 and Lu M. et al. J Biol Chem 2002 277 40 p. 37881 7 support these expectations. To our knowledge the first publicly disclosed small molecule selective inhibitors of ROMK including VU590 were reported from work done at Vanderbilt University as described in Lewis L. M. et al. 7.1 Mol Pharmacol 2009 76 5 p. 1094 1103. The compound VU591 was later reported in Bhave G. et al. 1.1 Mol Pharmacol 2011 79 1 p. 42 50 the text of which states that ROMK Kir1.1 is a putative drug target for a novel class of loop diuretics that would lower blood pressure without causing hypokalemia.

All structural Formulas and embodiments thereof described herein include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds defined therein.

As used herein except if noted otherwise alkyl is intended to include both branched and straight chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms. Commonly used abbreviations for alkyl groups are used throughout the specification. For example the term Calkyl or C Calkyl means linear or branched chain alkyl groups including all isomers having the specified number of carbon atoms and includes all of the hexyl and pentyl isomers as well as n iso sec and tert butyl butyl s butyl i butyl t butyl Bu butyl n and i propyl Pr propyl ethyl Et and methyl Me .

 Cycloalkyl is a cyclized alkyl ring having the indicated number of carbon atoms. Examples of cycloalkyl include cyclopropyl cyclobutyl cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl.

Unless expressly depicted or described otherwise variables depicted in a structural formula with a floating bond such as R are permitted on any available carbon atom in the ring to which the variable is attached.

The present invention encompasses all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of Formula I. Centers of asymmetry that are present in the compounds of Formula I can all independently of one another have R or S configuration. When bonds to a chiral carbon are depicted as straight lines in the structural Formulas of the invention or when a compound name is recited without an R or S chiral designation for a chiral carbon it is understood that both the R and S configurations of each such chiral carbon and hence each enantiomer or diastereomer and mixtures thereof are embraced within the Formula or by the name. The production of specific stereoisomers or mixtures thereof may be identified in the Examples where such stereoisomers or mixtures were obtained but this in no way limits the inclusion of all stereoisomers and mixtures thereof from being within the scope of this invention.

The invention includes all possible enantiomers and diastereomers and mixtures of two or more stereoisomers for example mixtures of enantiomers and or diastereomers in all ratios. Thus enantiomers are a subject of the invention in enantiomerically pure form both as levorotatory and as dextrorotatory antipodes in the form of racemates and in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers in all ratios. In the case of a cis trans isomerism the invention includes both the cis form and the trans form as well as mixtures of these forms in all ratios. The preparation of individual stereoisomers can be carried out if desired by separation of a mixture by customary methods for example by chromatography or crystallization by the use of stereochemically uniform starting materials for the synthesis or by stereoselective synthesis. Optionally a derivatization can be carried out before a separation of stereoisomers. The separation of a mixture of stereoisomers can be carried out at an intermediate step during the synthesis of a compound of Formula I or it can be done on a final racemic product. Absolute stereochemistry may be determined by X ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized if necessary with a reagent containing a stereogenic center of known configuration. Where compounds of this invention are capable of tautomerization all individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are included in the scope of this invention. The present invention includes all such isomers as well as salts solvates which includes hydrates and solvated salts of such racemates enantiomers diastereomers and tautomers and mixtures thereof.

The compounds of the instant invention have at least two chiral i.e. asymmetric centers from the central fused bicyclic ring of Formula I as indicated by the asterisk at each chiral center in example A. Also when Zcontains a non aromatic carbon ring fused to a phenyl ring the carbon in the non aromatic ring that is the point of attachment to the rest of the structure in Formula I is a chiral center and is referred to herein for brevity as an indane chiral center or tetrahydronaphthalene chiral center or a similar meaning variation thereof. An illustrative example of an indane chiral center when m is 1 or tetrahydronaphthalene chiral center when m is 2 is indicated by the asterisk in example B 

Additional chiral centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on a molecule. In some of the chemical structures shown in the examples an asterisk is used to identify one or more chiral centers.

Reference to the compounds of Formula I herein encompasses the compounds of Formulas I II III IV and IV and all embodiments thereof. Reference to the compounds of this invention as those of a specific formula or embodiment e.g. Formula I II III IV and IV and embodiments thereof or any other generic structural formula or specific compound described or claimed herein is intended to encompass the specific compound or compounds falling within the scope of the formula or embodiment including salts thereof particularly pharmaceutically acceptable salts solvates of such compounds and solvated salt forms thereof where such forms are possible unless specified otherwise.

In the compounds of Formula I the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominantly found in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of Formula I. For example different isotopic forms of hydrogen H include protium H and deuterium H . Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages such as increasing in vivo half life or reducing dosage requirements or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples. Isotopically enriched compounds within Formula I can be prepared without undue experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically enriched reagents and or intermediates.

When the compounds of Formula I contain one or more acidic or basic groups the invention also includes the corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Thus the compounds of Formula I which contain acidic groups can be used according to the invention for example as alkali metal salts alkaline earth metal salts or as ammonium salts. Examples of such salts include but are not limited to sodium salts potassium salts calcium salts magnesium salts or salts with ammonia or organic amines such as for example ethylamine ethanolamine triethanolamine or amino acids. Compounds of Formula I which contain one or more basic groups i.e. groups which can be protonated can be used according to the invention in the form of their acid addition salts with inorganic or organic acids as for example but not limited to salts with hydrogen chloride hydrogen bromide phosphoric acid sulfuric acid nitric acid benzenesulfonic acid methanesulfonic acid p toluenesulfonic acid naphthalenedisulfonic acids oxalic acid acetic acid trifluoroacetic acid tartaric acid lactic acid salicylic acid benzoic acid formic acid propionic acid pivalic acid diethylacetic acid malonic acid succinic acid pimelic acid fumaric acid maleic acid malic acid sulfaminic acid phenylpropionic acid gluconic acid ascorbic acid isonicotinic acid citric acid adipic acid etc. If the compounds of Formula I simultaneously contain acidic and basic groups in the molecule the invention also includes in addition to the salt forms mentioned inner salts or betaines zwitterions . Salts can be obtained from the compounds of Formula I by customary methods which are known to the person skilled in the art for example by combination with an organic or inorganic acid or base in a solvent or dispersant or by anion exchange or cation exchange from other salts. The present invention also includes all salts of the compounds of Formula I which owing to low physiological compatibility are not directly suitable for use in pharmaceuticals but which can be used for example as intermediates for chemical reactions or for the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts.

Furthermore compounds of the present invention may exist in amorphous form and or one or more crystalline forms and as such all amorphous and crystalline forms and mixtures thereof of the compounds of Formula I are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. In addition some of the compounds of the instant invention may form solvates with water i.e. a hydrate or common organic solvents. Such solvates and hydrates particularly the pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and hydrates of the instant compounds are likewise encompassed within the scope of this invention along with un solvated and anhydrous forms.

Any pharmaceutically acceptable pro drug modification of a compound of this invention which results in conversion in vivo to a compound within the scope of this invention is also within the scope of this invention. For example esters can optionally be made by esterification of an available carboxylic acid group or by formation of an ester on an available hydroxy group in a compound. Similarly labile amides can be made. Pharmaceutically acceptable esters or amides of the compounds of this invention may be prepared to act as pro drugs which can be hydrolyzed back to an acid or COO depending on the pH of the fluid or tissue where conversion takes place or hydroxy form particularly in vivo and as such are encompassed within the scope of this invention. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable pro drug modifications include but are not limited to Calkyl esters and Calkyl substituted with phenyl esters.

Accordingly the compounds within the generic structural formulas embodiments and specific compounds described and claimed herein encompass salts all possible stereoisomers and tautomers physical forms e.g. amorphous and crystalline forms solvate and hydrate forms thereof and any combination of these forms as well as the salts thereof pro drug forms thereof and salts of pro drug forms thereof where such forms are possible unless specified otherwise.

The compounds of Formula I according to the invention are inhibitors of ROMK and therefore could be used as diuretic and or natriuretic agents. ROMK inhibitors may be used to help to increase urination and increase urine volume and also to prevent or reduce reabsorption of sodium in the kidneys leading to increased excretion of sodium and water. Therefore the compounds could be used for treatment or prophylaxis or both of disorders that benefit from increased excretion of water and sodium from the body. Accordingly the compounds of this invention could be used in a method for inhibiting ROMK comprising administering a compound of Formula I in a ROMK inhibitory effective amount to a patient in need thereof. The inhibition of ROMK by the compounds of Formula I can be examined for example in the Thallium Flux Assay and or Electrophysiology Assay described below. Moreover this invention also relates to the use of the compounds of Formula I or salts thereof to validate in vitro assays for example but not limited to the Thallium Flux and Electrophysiology Assays described herein.

The compounds of this invention could be used in a method for causing diuresis natriuresis or both comprising administering a compound of Formula I in a therapeutically effective amount to a patient in need thereof. Therefore the compounds of Formula I of this invention could be used in methods for treatment of prevention of or reduction of risk for developing medical conditions that benefit from increased excretion of water and sodium such as but not limited to one or more of hypertension such as essential hypertension also known as primary or idiopathic hypertension which is a form of hypertension for which no cause can be found heart failure both acute and chronic the latter also known as congestive heart failure and or other conditions associated with excessive salt and water retention. The compounds could also be used to treat hypertension which is associated with any of several primary diseases such as renal pulmonary endocrine and vascular diseases including treatment in patients with medical conditions such as heart failure or chronic kidney disease. Furthermore the compounds of Formula I could be used in methods for treatment of prevention of or reduction of risk for developing one or more disorders such as pulmonary hypertension particularly pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus diabetes insipidus post operative volume overload endothelial dysfunction diastolic dysfunction systolic dysfunction stable and unstable angina pectoris thromboses restenosis myocardial infarction stroke cardiac insufficiency pulmonary hypertonia atherosclerosis hepatic cirrhosis ascitis pre eclampsia cerebral edema nephropathy glomerulonephritis nephrotic syndrome acute and chronic kidney insufficiency also referred to as chronic kidney disease or more generally as renal impairment acute tubular necrosis hypercalcemia idiopathic edema Dent s disease Meniere s disease edematous states glaucoma benign intracranial hypertension and other conditions for which a diuretic or natriuretic or both would have therapeutic or prophylactic benefit. The compounds of the invention may be administered to a patient having or at risk of having one or more conditions for which a diuretic or natriuretic or both would have therapeutic or prophylactic benefit such as those described herein.

The compounds of Formula I may potentially have reduced liabilities for example hypo or hyperkalemia new onset of diabetes dyslipidemia etc. over currently used clinical agents. Also the compounds may have reduced risk for diuretic tolerance which can be a problem with long term use of loop diuretics.

In general compounds that are ROMK inhibitors can be identified as those compounds which when tested have an ICof 5 M or less preferably 1 M or less and more preferably 0.25 M or less in at least one of the following assays 1 Thallium Flux Assay 2 Electrophysiology Assay. These assays are described in more detail further below.

The dosage amount of the compound to be administered depends on the individual case and is as is customary to be adapted to the individual circumstances to achieve an optimum effect. Thus it depends on the nature and the severity of the disorder to be treated and also on the sex age weight and individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated on the efficacy and duration of action of the compounds used on whether the therapy is acute or chronic or prophylactic or on whether other active compounds are administered in addition to compounds of Formula I. A consideration of these factors is well within the purview of the ordinarily skilled clinician for the purpose of determining the therapeutically effective or prophylactically effective dosage amount needed to prevent counter or arrest the progress of the condition. It is expected that the compound will be administered chronically on a daily basis for a length of time appropriate to treat or prevent the medical condition relevant to the patient including a course of therapy lasting days months years or the life of the patient.

In general a daily dose of approximately 0.001 to 100 mg kg preferably 0.001 to 30 mg kg in particular 0.001 to 10 mg kg in each case mg per kg of bodyweight is appropriate for administration to an adult weighing approximately 75 kg in order to obtain the desired results. The daily dose is preferably administered in a single dose or can be divided into several for example two three or four individual doses and may be for example but not limited to 0.1 mg 0.25 mg 0.5 mg 0.75 mg 1 mg 1.25 mg 2 mg 2.5 mg 5 mg 10 mg 20 mg 40 mg 50 mg 75 mg 100 mg 125 mg 150 mg 175 mg 200 mg etc. on a daily basis. In some cases depending on the potency of the compound or the individual response it may be necessary to deviate upwards or downwards from the given daily dose. Furthermore the compound may be formulated for immediate or modified release such as extended or controlled release.

The term patient includes animals preferably mammals and especially humans who use the instant active agents for the prohylaxis or treatment of a medical condition. Administering of the drug to the patient includes both self administration and administration to the patient by another person. The patient may be in need of treatment for an existing disease or medical condition or may desire prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the risk for developing said disease or medical condition or developing long term complications from a disease or medical condition.

The term therapeutically effective amount is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue a system animal or human that is being sought by a researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician. A prophylactically effective amount is intended to mean that amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of the biological or medical event that is sought to be prevented in a tissue a system animal or human by a researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician. The terms preventing prevention prophylactic and derivatives of these terms as used herein refer to administering a compound to a patient before the onset of clinical symptoms of a condition not yet present in the patient. It is understood that a specific daily dosage amount can simultaneously be both a therapeutically effective amount e.g. for treatment of hypertension and a prophylactically effective amount e.g. for prevention or reduction of risk of myocardial infarction or prevention or reduction of risk for complications related to hypertension.

In the methods of treatment of this invention the ROMK inhibitors may be administered via any suitable route of administration such as for example orally parenterally or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections intravenous IV intramuscular intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. Oral formulations are preferred for treatment of chronic indications such as hypertension or chronic heart failure particularly solid oral dosage units such as pills tablets or capsules and more particularly tablets. IV dosing is preferred for acute treatment for example for the treatment of acute heart failure.

This invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprised of a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is comprised of one or more excipients or additives. An excipient or additive is an inert substance used to formulate the active drug ingredient. For oral use the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention containing the active ingredient may be in forms such as pills tablets troches lozenges aqueous or oily suspensions dispersible powders or granules emulsions hard or soft capsules or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. The excipients may be for example inert diluents such as calcium carbonate sodium carbonate lactose mannitol calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate granulating and disintegrating agents for example corn starch or alginic acid binding agents for example starch gelatin or acacia and lubricating agents for example magnesium stearate stearic acid or talc.

Pharmaceutical compositions may also contain other customary additives for example but not limited to wetting agents stabilizers emulsifiers dispersants preservatives sweeteners colorants flavorings aromatizers thickeners buffer substances solvents solubilizers agents for achieving a depot effect salts for altering the osmotic pressure coating agents or antioxidants. Oral immediate release and time controlled release dosage forms may be employed as well as enterically coated oral dosage forms. Tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques for aesthetic purposes to mask taste or for other reasons. Coatings can also be used to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed.

Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent for example calcium carbonate calcium phosphate or kaolin or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients is mixed with water or miscible solvents such as propylene glycol PEGs and ethanol or an oil medium for example peanut oil liquid paraffin or olive oil.

Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil for example arachis oil olive oil sesame oil or coconut oil or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent for example beeswax hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti oxidant such as ascorbic acid. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents for example glycerol propylene glycol sorbitol or sucrose.

The instant invention also encompasses a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising combining a compound of Formula I with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Also encompassed is the pharmaceutical composition which is made by combining a compound of Formula I with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Furthermore a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention can be used for the preparation of a medicament useful for inhibiting ROMK for causing diuresis and or natriuresis and or for treating preventing or reducing the risk for any of the medical conditions described herein in dosage amounts described herein.

The amount of active compound of Formula I and or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts in the pharmaceutical composition may be for example but not limited to from about 0.1 mg to 1 g particularly 0.1 mg to about 200 mg more particularly from about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg and even more particularly from about 0.1 to about 50 mg per dose on a free acid free base weight basis but depending on the type of the pharmaceutical composition potency of the active ingredient and or the medical condition being treated it could also be lower or higher. Pharmaceutical compositions usually comprise about 0.5 to about 90 percent by weight of the active compound on a free acid free base weight basis.

The compounds of Formula I inhibit ROMK. Due to this property apart from use as pharmaceutically active compounds in human medicine and veterinary medicine they can also be employed as a scientific tool or as aid for biochemical investigations in which such an effect on ROMK is intended and also for diagnostic purposes for example in the in vitro diagnosis of cell samples or tissue samples. The compounds of Formula I can also be employed as intermediates for the preparation of other pharmaceutically active compounds.

One or more additional pharmacologically active agents may be administered in combination with a compound of Formula I. The additional active agent or agents is intended to mean a medicinal compound that is different from the compound of Formula I and which is a pharmaceutically active agent or agents that is active in the body including pro drugs for example esterified forms that convert to pharmaceutically active form after administration and also includes free acid free base and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said additional active agents when such forms are sold commercially or are otherwise chemically possible. Generally any suitable additional active agent or agents including but not limited to anti hypertensive agents additional diuretics anti atherosclerotic agents such as a lipid modifying compound anti diabetic agents and or anti obesity agents may be used in any combination with the compound of Formula I in a single dosage formulation a fixed dose drug combination or may be administered to the patient in one or more separate dosage formulations which allows for concurrent or sequential administration of the active agents co administration of the separate active agents . Examples of the one or more additional active agents which may be employed include but are not limited to thiazide like diuretics e.g. hydrochlorothiazide HCTZ or HCT angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors e.g alacepril benazepril captopril ceronapril cilazapril delapril enalapril enalaprilat fosinopril imidapril lisinopril moveltipril perindopril quinapril ramipril spirapril temocapril or trandolapril dual inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme ACE and neutral endopeptidase NEP such as omapatrilat sampatrilat and fasidotril angiotensin II receptor antagonists also known as angiotensin receptor blockers or ARBs which may be in free base free acid salt or pro drug form such as azilsartan e.g. azilsartan medoxomil potassium EDARBI candesartan e.g. candesartan cilexetil ATACAND eprosartan e.g. eprosartan mesylate TEVETAN irbesartan AVAPRO losartan e.g. losartan potassium COZAAR olmesartan e.g olmesartan medoximil BENICAR telmisartan MICARDIS valsartan DIOVAN and any of these drugs used in combination with a thiazide like diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide e.g. HYZAAR DIOVAN HCT ATACAND HCT etc. potassium sparing diuretics such as amiloride HCl spironolactone epleranone triamterene each with or without HCTZ carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide neutral endopeptidase inhibitors e.g. thiorphan and phosphoramidon aldosterone antagonists aldosterone synthase inhibitors renin inhibitors e.g. urea derivatives of di and tri peptides See U.S. Pat.

Trademark names of pharmaceutical drugs noted above are provided for exemplification of the marketed form of the active agent s such pharmaceutical drugs could be used in a separate dosage form for concurrent or sequential administration with a compound of Formula I or the active agent s therein could be used in a fixed dose drug combination including a compound of Formula I.

Several methods for preparing the compounds of this invention are described in the following Schemes and Examples. Starting materials and intermediates are purchased made from known procedures or as otherwise illustrated. Some frequently applied routes to the compounds of Formula I are also described by the Schemes as follows. In some cases the order of carrying out the steps of reaction schemes may be varied to facilitate the reaction or to avoid unwanted reaction products.

The R substituents in the Schemes correspond to the substituents defined in Formula I at the equivalent positions on the Scheme structures.

Compounds of the formula I may be prepared as shown in Scheme 1 by coupling of appropriately substituted piperazines 1 with carboxylic acids of the structure 2 to form amides. This can be accomplished in many ways well known to the chemist including by using EDC in the presence or absence of HOBt and a base such as triethylamine or by using a variety of other amide coupling reagents such as HATU.

Piperazines 1 can be prepared according to Scheme 2. Epoxides 4 can be coupled with appropriately protected hydroxyalkylpiperazines 5 by heating in a solvent such as ethanol DMSO or toluene to afford the diols 6 Nomura Y. et al. Chemical Pharmaceutical Bulletin 1995 43 2 241 6 . Heating can be by conventional thermal bath or by microwave irradiation. The diols 6 can be cyclized to afford 6 or 7 membered rings 7 by a variety of ways including by heating with the reagent cyanomethylene tri n butylphosphorane in a suitable solvent such as benzene or toluene. Heating can be by conventional thermal bath or by microwave irradiation. The resulting compounds 7 are generally mixtures of cis and trans isomers. The protective group Greene T. Wuts P. G. M. John Wiley and Sons Inc. New York N.Y. 1991 can then be removed. For example when the protective group is Boc as shown in Scheme 2 removal can be achieved by treatment with an acid such as TFA or HCl to afford piperazines 1A. Alternatively compounds 7 can be separated by means of silica chromatography or preparative high pressure liquid chromatography employing a chiral column to afford the separated cis 7 cis and trans 7 trans isomers. The protective group of the pure cis and trans isomers can be removed by treatment with an acid such as TFA or HCl in the case of a Boc group to afford piperazines 1A as pure cis and trans isomers 1A cis and 1A trans . If a single enantiomer of the hydroxyalkylpiperazines 5 is employed then single enantiomer cis and trans isomers 1A cis and 1A trans can be obtained.

Protected piperazines 7 can also be prepared according to Scheme 3 by initially coupling hydroxyalkylpiperazines 5 with bromomethylketones or chloromethyl ketones 8 to afford hemiketals 9. This is typically accomplished in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or diethylisopropylamine. The resulting hemiketals 9 can be converted directly to piperazines 1A by reduction using for example triethylsilane in the presence of an acid catalyst such as trifluoroacetic acid. If separation of the cis and trans isomers is desired a protective group such as Boc may be installed using for example BocO to give intermediates 7A which can be separated into cis and trans isomers as described in Scheme 2. Alternatively the hemiketals 9 may be reduced by a three step sequence involving formation of a mesylate with mesyl chloride and a base such as triethylamine followed by elimination in the presence of base to give enol ethers 10. Enol ethers 10 can then be reduced by hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium on carbon to afford protected piperazines 7A which can be separated into cis and trans isomers as described in Scheme 2. These may then be converted to piperazine intermediates 1A cis and 1A trans as described in Scheme 3.

Alternatively a subclass of intermediates 1 piperazines 1B can be prepared as described in Scheme 4. The Boc protective group of intermediates 6 prepared as described in Scheme 2 are switched to benzyl carbamate Cbz groups by initial treatment with an acid such as TFA or HCl followed by coupling with benzyl chloroformate in the presence of a base such as triethylamine. The resulting Cbz piperazine diols 6A are converted to the corresponding dichloro intermediates by heating with thionyl chloride then heated with allylamine in the presence of sodium iodide to afford the allyl substituted fused piperazines 11. The allyl groups may be removed in several ways including by warming with 1 3 dimethylpyrimidine 2 4 6 1H 3H 5H trione in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium tetrakis triphenylphosphine. The revealed amines are then re protected with tert butoxycarbamate groups by treatment with BocO in the presence of an amine such as triethylamine to provide intermediates 7B generally as mixtures of cis and trans isomers. The cis and trans isomers can be separated as described in Scheme 2 by silica chromatography or by chiral preparative HPLC. If intermediates 6 are single enantiomers then the resulting intermediates 7B cis and 7B trans are also single isomers. Alternatively separation of the cis and trans isomers can be performed at an earlier stage by separation of the cis trans isomers of intermediates 11. The Cbz protective groups of intermediates 7B cis and 7B trans can be removed for example by hydrogenolysis in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium on carbon to afford intermediates 1B cis and 1B trans .

Alternatively a sub class of intermediates 1 1C may be prepared according to Scheme 5. Diols 6 are initially converted to their corresponding mono mesylates by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride a base such as triethyl amine and a catalyst such as 4 dimethylaminopyridine. Subsequent reaction with potassium thiocetate in a solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO provides intermediates 12. The remaining hydroxyl group of 12 is then converted to the corresponding chloro intermediate by treatment with for example thionyl chloride followed by addition of a base such as pyridine. The resulting chloro intermediate is then treated with sodium methoxide to afford the cyclized sulfides 7C. When the starting diols 6 used are single isomers starting from enantiomerically pure epoxides 4 and enantiomerically pure hydroxyalkylpiperazines 5 Scheme 3 the resulting intermediates 7C may be obtained as single isomers. Alternatively when racemic epoxides 4 and single enantiomer hydroxyalkylpiperazines 5 are employed the resulting intermediates 7C are obtained as a mixture of two isomers cis and trans which can then be separated to single isomers 7C cis and 7C trans by silica chromatography or by chiral preparative HPLC. Removal of the tert butyl carbamate protective group can then be achieved by treatment with an acid such as TFA or HCl to provide the piperazines 1C cis and 1C trans .

The floating bond R on the phenylene ring in Schemes 6 10 represents the one or more substituents that may be present on this ring as defined in Formula I.

Intermediates 2 may be prepared in a variety of ways. A sub class 2A of carboxylic acids of the structure 2 may be prepared according to Scheme 6. By this route malonates 13 are reacted in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride with nitro substituted aromatic groups bearing a halogen leaving group such as a fluoro or chloro 14 shown . The resulting coupled products 15 are decarboxylated with hydrolysis of the remaining ester to afford carboxylic acids 16. Reduction of the nitro group can be achieved in a variety of ways. One approach is to reduce with hydrogen gas in the presence of a catalyst such as Pd on carbon. The anilines 17 may then be cyclized to the tetrazoles 2A by a number of different methods including reaction often with heating with sodium azide and triethylorthoformate in a solvent such as acetic acid. Alternatively the tetrazoles 2A may be formed by reaction with trimethylsilyl azide trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetate and triethyl orthoformate.

Alternatively intermediates of the sub class 2A may be prepared according to Scheme 7. In this case a mixed malonate 13a is used to afford compounds 15A in a similar fashion as described in Scheme 6. Decarboxylation under acidic conditions with for example TFA provides the esters 18. Reduction under conditions described for Scheme 6 provides amines 19. Cyclization to afford the tetrazoles 20 again could be accomplished as described above for Scheme 6. Finally ester hydrolysis using a base such as lithium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide with water and an organic solvent such as THF or dioxane affords the intermediates 2A.

Another sub class of acids 2B can be prepared in a variety of ways. One approach is depicted in Scheme 8. Malonate 12B in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride can be coupled to cyano aryl or heterocycle compounds bearing a halogen leaving group such as a chloride bromide or fluoride for example 21 . Hydrolysis and decarboxylation of intermediates 22 can be achieved under acidic conditions for example TFA to provide the acids 2b.

Alternatively acids 2B can be prepared according to Scheme 9. Commercially available cyano phenols 23 can be converted to their triflates 24 using for example triflic anhydride. Heating 24 with 2 tert butoxy 2 oxoethyl chloro zinc 25 in the presence of a palladium catalyst such as palladium Tetrakis triphenylphoshine can provide the coupled products 26. Hydrolysis is then achieved under acidic conditions with for example TFA to afford the acids 2B. In place of triflates 24 cyanophenyl halides or cyanoheterocyclic halides may be employed in a similar fashion.

Similarly acids 2A may be prepared according to Scheme 10. In this case haloanilines bromoanilines shown are coupled to 2 tert butoxy 2 oxoethyl chloro zinc 25 in the presence of a palladium catalyst such as palladium tetrakis triphenylphoshine to provide the coupled products 28. Cyclization to afford the tetrazoles 29 again could be accomplished as described above for Scheme 6. Hydrolysis is then achieved under acidic conditions with for example TFA to afford the acids 2A.

Epoxides 4 may be prepared by a variety of methods. One approach is described by Scheme 11. Aryl or heterocyclic halides bromide 30 shown may be coupled to form alkene products 31 in a number of ways for example by Heck reaction or by reaction with vinyl tetrafluoroborate Molander G. Luciana A. Journal of Organic Chemistry 2005 70 10 3950 3956 under palladium catalyzed coupling conditions with an appropriate phosphine ligand Molander G. Brown A. Journal of Organic Chemistry 2006 71 26 9681 9686 . The alkenes 28 can then be converted to the corresponding epoxides 6 by several ways including treatment with meta chloroperoxybenzoic acid Fringuelli F. et al. Organic Preparations and Procedures International 1989 21 6 757 761 .

Bromomethylketones 8 may be prepared in a variety of ways one route is depicted in Scheme 12. According to the Scheme aryl or heterocyclic halides bromide shown can be reacted with tributyl 1 ethoxyvinyl tin in the presence of a metal catalyst such as PdCl PPh to provide an intermediate ethylenolether. This is subsequently treated in the same reaction vessel with N bromosuccinimide NBS with added tetrahydrofuran and water to provide bromomethylketones 8. Chloromethyl ketones can similarly be prepared by employing N chlorosuccinimide in place of N bromosuccinimide.
