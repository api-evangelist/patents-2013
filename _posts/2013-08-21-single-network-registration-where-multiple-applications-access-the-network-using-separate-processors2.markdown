The disclosure is directed to providing a single network registration where multiple applications access the network using separate processors.

Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations including a first generation analog wireless phone service 1G a second generation 2G digital wireless phone service including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks and third generation 3G and fourth generation 4G high speed data Internet capable wireless services. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use including Cellular and Personal Communications Service PCS systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System AMPS and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Frequency Division Multiple Access FDMA Time Division Multiple Access TDMA the Global System for Mobile access GSM variation of TDMA and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.

More recently Long Term Evolution LTE has been developed as a wireless communications protocol for wireless communication of high speed data for mobile phones and other data terminals. LTE is based on GSM and includes contributions from various GSM related protocols such as Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution EDGE and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS protocols such as High Speed Packet Access HSPA .

The IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS framework currently provides various services such as Voice over LTE VoLTE Video Telephony VT and Rich Communication Services RCS . Ideally all of these services should be co located on a user device and show as one REGISTRATION on the network. If all of the services are communicating through either the modem processor or the application processor then the REGISTRATION goes through one IP address either the IP address of the modem processor or of the application processor and shows as one REGISTRATION.

A problem arises however when RCS communicates through the application processor and VoLTE VT applications communicate through the modem processor because if RCS performs a REGISTRATION using the application processor s IP address and a VoLTE application performs a REGISTRATION using the modem processor s IP address then there will be two registrations on the network from the same user device for different services.

The disclosure is directed to providing a single network registration for a first application on a first processor and a second application on a second processor of a user equipment UE . A method for providing a single network registration for a first application on a first processor and a second application on a second processor of a UE includes initiating a network registration using a registration manager on the first processor adding from the second processor first registration information for the second application to the registration manager on the first processor and appending the network registration with the first registration information using the first processor.

An apparatus for providing a single network registration for a first application on a first processor and a second application on a second processor of a UE includes logic configured to initiate a network registration using a registration manager on the first processor logic configured to add from the second processor first registration information for the second application to the registration manager on the first processor and logic configured to append the network registration with the first registration information using the first processor.

An apparatus for providing a single network registration for a first application on a first processor and a second application on a second processor of a UE includes means for initiating a network registration using a registration manager on the first processor means for adding from the second processor first registration information for the second application to the registration manager on the first processor and means for appending the network registration with the first registration information using the first processor.

A non transitory computer readable medium for providing a single network registration for a first application on a first processor and a second application on a second processor of a UE includes at least one instruction to initiate a network registration using a registration manager on the first processor at least one instruction to add from the second processor first registration information for the second application to the registration manager on the first processor and at least one instruction to append the network registration with the first registration information using the first processor.

Various aspects are disclosed in the following description and related drawings. Alternate aspects may be devised without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Additionally well known elements of the disclosure will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the disclosure.

The words exemplary and or example are used herein to mean serving as an example instance or illustration. Any aspect described herein as exemplary and or example is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects. Likewise the term aspects of the disclosure does not require that all aspects of the disclosure include the discussed feature advantage or mode of operation.

Further many aspects are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by for example elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits e.g. application specific integrated circuits ASICs by program instructions being executed by one or more processors or by a combination of both. Additionally these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus the various aspects of the disclosure may be embodied in a number of different forms all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition for each of the aspects described herein the corresponding form of any such aspects may be described herein as for example logic configured to perform the described action.

A client device referred to herein as a user equipment UE may be mobile or stationary and may communicate with a radio access network RAN . As used herein the term UE may be referred to interchangeably as an access terminal or AT a wireless device a subscriber device a subscriber terminal a subscriber station a user terminal or UT a mobile terminal a mobile station and variations thereof. Generally UEs can communicate with a core network via the RAN and through the core network the UEs can be connected with external networks such as the Internet. Of course other mechanisms of connecting to the core network and or the Internet are also possible for the UEs such as over wired access networks. WiFi networks e.g. based on IEEE 802.11 etc. and so on. UEs can be embodied by any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC cards compact flash devices external or internal modems wireless or wireline phones and so on. A communication link through which UEs can send signals to the RAN is called an uplink channel e.g. a reverse traffic channel a reverse control channel an access channel etc. . A communication link through which the RAN can send signals to UEs is called a downlink or forward link channel e.g. a paging channel a control channel a broadcast channel a forward traffic channel etc. . As used herein the term traffic channel TCH can refer to either an uplink reverse or downlink forward traffic channel.

Referring to UEs 1 . . . N are configured to communicate with an access network e.g. the RAN an access point etc. over a physical communications interface or layer shown in as air interfaces and or a direct wired connection. The air interfaces and can comply with a given cellular communications protocol e.g. Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Evolution Data Optimized EV DO Evolved High Rate Packet Data eHRPD Global System of Mobile Communication GSM Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution EDGE Wideband CDMA W CDMA Long Term Evolution LTE etc. while the air interface can comply with a wireless IP protocol e.g. IEEE 802.11 . The RAN includes a plurality of access points that serve UEs over air interfaces such as the air interfaces and . The access points in the RAN can be referred to as access nodes or ANs access points or APs base stations or BSs Node Bs eNode Bs and so on. These access points can be terrestrial access points or ground stations or satellite access points. The RAN is configured to connect to a core network that can perform a variety of functions including bridging circuit switched CS calls between UEs served by the RAN and other UEs served by the RAN or a different RAN altogether and can also mediate an exchange of packet switched PS data with external networks such as Internet . The Internet includes a number of routing agents and processing agents not shown in for the sake of convenience . In UE N is shown as connecting to the Internet directly i.e. separate from the core network such as over an Ethernet connection of Win or 802.11 based network . The Internet can thereby function to bridge packet switched data communications between UE N and UEs 1 . . . N via the core network . Also shown in is the access point that is separate from the RAN . The access point may be connected to the Internet independent of the core network e.g. via an optical communication system such as FiOS a cable modem etc. . The air interface may serve UE 4 or UE 5 over a local wireless connection such as IEEE 802.11 in an example UE N is shown as a desktop computer with a wired connection to the Internet such as a direct connection to a modem or router which can correspond to the access point itself in an example e.g. for a WiFi router with both wired and wireless connectivity .

Referring to an application server is shown as connected to the Internet the core network or both. The application server can be implemented as a plurality of structurally separate servers or alternately may correspond to a single server. As will be described below in more detail the application server is configured to support one or more communication services e.g. Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP sessions Push to Talk PTT sessions group communication sessions social networking services etc. for UEs that can connect to the application server via the core network and or the Internet .

Examples of protocol specific implementations for the RAN and the core network are provided below with respect to to help explain the wireless communications system in more detail. In particular the components of the RAN and the core network corresponds to components associated with supporting packet switched PS communications whereby legacy circuit switched CS components may also be present in these networks but any legacy CS specific components are not shown explicitly in .

In the core network includes the above noted SGSN B and potentially a number of other SGSNs as well and a GGSN B. Generally GPRS is a protocol used in GSM for routing IP packets. The GPRS core network e.g. the GGSN B and one or more SGSNs B is the centralized part of the GPRS system and also provides support for W CDMA based 3G access networks. The GPRS core network is an integrated part of the GSM core network i.e. the core network that provides mobility management session management and transport for IP packet services in GSM and W CDMA networks.

The GPRS Tunneling Protocol GTP is the defining IP protocol of the GPRS core network. The GTP is the protocol which allows end users e.g. UEs of a GSM or W CDMA network to move from place to place while continuing to connect to the Internet as if from one location at the GGSN B. This is achieved by transferring the respective UE s data from the UE s current SGSN B to the GGSN B which is handling the respective UE s session.

Three forms of GTP are used by the GPRS core network namely i GTP U ii GTP C and iii GTP GTP Prime . GTP U is used for transfer of user data in separated tunnels for each packet data protocol PDP context. GTP C is used for control signaling e.g. setup and deletion of PDP contexts verification of GSN reach ability updates or modifications such as when a subscriber moves from one SGSN to another etc. . GTP is used for transfer of charging data from GSNs to a charging function.

Referring to the GGSN B acts as an interface between a GPRS backbone network not shown and the Internet . The GGSN B extracts packet data with associated a packet data protocol PDP format e.g. IP or PPP from GPRS packets coming from the SGSN B and sends the packets out on a corresponding packet data network. In the other direction the incoming data packets are directed by the GGSN connected UE to the SGSN B which manages and controls the Radio Access Bearer RAB of a target UE served by the RAN . Thereby the GGSN B stores the current SGSN address of the target UE and its associated profile in a location register e.g. within a PDP context . The GGSN B is responsible for IP address assignment and is the default router for a connected UE. The GGSN B also performs authentication and charging functions.

The SGSN B is representative of one of many SGSNs within the core network in an example. Each SGSN is responsible for the delivery of data packets from and to the UEs within an associated geographical service area. The tasks of the SGSN B includes packet routing and transfer mobility management e.g. attach detach and location management logical link management and authentication and charging functions. The location register of the SGSN B stores location information e.g. current cell current VLR and user profiles e.g. IMSI PDP address es used in the packet data network of all GPRS users registered with the SGSN B for example within one or more PDP contexts for each user or UE. Thus SGSNs B are responsible for i de tunneling downlink GTP packets from the GGSN B ii uplink tunnel IP packets toward the GGSN B iii carrying out mobility management as UEs move between SGSN service areas and iv billing mobile subscribers. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art aside from i iv SGSNs configured for GSM EDGE networks have slightly different functionality as compared to SGSNs configured for W CDMA networks.

The RAN e.g. or UTRAN in UMTS system architecture communicates with the SGSN B via a Radio Access Network Application Part RANAP protocol. RANAP operates over a Iu interface Iu ps with a transmission protocol such as Frame Relay or IP. The SGSN B communicates with the GGSN B via a Gn interface which is an IP based interface between SGSN B and other SGSNs not shown and internal GGSNs not shown and uses the GTP protocol defined above e.g. GTP U GTP C GTP etc. . In the example of the Gn between the SGSN B and the GGSN B carries both the GTP C and the GTP U. While not shown in the Gn interface is also used by the Domain Name System DNS . The GGSN B is connected to a Public Data Network PDN not shown and in turn to the Internet via a Gi interface with IP protocols either directly or through a Wireless Application Protocol WAP gateway.

In the core network includes a plurality of Mobility Management Entities MMEs D and D a Home Subscriber Server HSS D a Serving Gateway S GW D a Packet Data Network Gateway P GW D and a Policy and Charging Rules Function PCRF D. Network interfaces between these components the RAN and the Internet are illustrated in and are defined in Table 1 below as follows 

A high level description of the components shown in the RAN and core network of will now be described. However these components are each well known in the art from various 3GPP TS standards and the description contained herein is not intended to be an exhaustive description of all functionalities performed by these components.

Referring to the MMEs D and D are configured to manage the control plane signaling for the EPS bearers. MME functions include Non Access Stratum NAS signaling NAS signaling security Mobility management for inter and intra technology handovers P GW and S GW selection and MME selection for handovers with MME change.

Referring to the S GW D is the gateway that terminates the interface toward the RAN . For each UE associated with the core network for an EPS based system at a given point of time there is a single S GW. The functions of the S GW D for both the GTP based and the Proxy Mobile IPv6 PMIP based S5 S8 include Mobility anchor point Packet routing and forwarding and setting the DiffServ Code Point DSCP based on a QoS Class Identifier QCI of the associated EPS bearer.

Referring to the P GW D is the gateway that terminates the SGi interface toward the Packet Data Network PDN e.g. the Internet . If a UE is accessing multiple PDNs there may be more than one P GW for that UE however a mix of S5 S8 connectivity and Gn Gp connectivity is not typically supported for that UE simultaneously. P GW functions include for both the GTP based S5 S8 Packet filtering by deep packet inspection UE IP address allocation setting the DSCP based on the QCI of the associated EPS bearer accounting for inter operator charging uplink UL and downlink DL bearer binding as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 UL bearer binding verification as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203. The P GW D provides PDN connectivity to both GSM EDGE Radio Access Network GERAN UTRAN only UEs and E UTRAN capable UEs using any of E UTRAN GERAN or UTRAN. The P GW D provides PDN connectivity to E UTRAN capable UEs using E UTRAN only over the S5 S8 interface.

Referring to the PCRF D is the policy and charging control element of the EPS based core network . In a non roaming scenario there is a single PCRF in the HPLMN associated with a UE s Internet Protocol Connectivity Access Network IP CAN session. The PCRF terminates the Rx interface and the Gx interface. In a roaming scenario with local breakout of traffic there may be two PCRFs associated with a UE s IP CAN session A Home PCRF H PCRF is a PCRF that resides within a HPLMN and a Visited PCRF V PCRF is a PCRF that resides within a visited VPLMN. PCRF is described in more detail in 3GPP TS 23.203 and as such will not be described further for the sake of brevity. In the application server e.g. which can be referred to as the AF in 3GPP terminology is shown as connected to the core network via the Internet or alternatively to the PCRF D directly via an Rx interface. Generally the application server or AF is an element offering applications that use IP bearer resources with the core network e.g. UMTS PS domain GPRS domain resources LTE PS data services . One example of an application function is the Proxy Call Session Control Function P CSCF of the IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS Core Network sub system. The AF uses the Rx reference point to provide session information to the PCRF D. Any other application server offering IP data services over cellular network can also be connected to the PCRF D via the Rx reference point.

In the eHRPD RAN includes a plurality of base transceiver stations BTS E E and E which are connected to an enhanced BSC eBSC and enhanced PCF ePCF E. The eBSC ePCF E can connect to one of the MMEs D or D within the EPS core network A over an S101 interface and to an HRPD serving gateway HSGW E over A10 and or A11 interfaces for interfacing with other entities in the EPS core network A e.g. the S GW D over an S103 interface the P GW D over an S2a interface the PCRF D over a Gxa interface a 3GPP AAA server not shown explicitly in over an STa interface etc. . The HSGW E is defined in 3GPP2 to provide the interworking between HRPD networks and EPS LTE networks. As will be appreciated the eHRPD RAN and the HSGW E are configured with interface functionality to EPC LTE networks that is not available in legacy HRPD networks.

Turning back to the eHRPD RAN in addition to interfacing with the EPS LTE network A the eHRPD RAN can also interface with legacy HRPD networks such as HRPD network B. As will be appreciated the HRPD network B is an example implementation of a legacy HRPD network such as the EV DO network from . For example the eBSC ePCF E can interface with an authentication authorization and accounting AAA server E via an A12 interface or to a PDSN FA E via an A10 or A11 interface. The PDSN FA E in turn connects to HA A through which the Internet can be accessed. In certain interfaces e.g. A13 A16 H1 H2 etc. are not described explicitly but are shown for completeness and would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art familiar with HRPD or eHRPD.

Referring to it will be appreciated that LTE core networks e.g. and HRPD core networks that interface with eHRPD RANs and HSGWs e.g. can support network initiated Quality of Service QoS e.g. by the P GW GGSN SGSN etc. in certain cases.

While internal components of UEs such as the UEs A and B can be embodied with different hardware configurations a basic high level UE configuration for internal hardware components is shown as platform in . The platform can receive and execute software applications data and or commands transmitted from the RAN that may ultimately come from the core network the Internet and or other remote servers and networks e.g. application server web URLs etc. . The platform can also independently execute locally stored applications without RAN interaction. The platform can include a transceiver operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other processor microprocessor logic circuit or other data processing device. The ASIC or other processor executes the application programming interface API layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory of the wireless device. The memory can be comprised of read only memory ROM or random access memory RAM electrically erasable programmable ROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform also can include a local database that can store applications not actively used in memory as well as other data. The local database is typically a flash memory cell but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art such as magnetic media EEPROM optical media tape soft or hard disk or the like.

Accordingly an aspect of the disclosure can include a UE e.g. UE A B etc. including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example ASIC memory API and local database may all be used cooperatively to load store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore the features of the UEs A and B in are to be considered merely illustrative and the disclosure is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.

The wireless communication between the UEs A and or B and the RAN can be based on different technologies such as CDMA W CDMA time division multiple access TDMA frequency division multiple access FDMA Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM GSM or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art voice transmission and or data can be transmitted to the UEs from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the aspects of the disclosure and are merely to aid in the description of various aspects of the disclosure.

Referring to the communication device includes logic configured to receive and or transmit information . In an example if the communication device corresponds to a wireless communications device e.g. UE A or B one of BSs A through A one of Node Bs B through B one of eNodeBs D through D etc. the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can include a wireless communications interface e.g. Bluetooth WiFi 2G CDMA W CDMA 3G 4G LTE etc. such as a wireless transceiver and associated hardware e.g. an RF antenna a MODEM a modulator and or demodulator etc. . In another example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can correspond to a wired communications interface e.g. a serial connection a USB or Fir wire connection an Ethernet connection through which the Internet can be accessed etc. . Thus if the communication device corresponds to some type of network based server e.g. PDSN SGSN GGSN S GW P GW MME HSS PCRF the application etc. the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can correspond to an Ethernet card in an example that connects the network based server to other communication entities via an Ethernet protocol. In a further example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can include sensory or measurement hardware by which the communication device can monitor its local environment e.g. an accelerometer a temperature sensor a light sensor an antenna for monitoring local RF signals etc. . The logic configured to receive and or transmit information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to receive and or transmit information to perform its reception and or transmission function s . However the logic configured to receive and or transmit information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to receive and or transmit information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further includes logic configured to process information . In an example the logic configured to process information can include at least a processor. Example implementations of the type of processing that can be performed by the logic configured to process information includes but is not limited to performing determinations establishing connections making selections between different information options performing evaluations related to data interacting with sensors coupled to the communication device to perform measurement operations converting information from one format to another e.g. between different protocols such as .wmv to .avi etc. and so on. For example the logic configured to process information may include logic configured to initiate a network registration using a registration manager on a first processor logic configured to add from a second processor first registration information for a second application to the registration manager on the first processor and logic configured to append the network registration with the first registration information using the first processor. The processor included in the logic configured to process information can correspond to a general purpose processor a digital signal processor DSP an ASIC a field programmable gate array FPGA or other programmable logic device discrete gate or transistor logic discrete hardware components or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described herein. A general purpose processor may be a microprocessor but in the alternative the processor may be any conventional processor controller microcontroller or state machine. A processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices e.g. a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor a plurality of microprocessors one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core or any other such configuration. The logic configured to process information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to process information to perform its processing function s . However the logic configured to process information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to process information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further includes logic configured to store information . In an example the logic configured to store information can include at least a non transitory memory and associated hardware e.g. a memory controller etc. . For example the non transitory memory included in the logic configured to store information can correspond to RAM flash memory. ROM erasable programmable ROM EPROM EEPROM registers hard disk a removable disk CD ROM or any other form of storage medium known in the art. The logic configured to store information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to store information to perform its storage function s . However the logic configured to store information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to store information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further optionally includes logic configured to present information . In an example the logic configured to present information can include at least an output device and associated hardware. For example the output device can include a video output device e.g. a display screen a port that can carry video information such as USB HDMI etc. an audio output device speakers a port that can carry audio information such as a microphone jack USB HDMI etc. a vibration device and or any other device by which information can be formatted for output or actually outputted by a user or operator of the communication device . For example if the communication device corresponds to UE A or UE B as shown in the logic configured to present information can include the display A of UE A or the touchscreen display B of UE B. In a further example the logic configured to present information can be omitted for certain communication devices such as network communication devices that do not have a local user e.g. network switches or routers remote servers etc. . The logic configured to present information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to present information to perform its presentation function s . However the logic configured to present information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to present information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further optionally includes logic configured to receive local user input . In an example the logic configured to receive local user input can include at least a user input device and associated hardware. For example the user input device can include buttons a touchscreen display a keyboard a camera an audio input device e.g. a microphone or a port that can carry audio information such as a microphone jack etc. and or any other device by which information can be received from a user or operator of the communication device . For example if the communication device corresponds to UE A or UE B as shown in the logic configured to receive local user input can include the keypad A any of the buttons A or B through B the touchscreen display B etc. In a further example the logic configured to receive local user input can be omitted for certain communication devices such as network communication devices that do not have a local user e.g. network switches or routers remote servers etc. . The logic configured to receive local user input can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to receive local user input to perform its input reception function s . However the logic configured to receive local user input does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to receive local user input relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to while the configured logics of through are shown as separate or distinct blocks in it will be appreciated that the hardware and or software by which the respective configured logic performs its functionality can overlap in part. For example any software used to facilitate the functionality of the configured logics of through can be stored in the non transitory memory associated with the logic configured to store information such that the configured logics of through each performs their functionality i.e. in this case software execution based in part upon the operation of software stored by the logic configured to store information . Likewise hardware that is directly associated with one of the configured logics can be borrowed or used by other configured logics from time to time. For example the processor of the logic configured to process information can format data into an appropriate format before being transmitted by the logic configured to receive and or transmit information such that the logic configured to receive and or transmit information performs its functionality i.e. in this case transmission of data based in part upon the operation of hardware i.e. the processor associated with the logic configured to process information .

Generally unless stated otherwise explicitly the phrase logic configured to as used throughout this disclosure is intended to invoke an aspect that is at least partially implemented with hardware and is not intended to map to software only implementations that are independent of hardware. Also it will be appreciated that the configured logic or logic configured to in the various blocks are not limited to specific logic gates or elements but generally refer to the ability to perform the functionality described herein either via hardware or a combination of hardware and software . Thus the configured logics or logic configured to as illustrated in the various blocks are not necessarily implemented as logic gates or logic elements despite sharing the word logic. Other interactions or cooperation between the logic in the various blocks will become clear to one of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the aspects described below in more detail.

Sessions that operate over networks such as 1 EV DO in UMTS based W CDMA in LTE in and eHRPD in can be supported on channels e.g. RABs flows etc. for which a guaranteed quality level is reserved which is referred to as Quality of Service QoS . For example establishing a given level of QoS on a particular channel may provide one or more of a minimum guaranteed bit rate GBR on that channel a maximum delay jitter latency bit error rate BER and so on. QoS resources can be reserved or setup for channels associated with real time or streaming communication sessions such as Voice over IP VoIP sessions group communication sessions e.g. PTT sessions etc. online games IP TV and so on to help ensure seamless end to end packet transfer for these sessions.

The various embodiments may be implemented on any of a variety of commercially available server devices such as server illustrated in . In an example the server may correspond to one example configuration of the application server described above. In the server includes a processor coupled to volatile memory and a large capacity nonvolatile memory such as a disk drive . The server may also include a floppy disc drive compact disc CD or DVD disc drive coupled to the processor . The server may also include network access ports coupled to the processor for establishing data connections with a network such as a local area network coupled to other broadcast system computers and servers or to the Internet. In context with it will be appreciated that the server of illustrates one example implementation of the communication device whereby the logic configured to transmit and or receive information corresponds to the network access points used by the server to communicate with the network the logic configured to process information corresponds to the processor and the logic configuration to store information corresponds to any combination of the volatile memory the disk drive and or the disc drive . The optional logic configured to present information and the optional logic configured to receive local user input are not shown explicitly in and may or may not be included therein. Thus helps to demonstrate that the communication device may be implemented as a server in addition to a UE implementation as in A or B as in .

The IMS framework currently provides various services such as VoLTE Video Telephony VT and Rich Communication Services RCS . Ideally all of these services should be co located on a user device and show as one registration on the network. If all of the services are communicating through either the modem processor or the application processor then the registration goes through one IP address either the IP address of the modem processor or of the application processor and shows as one registration.

A problem arises however when the RCS communicates through the application processor and VoLTE VT applications communicate through the modem processor because if the RCS performs a registration using the application processor s IP address and a VoLTE application performs a registration using the modem processor s IP address then there will be two registrations on the network from the same user device for different services.

At the RCS on the application processor sends an RCS registration request to the registration manager on the application processor or apps processor. At the registration manager sends a registration request for the RCS to the network . At the network acknowledges the registration request with for example a 200 OK message. At this point the RCS is associated with the IP address of the application processor. Although illustrates the VoLTE registration occurring before the RCS registration the RCS registration may occur first or the registrations may occur simultaneously.

At an application sends a request to the RCS to register the application with the network by adding custom feature tags FT of the application to the network registration. At the RCS sends a request to the registration manager to add the custom feature tags to the network registration. At the registration manager sends a request to the network to append the registration with the custom feature tags. At the network acknowledges the request with for example a 200 OK message. At the registration manager notifies the RCS that the custom feature tags have been added to the network registration and at the RCS notifies the application that its custom feature tags have been successfully added to the network registration.

To provide a single registration when RCS for example is running on the application processor and IMS VoLTE applications for example are running on the modem processor the IMS stack can be split between the modem processor and the application processor leaving the network dispatcher on the modem processor. In this way a session initiation protocol SIP message is always dispatched to and received from the network via the modem processor but registration can be initiated by the modem processor the application processor or both. Thus when the modem processor boots up it can perform the IMS registration and then when the application processor completes its initial configuration it can trigger the re registration to the modem processor by adding RCS specific feature tags through a proprietary pipe between the modem processor and the application processor.

At the RCS on the application processor or apps processor sends a request to a registration trigger on the application processor to register the RCS with the network . The registration request may include default RCS feature tags. An application or service such as the RCS may register with the network by adding its feature tags FT to the current network registration or by creating a network registration that includes its feature tags if there is no current network registration. At the registration trigger sends a registration request to the registration manager on the modem processor to register the RCS with the network by adding the RCS feature tags to the network registration. A registration request may simply be the feature tags of the application or service such as the RCS requesting network registration. At the registration manager sends a request to the network to append the current network registration with the RCS feature tags.

At the network acknowledges the request with for example a 200 OK message. At the registration manager on the modem processor sends a message to the registration trigger on the application processor indicating that the network registration status has been updated with the default RCS feature tags. At the registration trigger notifies the RCS that the registration was successful. At this point the RCS is associated with the IP address of the modem processor rather than the application processor. Although illustrates the VoLTE registration occurring before the RCS registration the RCS registration may occur first or the registrations may occur simultaneously.

At an application sends a request to the RCS to register the application with the network . The application may be but need not be associated with the RCS for example an RCS application. Rather the RCS simply facilitates the API s of the application being added to the registration manager and in the form of RCS capability. As with the RCS the application may register with the network by adding its custom feature tags to the current network registration. The custom feature tags may be but need not be custom RCS feature tags. At the RCS sends a request to the registration trigger to add the application s custom feature tags to the current network registration. At the registration trigger sends a request to the registration manager on the modem processor to add the application s custom feature tags to the network registration thereby registering the application with the network . At the registration manager sends a request to the network to append the network registration with the custom feature tags.

At the network acknowledges the request with for example a 200 OK message. At the registration manager on the modem processor sends a message to the registration trigger on the application processor indicating that the registration status has been updated with the application s custom feature tags. At the registration trigger notifies the RCS that the custom feature tags have been added to the network registration and at the RCS notifies the application that its custom feature tags have been successfully added to the network registration. At this point the application is associated with the IP address of the modem processor rather than the application processor.

As illustrated in the registration trigger receives registration requests from applications and or services that would otherwise register with the network through the application processor such as application and the RCS and forwards them to the registration manager on the modem processor instead of sending them out to the network . By forwarding these registration requests to the registration manager on the modem processor these applications services will be associated with the IP address of the modem processor rather than the IP address of the application processor. In that way all applications services running on the UE will have the same IP address.

Although illustrates a VoLTE service registering with the network via the registration manager on the modem processor the VoLTE service is just an example and the illustrated registration is equally applicable to any service or application that registers with the network via the modem processor. Likewise although illustrates the RCS registering with the network via the registration trigger on the application processor the RCS is just an example and the illustrated registration is equally applicable to any service or application that registers with the network via the application processor.

While illustrates a single application in addition to the RCS registering with the network any number of applications may register with the network via the registration trigger on the application processor. Where multiple applications and or services register through the registration trigger the registration trigger may combine the custom feature tags of each application received within a threshold period of time into a single registration request send separate registration requests with each application s custom feature tags or a combination of both. For example the registration trigger may combine the custom feature tags of each application that launches when the UE boots up into a single registration request and then send individual registration requests for applications that the UE launches after boot up.

At the registration manager on the modem processor sends a VoLTE registration request for example to the network . As in the network may include the various network elements illustrated in such as the RAN the core network the application server and the Internet . The UE may communicate with the network as described above with respect to UEs 1 to N in and or UEs A and B in . At the registration manager receives a registration success message from the network . At this point the VoLTE service is associated with the IP address of the modem processor.

At the RCS on the application processor or apps processor sends a request to the registration trigger on the application processor to register the RCS with the network . As described above an application or service such as the RCS may register with the network by adding its feature tags FT to the current network registration or by creating a network registration that includes its feature tags if there is no current network registration. The feature tags may be default RCS feature tags. At the registration trigger sends a registration request to the registration manager on the modem processor to register the RCS with the network by adding the RCS feature tags to the network registration. A registration request may simply be the feature tags of the application or service such as the RCS requesting network registration. At the registration manager sends a request to the network to append the current network registration with the RCS feature tags.

At the network acknowledges the request with for example a 200 OK message. At the registration manager on the modem processor sends a message to the registration trigger on the application processor indicating that the network registration status has been updated with the default RCS feature tags.

At an application A A sends a request to the RCS to register the application A A with the network . The application A A may be but need not be an application associated with the RCS . As with the RCS adding its default feature tags to the network registration the application A A may register with the network by adding its custom feature tags to the current network registration. The custom feature tags may be but need not be custom RCS feature tags. At the RCS sends a request to the registration trigger to add the application A s A custom feature tags to the current network registration.

At an application B B sends a request to the RCS to register the application B B with the network . The application B B may be but need not be an application associated with the RCS . As with the application A A the application B B may register with the network by adding its custom feature tags to the current network registration. At the RCS sends a request to the registration trigger to add the application B s B custom feature tags to the current network registration.

At the registration trigger sends a request to the registration manager on the modem processor to add the custom feature tags of applications A A and B B to the network registration thereby registering the applications A A and B B with the network . The registration trigger may combine the custom feature tags of each application into a single registration request as illustrated in or send them as separate registration requests not shown . At the registration manager sends a request to the network to append the network registration with the custom feature tags. The registration manager may send a single registration request if the registration trigger combined the custom feature tags as illustrated in or separate registration requests if the registration trigger did not combine the custom feature tags not shown .

At the network acknowledges the request with for example a 200 OK message. At the registration manager on the modem processor sends a message to the registration trigger on the application processor indicating that the registration status has been updated with the custom feature tags of applications A A and B B. At the registration trigger notifies the RCS that the custom feature tags were added to the network registration. If the registration requests were separate registration requests then there would be separate acknowledgments for each registration request not shown .

At the RCS notifies the application A A that its custom feature tags were successfully added to the network registration. At the RCS notifies the application B B that its custom feature tags were successfully added to the network registration. At this point the applications A A and B B are associated with the IP address of the modem processor rather than the application processor.
