This application is a U.S. national stage application of International Patent Application No. PCT US2013 051691 filed Jul. 23 2013 and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 674 692 filed Jul. 23 2012 the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was made with United States government support under grants DE SC0002491 awarded by the Department of Energy. The United States government has certain rights in the invention.

This invention relates to solid oxide fuel cells and in particular to seals to prevent mixing of fuel and oxidant streams and to seal the cell stack to the system manifold in solid oxide fuel cells.

Solid oxide fuel cells SOFCs are multi layered structures formed primarily of high purity metal oxides including an ionic conducting electrolyte which generate electricity from the electrochemical oxidation of a fuel source. Planar SOFC configurations are relatively simple to manufacture and have greater power densities and efficiencies than other configurations but require hermetic seals to prevent mixing of the fuel and oxidant streams within the cell stack and to seal the stack to the system manifold.

The seals must have a low electrical conductivity and must be chemically and mechanically stable in a high temperature reactive environment moist reducing and or oxidizing conditions . The seals should exhibit no deleterious interfacial reactions with other cell components should be created at a low enough temperature to avoid damaging cell components under 900 C. for some materials and should not migrate or flow from the designated sealing region during sealing or cell operation because of any applied load.

In addition the sealing system should be able to withstand thermal cycling between the operational temperature and room temperature. That is thermal stresses that develop because of mismatches in the thermal contraction characteristics of the different SOFC materials must either be reduced to well below the failure strengths of the materials or must be relieved in some fashion. Although it is possible to design rigid glass ceramics with coefficient of thermal expansion CTE characteristics that are compatible with other SOFC materials e.g. yttria stabilized zirconia YSZ ferritic stainless steels such as SS441 and alumina as a coating material on ferritic steels and are stable over a long period of time at the operational temperature stresses can still develop because of in plane temperature gradients during operation and thermal cycling. If these stresses lead to cracks in the rigid glass seal or at one of the seal interfaces the operational integrity of the SOFC is compromised.

Currently available glass seals for SOFCs are mostly based on glass ceramics which turn into a rigid ceramics after crystallization at the SOFC operational temperature 650 850 C. These rigid glass seals may have intrinsic flaws that are hard to eliminate and can be detrimental when CTE is not matched. Compliant glass seals have been developed as a means to overcome the limitations of the rigid sealants. These glass seals however contain alkali elements that may cause undesirable reactions with other SOFC components or contain expensive precious metals such as silver. Attempts have been made to develop viscous glass sealants for SOFCs but these attempts use gallium and or germanium that may limit the commercialization due to their high costs.

In one aspect the invention is directed to a sealant for forming a seal between at least two solid oxide fuel cell components wherein the sealant comprises a glass material comprising BOas a principal glass former BaO optionally SiO optionally AlO optionally one or more alkaline earth oxides selected from CaO SrO and MgO and optionally a transition metal oxide selected from among ZnO LaO and ZrO and wherein the glass material is substantially alkali free.

The invention is also directed to a solid oxide fuel cell comprising a sealant for forming a seal between at least two solid oxide fuel cell components wherein the sealant comprises a glass material comprising BOas a principal glass former BaO optionally SiO optionally AlO optionally one or more alkaline earth oxides selected from CaO SrO and MgO and optionally a transition metal oxide selected from among ZnO LaO and ZrO and wherein the glass material is substantially alkali free.

The invention is also directed to a ferritic steel interconnect in an SOFC comprising a sealant between at least two solid oxide fuel cell components wherein the sealant comprises a glass material comprising BOas a principal glass former BaO optionally SiO optionally AlO optionally one or more alkaline earth oxides selected from CaO SrO and MgO and optionally a transition metal oxide selected from among ZnO LaO and ZrO and wherein the glass material is substantially alkali free.

Other objects and features of the invention will be in part apparent and in part pointed out hereinafter.

The use of viscous glass seals provides one means of reducing the risk that thermal stresses will result in catastrophic failures and may provide a means for the seal to recover if cracks do form. The viscosity of the viscous glass seal at the operational temperature should be low enough e.g. 

This invention describes the glass compositions that a possess viscosity temperature characteristics that are compatible with sealing requirements and that allow for stress relaxation and self healing without excessive flow under pressure that would compromise seal integrity b are chemically compatible with SOFC components and so do not alter the thermo mechanical stability of the seal by forming deleterious interfacial reaction products c avoid the significant volatilization of glass constituents under the SOFC operational conditions that has been associated with other sealing materials and so alter the viscous properties of the seal or the performance of the SOFC d exhibit promising hermetic sealing and self healing behavior under SOFC operational conditions.

The sealant compositions of the invention function as a seal in ferritic steel interconnects in SOFCs such as between components in a SOFC such as stainless steel components and oxide components. Oxide components include for example components made from yttria stabilized zirconia YSZ . Stainless steel components include for example components made from stainless steels such as SS441 or Crofer 22 APU. Stainless steel SS441 has a nominal composition in wt of 0.03 max C 1.0 max Mn 0.04 max P 0.015 max S 17.5 18.5 Cr 9 C 0.3 to 1.0 0.45 Nb 0.1 0.6 Ti and balance Fe.

Viscous glass compositions of the invention are alkali free glasses having compositions from the BaO RO AlO BO SiOsystem where RO represents other alkaline earth or transition metal oxides. The compositions comprise BOas a principal glass former in a concentration of between 20 and 65 mol for example between 40 and 60 mol BOin one preferred embodiment. In preferred embodiments the borate concentration is carefully controlled to above 40 mol in order to maintain a low liquidus temperature so that under SOFC operation conditions the glass is viscous not rigid .

The compositions comprise from 10 to 40 wt BaO for example between 10 and 25 mol BaO in one preferred embodiment. The inventors have discovered that BaO in this range facilitates an increased coefficient of thermal expansion CTE to match that of SOFC components to be joined. If the BaO concentration is more than 25 mol the liquidus temperature of glass in the context of these formulations tends to increase to more than 850 C. contrary to a critical goal of this invention to have a liquidus temperature which is within the operating range of the SOFC and therefore less than for example 850 C. It has been discovered that in comparison to other CTE modifiers such as SrO the BaO is less susceptible to unwanted crystallization.

The compositions also include optionally SiOin an amount of up to 30 mol . In some preferred embodiments the SiOcontent is from 10 to 25 mol such as from 12 to 22 mol . The inventors have discovered that of SiOin this range in these compositions reduces the reactivity of the borate based glass by increasing viscosity of the overall borate based composition. AlOmay optionally be included in the range of from 0 to 20 mol such as from 2 to 10 mol to help prevent crystallization of the glass. Certain preferred embodiments have from 2 to 10 mol AlO such as from 2 to 7 mol AlO. At amounts up to 10 mol in the context of these overall formulations AlOhelps to prevent crystallization. But at amounts over 10 mol it tends to promote crystallization.

Alkaline earth oxides selected from CaO 0 to 15 mol such as from 2 to 10 mol SrO 0 to 15 mol such as from 2 to 10 mol and 2 to 7 mol in some preferred embodiments and MgO 0 to 5 mol may also be included to increase the CTE. The compositions may comprise between 2 and 10 mol each of one or more of said alkaline earth oxides selected from the group consisting of CaO SrO and WO. The compositions may further comprise 1 to 10 mol of one or more oxides selected from ZnO LaO and ZrO. The ZnO has been discovered to lower the liquidus temperature to within the desired range in many of the compositions. The LaO and ZrOhelp increase the CTE. One preferred embodiment comprises 40 to 60 mol BO 15 to 25 mol BaO 10 to 25 mol SiO 2 to 10 mol AlO 2 to 10 mol CaO and 2 to 10 mol SrO.

The glass seal materials of the invention are substantially alkali free and preferably completely alkali free. All embodiments of the invention are substantially alkali free in that they contain for example no more than 0.5 mol cumulatively of alkali oxides such as LiO NaO and KO. In one embodiment the cumulative concentration of LiO NaO and KO is less than 0.5 mol such as less than 0.1 mol . In one such embodiment there is no LiO NaO or KO. The presence of the alkali oxides in the viscous glass seal materials of the invention is minimized or avoided because these alkali materials are highly volatile at operational temperature e.g. 650 850 C. and the volatilized species can contaminate other SOFC components. Moreover alkali materials cause lower electrical resistivity whereas the sealing glass should be an electrically insulator.

The alkali materials are also avoided because they promote unwanted crystallization. The glasses are designed to resist crystallization at SOFC operational temperatures of 650 850 C. Some of the compositions of the invention resist crystallization but after long term heat treatment develop partial crystallization. They are still referred to as glass herein because the majority of the material is non crystalline. That is the glass material claimed herein is not necessarily 100 non crystalline unless otherwise indicated. These compositions comprise glass and crystallized material below the range where viscosity is substantially affected such as no more than 30 vol. crystallization or such as no more than 15 vol. crystallization. This partial crystallization may not be significantly detrimental to overall sealing performance i.e. partial crystallization is tolerable in certain applications. Other of the compositions of the invention such as exemplary glass 102 completely resist crystallization and do not crystallize upon heating. After more than 2000 hours at 800 C. the preferred glasses e.g. Glass 102 of the present invention do not form any crystalline Ba boroalumino silicate phase.

The seal composition of the invention has a glass transition temperature T and the softening temperature T below the operational temperature of the SOFC for which it is intended for example of less than about 650 C. The liquidus temperature TO is generally less than 900 C. such as less than 850 C. The seal composition of the invention preferably has a coefficient of thermal expansion between about 7 and about 10 40 500 C. 10 C. . The volatilization rate of the seal composition is less than 1.7 10g mm hr in stagnant dry air at 750 C. such as less than about 4.8 10g mm hr. The seal composition of the invention preferably has a viscosity at 725 C. of less than 10Pa s such as less than about 10Pa s in some embodiments.

Exemplary glass compositions Tables 1 4 and their properties Tables 5 7 are presented in the following tables.

While the materials are described herein as containing various oxides by mol those skilled in the art understand that in the final glass composition the oxide compounds are dissociated and the specific oxides e.g. BO SiO etc. are not separately identifiable or even necessarily separately present. Nonetheless it is conventional in the art to refer to the final composition as containing a given of the individual oxides so that is done here. So from this perspective the compositions herein are on an equivalent basis.

The dilatometric softening points T and the glass transition temperatures T of the glasses are generally under 650 C. the lower bound of the SOFC operating temperature. The glasses generally do not crystallize in a differential scanning calorimeter DSC when heated at a rate of 10 C. min up to 1 000 C.

The configuration of the solid oxide fuel cell of the invention is not narrowly critical to the efficacy of the invention. One exemplary configuration is disclosed in and described in column 11 of U.S. Pat. No. 7 989 374 the entire disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. The invention is further illustrated by the following working examples.

Glass compositions 73 75 77 and 102 were prepared and CTE values 40 500 C. determined to be 8.5 10 C. 8.2 10 C. 9.3 10 C. and 7.3 10 C. respectively. The liquidus temperatures T of Glass 73 75 and 77 are 800 10 C. 810 10 C. and 810 10 C. respectively. It is hard to determine the Tof Glass 102 because it does not crystallize upon heat treatments. Thus these glasses can form viscous seals that do not substantially devitrify under SOFC operational conditions. The X ray diffraction XRD pattern of Glass 102 shown in after isothermal heat treatments for 2 184 hours at 650 C. 750 C. and 850 C. respectively shows no evidence of crystalline phases. This exemplary set of embodiments contains 43 to 58 mol BO 15 to 25 mol BaO 10 to 25 mol SiO 2 to 7 mol AlO 2 to 7 mol CaO and 2 to 7 mol SrO and preferably consists essentially only of these components.

The viscosities of glass melts are measured at intermediate temperatures using a cylinder compression technique with a dynamic mechanical analyzer and at high temperatures using a rotating spindle technique. summarizes the viscosity data collected for Glass 73 75 and 77 with their respective fits to the MYEGA viscosity model. Table 8 shows the isokom data for Glass 73. The Littleton softening point 10Pa s is sometimes defined as the temperature at which a glass will flow under its own weight. With this definition self healing behavior should be possible at temperatures above about 706 C. demonstrates that the viscosity of Glass 102 is stable even upon heat treatment at 800 C. for 2000 hours.

The interfacial reactions of sealing glasses with aluminized 441 stainless steel and a NiO YSZ bilayer are studied using scanning electron microscopy SEM for sandwich seals held in air at 800 C. shows cross sections of sandwich seals made with Glass 102 after 2280 hours at 800 C. in air. The cross sections show excellent wetting and bonding to both aluminized metal and YSZ. The glass is homogenous and there are no crystals in the body of glass. Energy dispersive spectroscopy EDS line scans performed on components sealed according to the invention indicate that there are no elements that have diffused from either metal SS441 or YSZ confirming low volatility and good stability in sandwich seals. Al rich phase BaAlSiO is observed near the metal interface of the seal with Glass 102. The formation mechanism of these crystals is still not clear. Because of the high aluminum content and their presence only near the metal glass interface this phase may form when aluminum is released from the Al rich scale on the SS441 surface. Glass 102 has good chemical stability in the sandwich seals.

Glass stability against volatilization is determined by weight loss measurements at elevated temperatures. Weight loss measurements are conducted as a function of time up to 2 000 hours at 750 C. and 650 C. in flowing wet reducing conditions 5 Hand 95 Nwith a flow rate of 10 mL s and stagnant dry air conditions. The forming gas is bubbled through deionized water held at 70 C. so that the atmosphere contains 30 vol water. shows the linear volatility of Glass 73 in different atmospheres at 750 C. and 650 C. for up to 2 000 hours. The volatilization rates are 2.0 10g mm hr under flowing wet reducing conditions and 1.7 10g mm hr under stagnant dry air conditions respectively at 750 C. and 1.4 10g mm hr under flowing wet reducing conditions at 650 C. The inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy ICP MS analysis on the water trap downstream from the heat treated glass samples indicates that boron is the only component volatilized from the glasses. shows lower volatilization rates e.g. 4.8 10g mm hr in stagnant dry air at 750 C. of Glass 102 than those of Glass 73.

Hermetic seal tests are conducted using a horizontal test manifold . Coupon sealing is conducted by sandwiching Glass 73 paste between an aluminized SS441 disc 3.2 cm diameter and 1 mm thick with a central hole 1 cm diameter and an anode supported NiO YSZ thin electrolyte YSZ bilayer square 2 cm side . To date the Glass 73 seal has survived 100 thermal cycles 750 C. to room temperature in dry air at a differential pressure of 0.5 psi 26 torr over the course of 3 300 hours without failure . The Glass 73 seal has also survived 103 thermal cycles under wet forming gas .

Self healing of glass seals that are intentionally cracked by thermal shock is observed in a SS441 Glass 73 YSZ bilayer sample. The glass in a seal originally found to be hermetic is cracked upon rapid quenching 25 C. s from 800 C. When re heated to 800 C. 750 C. or 725 C. for 2 hours then slowly cooled to room temperature the seal is again hermetic holding a 2 psi differential pressure. From the viscosity temperature curve the viscosity of Glass 73 at 725 C. is 10Pa s close to the Littleton softening point 10Pa s . This is the first demonstration of crack healing in a thermally shocked seal.
