The present patent document is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 857 005 filed Aug. 16 2010 entitled END TO END PROVISIONING OF STORAGE CLOUDS . The disclosure of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 857 005 is incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates generally to storage provisioning. Specifically the present invention relates to end to end provisioning of storage clouds.

The cloud computing environment is an enhancement to the predecessor grid environment whereby multiple grids and other computation resources may be further abstracted by a cloud layer thus making disparate devices appear to an end user as a single pool of seamless resources. These resources may include such things as physical or logical compute engines servers and devices device memory storage devices.

Enterprise storage clouds are comprised of multiple layers of software and hardware components all of which need to be correctly configured for proper functioning of the storage cloud service. For example a Network Attached Storage NAS based storage cloud is typically comprised of storage subsystems inter connection fabric fiber channel InfiniBand Ethernet etc. storage nodes interface nodes file system etc. System administrators have to rely on a litany of management tools to manage and configure these components individually and provision storage resources for end users. Such independent management may be costly error prone and time consuming and may either result in under provisioning or suboptimal utilization of resources.

Embodiments discussed in this disclosure provide an integrated provisioning framework that automates the process of provisioning storage resources end to end for an enterprise storage cloud environment. Such embodiments configure and orchestrate the deployment of a user s workload and at the same time provide optimization across a multitude of storage cloud resources. Along these lines input is received in the form of workload requirements and configuration information for available system resources. Based on the input a set at least one of storage cloud configuration plans is developed that satisfy the workload requirements. A set of scripts is then generated that orchestrate the deployment and configuration of different software and hardware components based on the plans.

In this disclosure it is assumed that the storage cloud is based on General Parallel File Systems GPFS which provides a scalable and parallel access to backend storage consisting of a Storage Area Network SAN . However this need not be the case as similar techniques can also be applied to other cloud architectures as well. Moreover it is understood in advance that although this disclosure includes a detailed description of cloud computing implementation of the teachings recited herein are not limited to a cloud computing environment. Rather embodiments of the present invention are capable of being implemented in conjunction with any other type of computing environment now known or later developed.

Cloud computing is a model of service delivery for enabling convenient on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources e.g. networks network bandwidth servers processing memory storage applications virtual machines and services that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with a provider of the service. This cloud model may include at least five characteristics at least three service models and at least four deployment models.

On demand self service a cloud consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities such as server time and network storage as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with the service s provider.

Broad network access capabilities are available over a network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms e.g. mobile phones laptops and PDAs .

Resource pooling the provider s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi tenant model with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the consumer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction e.g. country state or datacenter .

Rapid elasticity capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned in some cases automatically to quickly scale out and rapidly released to quickly scale in. To the consumer the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any time.

Measured service cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service e.g. storage processing bandwidth and active user accounts . Resource usage can be monitored controlled and reported providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

Software as a Service SaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider s applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a web browser e.g. web based email . The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network servers operating systems storage or even individual application capabilities with the possible exception of limited user specific application configuration settings.

Platform as a Service PaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer created or acquired applications created using programming languages and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including networks servers operating systems or storage but has control over the deployed applications and possibly application hosting environment configurations.

Infrastructure as a Service IaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing storage networks and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems storage deployed applications and possibly limited control of select networking components e.g. host firewalls .

Private cloud the cloud infrastructure is operated solely for an organization. It may be managed by the organization or a third party and may exist on premises or off premises.

Community cloud the cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns e.g. mission security requirements policy and compliance considerations . It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on premises or off premises.

Public cloud the cloud infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by an organization selling cloud services.

Hybrid cloud the cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds private community or public that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability e.g. cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds .

A cloud computing environment is service oriented with a focus on statelessness low coupling modularity and semantic interoperability. At the heart of cloud computing is an infrastructure comprising a network of interconnected nodes.

It is understood all functions of the present invention as described herein are typically performed by the end to end provisioning function which can be tangibly embodied as modules of program code of program utility . However this need not be the case. Rather the functionality recited herein could be carried out implemented and or enabled by any of the layers shown in .

It is reiterated that although this disclosure includes a detailed description on cloud computing implementation of the teachings recited herein are not limited to a cloud computing environment. Rather the embodiments of the present invention are intended to be implemented with any type of clustered computing environment now known or later developed. Moreover although the illustrative embodiment of discusses a GPFS based cloud storage configuration this need not be the case. Rather the teachings recited herein could be applied to any type of storage configuration.

Referring now to an illustrative architecture according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown. As shown a set at least one of clients can communicate with a set of interface nodes e.g. GPFS nodes over a network connection e.g. LAN WAN etc. . Set of interface nodes then communicate via interconnects e.g. high sped interconnects with a set of storage nodes . As further shown set of storage nodes then interface with a set of storage subsystems e.g. Redundant Array of Independent Disks RAID via fiber channel network . As discussed above the embodiments of the present invention provide end to end provisioning for storage architectures such as that shown in . Among other things such embodiments will discover resources present in a given architecture take into account workload requirements and configurations develop a set of plans for provisioning the architecture based on the workload requirements and configurations and develop scripts for executing the set of plans.

Referring now to a process flow diagram according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown. Specifically depicts various components and or elements that perform the functions of the embodiments of the present invention. Among other things one task performed by provisioning engine P is to determine provide storage configuration s e.g. a GPFS configuration that can accommodate 1 the space performance and other requirements of the specified workloads e.g. workload requirements P 2 different resource configurations such as storage subsystem configuration P fabric configuration P and host HBA configuration P and models such as subsystem models P.

The first step in the automated planning comprises discovery of all available resources like storage subsystems interconnection fabric servers etc. and their configurations P P. The performance and resiliency of the storage cloud may be dependent on the composition and configuration of different logical and physical entities like storage arrays Logical Unit Numbers LUNs zoning I O servers etc. As further shown configurations P P and models P can be received by end to end modeling system P which will generate a set of models that is utilized by provisioning planning engine P along with workload requirements P to generate a set of plans such as GPFS cluster plan P network fabric plan P storage subsystem plan P. In a typical embodiment workload requirements P can be specified as follows 

Performance Requirements Input Output per Second IOPS read write ratio random sequential ratio cache hit ratio etc.

In one embodiment the plan s P can call for either extending an existing GPFS cluster by adding new storage nodes and or LUNs or by creating a completely new GPFS cluster. As indicated above automated planning hereunder includes discovery of all available resources e.g. storage subsystems interconnection fabric servers etc. and their configurations. The provisioning planning engine P determines the number and configuration of these entities based on their availabilities and capabilities the workload requirements and industry best practices.

It is understood that the indentations and subsection indicators shown below are for clarity and ease of reading only and are not intended to limit any of the teachings recited herein. At the end of the planning process the provisioning planning engine P produces a list of configuration plans that comprises 

In addition to plans P P output provided by provisioning planning engine P could comprise 1 a proposed storage architecture configuration storage volumes LUN mapping masking multipath configuration zoning configuration etc 2 a proposed GPFS cluster configuration network shared disk NSD NSD servers Interface node GPFS manager nodes etc. and or 3 a proposed GPFS configuration file systems GPFS storage pools etc.

Based on user or system selection the provisioning planning engine P generates a set of deployment scripts to automate the installation of drivers and tools creation of new entities and configuration of existing ones collectively shown as coordinated and automated deployment P. This simplifies the cloud provisioning process reduces cost and the possibility of making errors. In a typical embodiment the scripts are generated by provisioning planning engine while the plans are being generated or shortly thereafter. Specifically as courses of actions e.g. configuration changes for the plans are determined correlating commands will be generated for carrying out the changes. Along these lines commands scripts can be generated for any element denoted in a plan. In providing this functionality appropriate commands for carrying out plan elements can be determined based upon a lookup table e.g. that associates actions changes with commands and or API calls a rules engine etc.

The process of generating and executing scripts can also be referred to as deployment management that generally comprises invoking appropriate Application Programming Interfaces APIs and utilizing command line tools to deploy the plans. For the teachings herein this would mean invoking web service APIs in Storage Resource Management SRM tools such as Tivoli Storage Productivity Center TPC which provides different APIs. Among other things Tivoli can be used to create new LUNs configure LUN mapping masking fiber channel zoning etc. Tivoli and related terms are trademarks of IBM Corp. in the United States and or other countries. For cluster creation and other GPFS configuration management tasks GPFS command line tools can be utilized. Shown below are some examples 

 mmcrnsd F diskDesriptorFile where diskDesriptorFile contains information about the two LUNS created by TPC

Referring now to a method flow diagram according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown. As depicted in step S a set of workload requirements and a set of system resource configurations for a storage cloud are accessed. This typically involves discovering available resources associated with the storage cloud. Specifically the resource discovery can include determining a number and a configuration of each of the available resources. In step S a set of plans for provisioning the storage cloud is generated. In general each of the set of plans provide an adjustment of the set of system resource configurations so that the set of workload requirements are met. For example the set of plans can describe a configuration of a General Parallel File System GPFS cluster associated with the storage cloud provide a mapping of LUNs to network shared disk NSD nodes identify a number and a type of GPFS nodes associated with the storage cloud and or identify a number a size and a type of logical unit numbers LUNs associated with the storage cloud. Output provided based on generation of the plans can comprise for example a storage area network SAN configuration a GPFS cluster configuration and or a GPFS configuration. Regardless in step S a set of scripts is generated to carry out the set of plans. Along these lines the set of scripts is configured to orchestrate a deployment and a configuration of a set of hardware and software components associated with the storage cloud. In step S the plans are executed using the scripts.
