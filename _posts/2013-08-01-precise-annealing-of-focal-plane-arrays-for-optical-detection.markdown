title: Precise annealing of focal plane arrays for optical detection
abstract: Precise annealing of identified defective regions of a Focal Plane Array (“FPA”) (e.g., exclusive of non-defective regions of the FPA) facilitates removal of defects from an FPA that has been hybridized and/or packaged with readout electronics. Radiation is optionally applied under operating conditions, such as under cryogenic temperatures, such that performance of an FPA can be evaluated before, during, and after annealing without requiring thermal cycling.

This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 780 387 filed Mar. 13 2013 and entitled PRECISE LASER ANNEALING OF FOCAL PLANE ARRAYS FOR OPTICAL DETECTION the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was developed under Contract DE AC04 94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.

The present disclosure relates generally to optical detectors. More specifically the present disclosure relates to defects in Focal Plane Arrays FPAs found in an optical system.

FPAs are detectors that have a linear or two dimensional matrix of individual elements e.g. pixels and are generally used at the focus of optical systems for capturing images or video but can also be used for other non imaging purposes such as for example spectrometry LIDAR wave front sensing thermal imaging medical imaging as a receiver of a radio telescope etc. Materials used to form sensory portions of an FPA are selected based upon wavelengths of light that are desirably absorbed and or detected. The materials have respective band gaps wherein a band gap of a material corresponds to wavelengths of light that can be absorbed and or detected by the material. For example a camera that desirably detects light in the visible spectrum 380 nm to 760 nm may utilize an FPA comprising Silicon Si or Si based materials that have band gaps that correspond to the visible spectrum.

Defects or impurities in sensory materials can cause the FPA to comprise defective pixels which can in turn negatively impact overall operability and performance of the FPA. Conventionally however defects in a sensory layer of the FPA are indiscernible until a read out circuit is hybridized with the sensory layer e.g. the defects are not detectable until manufacturing of the FPA is completed . Thereafter if the FPA does not operate as expected e.g. the FPA has too many defective pixels the FPA is discarded. For FPAs comprising relatively inexpensive material cost of manufacturing FPAs is relatively low. For FPAs comprising relatively expensive material however costs of the FPA may be relatively high. Thus for some types of FPAs discarding a defective FPA and manufacturing a new FPA is impractical.

The following is a brief summary of subject matter that is described in greater detail herein. This summary is not intended to be limiting as to the scope of the claims.

In a general embodiment the aspects described herein pertain to a method for manufacturing FPAs using focused e.g. laser annealing. In another exemplary embodiment aspects described herein pertain to a method for repair localization of FPAs using focused annealing that can constitute a supplement to existing FPA manufacturing processes. The focused annealing methods in embodiments described herein target only defective regions of a sensory layer of the FPA e.g. defective pixels allowing much higher temperatures to be applied to the defective regions when compared to conventional approaches thereby further allowing for increased yield reduced dark current and reduced noise in FPAs when compared to conventional FPA manufacturing repair approaches.

With more specificity current annealing techniques used in manufacturing are centered on dopant activation and are not localized but are performed over the entire FPA sensor layer. Employment of focused laser annealing offers the ability to reduce noise in defective pixels after they have been manufactured and after hybridization of the FPA sensory layer with read out electronics. Thus the focused laser annealing methods in embodiments described herein facilitate repair of FPAs that do not meet a specified operation standard e.g. 99 operational rather than discarding of such FPAs. For instance large FPA development costs typically run in the 2M 30M range.

In another exemplary embodiment aspects described herein pertain to methods of reducing dark current in FPA pixels. Implementation of techniques to reduce dark current on detectors offers potential deep impact to the quality of data gathered and processed by the detectors. In an embodiment such techniques can precisely target pixels or clusters of pixels that are hot or noisy while leaving functional pixels untouched. Lowering FPA noise can be accomplished via laser annealing where problematic pixels are targeted and a localized amount of heat is generated locally at the problematic pixels allowing such pixels to reform under the conditions of a thermal anneal without affecting surrounding detector areas or a readout integrated circuit ROIC coupled to the detector material.

In yet another exemplary embodiment aspects described herein pertain to a method of manufacturing an FPA and or enhancing the manufacturing thereof. In accordance with such method a laser can be provided to anneal e.g. by irradiation one or more targeted defective pixels on an FPA.

In still yet another exemplary embodiment aspects described herein pertain to a method of annealing pixels on an FPA where a laser e.g. laser beam is applied to anneal e.g. by irradiation one or more targeted defective pixels on an FPA.

In another exemplary embodiment aspects described herein pertain to a system for manufacturing an FPA where the system comprises a device for positioning an FPA and a laser emitter configured to apply a laser beam to anneal one or more defective pixels of the FPA.

In yet another exemplary embodiment aspects described herein pertain to a system for annealing pixels on an FPA where the system comprises a device for positioning an FPA and a laser emitter configured to apply a laser beam to anneal one or more defective pixels of the FPA.

The terms includes or including is used interchangeably with the terms comprises or comprising. Additionally as used herein the term exemplary is intended to mean serving as an illustration or example of something and is not intended to indicate a preference.

In alternative embodiments aspects described herein pertain to precise annealing of an identified defective region of an FPA. Precise annealing can improve performance of pixels in the defective region without annealing and or potentially damaging pixels in non defective regions of the FPA. Further precise annealing can be applied to FPAs that have been hybridized with readout electronics e.g. a ROIC .

With reference now to a cross sectional view of an exemplary FPA is illustrated. The FPA comprises a sensory layer . The sensory layer comprises sensory material s wherein the sensory materials are configured to absorb radiation e.g. light and convert such radiation into an electric signal. In an exemplary embodiment the sensory layer can be an infrared IR sensory layer that is configured to detect light in the IR spectrum. Accordingly the sensory layer can be composed of materials such as but not limited to HgCdTe InSb CdTe GaInAs combinations thereof etc. In another exemplary embodiment the sensory layer can be configured to detect light in the visible spectrum such that the sensory layer can be composed of materials such as but not limited to Si. It is further to be understood that the sensory layer can be configured to detect radiation having wavelengths differing from wavelengths of visible and IR light. The FPA further comprises a ROIC layer that is hybridized with the sensory layer . The ROIC layer receives electric signals from the sensory layer and converts the signals into signals that are readably processed by a computer processor an application specific integrated circuit ASIC a field programmable gate array FPGA etc.

In an exemplary embodiment the ROIC layer comprises an integrated circuit chip such as for example a multiplexer. In another exemplary embodiment the ROIC layer is fabricated with Si based materials using Si processing techniques although other materials and processes are also contemplated. In yet another exemplary embodiment prior to being hybridized the ROIC layer is tested in order to generate a ROIC baseline map that can be used to calibrate the ROIC layer .

The FPA further comprises a contact layer wherein the sensory layer is hybridized with the ROIC layer by way of the contact layer . The contact layer comprises conductive contacts which can comprise bump bonds conductive films or tapes solder etc. Contact points of the contact layer are configured to transmit the electric signals from the sensory layer to the ROIC layer wherein receipt of an electric signal at the ROIC layer from a particular contact bump corresponds to a detection response for a pixel corresponding to the contact bump.

The ROIC layer can be interrogated in order to identify defective regions of the sensory layer . For example a hybridized FPA can be examined in a dark e.g. un illuminated condition whereby response of a pixel e.g. dark current responses can be considered to be due to a defect. The exemplary sensor layer is shown as having defects and . Defects that can negatively impact the performance of the FPA can include defects resulting from a crystal dislocation in sensory material defects at a PN junction in the sensory material sensory material impurities defects due to wear and tear defects due to adversarial damage etc.

Accordingly interrogation of the ROIC layer e.g. reading out values from the ROIC layer can be used to identify defective regions and of the FPA that correspond respectively to the defects and . As shown the defects and can occur at varying locations and depths in the sensory layer and can be of varying sizes. For instance a defect in the sensory layer can be relatively small such that a corresponding defective region has a size that is less than size of a single pixel e.g. the defective region . In another example a defect in the sensory layer may be somewhat larger such that a corresponding defective region has a size that is larger than a single pixel e.g. the defective region . Generally detection of defects is difficult impractical until after the sensory layer and ROIC layer have been hybridized. This limits the applicability of repair techniques to those that can be conducted without damaging the ROIC layer .

For example types of thermal annealing generally used in FPA manufacturing processes such as to facilitate dopant activation thermal oxidation metal reflow chemical vapor deposition or other processes use annealing temperatures that would damage the ROIC layer and or other electronics packaged with the FPA . Such processes generally involve heating a wafer of material to an annealing temperature by using a general heating device such as heat lamp hot plate furnace or laser swept over an entirety of a wafer from which the sensory layer is formed.

A further consideration is that many IR FPAs are configured to operate in cryogenic temperatures. Accordingly in order to read out electric response values from the ROIC layer and thus detect the presence of defective pixels after hybridization an IR FPA is cooled to cryogenic temperatures. Such cooling requirements for operation can impose further limitations on applicable repair techniques. For example even if a general heating device can raise sensory material in the sensory layer of the FPA to annealing temperatures without damaging the hybridized and or packaged electronics such heating means that the FPA cannot be analyzed for defects in the sensory layer until it is re cooled to its cryogenic operating temperatures. This process of thermal cycling can take hours or days and several of such cycles may be necessary before an FPA has achieved operational performance.

Conventional repair techniques are generally inapplicable or costly and time consuming to perform and are further limited by temperature tolerances of other portions of the FPA . In accordance with aspects described herein precise focused annealing of identified defective regions without annealing surrounding non defective regions can be used to repair defects of a hybridized FPA without damaging the ROIC layer can be performed without removing the FPA from thermal vacuum and can be used to increase yield decrease cost of manufacturing FPAs and can be used to decrease time needed to manufacture FPAs.

To that end an emitter can be configured to perform precise annealing with respect to defective regions in the sensory layer of the FPA where a defective region corresponds to at least one defective pixel and the defective region is less than an entirety of the FPA . In an exemplary embodiment the emitter is configured to direct focused radiation to a defect e.g. the defect in the sensory layer causing temperature to be locally increased e.g. to annealing temperature of the sensory material at the location of the defect while temperature of the remainder of the sensory layer remains below the annealing temperature of the sensory material. Pursuant to an example the emitter can be a laser that is configured to direct a laser beam at the defect such that an exothermic reaction occurs at the defect thereby raising the temperature to reach exceed the annealing temperature of the sensory material . In another example the emitter can be a focused ultrasound emitter that is configured to direct acoustical energy towards at least one defect in the sensory layer thereby locally increasing temperature of sensory material in the sensory layer at and proximate to the at least one defect. Other types of emitters are also contemplated. As will be described in greater detail herein characteristics of radiation emitted by the emitter such as fluence magnitude frequency focal spot size etc. can be selected based upon the sensory material of the sensory layer depth of the PN junction in the sensory material size of the defect etc.

With reference now to a system that facilitates precise annealing of the FPA is illustrated. The system comprises the emitter and a mounting device configured to receive the FPA . In an exemplary embodiment the mounting device and the emitter are disposed inside a thermal vacuum chamber which is configured to maintain cryogenic temperatures. In another example the emitter can be positioned external to the thermal vacuum chamber and can be configured to emit radiation through an optical window of the thermal vacuum chamber .

In an exemplary embodiment the mounting device can be a translation stage that is configured to translate the FPA relative to the emitter . In another exemplary embodiment the mounting device can be a static mount and the emitter can be configured to move relative to the FPA . In yet another exemplary embodiment the mounting device can be a translation stage and the emitter can also be configured to be moveable.

The system optionally comprises a computing apparatus that comprises a controller component . For instance the controller component can control the movement of the mounting device and or the emitter . Further the controller component can control operation of the thermal vacuum chamber and or operation of the emitter . As indicated above the controller component can control operation of the emitter such that the emitter focuses radiation towards a defective region in the sensory layer of the FPA and further causes such radiation to have particular characteristics which may be a function of distance between the emitter and the sensory layer of the FPA thickness of the sensory material type of the sensory material depth of the PN junction in the sensory material at the defect ambient temperature humidity etc. For instance the computing apparatus can receive an indication of type of the sensory material thickness of the sensory material etc. from an operator of the system . Selection of a type of emitter and computation of the aforementioned radiation characteristics are described in greater detail below.

The computing apparatus can further optionally include an interrogation component that is employable in connection with identifying location of at least one defect in the sensory layer of the FPA . The interrogation component is in communication with the ROIC layer of the FPA . The interrogation component reads electric response signals from the ROIC layer of the FPA . By reading such electric response signals when the FPA is under a dark condition defective pixels e.g. those with high dark current responses can be identified. Electric response signals can also be read under other lighting conditions in order to evaluate performance characteristics of the FPA .

The computing apparatus also optionally comprises a selector component that can select for example the emitter from amongst a plurality of potential emitters. For example various lasers having different respective operating properties may be available for precisely annealing sensory layers of FPAs wherein a desirably employed laser from the various lasers can be selected by the selector component based upon the operating properties of the laser e.g. range of fluence wavelength of radiation that can be emitted by the laser etc. type of sensory material that is to be subjected to annealing depth of a defect etc. In an exemplary embodiment the selector component can select the emitter from amongst lasers focused ultrasound emitters focused light emitters etc. Further the selector component may select a combination of emitters.

Further the selector component can select characteristics of radiation emitted by the emitter based at least in part upon a thermal model corresponding to the sensory material. The thermal model can be used to simulate radiation absorption of the sensory material and model heat profile generation when the sensory material is irradiated. The selector component can estimate fluence e.g. energy per unit area wavelength etc. needed to melt sensory material s of the sensory layer of the FPA at a desired depth therein. For example the selector component can determine an amount of fluence needed to anneal the sensory material in the sensory layer e.g. wherein the estimate is based upon the thermal model .

The controller component can receive radiation characteristics for annealing the sensory material in the sensory layer from the selector component and can control the emitter such that the emitter locally irradiates identified defective regions of the sensory layer of the FPA using the radiation characteristics. Annealing in such fashion allows for the defective regions to be annealed without negatively impacting non defective regions of the sensory layer or the ROIC layer of the FPA . With more particularity to repair defects in a defective region corresponding to at least one defective pixel the controller component can control the emitter such that radiation emitted thereby is absorbed by the sensory material at a region proximate to a PN junction in such material e.g. as defects typically occur proximate to such PN junction . Thus the emitter can be controlled to emit focused radiation with a fluence and wavelength for example that causes such radiation to be absorbed at a depth of the sensory layer corresponding to the PN junction therein and further causes temperature at the defective region to reach an annealing temperature of the sensory material without damaging the sensory layer and or annealing properly operating regions of the sensory layer . Responsive to being irradiated the defective region melts e.g. becomes included in a melted region and upon cooling the melted region begins epitaxial regrowth as described in more detail below. Thus not only can defective regions in the FPA be annealed without damaging electronics packaged with the FPA the ROIC layer electronic connections casing etc. but also the defective regions can be annealed without removing the FPA from cryogenic temperatures or disengaging the FPA from communication with the computing device .

Because cryogenic temperatures can be maintained during annealing effectiveness of the annealing can be ascertained relatively quickly e.g. in real time . For instance the interrogation component can be configured to interrogate the ROIC layer of the FPA during and or after the emitter locally irradiates a defective region e.g. in order to gage a performance change in the defective region . Such feedback can be used in successive cycles of annealing and can reduce processing time and costs and raise manufacturing yields.

The controller component can also control the emitter to cause radiation emitted thereby to have a particular focal spot size pulse energy spatial temporal profile etc. Focal spot size pulse energy spatial temporal profile etc. can relate to sensory material in the sensory layer wavelength of radiation emitted by the emitter etc. Moreover the controller component can utilize an optical parametric oscillator to control depth where radiation emitted by the emitter is absorbed in the sensory material.

For example as the defective region of the FPA is irradiated and the sensory material at the defective region is melted absorption and heat profile generation properties of the defective region may change. Thus properties of radiation applied to such defective region may likewise change. Additionally depth of the PN junction of the sensory material may vary in the FPA e.g. depending on the selection and or arrangement of sensory materials . The emitter desirably emits radiation at a higher energy for defects that are further from a surface of the sensory layer of the FPA . For example for FPAs having a relatively thick sensory layer selecting a laser beam at or slightly below a band edge of the sensory material promotes even absorption throughout a thickness of an irradiated region.

The methodology begins at and at an FPA is received in a mounting device disposed in a thermal vacuum chamber. The FPA is a hybridized FPA comprising a sensory layer bonded with a ROIC layer. The mounting device can be for example a static mount a translational stage etc. At the thermal vacuum chamber is caused to enter a dark condition at an operational temperature. Operational temperatures may be for example cryogenic temperatures. In some embodiments such as when operating temperatures are proximate to room temperature the mounting device is not disposed in the thermal vacuum chamber.

At electric response values of pixels in the FPA are read out from the ROIC layer. For instance the values can be read out by a computing apparatus in communication with the ROIC layer. At at least one defective pixel is identified based on an electric response value corresponding to at least one defective pixel and read out from the ROIC layer and at a defective region of the FPA is identified based upon the at least one defective pixel.

At an emitter is selected to irradiate the defective region. The emitter may be selected automatically and or by a user based on a thermal model of emissions from various emitters on various sensory materials. At characteristics of radiation to be emitted by the emitter are selected. The characteristics may be selected automatically and or by a user based on a size of the defective region depth of a defect in the sensory layer of the FPA depth of a PN junction in the sensory layer of the FPA or other properties of the FPA. As indicated above exemplary characteristics include wavelength of radiation pulse energy of radiation focus spot size and spatial temporal profile for the radiation. At the emitter is caused to locally irradiate the defective region without irradiating an entirety of the FPA.

At electric response values are read out from the ROIC layer and performance of the FPA is evaluated. For example the FPA may be desired to comprise a proportion of non defective pixels above an operational standard e.g. 99 of the pixels in the FPA are functional . Optionally at based on the performance of the FPA the emitter is caused to irradiate a portion of the FPA. In an example the defective region may require additional annealing. In another example annealing the defective region may have impacted another portion of the FPA. In another example the FPA may comprise additional defects that are desirably repaired in order for the FPA to perform at operational standards. The methodology ends at .

Referring now to the melting of the sensory material in the melt zones and softens the sensory material around the defects and and promotes dislocation movement and lattice relaxation exemplified by shifting and shrinking of the defects and in the FPA . As illustrated in responsive to the sensory material being irradiated by the emitter as described herein the defects and are substantially or completely removed.

Referring now to subsequent to the emitter irradiating the sensory material epitaxial regrowth begins to occur in the melt zones and . The regrowth is epitaxial as un melted material surrounding the melt zones and serves as a seed layer on which the regrowth is based. As illustrated in this epitaxial regrowth results in a substantially homogenous crystalline structure that is substantially free of dislocations and defects.

The precise annealing systems and methods described above can be used to elevate yields of FPA manufacture. Further precise annealing can be applied retroactively to FPAs already packaged but which fail to meet operability requirements due to excessive defects. Precise annealing can also be applied to FPAs damaged during use such as by wear and tear or by adversarial damage such as a laser directed to an FPA used in a satellite. Example 1 below illustrates repairing surface damage to an FPA.

Referring now to a high level illustration of an exemplary computing apparatus that can be used in accordance with the systems and methodologies disclosed herein is illustrated. For instance the computing apparatus may be used in a system that facilitates precise annealing of an FPA. By way of another example the computing apparatus can be used in a system that identifies and or repairs defective regions of a hybridized FPA. The computing apparatus includes at least one processor that executes instructions that are stored in a memory . The instructions may be for instance instructions for implementing functionality described as being carried out by one or more components discussed above or instructions for implementing one or more of the methods described above. The processor may access the memory by way of a system bus . In addition to storing executable instructions the memory may also store a graphical user interface models results data etc.

The computing apparatus additionally includes a data store that is accessible by the processor by way of the system bus . The data store may include executable instructions thermal models materials properties data electric potential values data etc. The computing apparatus also includes an input interface that allows external devices to communicate with the computing apparatus . For instance the input interface may be used to receive instructions from an external computer device from a user etc. The computing apparatus also includes an output interface that interfaces the computing apparatus with one or more external devices. For example the computing apparatus may display text images etc. by way of the output interface .

It is contemplated that the external devices that communicate with the computing apparatus via the input interface and the output interface can be included in an environment that provides substantially any type of user interface with which a user can interact. Examples of user interface types include graphical user interfaces natural user interfaces and so forth. For instance a graphical user interface may accept input from a user employing input device s such as a keyboard mouse remote control or the like and provide output on an output device such as a display. Further a natural user interface may enable a user to interact with the computing apparatus in a manner free from constraints imposed by input device such as keyboards mice remote controls and the like. Rather a natural user interface can rely on speech recognition touch and stylus recognition gesture recognition both on screen and adjacent to the screen air gestures head and eye tracking voice and speech vision touch gestures machine intelligence and so forth.

Additionally while illustrated as a single system it is to be understood that the computing apparatus may be a distributed system. Thus for instance several devices may be in communication by way of a network connection and may collectively perform tasks described as being performed by the computing apparatus .

Various functions described herein can be implemented in hardware software or any combination thereof. If implemented in software the functions can be stored on or transmitted over as one or more instructions or code on a computer readable medium. Computer readable media includes computer readable storage media. A computer readable storage media can be any available storage media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example and not limitation such computer readable storage media can comprise RAM ROM EEPROM CD ROM or other optical disk storage magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices or any other medium that can be used to carry or store desired program code in the form of instructions or data structures and that can be accessed by a computer. Disk and disc as used herein include compact disc CD laser disc optical disc digital versatile disc DVD floppy disk and Blu ray disc BD where disks usually reproduce data magnetically and discs usually reproduce data optically with lasers. Further a propagated signal is not included within the scope of computer readable storage media. Computer readable media also includes communication media including any medium that facilitates transfer of a computer program from one place to another. A connection for instance can be a communication medium. For example if the software is transmitted from a website server or other remote source using a coaxial cable fiber optic cable twisted pair digital subscriber line DSL or wireless technologies such as infrared radio and microwave then the coaxial cable fiber optic cable twisted pair DSL or wireless technologies such as infrared radio and microwave are included in the definition of communication medium. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer readable media.

Alternatively or in addition the functionally described herein can be performed at least in part by one or more hardware logic components. For example and without limitation illustrative types of hardware logic components that can be used include Field programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs Program specific Integrated Circuits ASICs Program specific Standard Products ASSPs System on a chip systems SOCs Complex Programmable Logic Devices CPLDs etc.

By way of example and not limitation the following examples are illustrative of various embodiments of aspects described herein.

Morphological and electrical damage to the photodiode resulted from the laser exposure. is a graph illustrating dark current electrical responses of the damaged region of the photodiode before damaging the baseline after damaging the defective line and after annealing the Laser Annealed line . is a graph illustrating dark current electrical responses at a 10 volt reverse bias of the damaged region after being subjected to laser pulses of a varying fluence to clarify there is no bias applied to the device during laser exposure . As illustrated by the damage increased dark current electrical response from the 0 nA baseline to over 20 nA.

As illustrated in a 1064 nm laser pulse with a fluence between 3.25 4.25 J cmdefine an annealing fluence range at which defects in the FPA are repaired. A laser pulse in the annealing range was applied to the damaged region of the photodiode. As illustrated by the Laser Annealed line in the dark current electrical response of the damaged region of the photodiode decreased by almost five times and at no bias voltage did performance of the photodiode degrade or worsen.

It can be understood that the annealing fluence range may be device specific and can differ for different sensory materials and defects. Further other pulse parameters may be optimized based on the sensory material or other factors. While this experiment used an Si photodiode the process is similarly applicable to other materials such as HgCdTe given the aforementioned variations to fluence range and pulse parameters.

As illustrated in laser fluences above 4.25 J cmcaused further damage to the photodiode. Too much heat generated in the defective region resulted in not only melting but also boiling which resulted in material ejecta and possibly splatter onto neighboring regions of the photodiode. By varying amount of fluence applied to different materials annealing fluence ranges and damage thresholds can be determined.
