The present invention is directed to an internet system that allows individuals to conduct and play games of chance.

In the United States of America the conduct operation management and regulation of games of chance are governed by diverse jurisdictional laws statutes rules and regulations. Federal State County and Municipal laws statutes rules and regulations govern games of chance for specific regions and levels of legal jurisdiction creating a vast diversity in the legality of games of chance across jurisdictional boundaries.

Prior to this system this has been a major obstacle that has made operating and managing games of chance on a network particularly the Internet illegal under a multitude of governing jurisdictions within the United States of America due to the lack of ability to control access to and participation in games of chance on the Internet. The Internet has historically given users the ability to access and participate in games of chance easily without restriction control or limits placed on accessibility set by applicable governing laws statutes rules and regulations that apply to games of chance.

There are many games of chance operating on the Internet today most of which operate illegally within not only in the United States of America but in other countries and across their boundaries as well. These games of chance are accessible by participants without any regional jurisdictional or residential controls filters or limitations on participation or access nor is there any electronic regulatory system method or apparatus in place to monitor games of chance activity on the Internet which spans a multitude of jurisdictions and geographical locations. Games of chance prior to this invention have operated without consideration of the legality and legitimacy of governmental boundaries and the applicable laws statues rules and regulations that apply to the conduct operation and management of games of chance within these boundaries on the Internet which provides virtually unrestricted global reach.

A raffle is a game of chance which is defined as a lottery in which a number of persons buy chances to win a prize. Although there are many entities offering the sale of raffle tickets using the Internet none limit their sales by geography or the jurisdictional boundaries of governing laws statutes rules and regulations. These raffles currently operate illegally when consumers purchase raffle tickets on the Internet in an area where the entity conducting the raffle is not allowed to sell or consumers are not allowed to purchase raffle tickets under governing jurisdictional laws statutes rules and regulations. The methods and processes used by these other systems are common to the ordinary sale of goods on the Internet and lack the proper filters and controls to help ensure lawful participation in a raffle. These systems may rely on agreements to enforce legal requirements but do nothing to actually stop participation or limit the reach and accessibility of raffles with regard to user or participant location or residency on the Internet.

Because raffles are specific to charitable and non profit organizations by the laws statutes rules and regulations within the United States of America only charitable and non profit entities may conduct operate and manage raffles and participants may only purchase raffles tickets for raffles conducted by a charitable or non profit entity that has been authorized to conduct a raffle within the boundaries of the United States of America. The only form of a raffle which is able to be conducted by a for profit entity in the United States of America is a no purchase necessary sweepstakes type game of chance where entrants may participate without having to purchase a chance to win a prize.

Prior to this system there has been no regional location or residency filter or access control system to restrict a person from outside the authorized access area from accessing and participating in games of chance as may be required by governing jurisdictions nor has there been a system that enables the regulation of such activity on the Internet. The invention enables games of chance operation or participation to be conducted within specified regions jurisdictions locations or boundaries. This invention also enables games of chance and participants to abide by and follow diverse jurisdictional laws for the operation of games of chance determined by location and age. This is done by establishing permission exclusion or restriction criteria and conditions and then determining if user s meet these conditions to determine eligibility. For example if state law only allows the operation of a game of chance in five counties then only users within those five counties will be able to access or participate in the game of chance. If there is a municipality in one of these five counties that does not allow the operation of the game of chance this municipality can be excluded or restricted so participants within this municipality will not be able to access or participate in the game of chance. The permission exclusion or restriction capabilities of this invention can be specified by permitting excluding or restricting locations to target limit or extend user access or participation. For example if there are twenty five counties in a state and you are allowing access or participation to fifteen counties you are able to either permit the state and exclude or restrict ten of the twenty five counties within the state or you may alternatively permit fifteen counties within the state. The age of the user is also taken into consideration for the user s location and the governing jurisdiction of the game of chance. Governing jurisdictions may have minimum age requirements for participants of games of chance which determine the eligibility of its residences to participate in games of chance and the minimum age required for a game of chance to allow participation. For example if a user is in the State of New York and New York requires its residences to be at least eighteen years of age to participate in a game of chance then users from the State of New York must meet this condition. If the governing jurisdiction of the game of chance is the State of Nevada and Nevada requires participants for the game of chance to be at least twenty one years of age then users from the State of New York will not be able to participate unless they are at least twenty one years of age. The permission exclusion or restriction methods and processes are able to be applied to any game of chance which requires determining user eligibility derived from location and age. Although this invention has been applied to raffles as a preferred game of chance it should not be construed to limit its application to other games of chance.

In a preferred embodiment the present invention provides a system methods and an apparatus for the conduct operation management sponsorship advertising promotion and regulation of raffles electronically using an electronic network.

This system comprises of an open network a system that is open and available to the public at large and a closed loop network a system for which each user must be a registered member through which users are able to operate manage sponsor advertise participate in promote and regulate games of chance. The system resides on a computer on a network that is accessible by other computers on a network. The system is accessible over the Internet. This system comprises a number of user interfaces comprising a number of components and a relational data structure which produce controls and filters that limit the accessibility participation advertising promotion and regulation of games of chance. System users are grouped as follows 

Each user group accesses the system through various graphical user interfaces to perform tasks which relate to the system for each individual group. Each interface is interconnected to the system by and through a relational or non relational data structure. The system interfaces filter control and limit access to only relevant portions of the data structure. Users download system interfaces on to a computer and access open network interfaces freely or access closed loop network interfaces as registered members or users of the system requiring user login. Only registered members or users are able to access closed loop network interfaces or closed loop network sections of system interfaces and each user group is able to only access the interface or sections of an interface for the user s specific user group or user permissions.

The invention comprises permission exclusion and restriction methods which are the foundation of the system. The permission exclusion and restriction methods compare user location residency and age to the permitted excluded and restricted locations of operation and the minimum age required for each game of chance to determine user eligibility access and participation. The permission exclusion and restriction criteria comprise state county municipality and age variables to determine user eligibility access and participation. Permission exclusion and restriction methods may also be used to target specific markets for advertising and games of chance participation.

User location and residency initialization methods establish store or retrieve information about a user s state county municipality and or age. This stored information is compared to the permit exclusion and restriction information stored for games of chance. The information for each user s state county and municipality is compared to the state county and municipality permission exclusion and restriction information for games of chance to determine user accessibility eligibility and participation authorization for games of chance. User accessibility eligibility and participation for games of chance are determined by the following conditions 

1 The game of chance is permitted in the user s State and the State permission is a State wide permission or the State does not require permission to operate a game of chance or 

2 The game of chance is permitted in the user s County and the County permission is a County wide permission or the County does not require permission to operate a game of chance or 

5 The game of chance is permitted in the user s State and The game of chance is permitted in the user s County or the County permission is a County wide permission or the County does not require permission to operate a game of chance 

6 And with all of the above conditions games of chance will not be displayed or accessible to users where the user s State County or Municipality is excluded restricted or denied permission.

7 In addition to the above criteria and conditions user age validation and verification methods are imposed on user access eligibility or participation. Age validation occurs at various points within the system and its methods and processes. One method utilizes the user s State County and Municipality to identify the required age to participate in games of chance for the user s location and residency. Another method utilizes the State County and Municipality of the governing jurisdiction of the games of chance to identify the required age to access or participate in games of chance. Access to or participation in games of chance is denied if the user does not meet the minimum age requirement to participate in the game of chance as governed by the jurisdiction from which the game of chance is issued permission to operate or if the user does not meet the minimum age requirement to participate in a game of chance as governed by the jurisdiction of the user s location or residency.

The permission exclusion and restriction criteria comprise state county municipality and age variables to determine user eligibility access and participation. Permission exclusion and restriction information and data comprising user location residency and age are also able to be used to target specific markets for various forms of advertising and promote games of chance participation.

User location and residency initialization methods establish store or retrieve information about a user s state county municipality and or age. This stored information in the form of identifiers is compared to the permit exclusion and restriction information stored for games of chance. The information for each user s state county and municipality is compared to the state county and municipality permission exclusion and restriction information for games of chance to determine user accessibility eligibility and participation authorization for games of chance. User accessibility eligibility and participation for games of chance are determined by the following conditions 

1 The game of chance is permitted in the user s State and the State permission is a State wide permission or the State does not require permission to operate a game of chance or 

2 The game of chance is permitted in the user s County and the County permission is a County wide permission or the County does not require permission to operate a game of chance or 

5 The game of chance is permitted in the user s State and The game of chance is permitted in the user s County or the County permission is a County wide permission or the County does not require permission to operate a game of chance 

6 And with all of the above conditions games of chance will not be displayed or accessible to users where the user s State County or Municipality is excluded restricted or denied permission.

7 In addition to the above criteria and conditions user age validation and verification methods are imposed on user access eligibility or participation. Age validation occurs at various points within the system and its methods and processes. One method utilizes the user s State County and Municipality to identify the required age to participate in games of chance for the user s location and residency. Another method utilizes the State County and Municipality of the governing jurisdiction of the games of chance to identify the required age to access or participate in games of chance. Access to or participation in games of chance is denied if the user does not meet the minimum age requirement to participate in the game of chance as governed by the jurisdiction from which the game of chance is issued permission to operate or if the user does not meet the minimum age requirement to participate in a game of chance as governed by the jurisdiction of the user s location or residency. Establishing and Initializing User Location and Residency to Compare to Game of Chance Permission Exclusion or Restriction Criteria and Conditions to Determine Access or Authorization for Eligibility and Participation.

In one embodiment query search listing and display results are filtered by the conditions stated infra. Using the criteria infra only information for games of chance that meet these conditions will be displayed to a particular user collectively the access filter . The access filter establishes or determines user eligibility.

In a second embodiment accessing participation listing display and purchasing sections are controlled by user login registration participation or purchasing methods and processes that utilize the criteria and conditions described in paragraph to authorize information access participation or purchasing for users that meet these conditions for games of chance collectively the access authorization . The access authorization establishes or determines user eligibility.

In one embodiment user location and residency initialization occurs when a user selects or enters the State County and Municipality of their residency from option lists menus link listing or any type of form object that will allow the user to make a selection series of selections or enter information. The identifiers for the user s State County and Municipal selection or information are stored and processed by the system which retrieves information and data from a database for games of chance that meet the permission exclusion and restriction criteria and conditions as described infra for the user s State County and Municipality using the access filter or access authorization as described infra. This process can occur on a single page or transverse multiple pages.

In a second embodiment user location and residency initialization occurs when the user provides a ZIP or Postal Code to the system. The system then retrieves the identifiers for the State County and Municipality matching the user s ZIP or Postal Code from a database. The identifiers for the user s State County and Municipality are stored and processed by the system which retrieves information and data from a database for games of chance that meet the permission exclusion and restriction criteria and conditions as described infra for the user s State County and Municipality using the access filter or access authorization as described infra. This process can occur on a single page or transverse multiple pages.

In a third embodiment user location and residency initialization occurs when the user accesses the system by providing a username and password. The system then retrieves the identifiers for the State County Municipality and Age of the user from a database. This information is then processed by the system which retrieves information and data from a database for games of chance that meet the permission exclusion and restriction criteria and conditions as described infra for the user s State County and Municipality using the access filter or access authorization as described infra. This embodiment is available only after the user has registered and created a system user membership account as described infra.

In a fourth embodiment users register to become members creating a system user membership account as described infra and provide the State County Municipality and ZIP or Postal Code information for the user s location residency as well as the user s date of birth or age. Before registration can be executed the user s age is compared to the minimum required age for the jurisdiction governing the user s location or residency. If the minimum age requirement is not met user registration is denied. If the minimum age requirement is met user registration is granted. Upon user login to access games of chance listings participation purchasing and payment sections methods or processes of the system as described infra the user s identifiers for location State County Municipality and or Age is retrieved from a database. This information is compared to the permit exclusion and restriction criteria and or minimum age requirement for a game of chance to determine if access to or participation in a game of chance is to be granted or denied using the criteria and conditions as described infra and access filter or access authorization as described infra.

In a fifth embodiment user location residency and age initialization occurs when the user accesses the system by providing an identifier which is used to retrieve user information from an external system or data source which contains the user s location residency and age information. The system then retrieves the identifiers for the user s State County Municipality and Age from a database. This information is then processed by the system which retrieves information and data from a database for games of chance that meet the permission exclusion and restriction criteria and conditions as described in supra paragraph for the user s State County and Municipality using the access filter or access authorization as described infra.

In these embodiments the legal gaming age for the user s unique location or residency identifiers are retrieved from a database. This information is used to verify age requirements for games of chance and membership registration authorization. Users are required to be of legal gaming age for the State County and Municipality in which they reside in order to become a registered member and user of the system. Users are required to be of the required legal gaming age of the jurisdiction governing the authority of an entity to conduct operate and manage a game of chance in order to participate in the game of chance. Users are restricted access to games of chance if the user s age does not meet the minimum legal gaming age requirement of the jurisdiction governing the game of chance. This is used in the access filter or access authorization processes as described infra. As described infra the minimum age requirement for user location or residency is also retrieved from a data source and the user may be required to agree to be of legal gaming age for the State County and Municipality selected or entered by the user representing the user s location or residency before the user is able to proceed. This is optional but preferred as an added legal precaution. A form of electronic signature can be applied to represent user agreement to the validity of information provided. Users are given the ability to reselect or re enter this information. In reference to infra additional access authorization as described infra will be required to validate user information and authorize participation maintaining an access control loop as described infra. This additional access authorization step can be placed within or between and step or section comprising games of chance domains listings or participation.

Those skilled in the art will also realize that user location or residency can be extended to include permission exclusion and restriction criteria and conditions that include Country information data and identifiers to give the system global reach. Although an object of the system is to provide methods and processes to operate manage sponsor advertise participate in and regulate games of chance and to provide location and age controls that limit or extend access to users within a single county it should not be construed to limit the system s ability to be configured to include country information. Adding country information requires adding an additional tier of location information to the criteria and conditions as described infra. This may also require adding additional territorial provincial regional or other jurisdictional divides for various countries to maintain accurate access filtration or access authorization as described infra. This can then be applied to the methods and processes as described infra. The conditions and criteria as described infra can be configured to include additional countries by inserting country level criteria into these conditions to determine if participation or access is permitted excluded or restricted for a country if permission is country wide or if no permission is required to operate the game of chance by a country. This then tiers down to evaluate sub levels of jurisdiction within a specified country as described infra. The current application of this invention is to cover jurisdictions or locations within the United States of America but may be extended to cover additional jurisdictions locations regions countries or territories.

In a preferred embodiment an access control loop is created. User registration and membership is required to participate in a game of chance or purchase a chance to win a prize for any raffle. User account information can be altered only in the Participant Account Interface. Alterations made to a user s State County Municipality or ZIP or Postal Code will establish new identifiers to be stored for these variables. The authentication authorization participation and purchasing sections of each interface dynamically populate identifiers and user account information into forms and form objects as read only or hidden variables and can not be altered outside of the Participant Account Interface. This requires users to exit and re enter system interfaces to make alterations to user information and data. This loop around between the Participant Account Interface and games of chance listings access participation and purchasing sections of interfaces maintain the integrity of the access filter and access authorization as described infra. Upon exiting the Participant Account Interface the new user information and identifiers are used in the access filter and access authorization as described infra to determine user eligibility for the games of chance. Dependent on alterations made to user data and information previously accessible games of chance may no longer be accessible by the user. This eliminates the user s ability to alter account information to gain access to and participate in games of chance for which the user is excluded or restricted. Since the user s financial transaction address and residency information is dynamically populated into participation and payment forms from a database or data store and can not be changed in the participation or payment forms or form objects altering user information in the Participant Account Interface to access excluded or restricted games of chance will cause the electronic financial transaction to fail during external user verification or authentication. The transaction authorization process conducted by a transaction authorization gateway will be declined if the user s address information is passed to the gateway s address verification system AVS from this inventions database data stores participation forms or purchasing forms if the user s account information does not match the user s financial account holder information in the external financial institution s systems. This will defeat the purpose of a user gaining access to a restricted or excluded game of chance. User data and information must be accurate and match both the game of chance access conditions and criteria as described infra as well as the user s data and information required for successful transaction processing and billing. Altering user data and information by providing incorrect data and information causes the system to deny participation or purchasing. This access control loop prevents unauthorized participation in games of chance. The user needs to provide correct user data and information throughout the entire system methods and processes to access games of chance and complete participation and transactions for which the user is permitted by the system.

In another embodiment an access control loop is created using user information provided at the time of purchase or participation. The user s State County Municipality and Age information is entered into a purchase form and submitted to be processed. Upon submission the system evaluates the user s information to determine if participation in the game of chance is permitted excluded or restricted using an access authorization as described infra. If permitted the system allows the user s information to be passed to the transaction authorization gateway which verifies the user s address information. If the gateway s address verification process is successful the transaction is allowed to proceed. If either the access authorization or address verification processes fail the user is denied participation in the game of chance.

In a preferred embodiment the registration process establishes variables or identifiers within the system for a user s State County Municipality and Age for participation and purchasing sections of the system that can only be edited or altered from the Participant Account Interface. These variables are dynamically populated into all games of chance participation or purchase forms and can not be altered or changed within these forms. This user information is used in the access filter or access authorization processes as described infra. In reference to infra users may provide State County and Municipal information that does not match the State County and Municipality information of the user s membership account. Upon attempting to access the participation section or making a participation attempt the access authorization as described infra and the access control loop as described infra will catch the data discrepancy and deny access or participation.

User login for games of chance information access participation and purchasing sections of the system retrieves user account information from a database which is used for access authorization as described infra.

The methods and apparatus of this invention utilize the above embodiments throughout the system to filter results or authorize access and or participation. Users are given any one or more options to establish or initialize user residency and location dependant on the point of access or the section of the system. Since establishing user residency location and age is an essential object of the system the availability of this user information supports system components features and functionality that utilize this information to perform a multitude of unique functions processes and tasks.

The raffle s permitted excluded and restricted States Counties and Municipalities are the variables used in the conditions as described infra to compare user location and residency information to determine access authorization and participation and are used to determine eligibility access or participation for the access filter or access authorization as described infra. The raffle information is structured dependant upon the raffle prize type as described infra. Raffle information is entered into the system and a data store through the Organization Account Interface where organizations operate and manage their games of chance. Raffle information may also comprise information for the organization operating and managing the raffle as described infra and information for sponsors of the raffle or prizes as described infra.

Summarized game of chance listing results comprise portions of the information as described infra. This allows smaller amounts of information to be displayed for each game of chance which allows a larger number of games of chance to be listing in less space. The summarized game of chance listing is a display of query and search results as described infra.

Detailed game of chance listing results comprise more detailed information about the selected game of chance as described infra. The detailed game of chance listing is a display of the results for a particular game of chance selected by a user as described infra.

Sorting and ordering listing results by Organization is only available for listings resulting from infra.

Listing search or navigation results may also comprise advertisements from member advertisers. These advertisements are displayed dependant on a user s State County and or Municipality. Advertisers post advertisements within the Advertiser Account Interface. During the process of posting advertisements advertisers select or enter the States Counties and or Municipalities to permit or target the viewing of each advertisement. This enables advertisers to target the audience of an advertisement dependant on user location or residency in a similar manner as games of chance are permitted excluded or restricted to users only advertisers need not exclude or restrict areas or locations nor have the option to provide permit or licensing information since this information is not needed for posting advertisements. Excluding or restricting areas or locations is strictly optional to enable greater targeting capabilities. Advertisers are also able to configure a standard set of target areas or locations to be used for all of the advertisers advertising to bypass providing target market area or location information for each individual advertisement. Targeted advertising requires user location or residency initialization methods to establish user location or residency prior to enabling targeted advertisements to be displayed to targeted audiences. This is unique to this invention since establishing and utilizing user location or residency information is an essential part of various methods and processes of the apparatus. Without first establishing the location or residency of users this form of target marketing is not possible.

In one embodiment of targeted advertising as described infra a beneficiary of a donation is displayed for each advertisement. Advertisers are able to select a member user to receive a donation comprising a portion of the amount spent on the advertisement or some other fixed amount.

This option is available within summary and detail games of chance listings.

Users are also able to email games of chance information to others. The system contains an email form that allows users to send games of chance information to single or multiple email addresses. This option is available within games of chance summary and detail listings.

Games of chance participation occurs when users purchase or request a chance to win a game of chance. Chances to win can either be purchased or requested without purchase either online offline or both online and offline. The majority of games of chance require participants to purchase chances to win although purchasing chances to win may not be required in some cases such as with a sweepstakes type of game of chance where there is no purchase necessary to participate or win.

Offline participation occurs when a chance to win a game of chance is not purchased or requested using online payment or participation methods and processes.

Online participation occurs when a chance to win a game of chance is purchased or requested using online payment or participation methods and processes.

Online and offline participation occur when a chance to win a game of chance can be purchased or requested both online and offline as described infra.

In one embodiment user information is dynamically populated into participation purchasing and transaction forms and form objects from a database.

In a second embodiment user information is manually entered into participation purchasing and transaction forms and form objects by the user.

In a third embodiment sales or participating sales locations where a chance to win a game of chance can be purchased or requested are displayed and listed.

Online participation comprises games of chance information as described infra information for the organization operating or managing the game of chance as described infra and purchase or participation forms comprising participant information as described infra or a request for participant information. Purchase or participation forms may also comprise the number of tickets to purchase or request the amount of the total purchase the option to purchase or request the remaining tickets if the desired amount is no longer available as described infra additional participant information and participant s payment information if payment is required to receive a chance to win a game of chance. Participant information is entered or populated into the purchase or participation form as described infra. Online participation information may vary or be required as necessary for participation or transaction processing dependant on access authorization transaction authorization gateway AVS and payment processing requirements.

In one embodiment participants are required to agree to the rules for the game of chance in order to be able to participate by applying their electronic signature. For example this can be done by requiring the participant to check a check box indicating the participant has read and agrees to the rules for the game of chance.

Offline participation comprises offline participation information for the game of chance. Offline participation information comprises games of chance information as described infra information for the organization operating or managing the game of chance as described infra and purchase or participation location information as described infra such as the Location Name Location Address Location State Location County Location Municipality Location ZIP or Postal Code Location Telephone Number Location Facsimile Number Location Email Address and Location Website URL. Users are also able to receive driving directions to any of the sales or participating sales locations by entering the user s address information in a form and submitting the form to receive driving directions to the selected location. If user login as described infra is required before accessing the participation section of the system the user s address information can be dynamically populated into the driving direction request form automatically.

Each organization operating games of chance has their own merchant account and payment authorization gateway. Merchant account and transaction authorization gateway information for the organization operating each specific game of chance for processing sales and accepting donations is dynamically populated into financial transaction processes and sections of the system. This allows multiple organizations to accept payments and donations using their own merchant accounts and transaction authorization gateways through a single channel or venue.

Games of chance that have sold or delivered all available chances to win are listed as sold out and no additional chances to win can be purchased or requested.

When a game of chance surpasses its scheduled end date no additional chances to win can be purchased or requested.

Sales cap protection prevents participants from purchasing or requesting more tickets than available for sale. The available number of tickets for sale is determined by subtracting tickets sold from the maximum number of tickets offered for sale. Sales cap protection prevents users from selecting or entering a number greater than the number of tickets available. Participants are not able to enter or select a number of tickets to purchase or request that is greater than the number of tickets remaining. For example if only ten tickets are remaining the system will not allow a participant to select or enter a value greater than ten.

Sales cap closeout protection prevents participants from purchasing more tickets than available for sale when the sales cap protection as described infra enables a participant to select or enter a value for the number of tickets to purchase that is no longer available since the purchase or participation form was first accessed. Purchasing tickets online requires availability to be confirmed prior to processing transactions to prevent selling more tickets than the maximum number of tickets offered for sale. This can occur when a limited number of tickets are remaining and multiple users attempt to purchase a combined number of tickets greater than what is available. The sales cap protection as described infra only prevents the user from selecting or entering a number of tickets to purchase or request that is greater than the number of remaining tickets at the time the purchasing or participation form is first accessed. From the time the participation section was first accessed to the time the user actually submits the purchasing or participation form for processing the number of remaining tickets may have diminished due to tickets purchased or requested by other users during that time frame. This is especially critical when the number of tickets purchased or requested by other users reduces the available number of tickets to less than the number of tickets a single user is attempting to purchase. Sales cap closeout protection prevents over selling tickets by first confirming availability of the selected or entered number of tickets upon user submission of the purchasing or participation form then placing a hold on the number of tickets requested if available tickets next the purchase transaction is processed and finally the sale of the tickets is completed. If the transaction fails the hold is taken off of the tickets and the tickets are made available for purchase once again. The availability of the tickets and the number of tickets to hold while the transaction is being processed is determined by either user selection input or the number of tickets remaining dependent on the embodiment chosen by the ticket purchaser or participant as described infra and can be applied to the sale of any number of types of tickets or any limited quantity items.

In one embodiment sales cap closeout protection can be set to either evaluate the purchase of a set number of tickets or evaluate the purchase of a number of tickets equal to or less than a set number of tickets. In this embodiment a user is able to either purchase the number of tickets selected or entered or if the number of tickets attempted to be purchased is no longer available purchase all remaining tickets available.

In a second embodiment sales cap closeout protection can be set to either purchase the number of tickets selected or entered or if the number of tickets selected or entered is no longer available do not purchase any tickets.

Participating in games of chance may require users to agree to rules of the game before transactions may occur.

In one embodiment participants are required to agree to the rules of the game before the user is able to submit the participation purchase or payment form for processing. This agreement may comprise the participant applying their electronic signature. For example this can be done by requiring the participant to check a check box indicating the participant has read and agrees to the rules for the game of chance.

In another embodiment participants are not required to agree to the rules of the game before the user is able to submit the participation purchase or payment form for processing.

Raffle ticket information is stored in a database upon completion of the purchasing or participation process. This ticket information is then utilized to generate printable tickets comprising raffle information as described infra organization information as described infra sponsor information as described infra participant information as described infra and a unique ticket number and or a ticket sequence number as described infra. Ticket information also comprises text or notice requirements by governing jurisdictions as described infra.

Ticket purchase receipts comprise raffle information as described infra organization information as described infra participant information as described infra and transaction information comprising the Transaction Result Transaction Identification Number Number of Ticket Purchased or Received Total Amount of the transaction and information returned from a transaction authorization gateway. Participants are able to print this receipt or print the tickets purchased or received for the game of chance selected.

Raffle tickets comprise two parts the participant part and the drawing part. The participant and drawing parts of a raffle ticket comprises ticket information as described infra. The participant part of a raffle ticket comprises additional text or notices as described infra. The participant part of a raffle ticket may also act as a receipt for the purchase of each raffle ticket. The drawing part of the raffle ticket is a form of raffle ticket stub that is used to conduct a raffle drawing to determine the winner of a drawing or prize. Raffle ticket drawings may be conducted physically as in a traditional manual raffle drawing or electronically using an algorithm to randomly select tickets or winners.

The creation of unique raffle ticket numbers is performed by combining the unique identification numbers of the organization operating the raffle the raffle the participant and the participant s ticket. The methods for generating unique ticket numbers are described infra. Any one of these embodiments can be utilized to generate unique ticket numbers. Including the unique identifier for the organization operating the raffle within the ticket number is optional but preferred for more detailed ticket identification purposes.

In a preferred embodiment the unique raffle ticket number appears as 1 2 3 4 with the first number comprising the unique identification number of the organization operating and managing the game of chance the second number comprising the unique identification number of the game of chance the third number comprising the unique identification number of the participant or ticket holder and the fourth number comprising a variable comprising that represents or identifies each unique ticket. For example if the user purchased three tickets for a particular game of chance the ticket numbers would appear as 1 2 3 A 1 2 3 B 1 2 3 C where A B and C are unique identification numbers for each particular ticket purchased for a particular game of chance. The unique identification numbers comprise unique identifiers created by a database such as a SQL Database and database software such as Microsoft SQL Server manufactured by Microsoft Corporation which create unique identifiers for each data set record. Combining these unique identifiers in the format described will always create unique and identifiable ticket numbers. The identifiers described above can be placed in any order or delimited with any delimiter to produce a unique and identifiable ticket number.

In one embodiment the variable that represents each unique ticket identification number as described infra comprises the unique identification number for the data set record of the ticket. For example if the user purchased three tickets for a particular game of chance the ticket numbers would appear as follows 1 2 3 109 1 2 3 418 1 2 3 519. The unique identification numbers for the tickets 109 418 and 519 comprise unique identifiers created by a database such as a SQL Database and database software such as Microsoft SQL Server manufactured by Microsoft Corporation which creates a unique identifier for each data set record.

In a second embodiment the variable that represents each unique ticket identifier as described infra comprises the ticket count number for the number of tickets purchased by the user for a particular game of chance. For example if the user purchased three tickets for a particular raffle the ticket numbers would appear as follows 1 2 3 1 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3. Using the ticket count numbers 1 2 and 3 in place of the unique data set record identification number created by a database still creates a unique ticket number when combined with the other unique identification numbers as described infra. This provides a method to easily view and track the number of tickets held by a participant for any given game of chance.

In a third embodiment the variable that represents each unique ticket identifier as described infra comprises the ticket sequence number for a particular game of chance as described infra. For example if the user purchased three tickets for a particular game of chance the ticket numbers would be appear follows 1 2 3 10 1 2 3 11 1 2 3 12. Using the ticket sequence numbers 10 11 and 12 in place of the unique data set record identification number created by a database still creates a unique ticket number when combined with the other unique identification numbers as described infra. This provides a method to easily view and track the number of tickets held by a participant for any given game of chance.

Raffle ticket sequencing generates a sequence number for each ticket beginning at the number one and counting upwards in increments of one until the last ticket is reached. Governing jurisdictions or regulators of games of chance may require tickets or ticket numbers to be sequenced in this manner.

In one embodiment sequenced ticket numbers or ticket sequence numbering are generated upon raffle activation as described infra.

In a second embodiment sequenced ticket numbers or ticket sequence numbering are generated when drawing tickets are generated as described infra.

Certain text or notices may be required to be displayed on each raffle ticket sold dependant on the governing jurisdiction of the organization operating the raffle the governing jurisdiction of the raffle or the governing jurisdiction of the participant s location and residency. Text or notice information is retrieved from a data source for the governing State County and or Municipality as they exist within the system s data source.

In one embodiment the required text to be displayed on each ticket sold is determined by the location of the organization operating the raffle.

In a second embodiment the required text to be displayed on each ticket sold is determined by the governing jurisdiction of the raffle.

In a third embodiment the required text to be displayed on each ticket sold is determined by the location and residency of the participant or ticket holder.

Participants are able to print their tickets upon the successful completion of the ticket purchase transaction or participation process. Participants are also able to print their raffle tickets from the Participant Account Interface as described infra.

As shown in one embodiment of the process topology for Node Games of Chance Interface at the broadest level comprises first establishing user location residency and age as described infra. Then the access filter is applied as described infra. Next games of chance are categorized and displayed as described infra. Finally participation in games of chance occurs as described infra. User registration for participation may or may not be utilized dependant on which embodiments have been configured to be used by the system.

Billing cycle details comprise information as described infra status of whether the bill has been paid status of whether the bill has been differed to the next billing cycle and the amount of the deferment status of whether an attempt to pay a bill has failed status of whether the bill is late and the late fee amount late payment date if the bill was late and total charges for the billing cycle.

Billing cycle histories can also be accessed from billing cycle summary listings. Billing cycle histories comprise listings of billing cycle details as described infra for billing cycles as described infra.

Billing cycle methods of payment are established by the organization through the Merchant Payment section of the Merchant Account Interface. The Merchant Payment section comprises information for the organizations preferred method of payment for licensing fees. These payment methods comprise credit card debit card electronic check electronic transfer or other electronic methods of payment or non electronic methods of payment. Upon a billing cycle becoming due organizations are able to make payments via the Merchant Payment section. Past due billing cycles are assessed late fees and billing cycles that have accrued less than a set amount of licensing fees may be differed to the next billing cycle without accruing any late penalties.

The Reporting section of the Merchant Account Interface comprises reporting tools for games of chance and donation transaction activity. To access reports organizations select the type of report to view. The organization can select to view reports for games of chance or donations. Once a selection is made the organization selects a reporting period by selecting or entering the start date and end date for the desired reporting period. Organizations are then able to view reports for the selected or entered period.

Merchant Account Interface raffle reports comprise the Number of Tickets Sold Revenue Transaction Fees Processing Fees Rates Surcharges Payment Methods and Total Charges. The fees and rates are able to be listed by the type of transaction and transaction methods accepted by the organization to provide accurate details. For example for credit card transactions transactions are able to be listed by credit card type. The organization is able to view the total discount rate and transaction fees charged by each individual credit card. These reports also display transaction activity for each individual date from the start date to the end date of the selected or entered reporting period. These reports are able to comprise all transaction activity for all games of chance combined within the specified reporting period or list transaction activity for individual games of chance within the specified reporting period. In addition to raffle financial information organizations are also able to access participant listings comprising participant information as described infra for raffle participation within the specified reporting period.

Merchant Account Interface donation reports comprise the Number of Donations Made Revenue Transaction Fees Processing Fees Rates Surcharges and Total Charges. The fees and rates are able to be listed by the type of transaction and transaction methods accepted by the organization to provide accurate details. For example for credit card transactions transactions are able to be listed by credit card type. The organization is able to view the total discount rate and transaction fees charged by each individual credit card. These reports also display transaction activity for each individual date from the start date to the end date of the selected or entered reporting period. These reports are able to comprise all transaction activity for all donors combined within the specified reporting period or list transaction activity for individual donors within the specified reporting period. In addition to donation financial information organizations are also able to access donor listings comprising donor information as described infra for donations made within the specified reporting period.

The Games of Chance Management Interface enables organization to operate and manage games of chance. In a preferred embodiment the games of chance are raffles.

Organizations must add or post raffles by entering information as described infra into a database. Entering raffle information also comprises establishing online offline or both online and offline participation methods as described infra establishing the raffle prize type as described infra and establishing key variables such as permitted excluded or restricted States Counties or Municipalities as described infra. Organizations are able to add or post as many raffles as desired.

For ease of use the process for providing raffle information and storing this information in a database can be structured in a number of ways as long as all necessary information has been provided as required for the Game of Chance Interface to operate and function properly and establish the key variables for the access display and participation criteria and conditions access filter and access authorization as described infra as well as establishing methods and listing structures for participation as described infra.

In one embodiment the process for adding raffles can be structured as a list of tasks where each tasks is linked to sections pages forms form objects and functions that enable the user to provide information and insert this information into a database or file system structure.

In a second embodiment the process for adding raffles can be structured as a step by step process comprising tasks where each task comprises pages sections forms form objects and functions that enable the user to provide information and insert this information into a database or file system structure.

Information is inserted into a database while images and files are uploaded to folders in directories to be accessed by the system through the Organization Account Interface and its various component interfaces. Dependant on the system configuration images can be uploaded and stored in a database.

To add a raffle to the system an organization begins by providing basic raffle information comprising a raffle title or heading and a description of the raffle or provide additional raffle information as described infra. This initial step establishes the identifiers for a raffle within a database. Data entry for raffle information as described infra can comprise a combination or distribution of steps.

Next the organization selects the type of raffle ticket sales or participation method as described infra and is given the option to establish pre activation participation. Pre activation participation allows the organization to manually enter participant information create a participant account and produce raffle tickets for participants who have purchased tickets or requested participant prior to the activation of the raffle as described infra.

Next the organization selects the raffle prize type or raffle type structure as described infra. This determines the number of prizes and drawings the raffle will be able to comprise.

Single prize type raffles as described infra comprise entering prize data and information for a prize comprising a Prize Category and or Prize Sub Category as described infra Raffle Item or Item Heading Prize Images Prize Image Upload component which allows images to be uploaded from the user s computer to a server option to notify participants the image is not the actual image of the prize Prize Description Prize Value Prize Cost Prize Quantity and Prize Options such as Raffle Item Cash Value and Cash Towards Purchase. An example image is also provided displaying how to scale and crop images to avoid distortion when the system resizes the images during the upload process to the required dimensions. If no images are provided and error handler automatically provides a default image stating no image is available. The same is true for all images that require uploading from interface components. Images are resized to meet the display and listing requirements of the system. Once this information has been provided and inserted into a database no additional prizes can be added and the process of adding prize information to the raffle is finished.

Choice prize type raffles as described infra comprise entering prize data and prize information for a prize comprising Prize Category and or Prize Sub Category as described infra Raffle Item or Item Heading Prize Images Prize Image Upload component which allows images to be uploaded from the user s computer to a server option to notify participants that the image is not the actual image of the prize Prize Description Prize Value Prize Cost Prize Quantity and Prize Options such as Raffle Item Cash Value and Cash Towards Purchase. An example image is also provided displaying how to scale and crop images to avoid distortion when the system resizes the images during the upload process to the required dimensions. If no images are provided and error handler automatically provides a default image stating no image is available. The same is true for all images that require uploading from interface components. Images are resized to meet the display and listing requirements of the system. Once this information has been provided and inserted into a database the organization is able to add additional prizes to this raffle. Prizes can continue to be added to this type of raffle but only one winner will be selected and be offered a choice of only one of these prizes. For example the prize may comprise a choice of one of three luxury vehicles. In this example one winner will be selected to receive one prize. Once all of the prizes for this raffle have been inserted into a database the process of adding prize information to the raffle is finished.

Multiple prize type raffles as described infra comprise entering prize data and prize information for a prize comprising Prize Category and or Prize Sub Category as described infra Raffle Item or Item Heading Prize Images Prize Image Upload component which allows images to be uploaded from the user s computer to a server option to notify participants that the image is not the actual image of the prize Prize Description Prize Value Prize Cost Prize Quantity and Prize Options such as Raffle Item Cash Value and Cash Towards Purchase. An example image is also provided displaying how to scale and crop images to avoid distortion when the system resizes the images during the upload process to the required dimensions. If no images are provided and error handler automatically provides a default image stating no image is available. The same is true for all images that require uploading from interface components. Images are resized to meet the display and listing requirements of the system. Once this information has been provided and inserted into a database the organization is able to add additional prizes to this raffle. Prizes can continue to be added to this type of raffle. Each prize added creates a prize level. For example adding three prizes creates a first prize second prize and a third prize. Multiple prize type raffles comprise only one prize listing per prize level. For example first prize may comprise a luxury vehicle second prize may comprise a motorcycle third prize may comprise a vacation package and fourth prize may comprise three televisions. In this example six winners would be selected to receive one prize each. Once all of the prizes for this raffle have been inserted into a database the process of adding prize information to the raffle is finished.

Multiple prize type raffles also comprise Early Bird Drawings and Prizes as described infra. The prize information for early bird prizes for multiple prize type raffles are the same as described infra. Multiple prize type raffle prize information comprises an additional early bird prize option when adding prizes to the raffle. By selecting the early bird prize option the prize is designated as an early bird prize. As the information for each early bird prize is inserted into a database an additional step is added to establish the early bird drawing information for the early bird prize. If the prize has a cost of zero the early bird drawing can occur at a set ticket number of ticket sales a drawing date or both a set number of ticket sales or a drawing date which ever occurs first. If the prize cost is greater than zero the early bird drawing can only occur at a set number of ticket sales. Dependant on prize cost the appropriate early bird drawing information can be inserted into a database. Because the focus of raffle participation is the main drawing and early bird drawings are considered types of bonus drawings for early participation this evaluation of prize cost is essential to prevent profit losses. For example if there are two early bird drawings one at two thousand ticket sales and the other on a set date and one thousand five hundred are sold by the end of the date for the early bird with the set drawing date and the remaining five hundred ticket are sold the next day this could not only cause severe losses to occur but also leave no margin of revenue for the main drawing. This is especially critical if no more tickets are sold by the time the drawing date for the main drawing has been reached. The methods and calculations used to determine profitability is described further infra. Multiple prize type raffle early bird drawings comprise only one prize listing per prize level. For example first prize may comprise a luxury vehicle second prize may comprise a motorcycle third prize may comprise a vacation package and fourth prize may comprise three televisions. In this example six winners would be selected to receive one prize each.

Mega prize type raffles as described infra comprise entering prize data and prize information for a prize comprising Prize Category and or Prize Sub Category as described infra Raffle Item or Item Heading Prize Images Prize Image Upload component which allows images to be uploaded from the user s computer to a server option to notify participants that the image is not the actual image of the prize Prize Description Prize Value Prize Cost Prize Quantity and Prize Options such as Raffle Item Cash Value and Cash Towards Purchase. An example image is also provided displaying how to scale and crop images to avoid distortion when the system resizes the images during the upload process to the required dimensions. If no images are provided and error handler automatically provides a default image stating no image is available. The same is true for all images that require uploading from interface components. Images are resized to meet the display and listing requirements of the system. Once this information has been provided and inserted into a database the organization is able to add additional prizes to this raffle. Prizes can continue to be added to this type of raffle. Each prize added creates a prize level. For example adding three prizes creates a first prize second prize and a third prize. In addition to adding individual prize levels as in a multiple prize type raffle mega prize type raffles enable the addition of choice prize type raffle groups within each prize level. For example first prize may comprise a choice of one of three luxury vehicles second prize may comprise a choice of one of two motorcycles third prize may comprise a vacation package and fourth prize may comprise three televisions. The prizes are grouped by level and any prize group comprising more than one prize is treated as a choice prize group. Each level can comprise either a single prize or a choice of prizes. For example first prize may comprise a choice of one of three luxury vehicles second prize may comprise a choice of one of two motorcycles third prize may comprise a vacation package and fourth prize may comprise three televisions. In this example six winners would be selected to receive one prize each. Once all of the prizes for this raffle have been inserted into a database the process of adding prize information to the raffle is finished.

Mega prize type raffles also comprise Early Bird Drawings as described infra. Mega prize type raffle early bird drawings comprise prize groups for each prize level. Each prize group may comprise of one or more prizes. For example first prize may comprise a choice of one of three luxury vehicles second prize may comprise a choice of one of two motorcycles third prize may comprise a vacation package and fourth prize may comprise three televisions. In this example six winners would be selected to receive one prize each. Once all of the prizes for this raffle have been inserted into a database the process of adding prize information to the raffle is finished.

Single prize type raffle prize management options comprise view prize information edit prize information delete or remove prize information and add a sponsor for the prize.

Editing early bird prizes and drawings require evaluating drawing ticket sales amounts drawing dates and prize cost. Since early bird drawings that occur on a specific date must comprise prizes with a cost of zero the system must evaluate changes to cost information when organizations edit early bird prizes. An early bird prize with a cost of zero can be placed in early bird drawings comprising ticket sales amounts drawing dates or both ticket sales amount drawings and drawing dates. Prizes comprising a cost greater than zero can only be placed in early bird drawings comprising ticket sales amount drawings. When editing early bird drawing information the system evaluates the type of drawing whether the drawing is to be held at a set ticket sales amount a date or both dependant on which occurs first. Then the prize costs are evaluated to determine how the early bird drawing can be edited.

Prize order is initially established as prizes are added. For example the first prize added is the first prize the second prize added is second prize and so on. The same is true for choice prizes where the first prize added is prize choice one the second prizes added is prize choice two and so on.

Choice prize type raffles comprise only one prize group comprising choices of prizes. The order of the prizes within prize listings for choice prize groups is initially established as prizes are added. These prizes appear as Prize Choice One Prize Choice Two and so on. Once prizes are added the order in which the prize choices appear can be edited. By selecting the edit prize order option a prize listing will appear. There is an option list next to each prize listed comprising numbers. These numbers range from the number one through a number representing the count of the total number of prizes. Each option list for each individual prize comprises the order number for that particular prize as a default order value. For example prize choice one will display the number one as the default order value prize choice two will display the number two as the default order value and so on. To change the order in which these prizes will appear in raffle listings a new order number can be selected from the option list for a particular prize. The system then automatically reorders all of the prizes and displays the a prize order listing. The system takes the new order number selected for a prize places the prize in the new position in the prize order list and then renumbers the prizes comprising order numbers between the new order number for the prize and the original order number for the prize in sequence plus or minus one dependant on the direction of the change. For example if there are five prizes and we change prize four to prize two the original prize two becomes three and the original prize three becomes prize four. If we change prize two to prize four the original prize four becomes prize three and the original prize three becomes prize two. This eliminates the need for an organization to manually renumber prize orders individually. This is especially valuable when there are a large number of prizes or prize groups.

Multiple prize type raffles comprise multiple prizes. The order of prizes within prize listings is initially established as prizes are added. These prizes appear as First Prize Second Prize and so on. Once prizes are added the order in which the prizes appear can be edited. By selecting the edit prize order option a prize listing will appear. There is an option list next to each prize listed comprising numbers. These numbers range from the number one through a number representing the count of the total number of prizes. Each option list for each individual prize comprises the order number for that particular prize as a default order value. For example first prize will display the number one as the default order value second prize will display the number two as the default order value and so on. To change the order these prizes will appear in raffle listings a new order number can be selected from the option list for a particular prize. The system then automatically reorders all of the prizes and displays a new prize order listing. The system takes the new order number selected for a prize places the prize in the new position in the prize order list and then renumbers the prizes between the new order number for the prize and the original order number for the prize in sequence plus or minus one dependant on the direction of the change. For example if there are five prizes and we change prize four to prize two the original prize two becomes three and the original prize three becomes prize four. If we change prize two to prize four the original prize four becomes prize three and the original prize three becomes prize two. This eliminates the need for an organization to manually renumber prize orders individually. This is especially valuable when there are a large number of prizes or prize groups.

Mega prize type raffles comprise multiple and choice prizes. The orders of prizes are initially established as prizes are added. Prizes are able to be added as groups of prizes. Organizations are able to add another prize add another prize to the current prize group add another prize to another existing prize group or add another prize to create a new prize group. These prizes appear as First Prize Second Prize Third Prize Choice One Third Prize Choice Two and so on. Essentially Mega prize type raffles are multiple prize type raffles that encapsulate a single prize or a choice of prizes. Once prizes are added the order in which the prizes appear can be edited only with Mega prize type raffles are prizes able to be ordered by their encapsulating group and are able to be ordered within the same encapsulating group. By selecting the edit prize order option a prize listing will appear. Next to each prize listing is an option list comprising numbers. These numbers range from the number one through a number representing the count of the total number of prizes. Each option list for each individual prize comprises the order number for a particular prize as a default value. For example first prize will display the number one as the default value second prize will display the number two as the default value and so on. To change the order these prizes will appear in raffle listings the new order number can be selected from the option list for a particular prize. The system then automatically reorders all of the prizes and displays the new prize order listing. The system takes the new order number selected for a prize places the prize in the new position in the prize order list and then renumbers the prizes between the new order number for the prize and the original order number for the prize in sequence plus or minus one dependant on the direction of the change. For example if there are five prizes and we change prize four to prize two the original prize two becomes three and the original prize three becomes prize four. If we change prize two to prize four the original prize four becomes prize three and the original prize three becomes prize two. This eliminates the need for an organization to manually renumber prize orders individually. This is especially valuable when there are a large number of prizes or prize groups. Since Mega prize type raffles comprise prize groups which are able to comprise one or more prize listings an additional ordering tier is added to encapsulate each group of prizes for a particular draw. The ordering is essentially applied to the group. For example if there will be three winners drawn for a raffle and the winners will be drawn as first prize second prize and third prize winners and the first prize group comprises a choice of one of three prizes the second prize group comprises one prize and the third prize group comprises one prize the first prize group comprises three prizes which are able to be ordered and reordered amongst each other prize within the group. Then the groups themselves are also able to be ordered and reordered to change the structure of the prize drawings. For example with reference to the example provided above the first prize group comprises one prize the second prize group comprises one prize and the third prize group comprises a choice of one of three prizes. Organizations are also able to edit or change the group in which a prize is encapsulated or comprised. By editing or changing the prize group of a prize the prize is able to be inserted into an existing prize group or a new group is able to be created for the prize in which the prize would be inserted. The system will automatically reorder and renumber the prizes in the original prize group and the targeted or new prize group. When a prize is removed from a prize group the prizes that are listed after the prize that was removed are reorder by subtracting one from their order numbers. When a prize is added to a prize group the prize is added to the selected position or to the end of the group. When the prize is place in a position within an existing prize order the prizes after the position of the newly added prize are reordered by adding one to their order numbers. If the prize is place at the end of the list of prizes the order number for the prize is the order number of the last prize previously listed as last in the prize group list plus one. Mega prize type raffle prize listings are automatically numbered to reflect the grouping and ordering established by the organization. This eliminates manual entry of order numbers for prizes and prize groups. Groups are able to be represented as first price second prize third prize and so on. Prizes are also able to be represented as first prize second prize third prize choice one third prize choice two and so on. Combinations of prize groups and prizes are at the discretion of the organization operating the raffle.

Multiple prize type raffle early bird drawings comprise single or multiple prizes. Prize listings for early bird drawings are able to be ordered in the same manner as multiple prize type raffle prizes as described infra. Adding early bird drawings to multiple prize type raffles adds an additional dynamic to multiple prize type raffle listings. Adding early bird drawings essentially create raffles within raffles. The system dynamically creates drawing group identifiers to separate the main drawing and main drawing prize drawings from early bird drawings and early bird drawing prize drawings. Drawing group identifiers encapsulate prizes. The system orders drawing groups automatically by evaluating ticket sales amounts drawing dates or both ticket sales amounts and drawing dates. Multiple prize type raffle early bird drawings are dynamically numbered. For example multiple prize type raffle early bird drawings for a raffle are labeled as Early Bird Drawing One Early Bird Drawing Two and so on. Prizes are listed within each early bird drawing group as described infra and ordered or reordered as described infra. The additional dynamic exists in the ordering of prizes within multiple prize type raffles and the impact on the creation or deletion of early bird drawings. If an early bird drawing comprises more than one prize the prizes can be ordered or reordered as described infra within the early bird drawing group. When an organization removes deletes or moves early bird prizes from an early bird drawing group to the point where no prizes remain within an early bird drawing group the empty early bird drawing group is removed completely and any other early bird drawing groups are reordered and relabeled automatically. When main drawing prizes are moved to early bird drawings early bird drawing prizes are moved to the main drawing or early bird drawing prizes are moved to another early bird drawing the prizes within the drawing group of origin and the prizes within the destination drawing group are reordered renumbered and relabeled as described infra.

Drawing group identifiers encapsulate prize groups which encapsulate prizes. The system orders drawing groups automatically by evaluating ticket sales amounts drawing dates or both ticket sales amounts and drawing dates. Mega prize type raffle early bird drawings are dynamically numbered. For example mega prize type raffle early bird drawings for a raffle are labeled as Early Bird Drawing One Early Bird Drawing Two and so on. Prizes are listed within each early bird drawing group as described infra and ordered or reordered as described infra. The additional dynamic exists in the ordering of prizes within mega prize type raffles and the impact on the creation or deletion of early bird drawings. If an early bird drawing comprises more than one prize the prizes can be ordered or reordered as described infra within the early bird drawing group. When an organization removes deletes or moves early bird prizes from an early bird drawing group to the point where no prizes remain within an early bird drawing group the empty early bird drawing group is removed completely and any other early bird drawing groups are reordered and relabeled automatically. When main drawing prizes are moved to early bird drawings early bird drawing prizes are moved to the main drawing or early bird drawing prizes are moved to another early bird drawing the prizes within the drawing group of origin and the prizes within the destination drawing group are reordered renumbered and relabeled as described infra.

Early bird prizes are able to be moved to the main drawing for a raffle but when a main drawing prize or an early bird prize is moved to or added to another early bird drawing the system evaluates the prize cost as described infra. This protects organizations from incurring losses under circumstances where ticket sales can not justify the expenses of operating the raffle or distributing the prizes to winners. For example if a prize is donated it has a cost of zero. This prize can be placed in any drawing or prize group without placing the organization at risk. If a prize has been purchased by the organization the prize has a cost associated with it. This cost creates risk. When participants purchase raffle tickets they are purchasing a chance to win a prize in the main drawing. Early bird drawings are bonus drawings that give participants an additional chance to win a prize at no additional cost in return for participating earlier in the tickets sales active or operational period of the raffle therefore there must be ticket sales revenue allotted towards the main drawings. If the raffle does not meet its targeted maximum ticket sales the organization is able to convert the raffle to a 50 50 type raffle. This type of a raffle creates an equal split of the gross ticket sales revenue to be distributed between the organization and winning ticket holders where half of the gross revenue received from ticket sales in distributed to the organizations and the remaining half is distributed amongst winning ticket holders. This protects the organization from having to payout prizes it can not afford when ticket sales goals have not been met. A problem is created when the dynamics of early bird drawings are added to a raffle. If a raffle has two early bird drawings one with a set ticket sales amount and another with a set drawing date both drawing targets could be reached on the same day. This would cause both early bird drawings to be held at the same ticket sales amount essentially combining the two early birds. This comprises only part of the problem and may not cause financial harm if structured properly. The real problem is if the combined cost of the prizes is greater than the total ticket sales for the combined drawings. The purpose of multiple early birds is to drive early sales increase participants chances of winning and essential cover the costs of early bird prizes while generating early profits that could help cover some of the costs associated with the main drawings. If the early bird is converted to a 50 50 type raffle and no other tickets are sold the main drawing may also need to be converted to a 50 50 type raffle as well which would leave the organization with no profit from the raffle ticket sales. The organization would also assume the risk on the cost of any prizes purchased and any additional cost associated with operating and managing the raffle. The solution is to enable prizes with a cost greater than to zero to be placed only in main drawings or early bird drawings comprising a set ticket sales amount. Prizes that have a cost equal to zero are able to be placed in main drawings and or early bird drawings comprising a set ticket sales amount or drawing date. No prize with a cost greater than zero dollars can be placed in any early bird drawing comprising a set drawing date. This enables the raffle to be converted to a 50 50 type raffle without risk to the organization. If sales targets are not met but drawing dates are the dated drawings can proceed as planned since the prizes cost the organization zero and the raffle with the failed ticket sales targets can be converted to 50 50 type raffles. Any purchased prizes not distributed due to the 50 50 type raffle conversion can be returned sold auctioned or applied to a future raffle to recover costs.

Organizations are able to assign sponsors to raffles drawings and prizes. If no sponsor is selected no sponsor is listed. Sponsors must be register members for organizations to be able to assign a sponsor to a raffle drawing or prize. Organizations are able to browse a Sponsor Directory as described infra and select a sponsor to be listed for a raffle drawing or prize. When an organization selects a sponsor to be listed for a raffle drawing or prize the sponsor s advertisement will be automatically displayed in the raffle details listing as described infra. If no sponsors are assigned to a raffle drawing or prize then a random advertisement will be displayed in the raffle details listing as described infra. This process can occur during the adding of prizes or after a prize has been added. Adding a sponsor to a raffle drawing or prize enables sponsors to access games of chance participants for a raffle as described infra.

As described infra the permission exclusion and restriction criteria comprise the location or residency information of users or visitors and the permitted excluded or restricted areas for games of chance. As described infra the system supports various embodiments for establishing the permission exclusion and restriction criteria for games of chance operated by an organization.

In a preferred embodiment organizations are able to establish the permitted excluded or restricted States Counties and or Municipalities for each individual game of chance the organization operates as described infra. This information can be entered or inserted into the system s database in any order for each game of chance operated. The system evaluates this data and information for each individual game of chance as applied to the conditions as described infra upon game of chance is activation and the game of chance start date is reached.

Permitted excluded and or restricted States Counties and or Municipalities are listed in listings as they are added for a game of chance. This allows the organization to keep track of the criteria that has been applied to the game of chance.

Permitting an area grants permission to users visitors and or participants to view or participate in the game of chance as applied in the conditions access filter or access authorization as described infra.

Excluding an area restricts users visitors and or participants from viewing or participating in the game of chance as applied in the conditions access filter or access authorization as described infra.

An excluded area is an area where an area within a permitted area is restricted form participating. For example if New York State residence are permitted to participate but Erie County residence are not permitted to participate the organization would permit New York State and exclude Erie County.

A restricted area is an area where a specific area is excluded which does not reside within a permitted area. For example if New York residences are not permitted to participate the organization would not permit New York State.

Not permitting an area would exclude or restrict the entire area unless there are permitted areas within the area. For example if Erie County residences are permitted to participate but New York State residences have not been permitted to participate nor excluded from participating then Erie County residences will be able to participate even though Erie County is in New York State. If Erie County is the only area in New York State that has been permitted to participate then only Erie County residence will be able to access and or participate in the game of chance in the State of New York. All other counties within New York State will be excluded or essentially restricted from participating.

The system utilizes the permission of areas and the exclusion of areas to determine accessibility and eligibility. Since not permitting and not excluding an area automatically restricts the area by not including the area in the conditions there is no need to actually restrict an area that does not exist within a permitted area. To restrict an area the organization simply need not add it to the permissions for the game of chance. If the permission does not exist it will not be accessible unless it exists within a permitted area. The conditions as described infra evaluate jurisdictional levels and depth to determine accessibility or eligibility of residences from an area by evaluating the existence of an area the permissions and the exclusions of areas. If the area does not appear in the permissions or within an area in the permissions it is automatically not permitted or restricted. The exclusion of areas enables areas within permitted areas to be restricted or not permitted. If an area is both permitted and excluded at the same time it will be excluded. Exclusions override permissions which allow smaller areas within larger areas to be singled out and excluded from access or participation.

The permission and exclusion of areas is a tiered bidirectional process that can be structured or configured to include any level of geographic demographic governmental or jurisdictional boundaries areas locations or regions. For the purpose of this invention the boundaries of the United States of America have been used. This does not limit the systems ability to address cross government boundaries to comprise other countries. To include other countries in the permission exclusion or restriction criteria and conditions as described infra additional tiers are able to be added. For the purpose of this invention the following paragraphs continue to address permission exclusion or restriction criteria within the boundaries of the United States of America.

To permit residences of a state to access and or participate in a game of chance the organization enters or selects the state to permit from an option list menu link listing or any type of form object that will allow the user to make a selection or enter information. Next the organization establishes if no permit or license is required to be acquired or received by the organization from the selected state to operate the game of chance within the selected state or if the permit or license acquired or received by the organization from the selected state to operate the game of chance within the selected state is the only permit or license required to operate the game of chance within the selected state and no other permits or licenses are required for jurisdictions or areas within the selected state. If the permit or license acquired or received by the organization from the selected state to operate the game of chance within the selected state is the only permit or license required to operate the game of chance within the selected state and no other permits or licenses are required for jurisdictions or areas within the selected state the permission is a State Wide permission. If the organization has acquired a permit or license from the selected state to operate the game of chance within the selected state the organization is able to enter the permit or license number. This information is comprised in a form or forms comprising form objects used to insert and store this information in a database.

To permit residences of a county to access and or participate in a game of chance the organization enters or selects the county to permit from an option list menu link listing or any type of form object that will allow the user to make a selection or enter information. Next the organization establishes if no permit or license is required to be acquired or received by the organization from the selected county to operate the game of chance within the selected county or if the permit or license acquired or received by the organization from the select county to operate the game of chance within the selected county is the only permit or license required to operate the game of chance within the selected county and no other permits or licenses are required for jurisdictions or areas within the selected county. If the permit or license acquired or received by the organization from the select county to operate the game of chance within the selected county is the only permit or license required to operate the game of chance within the selected county and no other permits or licenses are required for jurisdictions or areas within the selected county the permission is a County Wide permission. If the organization has acquired or received a permit or license from the selected county to operate the game of chance within the selected county the organization can enter the permit or license number. This information is comprised in a form or forms comprising form objects used to insert and store this information in a database.

To permit residences of a municipality to access and or participate in a game of chance the organization enters or selects the municipality to permit from an option list menu link listing or any type of form object that will allow the user to make a selection or enter information. Next the organization establishes if no permit or license is required to be acquired or received by the organization from the selected municipality to operate the game of chance within the selected municipality. If the organization has acquired or received a permit or license from the selected municipality to operate the game of chance within the selected municipality the organization can enter the permit or license number. This information is comprised in a form or forms comprising form objects used to insert and store this information in a database.

To exclude a State County or Municipality the organization selects or enters the state county and or municipality to exclude for the game of chance. This information is inserted into a database. The system does not allow duplicate entry of permitted excluded or restricted States Counties and or Municipalities.

To navigate tiers of boundaries and regions forms and form objects are used to provide option lists link lists or data entry fields. To add a state a user selects a state. To add a county a user selects a state and then selects a county within the selected state. To add a municipality a user selects a state then selects a county within the selected state and then selects a municipality within the selected county. The same is true for adding areas to both the permission and exclusion lists for a game of chance.

To remove areas from either the permissions or exclusions for a game of chance the user selects a remove or delete link or button that exists for each area listed in the permission or exclusion listings as described infra. This will remove the permission or exclusion criteria from a game of chance.

As described infra the establishment of these permission and exclusion criteria as described above can be configured within the system by either an organization operating a game of chance a system administrator or regulators of games of chance. Although infra describes a preferred embodiment the system is structured to enable the embodiments of infra as optional system configurations. Optional system configurations also enable permission exclusion or restriction capabilities to be directly configured by regulators as described infra.

Additional raffle information as described infra must be entered into the system. Raffle and drawing information comprising the raffle ticket sales Start Date raffle ticket sales End Date Drawing Date for the main raffle drawing Drawing Time for the main raffle drawing Drawing Location drawing location address as well as Raffle Rules Shipping Information additional raffle sponsors and affiliates and Participating Ticket Sales Locations for offline ticket sales. This information is able to be provided prior to or after entering prize information or provided prior to or after permission exclusion and restriction information.

The raffle ticket sales Start Date raffle ticket sales End Date Drawing Date for the raffle and Drawing Time for the raffle establish the period of operation for the raffle. Upon activation the raffle will not be displayed or accessible to participants or visitors until the raffle ticket sales Start Date has been reached. The raffle will expire and raffle participation will no longer be available after the raffle ticket sales End Date has been surpassed. The Drawing Date and Drawing Time provide information to participants and visitors establishing when winners will be drawn or selected and the completion period for the raffle.

As described infra ticket sales are able to occur through offline participation methods. The system has been developed to support offline ticket sales either independently or in conjunction with online ticket sales as described infra. In either case offline ticket sales comprise providing participating ticket sales locations to visitors users or participants. Individuals are able to physically travel to these participating ticket sales locations or contact these participating ticket sales locations to purchase or request raffle tickets.

As described infra if the organization has opted to offer offline or both online and offline ticket sales the participating ticket sales locations will need to be entered into the system for a game of chance. As the information for each participating ticket sales location as described infra is entered into the system the locations appear in a participating ticket sales locations listing. The information for the participating sales locations is able to be edited or deleted from this listing.

Financial tools and calculators enable an organization to analyze the profitability of a game of chance. These analytical tools establish Ticket Price Ticket Count and Additional Cost variables for a raffle and calculate break even points and profitability. Organizations enter the desired Ticket Price the desired Number of Tickets for Sale and any Additional Costs that are budgeted or may be associated with the raffle. These values are inserted into the calculation variables along with stored variables from a database to generate a report comprising the results of these calculations. The reports and calculations comprise ticket count ticket price additional costs estimated total ticket sales based on the ticket price and ticket count provided total raffle prize costs from the cost of each prize for the raffle estimated total fees including discount rates transaction fees licensing fees merchant account fees gateway fees processing fees and surcharges estimated profitability for prize payouts the estimated profitability for 50 50 type raffle conversion payouts a listing of each prize with associated prize costs and totals for each drawing total prize count for the raffle and each individual drawing 50 50 reserve amount beginning drawing prize budget remaining drawing prize budget profitability of each drawing total prize cost for the raffle and each individual drawing total estimated sales at ticket price and count for the raffle and each individual drawing where sales are reported from one drawing to the next and the forecasted percentage sold. The system automatically reserves half or fifty percent of the expected sales revenue from each early bird drawing for the main drawing. This ensures that at least fifty percent of gross sales revenue will be available for the main drawing should the main drawing need to be converted to a 50 50 type raffle drawing due to a lack of ticket sales to meet raffle costs. Then the total estimated fees for conducting operating processing transactions and licensing are subtracted from the remaining fifty percent to determine the beginning prize budget. This is the break even point for prize costs. Next the system subtracts the total cost of all the prizes for each individual drawing to determine the remaining drawing or prize budget. This is critical because only the main drawing can be converted to a 50 50 type raffle. If no more tickets are sold after an early bird drawing ticket sales amount has been reach or not enough tickets are sold to cover the costs of the main raffle drawing the organization is still responsible to conduct the main drawings. This is when a raffle is able to be converted to a 50 50 type raffle utilizing the reserved sales amount 50 50 reserve from each early bird drawing to conduct the main drawing. Early bird drawing information for early bird drawings with drawing dates rather than early bird drawings with a drawing ticket sales amount is listed as either zero or not available since each prize in an early bird drawing with a set drawing date can not have a cost greater than zero. The ticket sales amount for early bird drawings are the number of tickets that must be sold before an early bird drawing will be held. The early bird drawing date is a set date an early bird drawing will be held regardless of how many tickets have been sold. Since early bird drawings with a drawing date have a total prize cost of zero there is no need to determine a prize cost budget. For prize groups comprising choice prizes where the winner will have a choice of one of multiple prizes the system evaluates the costs of all of the prizes within the choice prize group and uses only the highest value within the prize group in cost calculations. If the estimated profits for either the main drawing or any early bird drawing with a drawing ticket sales amount are less than zero the raffle can not be activated. The organization will need to change the ticket price ticket sales amount adjust additional costs or edit prizes or drawings to make the raffle profitable to enable activation. In addition to the above financial analysis and reporting an odds or statistical participation report is also generated and provided disclosing a participant s chances of winning drawings for a raffle as described infra. This enables organizations to determine the ticket price number of ticket to offer for sale number of prizes to offer number and type of drawings to conduct and evaluate raffle and prize costs to maximize participation and profitability.

A detailed raffle listing displays raffle information as described infra as it has been entered into the system by an organization. Raffle information can be edited removed or deleted from this detailed raffle listing. The listing comprises edit buttons or links which transverse various data entry pages forms and form objects that guide the organization through editing and removing or deleting information. Selecting these links or buttons enables organizations to access edit or delete sections which resemble the insert sections used to initially enter data and information into the system comprising the adding games of chance process.

Games of Chance are able to be activated by the organization operating the game of chance an administrator of the system a regulator of the jurisdiction governing the game of chance or regulators of the jurisdictions governing permitted areas or participants of the game of chance.

In one embodiment organizations submit a request for activation for a game of chance to a system administrator. A system administrator then activates the game of chance which commences operation upon the specified raffle start date provided by the organization.

In a second embodiment organizations activate their own games of chance which commence operation upon the specified raffle start date provided by the organization.

In a third embodiment organizations submit a request for activation for a game of chance to a regulator of the jurisdiction governing the raffle. The regulator then activates the game of chance which commences operation upon the specified raffle start date provided by the organization.

In a fourth embodiment organizations submit a request for activation for a game of chance to each regulator of the jurisdiction governing the areas whose residence are permitted to participate. Each regulator then activates the raffle s operation for their given jurisdiction which commences operation within each activated jurisdiction upon the specified raffle start date provided by the organization.

Activation as described infra are both preferred methods under current governing jurisdictional regulations and laws. Activation as described infra enables raffle information to be reviewed by a system administrator to provide technical assistance to ensure information as been entered properly. This review is not necessary but is preferred to ensure organizations using the system for the first time have not made mistakes and gives added comfort to users from a consultative perspective.

Upon activation of a raffle the billing cycle and licensing payment periods are established as described infra. Upon activation a notification is also sent to all member participants eligible to participate in the raffle that meet the criteria and conditions as described infra and who have selected the option to receive notifications by subscribing to do so as described infra. This notification can comprise an automated email or any other form of communication which comprises raffle and participation information.

Upon activation of a raffle raffle tickets and raffle ticket sequence numbering can occur as described infra. When a raffle is activated the system takes the maximum or targeted ticket sales number amount and creates a data record set for each ticket to be potentially sold a given raffle and gives each of these record sets a unique ticket sequence number starting with the number one and counting upwards in increments of one until the maximum number of tickets is reached.

In a preferred embodiment ticket number sequencing is performed at the close of ticket sales as described infra. This is because a set number of maximum targeted ticket sales may not be required to be established. Although the description of the invention up until now has addressed a set number of tickets to be sold for each raffle and methods of preventing selling tickets past a limited number of tickets as described infra the organization may choose to offer an unlimited number of tickets for purchase up until the raffle end date has been surpassed. This is the same as an early bird drawing with a set drawing date but is applied to the main drawing. Since there is no way of knowing how many tickets are to be sold or how many tickets will be sold by the close of ticket sales it is preferred to sequence the tickets after the raffle end date has been surpassed prior to printing or drawing the tickets.

In some cases organizations may have begun the sale of raffle tickets or participation in a raffle prior to raffle activation. If a raffle has been configured by the organization as an online raffle where tickets are to be sold or participation accepted only online pre activation ticket sales and participation will need to be entered into the system prior to activation of the raffle. This is done using the manual ticket entry system as described infra. Access to the manual ticket entry system is determined by which embodiment of the raffle activation process is used as described infra. If a request for raffle activation is required the organization may need to request manual ticket entry activation prior to requesting raffle activation. Upon activation of manual ticket entry the sold ticket information or prior participation can be entered into the system. Then once all prior participation information for a raffle has been entered the organization can request activation which will disable manual ticket entry in the case of a raffle designated for online ticket sales. In the case of raffles designated for offline ticket sales or both online and offline tickets the manual ticket entry system may be enabled and accessible until the close of the raffle.

As raffle activation is discussed raffles comprise various levels or phases of activity. As a raffle is first being added edited or entered into the system the raffle is pending. Next if a request for activation has been issued the raffle is pending activation. Next if the raffle comprises any ticket sales or participation that have been conducted prior to activation for an online participation raffle and a request for manual ticket entry has been issued the raffle is pending manual ticket entry. Next if manual ticket entry for an online participation raffle has been activated the raffle is in manual ticket entry mode. Next when a raffle is activated the raffle is active. Next if the raffle is suspended the raffle is suspended. Next if the raffle is sold out the raffle is sold out. Next when the raffle has reached the scheduled raffle end date the raffle is ending today. Next once the scheduled raffle end date has been surpassed the raffle is expired. Finally after the drawings have been conducted winners drawn selected and entered into the system and the last winner has been entered into the system the raffle is archived. This information sets the grounds for raffle operation and management processes.

As raffles are entered into the system they are able to be managed from raffle management listings comprising raffles which exist for an organization. These listings comprise summary information for each raffle which exists within the system for an organization. Raffle management listings comprise links and buttons enabling users to transverse various raffle management sections for each individual raffle. These sections comprise direct linking emailing participants printing tickets participation reports raffle reports manual ticket entry and viewing raffle information details from which raffles may be edited deleted or activated and organizations may submit requests for manual ticket sales and raffle activation. These section are able to either stand alone as menu options where the menu option is first selected and then the game of chance is selected for which to apply the section s functionality or these sections are able to be listed as functional option links or buttons for each game of chance listed in the raffle management listing.

The direct linking section comprises a link generator for directly linking to raffles operated by an organization. This allows an organization to generate the code for the direct link as described infra. This section also comprises graphical images that are able to be included within the direct link code that allows the image to be clicked on to transverse the internet to access the system as described infra. Images are able to be replaced within the code at the discretion of the organization. The organization is able to upload its own images to the system and generate the direct link code comprising the new image information inserted into the code. This is then able to be provided to affiliates essential managing affiliate advertising of the organization s games of chance or used by any entity to promote an organization s games of chance. The pages of this section comprise code generation and code copying links or buttons which when clicked on create and display or copy the direct link code.

The next section enables organizations to contact raffle participants. By selecting to transverse this section organizations are able to enter email information in to an email form that has been dynamically populated with the email addresses of all participants participating in a raffle operated by the organization. The organization is able to email all participants in all of the raffles operated by the organization or participants in each individual raffle independently. In addition to contacting participants of a single raffle organizations are able to email all participants that have participated in raffles operated by the organization. In both of these instances the email addresses dynamically populated into the email form are distinctly populated to ensure no duplicates receipts occur for the participants. The organization also has the option to print mailing labels in both of these cases. The organization is also able to print mailing label sheets that have been formatted to print on standard label paper directly from the user s browser and that have been dynamically populated with participant contact information.

The next section enables organizations to print raffle tickets. Raffle tickets are able to be printed directly from a user s browser and instructions are provided for configuring print settings and margins to properly format the print pages for printing raffle tickets.

In one embodiment once these setting have been configured the organization enters the first and last ticket numbers ticket sequence numbers or selects the print all tickets option to print the desired raffle tickets. The actual ticket number need not be entered but rather the count numbers. For example if the organization only wants to print the first two thousand tickets the starting ticket number would be the number one and the ending ticket number would be the number two thousand. The system already knows the identifiers for the organization and the game of chance. When printing tickets the system sorts and orders the tickets by the unique identifiers of the tickets which will always be ordered in the database as they are entered and created in the database at the time of participation. These unique identifiers are then used to produce a count which essentially comprises the ticket sequence numbers giving the ticket a sequential count number from the number one to the last ticket in increments of one. The tickets are then formatted into a printable view comprising ticket information as described infra. These tickets are the drawing tickets used to conduct manual raffle drawings and select winners. Error handlers do not allow ending ticket numbers to be entered that exceed the number of tickets sold. An alternative is to use option lists that allow the organization to select a starting ticket number and an ending ticket number from a list of option. The maximum number in any one of these lists is the number of tickets sold.

In a second embodiment the organization can provide a beginning ticket date and an ending ticket date instead of a starting ticket number and an ending ticket number to retrieve a group of tickets as described infra. Ticket dates are the dates tickets where purchased created or inserted in a database. This is the date the data record set for the ticket was created in a database and the date of participation. These dates also comprise time stamping. When retrieving the tickets for a specified time period the system determines the sequence number of the first ticket produced on the starting date of the specified period and then produces the count or sequence numbers as described infra up to the last ticket produced on the ending date for the specified period. This ensures correct and consistent ticket number sequencing.

In a third embodiment the organization can provide a combination of ticket numbers or ticket dates. This will display ticket that either begin at a certain ticket count number and end on a certain date or begin on a certain date and end at a certain ticket count number.

The next section is for participation reporting. Participation reporting enables organizations to view lists of information for raffle participation. Participation reports comprise participation analysis and participation information for game of chance. Participation analysis information summarizes participation and sales activity and comprises the maximum tickets available for sale or acquisition number of tickets sold number of remaining tickets ticket price total ticket sales total prize costs additional costs total actual accrued fees and other information as described infra. Participation information comprises additional details of participation by participant region location or residency. A listing is displayed comprising every state county and municipality in which a participant resides and displays the number of participants in each state county and municipality the total number of tickets purchased in each state county and municipality and the percentage of tickets purchased by participants in each state county and municipality of the total tickets sold. The organization is able to select any of these states counties or municipalities to view a detailed report of participant information. The detailed participation report comprises the information described above as well as detailed listings of participants comprising the ticket holder s first name last name address state county municipality ZIP or postal code telephone number email address and number of tickets purchase by the ticket holder or participant for the game of chance within the selected state county or municipality.

The next section comprises dynamically generated raffle reports. Raffle report information comprises a form or series of forms which enable the selection of specific raffle information and listing of form objects for the entry of additional information. Organizations select and or enter information to be included in a report for a raffle which is able to be used or submitted for regulatory reporting. This information may comprise organization information as described infra sponsor information as described infra Participant information as described infra raffle information as described infra permission exclusion or restriction information as described infra ticket information as described infra for games of chance participants raffle prize information as described infra financial analysis information as described infra and ticket drawing and winner information as described infra. This information is structured and formatted into forms and form objects enabling organizations to select and enter the information desired to be included in a report. Once the organization has selected and entered the desired information a dynamically populated report is able to be created by the system. The organization is then able to click on a link or button to display this custom report comprising the specified information. Once the report has been displayed the report is able to be printed from the user s computer screen or browser window or downloaded as a file to be saved or printed.

The next section is a raffle information display listing for viewing detailed raffle information as described infra. Viewing raffle information in this section displays detailed views of this information and provides formatting of this information as it is displayed to a user visitor or participant in Node the Games of Chance Interface in the game of chance detail view. This is the same display view as described infra. Prior to activation all of the information in this section is able to be edited and or deleted by the organization and comprises additional financial analysis information comprising estimated values as described infra. Once a raffle is activated the system is able to automatically disable edit and deletion capabilities within this view and enables actual financial analysis of real data and values to replace estimated values data variables and calculations as described infra as active game of chance operations commence. The only data an organization is able to edit at all times is the additional cost portion of the raffle information which may comprise ongoing expenditures and the addition deletion or editing of raffle and or prize sponsors which may also comprise ongoing sponsorship activities.

The manual ticket entry system comprises methods and processes for handling ticket sold or participation that occurs through offline methods of participation. In order to utilize the full potential of the system and its sales advertising participation and reporting capabilities participants need to be entered into the system. This enables the system to report participation and raffle activity as well as enable participant notifications. In the case of raffles configured to operate online participation manual ticket entry enables organizations that may have accrued participation offline prior to activating their online raffle to enter pre online participant to the system to maintain the integrity of the system and its reporting as well as provide accurate participation information to users. This manual ticket entry system is able to be configured to be enabled or disabled by system administrators.

Manual ticket entry comprises entering participant information into forms and form objects creating participant accounts or retrieving participant information from existing participant accounts and generating participant raffle tickets for games of chance. Manual ticket entry enables organizations to enter information for tickets acquired or purchased offline by participants.

For manual ticket entry organizations first determine if a participant already has a participant member account for the system. To determine if a participant is already a registered member the organization enters the participant s email address into a search form field and searches a database of registered member participants for a matching email address. If the participant s account is found to exist the participant s information is dynamically populated into a participation form comprising information as described infra. If the participant account is not found to exist the organization is able to enter information into a participant registration form comprising information as described infra. In addition to this information the organization enters the number of tickets the participant has purchased or acquired offline to create online tickets for the participant. Next the information is submitted to the system. If the participant s account already exists tickets are generated for the participant as described infra. If the participant s account does not already exist a participant account is created as described infra and the newly created account information is sent to the participant along with a temporary password for accessing their newly created participant account. Then tickets are generated for the new participant account as described infra. Participants who are already registered members will be able to access this information in their Participant Account Interface as they would any of their other participation information. Participants who are not already registered members may need to agree to the participant membership agreement and confirm their account information upon login in order to activate their participant membership account and access their Participant Membership Interface.

Once an active raffle has been sold out is expired or has reached an early bird drawing date or a specified early bird drawing ticket sales amount organizations are able to print raffle tickets to conduct raffle drawings as described infra.

In a preferred embodiment raffle tickets are printed and manually drawn by hand to determine winners of prizes. This is preferred because of public opinion having more trust for manual hand drawings over electronic methods of winner selection.

In a second embodiment the system is able to randomly select winners for selected drawings. The organization accesses the raffle information listing as described infra for an active raffle that is sold out expired or comprises early bird drawings that have reached their drawing dates or drawing ticket sales count amounts. The organization then clicks on a link or button displayed for the drawing which will randomly select winning tickets and their ticket holders for each prize or prize group in a drawing.

When winners have been selected ticket numbers as described infra are entered into a ticket entry form accessible from the raffle information listing as described infra by selecting the appropriate drawing prize or prize group for which the winning ticket has been drawn. The ticket number is entered into a ticket entry form and submitted to the system. The system retrieves the ticket holder s information sets the ticket holder as the winner notifies all participants a winner has been selected and who the winner is and displays the selected winner in raffle listings as the winner for the appropriate prize or prize group. In the case of choice prize groups the prize selected to be received by the winner is also selected as the winning ticket number is being submitted to the system for processing. In the case where a raffle is converted to a 50 50 type raffle the system evaluates the existence of early bird drawings in the raffle. If a raffle comprises early bird drawings the system calculates the prize amount by dividing half of the total ticket sales by the number of winners to be drawn. The number of winners to be drawn is determined by subtracting the number of winners drawn for completed early bird drawings from the total number of winners to be drawn for the raffle. If the raffle does not comprise early bird drawings then the system calculates the prize amount by dividing half of the total ticket sales by the number of winners to be drawn. The system then sets the prizes to be won for each prize or prize group drawing to the 50 50 prize amount which would replace advertised prizes.

The system also supports uploading downloading and streaming video feeds of drawings. The organization is able to upload a drawing video using an upload utility which places the video in a folder in a file system directory on a server accessible to users to view drawings. The system also has built in streaming video capabilities to display live drawings. These methods of media are accessible and viewable by participants in the Participant Account Interface.

The system also supports uploading photographic images of drawings. The organization is able to upload drawing images using an upload utility which places images in a folder in a file system directory on a server accessible to users to view drawings in the same manner logos and images are uploaded to the system for raffles advertisements membership registration and membership accounts. These methods of media are accessible by participants in the Participant Account Interface.

Once all drawing have been completed and winners have been entered into the system the raffle is able to be closed and archived. Once archived organizations are able to view archived raffles adjust additional cost information print reports and contact participants as described above.

Organizations are also able to print mailing label sheets that have been formatted to print on standard label paper directly from a user s browser and that have been dynamically populated with attendee contact information.

The Regulator Directory Interface comprises regulatory listings and information for registered member regulators as described infra. In addition to this information the contact information for Regulator Account Interface user as described infra and the jurisdictional regulatory information for games of chance as described infra are also listed and displayed.

Upon accessing the Regulator Directory Interface a listing for the state county and municipal regulators for the jurisdiction governing the location of the organization is displayed. Organizations are able to select states counties and municipalities to view listings of registered member regulators. From these regulator listings organizations are able to click on links or buttons to view regulatory contacts as described infra regulatory information as described infra and view or access regulator websites. Organizations are also able to access online permit and licensing applications for games of chance which are able to be either applied for online or downloaded.

The Licensing Management Interface is a segregation of infra. This enables the system to be configured to display licensing and billing information in an individual interface or control panel as the system continues to grow and require more space for merchant and licensing information which may need to be individually accessible.

The Affiliate Management Interface enables organizations to operate and manage affiliate programs for the promotion of games of chance operated and managed by an organization. The Affiliate Management Interface comprises an Affiliate Program Configuration Interface and an Affiliate Program Merchant Interface. Through the Affiliate Program Configuration Interface organizations are able to upload advertisement images to be used for the affiliate direct link as described infra and enter the affiliate referral fee as either a fixed amount of currency per ticket purchase or a percentage of the ticket price.

When sponsors are added to games of chance by organizations operating and managing games of chance the sponsor receives advertising space within games of chance listings for sponsored games of chance. Sponsor advertising is displayed to users viewing games of chance listings and sponsors are able to view the number of times an advertisement has been viewed by users visitors or participants and the number of times users visitors or participants have clicked on the sponsor s advertisement. This information is provided as an advertising report. This advertising report comprises advertisement listings which comprise view and click information listed and displayed by date and time. View and click information may also comprise user visitor or participant State County and Municipality listings to provide sponsors with statistical marketing data. This data is also able to be viewed through marketing location reports which resemble games of chance participation reporting as described infra but rather than reporting games of chance participation marketing location reports replace participation with view and click data for sponsor advertisements rather than games of chance. Availability of marketing location reports is dependant on system configurations and the embodiments which comprise these configurations. In a preferred embodiment marketing location reports are available to sponsors.

The Promotional Interface component of the Sponsor Account Interface enables games of chance sponsors to target advertising marketing and promotions via direct access to participants participating in games of chance sponsored by the sponsor.
