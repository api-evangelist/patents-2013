The present invention relates generally to event monitoring and more particularly but not by way of limitation to systems and methods for correlating events.

Event monitoring systems are typically configured to identify anomalous events and notify appropriate individuals by issuing an alert i.e. a message in the form of a voice alert email text message etc. Oftentimes however anomalous events are merely a result of a much larger event that either already has occurred or is in the process of occurring. For example a monitoring system may identify that a particular object is offline or experiencing difficulty. A root cause may be a technical problem on an object several levels above the particular object in a network topology. In such circumstances the causing object and each object beneath the causing object in the network topology are typically the subject of discrete events that are identified by the event monitoring system and for which alerts are issued. The result is a storm of messages often to a same group of individuals that relate to a same root cause.

Moreover as the value and use of information continues to increase individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option available to users is information handling systems. An information handling system generally processes compiles stores and or communicates information or data for business personal or other purposes thereby allowing users to take advantage of the value of the information. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements vary between different users or applications information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled how the information is handled how much information is processed stored or communicated and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed stored or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing airline reservations enterprise data storage or global communications. In addition information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process store and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems data storage systems and networking systems.

In one embodiment a method includes monitoring by an event monitoring system a plurality of information handling systems. The method further includes receiving an anomalous event with respect to at least one information handling system of the plurality of information handling systems. In addition the method includes performing via at least one correlation handler on the event monitoring system at least one correlation algorithm on the anomalous event. Further the method includes responsive to the performing creating by the event monitoring system via the correlation handler at least one composite event. Additionally the method includes sending the at least one composite event to an event handler. The method also includes issuing by the event monitoring system via the event handler an alert for the at least one composite event.

In one embodiment an information handling system is operable to perform a method. The method includes monitoring a plurality of information handling systems. The method further includes receiving an anomalous event with respect to at least one information handling system of the plurality of information handling systems. In addition the method includes performing via at least one correlation handler at least one correlation algorithm on the anomalous event. Further the method includes responsive to the performing creating via the correlation handler at least one composite event.

In one embodiment a computer program product includes a computer usable medium having computer readable program code embodied therein. The computer readable program code is adapted to be executed to implement a method. The method includes monitoring a plurality of information handling systems. The method further includes receiving an anomalous event with respect to at least one information handling system of the plurality of information handling systems.

Further the method includes responsive to the performing creating via the correlation handler at least one composite event. Additionally the method includes sending the at least one composite event to an event handler. The method also includes issuing via the event handler an alert for the at least one composite event.

In various embodiments alerting of anomalous events can be made more effective via systems and methods described herein. In various embodiments anomalous events are analyzed for root cause at a time of identification and before being passed to an event handler for issuing alerts. In a typical embodiment anomalous events that have been inferred to relate to a same root cause can be correlated into a composite event that is passed to an appropriate event handler. In this fashion alerts can be made more specific by indicating an inferred root cause. Alerts can also be targeted to a set of individuals who should be notified of the composite event regardless of whether those individuals would have been notified of any individual anomalous event. In addition redundant alerts such as for example message storms can be reduced or eliminated.

An anomalous event as used herein refers to a detected occurrence or action that deviates from what is expected and or that merits special handling. For example an anomalous event may be a detected deviation from expected performance on an information handling system. A composite event as used herein is a higher order event made up of one or more anomalous events. For example a composite event may result from two or more anomalous events being deemed to have a common root cause. The common root cause may be inferred for example from an analysis of the one or more anomalous events. A message or alert as used herein refers to a notification made via for example email short message service SMS text message voice communication and the like. For example in various embodiments alerts regarding anomalous events and or composite events may be issued to specific individuals or groups of individuals. Dynamic context information as used herein refers to variable characteristics of an information handling system and or of the information handling system s environment. Such variable characteristics may be referenced herein as contextual variables. Dynamic context information that provides values for contextual variables may be referenced herein as contextual values.

For purposes of this disclosure an information handling system may include any instrumentality or aggregate of instrumentalities operable to compute calculate determine classify process transmit receive retrieve originate switch store display communicate manifest detect record reproduce handle or utilize any form of information intelligence or data for business scientific control or other purposes. For example an information handling system may be a personal computer e.g. desktop or laptop tablet computer mobile device e.g. personal digital assistant PDA or smart phone server e.g. blade server or rack server a network storage device or any other suitable device and may vary in size shape performance functionality and price. The information handling system may include random access memory RAM one or more processing resources such as a central processing unit CPU or hardware or software control logic ROM and or other types of nonvolatile memory. Additional components of the information handling system may include one or more disk drives one or more network ports for communicating with external devices as well as various input and output I O devices such as a keyboard a mouse touchscreen and or a video display. The information handling system may also include one or more buses operable to transmit communications between the various hardware components.

It should be appreciated that the network is intended to abstract a plurality of networks over which the event monitoring system may be operable to communicate. In particular the network logically represents all communication infrastructure for connecting the event monitoring system to each of the monitored information handling systems . The network can include any number of wired and or wireless communications networks such as for example public or private intranets the Internet public switched telephone networks PSTNs cellular networks satellite communication and the like. To the extent a particular information handling system of the monitored information handling systems connects to the event monitoring system through others of the monitored information handling systems for purposes of communication between the event monitoring system and the particular information handling system the network can be considered to include those other information handling systems.

The monitored information handling systems can include for example field devices e.g. programmable logic controllers PLCs that control or monitor local operations such as opening and closing valves and breakers sensor systems remote terminal units RTUs that connect to and gather data from sensor systems and the like. The monitored information handling systems can also include for example server computers desktop computers laptop computers tablet computers and smartphones. The monitored information handling systems can also include networking equipment such as for example routers switches wireless access points and the like. In various embodiments subsets of the monitored information handling systems may be interconnected. Each interconnected subset may be arranged into a network topology that has for example a tree structure. In this manner some of the monitored information handling systems may be effectively dependent upon others of the monitored information handling systems . The monitored information handling systems may also be geographically dispersed on a global level.

The event monitoring system is operable to monitor correlate and handle anomalous events that have relevance to the monitored information handling systems . As described in greater detail with respect to the event monitoring system typically collects dynamic context information regarding inter alia one or more features of each of the monitored information handling systems . The features can include for example availability CPU utilization and or other factors of interest. In various embodiments the event monitoring system may request the dynamic context information over the network . In various other embodiments the event monitoring system may receive the dynamic context information without having to transmit a request. In some embodiments the event monitoring system may request and or receive at least a portion of the dynamic context information according to a data collection schedule. The data collection schedule can be for example specific to each information handling system of the monitored information handling systems .

In a typical embodiment the contextual subsystem is operable to provide a stream of dynamic context information to the plurality of correlation handlers and to the event identifier . As described below the plurality of correlation handlers can leverage the dynamic context information to correlate anomalous events. In various embodiments functionality of the contextual subsystem is exposed via for example an application programming interface API . In various other embodiments the contextual subsystem may be considered an abstraction of a plurality of contextual sources that are accessible to the plurality of correlation handlers and the plurality of event handlers .

The contextual subsystem typically leverages resources of the event monitoring system to produce the dynamic context information. Therefore it should be appreciated that the contextual subsystem is typically operable to provide numerous categories of context information. For example as described in greater detail below the dynamic context information can include any combination of weather information geographic information proximity information topological information data collection scheduling information user information status information and logged event information. Numerous other categories of context information are also contemplated and will be apparent to one of skill in the art after reviewing the inventive principles outlined herein.

The weather information generally includes information about current weather and current weather patterns for example by geographic location. In various embodiments the weather information may be received via a weather monitoring service. The location information typically includes information indicative of a physical location of one or more of the monitored information handling systems . For example in various embodiments the location information identifies a geographic location e.g. geographic coordinates from a global positioning system GPS .

The proximity information includes information identifying a geographic proximity of a monitored information handling system to a target such as for example another information handling system. The data collection scheduling information can include information related to when updated data of a particular type including other dynamic context information can be expected. For example the data collection scheduling information may indicate when new topological information or availability information is expected from each of the monitored information handling systems .

The user information typically identifies or classifies users associated with the monitored information handling systems and can include for example information identifying the user and a group and or domain to which the user belongs. The status information may include any information related to a current state of a given information handling system such as for example the given information handling system s availability signal to noise ratio capacity etc. The logged event information typically includes information regarding anomalous events previously identified and or processed by the event monitoring system .

In a typical embodiment the event identifier is operable to identify anomalous events based on for example rules that utilize contextual variables. The anomalous events may be identified as a result of dynamic context information supplied by the contextual subsystem or via another stimulus. For example an anomalous event may be that a particular monitored information handling system of the monitored information handling systems has been deemed unavailable e.g. based on no response frame received . The event receiver is operable to provide an interface for receiving events that have been identified. The dispatcher manages incoming anomalous events and as described in greater detail below distributes the incoming anomalous events to the plurality of correlation handlers . In some embodiments the dispatcher may implement a pipeline software pattern.

In a typical embodiment the plurality of correlation handlers are collectively operable to resolve an appropriate composite event if any for a given anomalous event. Therefore each correlation handler of the plurality of correlation handlers typically includes logic for correlating the given anomalous event to other anomalous events to dynamic context information for the monitored information handling systems and or to other items of relevance. In various embodiments the plurality of correlation handlers can use any one of many correlation algorithms and each correlation handler need not use a same type of correlation algorithm.

For example in various embodiments particular correlation handlers of the plurality of correlation handlers may employ rule based correlation algorithms. In these embodiments rules may be established that correlate based on contextual variables. The rules can be established by administrators or other parties. In a typical embodiment each rule includes a Boolean expression and a potential correlation that is dependent upon whether the Boolean expression evaluates to true or false. For example the Boolean expression for each rule can specify absolute values and or ranges of values for each of one or more contextual variables. The values and or ranges of values can be connected by Boolean operators such as for example AND OR and NOT. For example rules could be established that identify composite events for particular types of anomalous events involving information handling systems that are related in a particular way e.g. a parent child relationship in a network topology .

By way of further example in various embodiments particular correlation handlers of the plurality of correlation handlers may employ a machine learning algorithm such as pattern recognition clustering and decision tree learning. In these embodiments the plurality of correlation handlers can be trained to classify anomalous events based on dynamic context information and to better distinguish between different composite events. In addition in various embodiments particular correlation handlers of the plurality of correlation handlers may employ a scoring model such that for example particular contextual variables can be mathematically operated upon and combined to yield a score that is compared to a threshold.

In various embodiments the plurality of correlation handlers can correlate for purposes of message storm prevention. In various embodiments the plurality of correlation handlers can also correlate for purposes of issuing proactive alerts. In the proactive aspect the plurality of correlation handlers are operable to receive external events such as for example anomalous weather events and to correlate the external events to dynamic context information related to particular information handling systems e.g. geographic information for purposes of identifying any composite event. In the message storm prevention aspect the plurality of correlation handlers are operable to receive an anomalous event related to a particular monitored information handling system and to attempt to infer a root cause. If a root cause is inferred a composite event is generally created. In various embodiments the plurality of correlation handlers can thereby reduce or prevent message storms. The root cause can be for example weather a parent node in a network topology or the like.

In a typical embodiment the plurality of event handlers are operable to handle both composite events and individual anomalous events and to issue alerts to appropriate individuals and or groups of individuals. In various embodiments each of the plurality of event handlers may be operable to handle a particular type of composite event or anomalous event. A particular type of composite event or anomalous event may be identified for example by an identifier for the type and or an identifier for the particular event. In certain embodiments particular event handlers of the plurality of event handlers may be associated with particular correlation handlers of the plurality of correlation handlers . In these embodiments the particular event handlers may receive events from particular correlation handlers. In this fashion alerts can be made specific by indicating any inferred root cause. Alerts can also be targeted to a set of individuals who should be notified of the composite event regardless of whether those individuals would have been notified of any individual anomalous event. In addition redundant alerts such as for example message storms can be reduced or eliminated.

In operation the event identifier passes an anomalous event to the event receiver . The event receiver receives the anomalous event and passes the anomalous event to the dispatcher . As described above the dispatcher manages incoming anomalous events. In various embodiments each of the plurality of correlation handlers may address a particular type of composite event. Also some correlation handlers of the plurality of correlation handlers may address a same type of composite event. Therefore the dispatcher distributes the anomalous event to an appropriate sequence of correlation handlers of the plurality of correlation handlers . The sequence may be for example a priority order in which composite events should be identified. The sequence can also be defined in other ways. It should be appreciated that in some embodiments it may be allowed to have more than one composite event identified since it may be possible that there is more than one root cause for a given anomalous event.

After the plurality of correlation handlers have attempted to correlate the anomalous event any composite events or the anomalous event are passed to one or more appropriate event handlers of the plurality of event handlers . As described above the one or more appropriate event handlers may issue an alert to appropriate individuals or groups of individuals. In various embodiments separation of correlation logic event handling logic and event identification logic as described above allows for smoother event identification and event handling. Both the event identifier and the plurality of event handlers can operate unclouded by knowledge of for example dependency relationships among the monitored information handling systems .

At step the correlation handler receives an anomalous event. The anomalous event has typically been identified as described for example with respect to . From step the process proceeds to step . At step the correlation handler determines whether any data refresh is needed before performing a correlation algorithm. In a typical embodiment the correlation makes the determination with respect to monitored information handling systems that are within a correlation scope of the anomalous event. That is the information handling system determines whether there are any monitored information handling systems that could potentially contribute to a composite event being identified relative to the anomalous event but whose dynamic context information is deemed out of date. The correlation scope may be based on for example topological dependency physical dependency logical dependency e.g. a common control system geographic relationships etc. In a typical embodiment if the correlation handler determines that any data refresh is needed the process proceeds to step .

At step the correlation handler waits for updated data from any information handling systems whose dynamic context information is deemed out of date. In a typical embodiment a length of the wait is a configurable delay based on for example a data collection schedule that specifies when or at what frequency updated data is expected. In some embodiments the correlation handler may affirmatively request the data refresh from those information handling systems. In a typical embodiment the configurable delay allows the correlation handler to anticipate the possibility that other anomalous events may soon be received.

Moreover the configurable delay addresses a problem that anomalous events are often received out of order. In particular a first information handling system may be directly dependent upon another information handling system higher in a topology structure that has experienced a failure. However based on the data collection schedule the anomalous event pertaining to the first information handling system may be identified before the anomalous event is identified for the second information handling system. The configurable delay however alleviates this problem because the configurable delay is tailored to ensure that up to date dynamic context information is received for information handling systems within the correlation scope. From step the process proceeds to step .

At step the correlation handler applies the correlation algorithm. In a typical embodiment the correlation algorithm attempts to identify a root cause of a particular type for which the correlation handler is configured. The correlation handler typically examines relationships among the monitored information handling systems within the correlation scope. In various embodiments the correlation handler may examine topological dependencies. For example based on topological dependencies it may be determined that an information handling system higher than an information handling system from which the anomalous event originated is the root cause of the anomalous event. In such cases an outage on the higher information handling system may be appropriately identified as the root cause.

In various embodiments the correlation handler may examine and correlate for example geographic relationships among the monitored information handling systems. The geographic relationships can be inferred via geographic information provided as part of dynamic context information from a contextual subsystem such as for example the contextual subsystem of . Therefore the anomalous event e.g. an outage on a particular monitored information handling system can be correlated with other anomalous events e.g. other outages occurring within a configurable geographic area. In such cases a geographic issue may be appropriately identified as the root cause.

Continuing the above example in some embodiments the correlation handler may examine weather information in addition to the geographic relationships. The weather information is typically also received as part of the dynamic context information. In this fashion the correlation handler can correlate a weather event such as a storm with the configurable geographic area. In such cases the weather event may be appropriately identified as the root cause of outages in the configurable geographic area.

In addition the correlation handler can examine logged event information that is provided for example as part of the dynamic context information. The logged event information typically includes information about previous anomalous events that have been processed by the event monitoring system. Oftentimes it may not be possible to identify a root cause based on limited information available at a given time. For example early anomalous events e.g. the first anomalous event related to a weather event as described above may not be able to be properly correlated at the time of identification. The correlation handler however is typically operable to analyze the previous anomalous events as part of its functionality. Consequently as sufficient information becomes available via for example additional anomalous events or additional weather information the correlation handler can appropriately correlate the early anomalous events with the additional anomalous events and with any weather events. In this manner root causes can be identified with respect to the anomalous event and the previous anomalous events as necessary. From step the process proceeds to step .

At step the correlation handler determines whether a root cause has been identified. If so the process proceeds to step . At step a composite event is created. The composite event may have an identifier for its type i.e. root cause and or an identifier that specifically identifies the composite event among all other events. The composite event may also identify individual anomalous events subsumed therein. From step the process proceeds to step . At step the correlation handler sends the composite event to an event handler. From step the process proceeds to step .

At step the event handler determines recipients for an alert concerning the composite event. From step the process proceeds to step . At step the event handler issues the alert for the composite event. In cases where the composite event includes anomalous events previously processed by the event monitoring system the issuing of the alert may include issuing an update to any previous alerts that were issued. For example the update may specifically identify the root cause. From step the process proceeds to step . At step the process ends.

If it is determined at step that no root cause has been identified the process proceeds to step . At step the correlation handler sends the anomalous event to an event handler for handling as an individual anomalous event. From step the process proceeds to step . At step the event handler determines recipients for the alert concerning the anomalous event. From step the process proceeds to step . At step the event handler issues the alert for the anomalous event. From step the process proceeds to step and ends.

Once the dynamic context information for the information handling system has been updated it may be determined that the information handling system is also experiencing an outage event. In this case the outage event on the information handling system is a root cause of the outage event on the information handling system . In response the correlation handler can create a composite event that identifies the root cause and an observed impact i.e. the information handling systems and . The correlation handler can send the composite event to an event handler for handling and issuing of an appropriate alert as described above.

At step the correlation handler receives an anomalous event such as for example an anomalous weather event. The anomalous event may be for example a storm that affects wireless transmission ability or other functionality of information handling systems in a certain geographic area. The anomalous event has typically been identified as described for example with respect to . From step the process proceeds to step . At step the correlation handler analyzes dynamic context information provided by a contextual subsystem such as for example the contextual subsystem of . For example if the anomalous event is an anomalous weather event such as a storm the correlation handler may predict and analyze a projected path of the storm. From step the process proceeds to step .

At step based on the analysis the correlation handler identifies any monitored information handling systems that are impacted by the anomalous event. For example with respect to the anomalous weather event the impacted information handling systems may be those information handling systems located in the certain geographic area. By way of further example the impacted information handling systems may include those information handling systems that are in the projected path of the storm. It should be appreciated that the impacted information handling systems are often mobile. Therefore the identification at step is typically performed dynamically. From step the process proceeds to step .

At step the correlation handler creates a composite event according to the impacted information handling systems. For example the composite event may be considered a proactive composite event regarding the anomalous weather event. From step the process proceeds to step . At step the correlation handler sends the composite event to an event handler. From step the process proceeds to step . At step the event handler determines appropriate recipients for an alert concerning the composite event. From step the process proceeds to step . At step the event handler issues the alert for the composite event. The alert may be for example a weather advisory. In a typical embodiment the alert ensures that appropriate preparation can occur such as for example setting up alternative equipment to manage an outage on the impacted information handling systems. It should be appreciated that the ability to prepare can be particularly important in critical control environments such as power generation. From step the process proceeds to step . At step the process ends.

It should be appreciated that a process such as for example the process of or the process of may be performed with respect to numerous types of anomalous events. For example a correlation handler may observe events associated to busses that appear to be stopped e.g. via stationary GPS coordinates on a certain road or highway. In such a case the correlation handler may identify a blockage event a composite event . Subsequently an event handler may issue a warning event to inbound busses and suggest an alternate route.

Other types of composite events can also be identified and handled such as for example login failures on several monitored information handling systems within a short period of time intrusion attempt composite event login failures with a same set of credentials on several monitored information handling systems invalid credential composite event and the like. Numerous other types of composite events will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art after reviewing the inventive principles contained herein.

Although various embodiments of the method and apparatus of the present invention have been illustrated in the accompanying Drawings and described in the foregoing Detailed Description it will be understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiments disclosed but is capable of numerous rearrangements modifications and substitutions without departing from the spirit of the invention as set forth herein.
