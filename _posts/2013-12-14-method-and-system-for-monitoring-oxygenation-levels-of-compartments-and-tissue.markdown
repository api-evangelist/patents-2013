The entire contents of both the provisional patent application and non provisional patent application are hereby incorporated by reference.

The invention relates to a coordinated continual and real time method and system for monitoring oxygenation levels of a compartment and other tissue. More particularly the invention relates to an orchestrated method and system that monitors oxygenation levels of compartments as well as other tissue such as traumatized tissue.

Compartment syndrome is a medical condition where the pressure inside a compartment which is a muscle group surrounded by fascia or a thin inelastic film increases until the blood circulation inside the volume defined by the fascia or thin film is cut off. The most common site in humans occurs in the lower leg and more specifically in regions adjacent to the tibia and fibula. There are four compartments in the lower human leg the anterior front lateral side next to the fibula and the deep and superficial posterior back .

These four compartments surround the tibia and fibula. Anyone of these four compartments can yield a compartment syndrome when bleeding or swelling occurs within the compartment. Compartment syndrome usually occurs after some trauma or injury to the tissues such as muscles or bones or vessel or all three contained within the compartment. Bleeding or swelling within a compartment can cause an increase in pressure within that compartment. The fascia does not expand so as pressure rises the tissue and vessels begin to be compressed within the compartment.

This compression of tissue such as muscle due to intra compartmental pressure can restrict and often times stop blood flow from entering the compartment that is destined for any tissues contained within the compartment. This condition is termed ischemia. Without blood flow to tissues such as muscle the tissues will eventually die. This condition is termed necrosis.

A simple working definition for a compartment syndrome is an increased pressure within a closed space which reduces the capillary blood perfusion below a level necessary for tissue viability. As noted above this situation may be produced by two conditions. The first condition can include an increase in volume within a closed space and the second condition is a decrease in size of the space.

An increase in volume occurs in a clinical setting of hemorrhage post ischemic swelling re perfusion and arterial venous fistula. A decrease in size results from a cast that is too tight constrictive dressings pneumatic anti shock garments and closure of fascial defects. As the pressure increases in tissue it exceeds the low intramuscular arteriolar pressure causing decreased blood in the capillary anastomosis and subsequent shunting of blood flow from the compartment.

The clinical conditions that may be associated with compartment syndrome include the management of fractures soft tissue injuries arterial injuries drug overdoses limb compression situations burns post ischemic swelling constrictive dressings aggressive fluid resuscitation and tight casts.

Referring now to the Figures illustrates an X ray view of a human leg with fractured bones of the tibia and fibula that lead to one or more compartment syndromes in the muscles surrounding the bones of the human leg . The tibia and fibula usually bleed in regions proximate to the physical break regions . This bleeding can form a large pool of stagnant blood referred to as a hematoma. The hematoma can start pressing upon muscles that may be proximate to the break . This pressure caused by the hematoma can severely restrict or stop blood flow into the muscles of a compartment which is the diagnosis of a compartment syndrome.

Referring now to this Figure is a side view of a human leg in which compartment pressures are being measured with a large bore needle having a gauge size such as 14 or 16 which is the largest needle in the hospital available to clinicians according to a conventional method known in the prior art. While compartment pressures can be measured with this conventional method the method is highly invasive procedure which can cause tremendous pain to the patient. Needles with large gauge sizes of 14 or 16 are analogous to sticking a patient with an object as large as a nail or a pen.

In addition to causing tremendous pain to the patient there are several more problems associated with the conventional needle measuring method. First it is very challenging for a medical practitioner to actually measure or read pressure of a compartment since the needle must be positioned at least within the interior of a compartment. To enter the interior of a compartment the needle must penetrate through several layers of skin and muscle. And it is very difficult for the medical practitioner to know if the needle has penetrated adequately through the intermediate layers to enter into the compartment. This challenge significantly increases if the patient being measure is obese and has significant amounts of subcutaneous fat in which to penetrate with the needle.

Often the medical practitioner may not have a needle accurately positioned inside a compartment which can yield a reading of the tissue adjacent to the compartment such as muscle or skin. Such a reading of muscle or skin instead of the compartment of interest can provide the medical practitioner with elevated or depressed pressure readings that do not reflect the actual pressure contained within the compartment of interest. Pressure readings inside a compartment have been shown to vary increase based on the depth of the reading as well as the proximity to the fracture site.

Because of the challenge medical practitioners face with precisely positioning a needle within a compartment of interest and because of the numerous law suits associated with the diagnosis of compartment syndrome many medical schools do not provide any formal training for medical practitioners to learn how to properly place a needle within a compartment of interest for reading a compartment s pressure. Therefore many medical practitioners are not equipped with the skills or experience to accurately measure compartment pressures with the needle measuring method.

Currently intra compartmental pressures are the only objective diagnostic tool. Due to the legal climate regarding this condition clinicians are forced to treat an elevated value for compartment pressures or expose themselves to legal ramifications with any complications. As described later the treatment of compartment syndrome can cause significant morbidity and increase the risk for infection. Therefore inaccurate and elevated pressure readings are a very difficult and potential dangerous pitfall.

Another problem associated with the training and experience required for the needle measuring method is that as noted above compartment syndromes usually occur when tissues within the compartment are experiencing unusual levels of swelling and pressure. With this swelling and pressure the tissues do not have their normal size. Therefore any training of a medical practitioner must be made with a patient suffering under these conditions. A normal patient without any swelling would not provide a medical practitioner with the skills to accurately assess a size of a compartment when using the needle measuring method for determining compartment pressure. Put another way due to the trauma associated with the injury normal anatomy is not always present when attempting to measure compartment pressures.

In addition to the problem of entering a compartment that may have an abnormal size or anatomy the needle measuring method has the problem of providing only a snap shot of data at an instant of time. When the conventional needle measuring method is used it provides the medical practitioner with pressure data for a single instant of time. In other words the needle pressure method only provides the medical practitioner with one data point for a particular time. Once pressure is read by the medical practitioner he or she usually removes the needle from the patient. The data obtained from a single measurement in time gives no information concerning the pressure trend and the direction the intra compartmental pressure is moving.

This collection of single data points over long periods of time is usually not very helpful because pressures within a compartment as well as the patient s blood pressure can change abruptly on the order of minutes. Also because of the pain associated with the needle measuring method noted above the medical practitioner will seldom or rarely take pressure readings with within a few minutes of each other using a needle.

A further problem of the needle measuring method is that for certain regions of the body such as the lower leg there are four compartments to measure. This means that a patient s leg must be stuck with the large bore needle at least four times in order for a medical practitioner to rule out that a compartment syndrome exists for the lower leg. In the lower leg of the human body one compartment is located under a neighboring compartment such that a needle measurement may be needed in at least two locations that are very close together but in which the medical practitioner must penetrate tissues at a shallow depth at a first location to reach the first compartment and for reaching the second compartment that is underneath the first compartment a large depth must be penetrated by the needle often with the needle piercing the first compartment and then the second compartment.

Another problem besides pain that is associated with the needle pressure measuring method is that there is a lack of consensus among medical practitioners over the compartment pressure ranges which are believed to indicate that a compartment syndrome may exist for a particular patient. Normal compartment pressure in the human body usually approaches 4 mmHg in the recumbent position. Meanwhile scientists have found that an absolute pressure measurement of 30 mmHg in a compartment may indicate presence of compartment syndrome. However there are other scientists who believe that patients with intracompartmental pressures of 45 mmHg or greater should be identified as having true compartment syndromes. But other studies have shown patients with intra compartmental pressures above these limits with no clinical signs of compartment syndrome. Additional studies have shown that a pressure gradient based on perfusion pressure diastolic blood pressure minus intra compartmental pressure is the more important variable. Studies have shown in a laboratory setting that once the perfusion pressure drops to 10 mm Hg tissue necrosis starts to occur.

Other subjective methods for diagnosing compartment syndromes instead of the needle measuring method exist however they may have less accuracy than the needle measuring method because they rely on clinical symptoms of a patient. Some clinical symptoms of a patient used to help diagnose compartment syndromes include pulselessness absence of a pulse lack of muscle power pain parastesias and if the flesh is cold to touch. Pain out or proportion and with passive stretch are considered the earliest and most sensitive but both are very low specificity. One of the major drawbacks of these symptoms is that for many of them the patient must be conscious and must be able to respond to the medical practitioner. This is true for the muscle power and pain assessment. For any inebriated patients or patients who are unconscious the pain assessment and muscle power assessment cannot be used accurately by the medical practitioner. In the setting of high energy trauma which is associated with compartment syndrome many patients are not capable of cooperating with a good physical exam due to any number of causes including head trauma medical treatment including intubation drug or alcohol ingestion neurovascular compromise or critical and life threatening injuries to other body systems.

For the pain assessment if a lower leg compartment syndrome exists in a patient then the range of motion for a patient s foot or toes will be extremely limited and very painful when the patient s foot or toes are actively or passively moved. The pain from a compartment syndrome can be very immense because the muscles are deprived of oxygen because of the compartment syndrome.

Another drawback using pain to assess the likelihood of a compartment syndrome is that every human has a different threshold for pain. This means that even if someone should be experiencing a high level of pain he or she may have a high threshold for pain and therefore not provide the medical practitioner with a normal reaction for the current level of pain. Another problem with using pain to assess the likelihood of the existence of a compartment syndrome is that if the patient is experiencing trauma to other parts of their body he or she may not feel the pain of a compartment syndrome as significantly especially if the trauma to the other parts of the patient s body is more severe. This condition is termed a distracting injury. On the other hand trauma causes the initial injury that precipitates a compartment syndrome. That initial trauma by definition will cause a baseline amount of pain that is often very difficult to separate from a potential compartment syndrome pain. These initial injuries by themselves cause significant pain so a patient that does not tolerate pain well may present similar to a compartment syndrome without having any increased pressures simply because they react vehemently to painful conditions.

Non invasive measuring of compartment syndromes using near infrared sensors such as spectrophotometric sensors to measure oxygenation levels within a compartment has been suggested by the conventional art. However these conventional techniques have encountered the problem of a medical practitioner locating compartments of interest and accurately and precisely positioning a sensor over a compartment of interest. Often the orientation of the scan and the depth of the scan produced by a near infrared sensor as well as the orientation of a compartment can be challenging for a medical practitioner to determine because conventional sensors are not marked with any instructions or visual aids. Another problem faced by the medical practitioner with conventional non invasive techniques is determining how to assess the oxygenation level of compartments that lie underneath a particular neighboring compartment such as with the deep posterior compartment of the human leg.

In trauma settings near infrared sensors often do not work when they are placed over regions of the body that have hematomas or pools of blood. In such conditions a medical practitioner usually guesses at what regions of the human body do not contain any hematomas that could block compartment measurements. Also conventional near infrared sensors typically are not sterilized and cannot be used in surgical or operating environments.

Near infrared sensors NIRS in their current form are limited to a single sensor with a single sensor depth. They also can be affected by skin pigmentation that is not accounted for in the current technology. Placement of the sensor can be difficult since an expanding hematoma can block a previously acceptable placement. Additionally the only system as of this writing is a single monitor system. There is no product available at this time which will allow for multiple areas to be monitored in close proximity to one another without the potential for interference from other sensor light sources.

Referring now to this figure is a side view of a human leg in which a surgical procedure known as a fasciotomy was performed in order to release the pressures in one or more compartments surrounding the bones of the leg according to a technique known in the art in order to alleviate a compartment syndrome that was diagnosed. This surgical procedure includes an incision that is made along the length of the leg and is generally as long as the compartments contained within the leg . While a single incision is illustrated in a second incision is made on the opposing side of the leg so that a patient will have two incisions on each side of his leg . These incisions typically extend from near the knee to near the ankle on each side of the leg.

This procedure is very invasive and it often leaves the patient with severe scars and venous congestion once healed. Also the procedure increases a patient s chances of receiving an air borne infection because the incisions made on either side of the leg are usually left open for several days in order to allow for the swelling and excess bleeding to subside. Fasciotomies transform a closed fracture one in which the skin is intact and minimal risk of infection to an open fracture. Open fractures have a much higher risk of bone infections which requires multiple surgical debridements and ultimately amputation in some cases in ordered to appropriately treat. Additionally some wound cannot be closed and require skin transfers or skin grafts from other parts of the body usually from the anterior thigh.

Therefore it is quite apparent that accurately diagnosing compartment syndrome is critical because any misdiagnosis can lead to significant morbidity. A missed compartment syndrome can result in an insensate and contracted leg and foot. A fasciotomy which is highly invasive procedure and which exposes a patient to many additional health risks should not be performed in the absence of a compartment syndrome.

Additionally time is an important factor in the evaluation of these patients. Ischemic muscle begins to undergo irreversible changes after about six hours of decreased perfusion. Once irreversible changes or necrosis occur a fasciotomy should not be performed. Fasciotomies in the setting of dead muscle only increase the risk for severe infections and other complications. Late fasciotomies have been shown to have approximately a 50 75 risk of complication. Therefore fasciotomies need to be performed early but judiciously in patients that are often unresponsive or uncooperative in order to prevent severe morbidity.

Accordingly there is a need in the art for a non invasive real time method and system that monitors oxygenation levels of a compartment and that is provided with sensors which can be precisely positioned over a compartment of interest in order to assist in assessing conditions associated with a compartment syndrome. A further need exists in the art for a non invasive method that monitors oxygenation levels of a compartment over long periods of time at frequent time intervals and that can monitor different compartments that may be in close proximity with one another. Another need exists in the art for oxygenation sensors that can be fabricated to fit the size of compartments of interest. There is also a need in the art for a non invasive method and system that monitors oxygenation levels and that can identify ideal locations along a human body in which to conduct scans for deep compartments. There is another need in the art for sterile non invasive oxygenation sensors that can be used under surgical and operating conditions. There is a need for multiple locations and multiple compartments to be monitored in a continual and orchestrated manner by a single system. In other words multiple monitors coordinated to limit noise and continually monitor multiple compartments are needed in the art.

A method and system for monitoring oxygenation levels in compartments of an animal limb such as in a human leg or a human thigh or a forearm can be used to assist in the diagnosis of a compartment syndrome. The method and system can include one or more near infrared compartment sensors in which each sensor can be provided with a compartment alignment mechanism and a central scan depth marker so that each sensor may be precisely positioned over a compartment of a living organism such as a compartment of a human leg or human thigh or forearm. The method and system can include a device for displaying oxygenation levels corresponding to respective compartment sensors that are measuring oxygenation levels of a compartment of interest.

The alignment mechanism of a compartment sensor can include a linear marking on a surface of the compartment sensor that is opposite to the side which produces a light scan used to detect oxygenation levels. The linear marking can be used by a medical practitioner to align a compartment sensor with the longitudinal axis of a compartment.

The central scan depth marker can include a linear marking positioned on a surface of a compartment sensor that intersects the alignment mechanism a crosshatch at a location along the alignment mechanism that denotes the deepest region of a light scan produced by the compartment sensor. The depth of measurement can be displayed in numeric form over the crosshatch guide to aid the clinician since depth varies based on light source receptor separation. The central scan depth marker can insure that a medical practitioner properly aligns the compartment sensor at a location that will measure a compartment of interest.

According to one exemplary embodiment of the invention in addition to each compartment sensor having a compartment alignment mechanism and a central scan depth marker the compartment sensors can be grouped in pairs and share a common supporting substrate. The common supporting substrate can include a separation device such as but not limited to a perforated region. The separation device such as a perforated region can be torn or broken by the user in order to adjust for a size of a compartment of interest. In other words with the separation device a pair of two compartment sensors can be physically divided so that the sensors do not share a common substrate after the separation device is utilized.

According to another exemplary embodiment of the invention a compartment sensor can include one light emitting device and two different sets of light detectors such that the compartment sensor can provide a first shallow oxygenation scan at a first depth and a second deep oxygenation scan at a second depth. The second depth can be greater than the first depth so that a general computing device coupled to the two compartment sensors can be programmed or hardwired to calculate the second deep oxygenation level at the second depth by subtracting data generated by the first shallow oxygenation level at the first depth.

According to another alternate exemplary embodiment of the invention several individual compartment scanners can be grouped together along a longitudinal axis of a common supporting material to define a linear compartment array. The linear compartment array can also include a linear marking on its surface and that is opposite to the side which produces the light scan as well as multiple crosshatches for depth denotation. The linear marking can be used to align linear compartment array with a longitudinal axis of a compartment.

According to another exemplary embodiment of the invention a compartment sensor or compartment sensor array can be positioned at a predetermined position along a human leg in order to measure a deep posterior compartment of the human leg. Position is posteromedial to the posterior aspect of the tibia.

According to one exemplary embodiment of the invention a linear compartment sensor array can include individual sensors that scan at different depths such that the linear compartment sensor array as a whole has a varied scan depth along its longitudinal axis to more closely match the topography shape or depth of a compartment of interest that has a corresponding varied depth. According to another exemplary embodiment of the invention each individual compartment sensor can produce its oxygenation scan at a predetermined interval such that each individual compartment sensor is only activated one at a time or in a predetermined sequence so that any two or more sensors are not working at a same instant of time in order to reduce any potential for light interference among the different oxygenation scans produced by respective sensors of the array.

According to a further exemplary embodiment of the invention each compartment sensor can use optical filters in combination with different wavelengths of light so that two or more compartment sensors can scan at the same without interfering with one another. According to another exemplary embodiment of the invention a linear compartment array can include optical transmitters that are shared among pairs of optical receivers. For example a single optical transmitter can be used with two optical receivers that are disposed at angles of one hundred eighty degrees relative to each other and the optical transmitter along the axis of the compartment.

According to yet another exemplary embodiment a compartment sensor or compartment sensor array can be made from materials that can be sterilized and used in operating environments that are free from germs or bacteria. A compartment sensor or compartment sensor array can also be provided with a coating that is sterilazable or sterilized. When a compartment sensor or compartment sensor array is sterilized it can be provided underneath bandages or dressings adjacent to a wound or injury of a compartment or proximate to compartment of interest. Each sensor can be provided with a common and sufficient length of cord such as on the order of approximately ten feet to allow the cord to extend off the sterile operative field.

According to another exemplary embodiment of the invention the compartment monitoring method and system can include a device that displays oxygenations levels of a compartment over time in which oxygenation levels are measured at a particular time frequency such as but not limited to on the order of seconds or minutes. According to another exemplary embodiment of the invention the compartment monitoring system and method can display all measured data from all sensors on the same screen. The display can also show a differential between injured and uninjured leg values of the concordant compartments.

For example the screen can display calculations of the difference between the values of the anterior compartment of both the injured leg and the contralateral uninjured leg control leg to help evaluate the perfusion of the injured leg. According to an alternate exemplary embodiment of the invention the compartment monitoring system and method can display anatomical features and locations for positioning the sensors of the system along compartments of interest selected by a user. This program at initial set up can help insure proper placement of the sensor by the clinician by using diagrams for accurate placement for each of the labeled sensors or sensor arrays.

According to another exemplary embodiment of the invention the compartment monitoring system can detect changes in a size of a hematoma when at least one linear compartment arrays is used to measure oxygenations levels at different positions of a compartment. Alternatively the compartment monitoring system can provide information on varies levels of blood flow along the longitudinal axis of a compartment when at least one linear compartment array is used to measure oxygenations levels at different positions of a compartment.

Alternatively according to another exemplary embodiment of the invention a compartment sensor can be provided with a skin pigment sensor that has a known reflectance and that can be used to calibrate the compartment sensor based on relative reflectance of skin pigment which can affect data generated from oxygenation scans. For example a skin narrow band simple reflectance device a tristimulus colorimetric device or scanning reflectance spectrophotometer can be incorporated into the oxygenation sensor system to obtain a standardized value for skin pigmentation which evaluate melanin and hemoglobin in the skin.

Once the skin melanin is determined it can be correlated to its calculated absorption or reflectance effect on the NIRS value using a predetermined calibration system. This effect optical density value can be incorporated in tissue hemoglobin concentration calculations in the deep tissue. Accounting for skin pigmentation will usually allow for information or values to be compared across different subjects with different skin pigmentation as well as using the number as an absolute value instead of monitoring simply changes in value over time.

According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention a compartment sensor can be provided with layers of a known thickness and a know absorption in order to reduce the depth of an oxygenation scan by the sensor so that a thin layer of tissue such as skin can be measured by the sensor. In other words due to limitations of how close the light source and receptor can be positioned in order to evaluate very superficial layers such as skin the sensor can be separated from the skin of the subject by fixed amount with a known material. For example by using a material with a known optical density the length of a scan can be shortened by projecting the light pathway mostly through the known material.

The light pathway would escape the know material only at the maximum depth to evaluate a limited depth of tissue such as skin. This technique would allow for direct measurement of the skin pigmentation effects on the system. This skin sensor can be either incorporated into the compartment monitoring system directly or used to construct the predetermined calibration for skin reflectance values that can be used by the compartment monitoring system.

According to another exemplary embodiment of the invention the compartment monitoring system can receive data from a blood pressure monitoring system in order to correlate oxygenation levels with blood pressure. The compartment monitoring system that includes a blood pressure monitoring system can activate an alarm such as an audible or visual alarm or both when the diastolic pressure of a patient drops since it has been discovered that perfusion can be significantly lowered or stopped at low diastolic pressures and when compartment pressures are greater than the diastolic pressure.

According to another exemplary embodiment the compartment monitoring system can increase a frequency of data collection for oxygenation levels and or blood pressure readings when low blood pressure is detected by the system. According to an alternative exemplary embodiment the compartment monitoring system can display blood pressure and oxygenation levels simultaneously and in a graphical manner over time such as an X Y plot in a Cartesian plane or as two separate graphs over time. Correlation between hemoglobin concentration and diastolic pressure can be used to estimate intra compartmental pressures without having to use invasive needle measurements.

According to another further exemplary embodiment the inventive system can incorporate oxygenation levels from both lower extremities and compare values between the legs or other body parts. Initial data from patients with extremity injuries by the inventor have shown that muscular skeletal injuries cause hyperemia increased blood flow and oxygen in the injured extremity. If a compartment syndrome develops the oxygenation drops from an elevated state to an equal and then lower level with comparison to the uninjured limb. Therefore when comparing injured and uninjured extremities the injured limb may show increased oxygenation levels. If levels begin to drop in the injured limb compared to the uninjured limb an alarm or alert can be triggered to alert the clinician. A display for the blood pressure being measured can also be provided by the system.

A method and system for monitoring oxygenation levels in compartments of an animal limb such as in a human leg or a human thigh or a forearm can be used to assist in the diagnosis of a compartment syndrome. The method and system can include one or more near infrared compartment sensors in which each sensor can be provided with a compartment alignment mechanism and a central scan depth marker so that each sensor may be precisely positioned over a compartment of a human leg or human thigh or forearm. The method and system can include a device for displaying oxygenation levels corresponding to respective compartment sensors that are measuring oxygenation levels of a compartment of interest.

Referring now to the drawings in which like reference numerals designate like elements illustrates oxygen levels A B of compartments of a human leg being measured by a near infrared spectroscopy NIRS sensors A B that include a compartment alignment mechanisms A B and central scan depth markers A B according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention.

The alignment mechanism of a compartment sensor can include a linear marking on a surface of the compartment sensor that is opposite to the side which produces a light scan used to detect oxygenation levels. The linear marking can be used by a medical practitioner to align a compartment sensor with the longitudinal axis of a compartment of interest. The invention is not limited to a solid line on the sensor . Other alignment mechanisms within the scope of the invention include but are not limited to tick marks dashed lines notches cut in the substrate of the compartment sensor to provide a geometric reference for the medical practitioner and other like visual orienting alignment mechanisms .

The central scan depth marker can include a linear marking positioned on a surface of a compartment sensor that intersects the alignment mechanism at a location along the alignment mechanism that denotes the deepest region of a light scan produced by the compartment sensor . The depth of measurement can be displayed in numeric form over the central scan depth marker as a guide to aid medical practitioner since scan depth can vary based on the compartment sensor s light source and receptor separation. The central scan depth marker can insure that a medical practitioner properly aligns the compartment sensor at a location that will measure a compartment of interest. Similar to the alignment mechanism noted above the invention is not limited to a solid line on the compartment sensor . Other central scan depth markers within the scope of the invention include but are not limited to tick marks dashed lines notches cut in the substrate of the compartment sensor to provide a geometric reference for the medical practitioner and other like visual orienting central depth markers .

Once the proper position for a compartment sensor is determined by the medical practitioner with the compartment alignment mechanism and the central scan depth marker the medical practitioner can apply the compartment sensor on the patient by using an adhesive that is already part of the compartment sensor .

The compartment sensors can generally provide spectrophotometric in vivo monitoring of blood metabolites such as hemoglobin oxygen concentration in any type of compartment and on a continuing and substantially instantaneous basis.

The compartment sensors are coupled to a processor and display unit which displays the two oxygen levels A B comprising the values of seventy three. The processor and display unit can display all four oxygen levels of four compartments of the human leg when at least four compartment sensors are deployed. The invention is not limited to four compartment sensor embodiments. The invention can include any number of compartment sensors for the accurate detection of conditions that may be associated with compartment syndrome. For example another exemplary embodiment illustrated in allows for eight sensor readings so that concomitant monitoring of the contralateral uninjured leg can be performed.

The processor of the display unit can be a conventional central processing unit CPU known to one of ordinary skill in the art. It may have other components too similar to those found in a general purpose computer such as but not limited to memory like RAM ROM EEPROM Programming Logic Units PLUs firmware and the like. Alternatively the processor and display unit can be a general purpose computer without departing from the invention.

The processor and display unit can operate in a networked computer environment using logical connections to one or more other remote computers. The computers described herein may be personal computers such as hand held computers a server a client such as web browser a router a network PC a peer device or a common network node. The logical connections depicted in the Figures can include additional local area networks LANs and a wide area networks WANs not shown.

The processor and display unit illustrated in and the remaining Figures may be coupled to a LAN through a network interface or adaptor. When used in a WAN network environment the computers may typically include a modem or other means for establishing direct communication lines over the WAN.

In a networked environment program modules may be stored in remote memory storage devices. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between computers other than depicted may be used.

Moreover those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention may be implemented in other computer system configurations including other hand held devices besides hand held computers multiprocessor systems microprocessor based or programmable consumer electronics networked personal computers minicomputers mainframe computers and the like.

The invention may be practiced in a distributed computing environment where tasks may be performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment program modules may be located in both local and remote storage devices.

The processor and display unit can comprise any general purpose computer capable of running software applications and that is portable for mobile applications or emergency applications.

The communications between the processor and display unit and the sensors can be wire or wireless depending upon the application. Typical wireless links include a radio frequency type in which the processor and display unit can communicate with other devices using radio frequency RF electromagnetic waves. Other wireless links that are not beyond the scope of the invention can include but are not limited to magnetic optical acoustic and other similar wireless types of links.

In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in the compartment sensors are coupled to the processor and display unit with cables A B which can include electrical conductors for providing operating power to the light sources of the compartment sensors and for carrying output signals from the detectors of the sensors to the display unit . The cables may be coupled to a quad channel coupler a preamplifier A B and an integrated multiple conductor cable . Alternatively all wires could be packaged or merged into a single unit or cord or plug not illustrated for insertion into the monitor for ease of management for the clinician and to prevent misplacement of wire plugs into wrong sockets.

In addition to tracking compartment oxygen levels the processor and display unit may receive data from a blood pressure monitor . The blood pressure monitor may be coupled to a probe that takes pressure readings from the patient at one or more locations such as but not limited to an arm with a cuff a needle in the volar wrist the brachium arm via a sphygmomanometer or arterial line. The probe can be any one of a number of devices that can take blood pressure readings such as but not limited to automated inflating pressure cuffs sphygmomanometer arterial lines and the like. Similarly other types of blood pressure monitors are not beyond the scope of the invention. Further details of the relationship between blood pressure and oxygen levels in the human body will be discussed and described more fully below in connection with .

The display and processing unit can display values at any one time for all compartment sensors being used. While the display and processing unit only displays two oxygen levels for the embodiment illustrated in the display and processing unit could easily display all four values from the four compartment sensors that are being used to monitor the four compartments of the lower leg .

Referring now to this figure illustrates a bottom view of two pairs of compartment sensors with each sensor having a compartment alignment mechanism and a central scan marker in addition to a separating device according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. The substrate of each compartment sensor can comprise a foam or plastic material that may have a soft and comfortable outer layer. The separating device is illustrated with a dashed line in .

According to one exemplary embodiment the separating device can comprise a perforation in the substrate . A perforation is a series of cuts or removed portions positioned along a line which can be perforated or separated. This means for the exemplary embodiment illustrated in the first compartment sensor A can be physically separated from the second compartment sensor B. The separating device is not limited to perforations and it can include other types of devices. For example the separating device can comprise a zipper a plastic seal line hook and loop fasteners and other like devices that would permit the rapid and accurate expansion of compartment sensors when used in a trauma setting.

As noted above the compartment sensors can include alignment mechanisms and a central scan depth marker in order to accurately position the compartment sensors over compartments of interest. The alignment mechanisms and central depth markers are illustrated with dashed or dotted lines because they are hidden relative to the bottom view of the compartment sensors which are illustrated in .

Each compartment sensor may comprise an optical transmitter and an optical receiver . The optical transmitter may comprise an electrically actuated light source for emitting a selected examination spectra. Specifically the optical transmitter may comprise two or more narrow bandwidth LEDs whose center output wavelengths correspond to the selected examination spectra. Each optical receiver may comprise two or more light detectors such as photodiodes. In the embodiment illustrated in the optical receiver has a total of four photodiodes in which pairs of photodiodes work together to provide a near detector and a far detector. Each photo diode must have two receptors to receive light at two separate wavelengths to allow for calculations of oxy hemoglobin and deoxy hemoglobin concentrations. Using two pairs of receptors allows for a deep and shallow set to enable isolation of only the deep tissue oxygenation see .

Referring briefly now to the near light detector B and the far light detector A are positioned within the substrate material at predetermined distances from the optical transmitter . The near detector B formed by the two photodiodes that are closest to the optical transmitter have a light mean path length B which is primarily confined to shallow layers of a compartment of interest. Meanwhile the far detector A formed by the pair of photodiodes that are farthest from the optical transmitter have a light mean path A that is longer than that of the near detector and is primarily confined to deep layers of a compartment of interest in a leg .

By appropriately differentiating the information from the near or shallow detector B which may produce a first data set from the far or deep detector A which may produce a second data set a resultant value for the tissue optical density may be obtained that characterizes the conditions within a compartment of interest without the effects that are attributable to the overlying tissue which is adjacent to the compartment of interest.

This enables the compartment monitoring system illustrated in to obtain metabolic information on a selective basis for particular regions within the patient and by spectral analysis of the metabolic information and by using appropriate extinction coefficients a numerical value or relative quantified value such as of may be obtained which can characterize metabolites or other metabolite data such as the hemoglobin oxygen saturation within the particular region of interest. This region of interest is defined by the curved light mean path A extending from the optical transmitter to the far or deep detector A and between this path A and the outer periphery of the patient but excluding the region or zone defined by the curved light mean path B extending from the optical transmitter to the near or shallow detector . Further details of the compartment sensors are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 615 065 issued in the name of Barrett et al. which is hereby incorporated by reference.

Referring back now to each compartment sensor has its own cable that provides power to the optical transmitter A and that receives data from the optical receiver . Each compartment sensor may also include a label which may comprise a name and an anatomical location to position the compartment sensor on a patient. This label may be placed on the bottom of the sensor that contacts the patient as well as on the side that is opposite to the side which contacts the patient. For example the first sensor A can have a first label A that comprises the phrase Lateral to describe the name of the compartment that this compartment sensor A that is designed to assess. The numerical depth can also be displayed on the label but is not limited to a single depth.

The first pair of compartment sensors A B may be coupled to the second pair of compartment sensors C D with an expansion device . The expansion device may comprise an elastic material that stretches. The expansion device allows the pair of compartment sensors to be positioned on appropriate parts of a patient to monitor any compartments of interest. The four compartment sensor exemplary embodiment illustrated in is designed for the four compartments of a human lower leg .

The expansion device is not limited to elastic material. The expansion device can include other mechanisms which allow for an adjustable separation between the pairs of compartment sensors so that the compartment sensors may be precisely and appropriately positioned over specific compartments of interest. The expansion device may include but is not limited to springs tape hook and loop fasteners gauze and other like materials.

Referring now to this figure illustrates a bottom view of the four compartment sensors of but with the individual sensors divided from one another through using the separating device such as the perforations according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. Specifically the first compartment sensor A of the first pair of sensors A B is physically located away from the second compartment sensor B. Similarly the third compartment sensor C of the second pair of sensors B C is physically located away from the fourth compartment sensor C. The separating device the expansion device in combination with the alignment mechanism and central scan depth marker can allow the compartment sensors to be accurately and precisely positioned over compartments of interest such as the four compartments of a human leg . In order to accurately monitor the appropriate compartment a right and left configuration can be provided since compartment alignment would be reversed based on which leg is examined by the medical practitioner. Each configuration would be labeled as right or left. The configuration illustrated in are designed for human left leg where the expansion device would be positioned over the tibia.

Referring now to this figure illustrates a bottom view of a three sensor embodiment in which one sensor of the three compartment sensors A B can scan at two or more depths according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. Specifically a compartment sensor may include an optical transmitter C that works with at least two different optical receivers C and C. As noted above each optical receiver may comprise two or more light detectors such as photodiodes. In the embodiment illustrated in each optical receiver C and C has a total of four photodiodes in which pairs of photodiodes work together to provide near detector and far detectors for a respective receiver C C. This combination allows the compartment sensor to scan at least two different depths. And because of the capability to scan at two different depths the compartment sensor is provided with two different central scan depth markers C C.

Referring now to this figure illustrates the compartment sensor of that can scan at two or more depths in order to measure deeper compartments of an animal body according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. The twp optical receivers of work in principal in an identical manner relative to the optical receiver described in connection with discussed above. This means that the combination of the optical transmitter C and optical receiver C can provide an oxygenation level for a first scan depth B of a patient. Meanwhile the combination of the optical transmitter C and the optical receiver C can provide an oxygenation level for a second scan depth A of a patient.

Therefore this stacked compartment sensor can be used to measure the oxygenation level of a first compartment that maybe positioned underneath a second compartment such as for the deep posterior compartment of a lower leg of a human body which is positioned beneath the superficial posterior compartment of the leg . This stacked compartment sensor can allow the display and processing unit to subtract the oxygenation level found at the first scan depth B of the first compartment such as the superficial posterior compartment from the oxygenation level at the second scan depth A of the second compartment such as the deep posterior compartment.

The invention is not limited to the two stacked optical receiver embodiment illustrated and can include any number of optical receivers positioned in the substrate material so that various scan depths can be made to determine oxygenation levels within multiple compartments that may be stacked on or positioned adjacent to one another in a sequential or layered shallow to deep arrangement.

Referring now to this figure illustrates a bottom view of a sensor comprising a substrate a light source and optical receivers similar to those described above according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. The sensor also has a superficial tissue sensor or skin sensor . Further details of the skin sensor will be described below in connection with . The light source and the optical receivers can be controlled over time and may be referred to in the art as time related reflectance to adjust for the reflectivity and penetration depth of optical light which leaves the light source and enters layers of skin See . The optical receivers can be controlled so that they are instructed to wait for measuring optical light that has penetrated deeper into the skin and other tissue layers. The light reflectance can be used to measure depth of fat subcutaneously in order to allow for different size people. For example this light reflectance can be used and scaled for people with various thicknesses in skin and fat tissue.

Three to four or more receivers can be positioned in an arch around the same light source at between about thirty and about forty five degrees or more. One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that any number of receivers and light sources can be employed at various different positions without departing from the scope of the invention.

In other exemplary embodiments not illustrated the receivers can be positioned in a circle or at about 360 degrees around the single light source . Each of the optical receivers can be independently or separately controlled.

The optical receivers and or the skin sensor can be used to measure any initial reflectance over a short time period such that skin pigment and erythema can be assessed. Erythema is a condition of skin and tissue after they have been injured. Usually with this condition fair or white pigmented skin individuals usually have red colored swollen skin near tissue in an Erythematic condition. If the light source uses red colored light to assess red colored skin then false readings may occur in this situation. Therefore the light source can be provided with a skin sensor D that is used under Erythema conditions. Additional wavelengths can be added to the light source outside of the near infrared range in order to determine a measure of erythema of the subcutaneous skin. By using wavelengths in the red and green spectrum an algorithm can be formulated to measure erythema A dermaspectrum II was used by the inventor in a study in which the inventor looked at pigment using green red light to measure erythema . However one of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that other colors or optical wavelengths above or below the green colored spectrum can be produced by the skin sensor D without departing from the invention.

The skin sensor can scan at exemplary depths of about between four and seven millimeters. However other depths higher or lower than those specifically described are not beyond the scope of the invention.

The skin sensor D can be calibrated to measure both a pigmentation index as well as an erythema index. The pigmentation index would be incorporated in all measurements. The erythema index would allow the sensor to determine if the tissue being measured was traumatized or not. Different calibrations could be used in different circumstances. If the tissue being measured is traumatized the erythema index would be elevated and a hyperemic effect would be expected. If the erythema index is elevated and hyperemia is not present an alarm would be triggered for concern about poor perfusion. Control uninjured tissues could be recognized by lower erythema indices. The following are indices that can be used by the dermaspectrometer for measuring pigment red light only and erythema red green light 

If the skin layer is missing then the skin sensor D can be shut off while the light source continues to illuminate a tissue area of interest. This ability will be important in traumatized tissue or wounds since in many cases trauma results in loss of skin. When skin is missing the superficial recording will be turned off in order to account for lack of pigmentation and erythema. A separate calibration will be used in these cases where measurements are taken directly over tissue which does not have skin such as over muscle.

Additionally a sterile sensor with a sufficiently long sterilized cord will be required to allow for sterile technique to be maintained in an operating room setting. According to one exemplary embodiment the light source can be provided with at least two different light sources that illuminate in different optical wavelengths such as in the wavelengths for the color red and green. In this embodiment these two different light sources can be used to detect an erythema condition in which the skin layers may be red in color.

The sensor can be designed to account for different thickness or level of fat layers present in a particular patient. Sensors can be sized to measure different sized individuals. For example based on the circumference of a leg or extremity body part different size devices can be fabricated with different depths of tissue monitoring spread of light source and sensor in order to maximize the tissue sampling in a correct location. A large medium and small size can be designed to read tissues customized to different anatomic variations in different sized people. An ultrasound device can be incorporated into the sensor for monitoring and for determining fat depth. The ultrasound device and other devices in are illustrated with dashed lines to indicate that such hardware software may be optional for the sensor . Also any combinations of this hardware software can be included in the sensor without departing from the invention.

A pressure transducer can be incorporated into the sensor in order to determine if the dressings for a wound have been applied too tight. Additionally in trauma settings dressings are applied initially and swelling continues after the dressing application. If a pressure transducer determines increasing pressure on the tissue from external forces dressings splints casts an alarm can sound to warn the clinician. If external pressures increase while and oxygenation values decrease then the alarm will sound to release the dressing or loosen the restrictive dressing.

The sensors can be used to take multiple readings of similar areas of interest. Subcutaneous vessels can cause erroneous values. Subcutaneous vessel effects can be removed if single sensor is aberrant. Additionally in traumatized tissue readings can be difficult to obtain due to hematomas collections of blood . Each sensor may also account for small vessel abnormalities. A weighted average of values from the scans can be taken which should yield better sampling of tissue that is of interest. It should also allow for higher ability of obtaining a reading and maintaining a reading after placement since hematomas would have to block multiple sensors to lose a signal completely. Abnormally high or low values deviated by a predetermined value such as ten or more percentage points can be thrown out.

The sensor may further comprise a memory device . The memory device may comprise volatile or non volatile memory or a combination of both. The memory device can comprise any type of machine readable medium. Any machine readable medium can include but is not limited to floppy diskettes optical disks CD ROMs magneto optical disk ROMs RAMs EPROMs EEPROMs magnetic or optical cards flash memory or any other type of media machine readable medium suitable for storing records and or electronic instructions for a CPU A. The CPU A can run or execute programs for activating the various components of the sensor to take readings and storing them in the memory device . Alternatively the CPU A may comprise firmware and or hardwired circuitry without departing from the scope of the invention.

The CPU A may also be coupled to a wireless transceiver that uses an antenna . The wireless transceiver can employ any one of a number of wireless media such as radio frequency communications optical communications magnetic inductive communications acoustic communications and other like wireless media as described above in connection with . The wireless transceiver can relay the data produced and recorded by the sensor to a remote monitoring apparatus such as a monitor . Additionally the data could be sent via satellite or other means to a central monitoring station or even a clinicians phone pager or other mobile device for distance monitoring or access.

In this way the sensor may become a portable unit that can be used by the patient and or monitored by a medical practitioner located at a distance from the patient. With the memory device continuous data can be stored on the sensor without a need to record on a central device such as a processor and display unit . This ability to record data on the sensor will allow a sensor to couple with different remote monitors to allow continual data collection and display of the data. This feature will allow for interchangeability between sensors and remote monitors irrespective of their manufacturer. The data stored in the memory device may be provided with time stamps so that the data can be mapped over time.

Additionally interchangeability between different sensors for different functions such as a leg sensor or an arm sensor or a cerebral sensor and a tissue transfer sensor would be recognized by the system and a set series of alarms or readings would be recorded based on the sensor inserted into the monitor or coupled to the monitor in a wireless manner. Therefore the same monitor would be able to identify the type of sensor couple to the monitor . A single monitor could be compatible with multiple different sensors and display appropriate data and alarms based on the sensor collecting data about the tissue areas of interest.

The memory device may have a significant amount of capacity and it may allow for notes to be added to patient history. In addition to the reflectance values recorded by the optical receivers the memory device may be able to store other measured parameters taken by other sensors and or tests. For example the memory device may also store a patient s blood pressure temperature respiratory status rate supplemental oxygenation pulse oximetry values etc. over time. Further any lab work such as lactic acid levels CBC count and blood chemistry may be provided and stored in memory device .

The sensor can be incorporated into a wound dressing in order to monitor physiological conditions during transportation of injured subjects. This capability would be built into a dressing that can be attached to vacuum devices for management of extremity wound with gross contamination or skin loss.

Referring now to this Figure illustrates a linear array of compartment sensors assembled as a single mechanical unit that can provide scans at various depths A B C and D. The compartment sensors can be simultaneously activated to produce their scans of various depths at the same time when optical filters are used as will be described more fully below in connection with . Alternatively the sensors of the linear array can produce their scans of various depths by controlling a phase or timing of the activation of the sensors so that no two sensors are activated at the same time in order to reduce any potential of optical interference between the sensors . This phasing of the sensors can be controlled by the display and control unit of .

The first compartment sensor A can provide a first scan depth A that is shorter or more shallow than a second scan depth B produced by the second compartment sensor B. The scan depths can increase in this manner along its longitudinal axis which corresponds with its alignment mechanism so that the linear array matches the one or more depths of a single compartment of interest. As noted above in connection with the scan depth of a compartment sensor is function of the separation distance between the optical transmitter and optical receiver . For example a scan depth of a compartment sensor can be decreased as the optical receiver is moved closer along the body of the sensor towards the optical transmitter C.

One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that many of the compartments of the human body have various different geometries and resulting depths relative to the outside skin of a patient. For example the compartments of the lower human leg tend to have a greater depth or volume adjacent to the knee and generally taper or decrease in depth towards the ankle or foot. Therefore linear arrays of compartment sensors can be designed to have depths that match a particular geometry of a compartment of interest. To achieve these different scan depths each compartment sensor can have an optical transmitter and an optical receiver that is spaced or separated from each other by an appropriate distance to achieve the desired scan depth . If a compartment of interest has a substantially flat or linear depth relative to the skin surface of a patient the linear array can be designed such that each compartment sensor produces scans with uniform depths not illustrated to match a compartment with such a linear or flat geometry.

Like the single sensor embodiments described above in which are designed to measure individual compartments the compartment sensor array may comprise an alignment mechanism that can be positioned so that it corresponds with the longitudinal axis of a particular compartment. The compartment sensor array of is not provided with any central depth markers like those of the single sensor embodiments since the depth markers may not be needed by the medical practitioner since he or she will be assessing the entire length of a particular compartment with the entire compartment sensor array which is unlike that of the single sensor embodiments. Alternatively multiple crosshatches and numerical depths not illustrated can be positioned over each light source receptor set to locate where each measurement is obtained for identifying sites of a hematoma which will be described in more detail in connection with below. Additionally these positions could be used to locate appropriate amputation level for diabetics or peripheral vascular disease which is also described in more detail in connection with below.

Referring now to this figure illustrates a linear compartment sensor array that can include optical transmitters that are shared among pairs of light receptors . For example a single optical transmitter A can produce light rays A B that can be used by two optical receivers A A that are disposed at angles of one hundred eighty degrees relative to each other and the optical transmitter A along the longitudinal axis and alignment mechanism A of the compartment sensor array A. As described previously the light source and receptor separation can be varied to best match the topography of the compartment in the leg or other body part. Larger separation would allow for deeper sampling in the proximal leg versus more shallow depth closer to the ankle.

As discussed above in connection with the single sensor array of the sensors of each compartment sensor array illustrated in can be simultaneously activated to produce their scans at the same time when optical filters not illustrated in are used as will be described more fully below in connection with . Alternatively the sensors of each linear compartment sensor array can produce their scans by controlling a phase or timing of the activation of the sensors so that no two sensors are activated at the same time in order to reduce any potential for optical interference between the sensors . This phasing of the sensors can be controlled by the display and control unit of .

Like the single sensor embodiment illustrated in the compartment sensor array of can comprise an alignment mechanism for aligning the structure with the longitudinal axis of a compartment as well as a separation device A that can be used to divide the physical structure of the paired array A B into two separate linear compartment sensor arrays A B. The compartment sensor arrays of may also include labels and an expansion device like those of . The labels can be positioned on the front and back sides of each compartment sensor array . While the optical transmitters and receivers of are illustrated in functional block form it is noted that these elements as well as other numbered elements which correspond to the numbered elements of work similar to the embodiments described and illustrated in .

Referring now to this figure is a functional block diagram of compartment sensor that illustrates multiple optical receivers that may positioned on opposite sides of a single optical transmitter and that may be simultaneously activated to produce their scans at the same time. This exemplary embodiment can produce scans at the same time by using light with different wavelengths. Using light with different wavelengths can help reduce and substantially eliminate any optical interference that can occur between multiple light rays that may be received by the multiple optical receivers . While the optical receivers of are illustrated in functional block form it is noted that these receivers as well as other numbered elements which correspond to the elements of work similar to the embodiments described and illustrated in .

The two optical receivers A A of may be simultaneously activated when two optical filters A B having different wavelengths are used. The first optical filter A may have a first wavelength of lambda one 1 which is different than a second wavelength of lambda two 2 that is the wavelength of the second optical filter B. The optical transmitter can be designed to produce light having wavelengths of the first and second wavelengths which correspond with the first and second optical filters A B.

Light A with a first wavelength can be produced by the optical transmitter propagating its light through a first optical filter A that is designed to only let the first wavelength pass through it. Similarly Light B with a second wavelength can be produced by the optical transmitter propagating its light through a second optical filter B that is designed to only let the second wavelength pass through it. A third optical filter A corresponding with the first optical filter A can be designed to only pass the first wavelength such that the optical receiver A only detects light of the first wavelength. Similarly a fourth optical filter B corresponding with the second optical filter B can be designed to only pass the second wavelength such that the optical receiver A only detects light of the second wavelength.

In this way simultaneous different compartment scans can be produced at the same time with light having the first wavelength of lambda one 1 and light having the second wavelength of lambda two 2 in which the two optical receivers A and A share the same optical transmitter . This principal of optical receivers sharing the same optical transmitter is also illustrated in which provides the compartment sensor arrays discussed above. Specifically any optical transmitter optical receiver group that is positioned along a single alignment mechanism and longitudinal axis can be designed to have a unique wavelength relative to its neighbors along the same line. So this means that each optical transmitter optical receiver group of a particular compartment sensor array such as first array A can be designed to have unique wavelengths relative to each other for illuminating the same compartment. Meanwhile a neighboring compartment sensor array such as second array B may have the same wavelength arrangement as the first array A.

One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that each light optical transmitter and optical receiver design uses two separate wave lengths to solve for oxy hemoglobin and deoxy hemoglobin concentrations as illustrated in . Therefore the two optical wavelength design described for above may translate into four or more wavelengths for each optical transmitter and pair of optical receivers . The two wavelength design for was described above for simplicity and to illustrate how groups of optical transmitters and optical receivers can operate at different wavelengths relative to the groupings.

The invention is not limited to only two optical receivers that share the same optical transmitter . The invention could include embodiments where a single optical transmitter is shared by a plurality of optical receivers greater than two relative to the exemplary embodiment illustrated in .

Referring now to this figure illustrates a cross sectional view of a left sided human leg that has the four major compartments which can be measured by the compartment sensors according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. A first compartment B also noted with a Roman Numeral One of the lower human leg comprises the anterior compartment that is adjacent to the Tibia and Fibula . A first compartment sensor B is positioned adjacent to the anterior compartment B and provides a first oxygenation scan having a depth of B.

A second compartment A also noted with a Roman Numeral Two of the lower human leg comprises the lateral compartment that is adjacent to the Fibula . A second compartment sensor A is positioned adjacent to the lateral compartment A and provides a second oxygenation scan having a depth of A.

A third compartment D also noted with a Roman Numeral Three of the lower human leg comprises the superficial posterior compartment that is behind the Tibia and Fibula . A third compartment sensor D is positioned adjacent to the posterior compartment D and provides a third oxygenation scan having a depth of D.

A fourth compartment C also noted with a Roman Numeral Four of the lower human leg comprises the deep posterior compartment that is within a central region of the human leg . A fourth compartment sensor C is positioned adjacent to the deep posterior compartment C and provides a fourth oxygenation scan having a depth of C.

Referring now to this figure illustrates a cross sectional view of a right sided human leg and possible interference between light rays of simultaneous oxygenation scans made by the compartment sensors into respective compartments of interest according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. This figure illustrates how light rays produced by respective compartment sensors can interfere with one another. To resolve this potential problem the activation and hence production of light rays by the compartment sensors can be phased so that light rays produced by one compartment sensor A are not received and processed by a neighboring compartment sensor B C. When light is emitted from the compartment sensors through tissue the light does not travel in a straight line. It is reflected and spreads throughout the whole tissue. Therefore light interference or noise would be a significant concern for multiple light sources placed in close proximity to each other. Alternatively and as noted above each compartment sensor can produce optical wavelengths that are independent of one another in order to reduce any chances of optical interference.

Referring now to this figure illustrates a position of a compartment sensor C in relation to the knee for the deep posterior compartment C of a right sided human leg according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. As illustrated in discussed above the deep posterior compartment sensor C can be positioned such that the sensor C can directly sense the oxygenation levels of this compartment C without penetrating or going through another compartment. With respect to the deep posterior compartment C can be accessed by placing the sensor along the posteromedial aspect of the medial tibia. In other words palpation of the shin bone will allow the location of the tibia. The sensor should be placed just behind the bone on the inside of the leg along the longitudinal axis C of the compartment C not illustrated in this Figure . The compartment sensor C can be aligned with the longitudinal axis C of the deep posterior compartment C through using the alignment mechanism C. The compartment sensor C can positioned at any point along the longitudinal axis C. The location of this deep posterior compartment sensor C on the lower leg may be one inventive aspect of the technology since it allows a direct scan of the deep posterior compartment C.

Referring now to this figure illustrates an exemplary display of numeric oxygenation values as well as graphical plots for at least two compartments of an animal according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. The graphical plots can display the current instantaneous oxygenation level for each compartment as a point as well as historical data displayed as other points along a line that plots the history for a particular compartment sensor . In other words the X axis of the plots can denote time in any increments while the Y axis of the plots can denote oxygenation levels monitored by a particular sensor .

While only two plots are illustrated multiple plots can be displayed for each respective sensor . In compartment sensor array deployments the graphical plot can represent an average of oxygenation levels measured by the multiple sensors of a particular linear compartment sensor array . The display device can include controls that allow for the selection of one or more compartment sensors or one or more compartment sensor arrays for displaying on the display device . The display of historical oxygenation levels of a compartment over time through the plots is a significant improvement over conventional methods of direct pressure readings of compartments which usually would only allow periodic measurements of compartments on the order of every fifteen or thirty minutes compared to minutes or seconds now measured with the compartment sensors described in this document.

Referring now to this figure illustrates single compartment sensors with alignment mechanisms and central scan depth markers that can be used to properly orient each sensor with a longitudinal axis of a compartment of an animal body according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. While the longitudinal axis of a compartment shown with broken lines cannot actually be seen on the external surface of a lower human leg by a medical practitioner a medical practitioner can envision this invisible axis based on the anatomy of the leg such as looking at the knee and comparing its orientation with the ankle and foot of the leg . As described above the compartment extends from the knee to ankle and the sensor can be placed over a portion or all of the compartment being measured. With these single compartment sensor embodiments each sensor can be positioned along the length of the longitudinal axis to obtain an oxygenation level for a particular compartment of interest.

Referring now to this figure illustrates compartment sensor arrays with alignment mechanisms that can be used to properly orient each array with a longitudinal axis of a compartment of an animal body according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. Since compartment sensor arrays will typically occupy close to the entire length of any given longitudinal axis of a compartment of interest the individual sensors of the compartment sensor array are usually not provided with central scan depth markers . In the sensor array embodiments the arrays are usually provided only with the alignment mechanism . However the central scan depth markers could be provided if desired for a particular application or medical practitioner or both .

Referring now to this Figure illustrates various locations for single compartment sensors that can be positioned on a front side of animal body such as a human to measure oxygenation levels of various compartments according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. illustrates that the invention is not limited to compartment sensors that only measure lower legs of the human body. The compartment sensors can measure various different compartments such as but not limited to compartments of the arm thighs and abdomen.

Referring now to this Figure illustrates various locations for single compartment sensors that can be positioned on a rear side of animal body such as a human to measure oxygenation levels of various compartments according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. Similar to above the compartment sensors shown in this Figure can measure various different compartments such as but not limited to compartments of the arm thighs and abdomen. Also while grouped compartment sensors that are coupled together with expansion devices are not illustrated here such as those described in connection with FIG. A above one of ordinary skill recognizes that such grouped compartment sensors can be substituted anywhere were the single compartment sensors are shown.

Referring now to this Figure illustrates various locations for compartment sensor arrays that can be positioned over compartments on a front side of an animal body such as a human to measure oxygenation levels of the various compartments according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. Like the single compartment sensor embodiments of described above the compartment sensor arrays can measure various different compartments such as but not limited to compartments of the arm thighs and abdomen.

Referring now to this Figure illustrates various locations for compartment sensor arrays that can be positioned over compartments on a rear side of an animal body such as a human to measure oxygenations levels of the various compartments according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. Also while grouped compartment sensor arrays that are coupled together with expansion devices are not illustrated here such as those described in connection with above one of ordinary skill recognizes that such grouped compartment sensor arrays can be substituted anywhere were the individual compartment array sensors are shown.

Referring now to this Figure illustrates an exemplary display and controls for the display device that lists data for eight single compartment sensors according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. The eight single compartment sensors may be monitoring compartments of two limbs of an animal such as two lower legs of a human patient. One limb is usually uninjured while the other limb is typically injured though the system is not limited to unilateral injuries.

The display may provide up to eight different plots or graphs A A A B B B B B of data that are taken from the eight different sensors or sensor arrays . The first pair of right and left leg sensors may monitor the anterior compartment B of which is displayed with the letter A for the first row of data. The second pair of right and left leg sensors may monitor the lateral compartment A of which is displayed with the letter L for the second row of data. The third pair of right and left leg sensors may monitor the deep posterior compartment C which is displayed with the letters DP for the third row of data. The first pair of right and left leg sensors may monitor the superficial posterior compartment D which is displayed with the letters SP for the fourth row of data.

The display may also provide a measure of a difference in oxygenation levels between the injured limb or region and the uninjured limb or region. This difference may be displayed by listing the two oxygenation levels of each respective limb separated by a slash line. Underneath the two oxygenation levels for a respective pair of sensors for the injured and uninjured limbs a value which is the difference between the oxygenation levels displayed above it may be listed. For example for the first oxygenation difference value of A the oxygenation level for the right leg sensor is the value of forty four while the value for the left leg sensor is the value of sixty five. In this exemplary embodiment the right leg is injured while the left leg is uninjured. The difference value displayed under the two oxygenation levels for the first data set A is twenty one.

Initial data from patients with extremity injuries measured by the inventor have shown that muscular skeletal injuries cause hyperemia increased blood flow and oxygen in the injured extremity. If a compartment syndrome develops the oxygenation drops from an elevated state to an equal and then lower level with comparison to the uninjured limb. Therefore when comparing injured and uninjured extremities the injured limb should show increased oxygenation levels. If levels begin to drop in the injured limb compared to the uninjured limb an alarm or alert can be triggered to warn the medical practitioner. This alarm can be visual or audible or both .

With the display a medical practitioner can modify how data is displayed by pressing the mode button on the display which may comprise a touch screen type of display . The mode button permits the medical practitioner to change the display of the screen. This function would allow for selection between multiple different settings to allow for data downloading changing the time frame for which data is displayed etc. With the time mark button the medical practitioner can mark or flag certain data points being measured for later review. With the select button the medical practitioner can select between the multiple options that can be accessed through the mode button.

While the above description of mentioned that eight single compartment sensors produced the data of the display of the single compartment sensors can be easily substituted by compartment sensor arrays . In such a scenario in which compartment sensor arrays are used to produce the data of display the displayed values can be an average of the values taken from a given array . This average can be calculated by the processor of the display device .

Referring now to this Figure illustrates an exemplary display of providing users with guidance for properly orienting a single compartment sensor over a compartment of an animal such as a human leg according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. The display can be generated by display device so that a medical practitioner is provided with instructions and graphical information on how to mount and operate the compartment sensors of the system. The display may provide an illustration of the body part having the compartment of interest. In the exemplary embodiment of the compartment of interest is located within the lower human leg .

An illustration of the lower human leg is provided in display . On the body part having the compartment of interest the display device can identify the longitudinal axis by marking or flagging this axis with a text box label . The display can also identify an illustration of the compartment sensor A by marking or flagging this illustration with another text box label . The display can also identify a general region for a compartment of interest by encapsulating the region with a geometric outline such as an ellipse and marking this ellipse with another text box label .

The display can also include a miniaturized view of a cross section of the compartment of interest similar to the views illustrated in for this exemplary embodiment that is assessing a lower leg compartment . The display may also allow the user to expand the cross sectional view of the compartment of interest by allowing the user to double click or touch the actual display of the cross section. Multiple sections including an axial coronal and or sagittal view may be included in the on screen instructions for placement. Upon such action by the user the display device may enlarge the cross sectional view to a size comparable or equivalent to that illustrated in . Once the medical practitioner has positioned the sensor on the patient over the desired compartment of interest the display can be refreshed to include the next compartment of interest.

Referring now to this Figure illustrates a front view of lower limbs such as two lower legs of a human body that are being monitored by four compartment sensor arrays according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. The four sensor arrays can be positioned along compartments of interest by orienting the alignment mechanism along the longitudinal axis of a respective compartment. Multiple central scan depth markers and numerical depths not illustrated in can be positioned over each light source receptor set of a sensor array to locate where each measurement is obtained for identifying sites of a hematoma which will be described in more detail in connection with below.

Referring now to this Figure illustrates a display of the display device that can be used to monitor hematomas and or blood flow according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. The display can include an average oxygenation level of thirty six at an instant of time that is determined from the two compartment sensor arrays A B of a patient s right leg A which is injured in this exemplary case. Meanwhile the display can also include an average oxygenation level of fifty three at the same instant of time that is determined from the two compartment sensor arrays A B of a patient s left leg B which is uninjured in this exemplary case.

The display can also provide oxygenation values that it is receiving from each of the individual sensors in a first sensor array not illustrated. For the injured right leg A illustrated in the display the oxygenation levels vary between thirty two and forty four. However in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in there are three individual sensors not illustrated in this Figure of the sensor array A that are not producing any oxygenation values which have been provided with the letter H to denote a possible hematoma. For the uninjured leg B the individual compartment sensors not illustrated of the two sensor arrays A B have provided oxygenation levels that range between 50 and 54 which are believed to be in the normal range for normal blood flow. Also While individual sensors that are not illustrated here such as those described in connection with above one of ordinary skill recognizes that such individual compartment sensors can be substituted anywhere were the compartment array sensors are shown.

Referring now to this Figure illustrates a display of the display device for an instant of time after the display of and which can be used to monitor hematomas and or blood flow according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. The display illustrates that the hematoma or absence of healthy blood flow condition being tracked by sensor arrays A B of is expanding. The display can include a warning message such as WARNING HEMATOMA EXPANDING to alert the medical practitioner of the changing conditions of the compartments of interest in the injured or traumatized area. In the average oxygenation level of the injured leg A decreased in value from thirty six to twenty four. Further the number of individual sensors not illustrated but values shown detecting a hematoma or lack of healthy blood flow condition increased from two sensors detecting the condition in to seven sensors detecting the condition in as indicated by the H values on display . Meanwhile the average oxygenation level of the uninjured left leg B changed slightly from fifty three to fifty two.

With the display that provides the compartment sensors with H values in combination with the central scan depth markers provided on the sensor arrays the medical practitioner can easily locate the physical sites on the leg that contain the hematoma or lack of healthy blood flow. These positions can also be used by the medical practitioner to locate appropriate amputation level for diabetics or peripheral vascular disease since peripheral vascular disease is typically worse distally closer to the toes and gradually improves closer to the knee. The compartment sensor or more specifically the array system can be used to aid a clinician or surgeon in determining the level of amputation for peripheral vascular disease and or diabetes mellitus. By obtaining multiple readings at different levels from the knee to the ankle the surgeon can determine the appropriate level for amputation. The level of amputation is important since if the tissue is not well perfused the surgical wound will not heal and require revision surgery and more of the patient s leg must be removed.

Referring now to this Figure illustrates a sensor design for measuring the optical density of skin according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. The depth of tissue measurement using NIRS is based on separation of the optical transmitter and the optical receiver see . In order to obtain readings of only the skin very shallow depths the separation between the optical transmitter and optical receiver would have to be very small and which may not be feasible. In this exemplary embodiment the sensor can comprise a material of known optical density that can be positioned between the substrate and the skin . In this way the light mean paths A B will only penetrate upper layers of the leg such as the skin layers . The thickness of the known material can be varied to adjust for different desired scan depths made by the light mean paths A B. Since the optical density of the material is known then any near infrared light absorption will be attributable to the layers of tissue of interest. And in this case the optical density of the skin can be determined. According to a further exemplary embodiment one of the photoreceptors A B can be removed from the optical receiver in order to decrease the depth of the scan. For example if the second photoreceptor A was removed the depth of the scan would only extend as deep as the light mean path B for the photoreceptor B.

The inventor has recognized that skin pigmentation can affect the oxygenation values of a patient that uses near infrared compartment sensors . This effect on oxygenation levels is also acknowledged in the art. See an article published by Wassenar et al. in 2005 on near infrared system NIRS values. As with solar light skin pigmentation caused by the biochemical melanin is a major factor in light absorption. In the inventor s research skin pigmentation has been demonstrated to be a significant factor in measuring oxygenation levels among patients. The inventor has discovered that there was approximately a ten point difference when comparing low pigmentation subjects Caucasians Hispanics Asians with higher pigmented subjects African American . The pigmented subjects had average scores of approximately ten points lower when compared to non pigmented subjects. See Table 1 below that lists data on the difference between measured oxygenation levels of uninjured patients due to skin pigmentation.

The p value can be described as the chance that these findings were due to chance alone. In all four compartments the chance of finding the difference 9 14 in average value between the two groups dark and white was less than 0.01 or less than 1 out of 10 000. In other words the likelihood of these findings occurring by chance alone is very unlikely. By convention statistically significant findings are considered to be less than 5 or a p value of 

Conventional studies Wassenar et al. 2005 and Kim et al. 2000 have showed that when subjects increase their activity dark pigmented people tend to have higher rates of loss of signal.

There have been no attempts as of this writing to account for skin pigmentation or optical density in oxygenation levels detected with sensors like the compartment sensor discussed above. Therefore the design illustrated in have been developed by the inventor to account for pigmentation optical density. With the embodiments of skin pigmentation influences can be calibrated and accounted for when measuring oxygenation levels with sensors that use near infrared light absorption principles. In this way true or more accurate oxygenation levels of subcutaneous tissue such as muscle cerebral matter or organ tissue may be obtained. This calibration or pigmentation accounting would also allow for comparison of values between different patients since each individual will likely have different skin pigmentation values.

Referring now to this Figure illustrates a sensor that can penetrate two layers of skin A B to obtain optical density values according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. The distance D between the optical transmitter and optical receiver can be predetermined based on the scan depth A that is desired.

Referring now to this Figure illustrates a sensor that can penetrate one layer of skin A according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. This figure demonstrates how the depth of measurement for oxygenation levels using the sensors that operate according to near infrared light absorption principles is usually directly proportional to the optical transmitter and optical receiver separation distance D. In the separation distance D is smaller than that of the separation distance D of . Accordingly the central scan depth B of is also shorter than the central scan depth A of .

According to one exemplary embodiment of the invention the separation D and D between the optical transmitter and optical receiver can range between approximately five millimeters to two centimeters. This separation distance D can be optimized to obtain an accurate reading of only the skin in the particular area of interest. One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that skin is not a constant depth or thickness throughout a human body. Therefore the depth of the scan of a sensor for which it is designed ie. the leg for compartment syndromes may preferably be designed to vary to obtain an accurate optical density value for skin in that specific body location.

Referring now to this figure illustrates a modified compartment monitoring system that can correlate skin pigmentation values with skin optical density values in order to provide offset values for oxygenation levels derived from near infrared light absorption principles across different subjects who have different skin pigmentation according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. The system can comprise a central processing unit of the display device or any general purpose computer. The CPU of the display device can be coupled to a compartment sensor that has been modified to include a skin pigment sensor .

The skin pigment sensor may be provided with a known reflectance and that can be used to calibrate the compartment sensor based on relative reflectance of skin pigment which can affect data generated from oxygenation scans. For example the skin sensor can comprise a narrow band simple reflectance device a tristimulus colorimetric device or scanning reflectance spectrophotometer. Conventional skin sensors available as of this writing include mexameter 18 CK electronic Koln Germany chromameters and DermaSpectrometers. Other devices appropriate and well suited for the skin sensor are found in U.S. Pat. No. 6 070 092 issued in the name of Kazama et al U.S. Pat. No. 6 308 088 issued in the name of MacFarlane et al and U.S. Pat. No. 7 221 970 issued in the name of Parker the entire contents of these patents are hereby incorporated by reference.

The skin sensor can determine a standardized value for skin pigmentation of a patient by evaluating the melanin and hemoglobin in the patient s skin. Once the skin melanin or pigment value is determined it can be correlated to its calculated absorption or reflectance effect on the oxygenation levels using a predetermined calibration system such as the skin pigment table illustrated in . From the skin pigment table the CPU can identify or calculate an oxygenation offset value that can be incorporated in tissue hemoglobin concentration calculations for deep tissue oxygenation scans. Accounting for skin pigmentation will usually allow for information or values to be compared across different subjects with different skin pigmentation as well as using the number as an absolute value instead of monitoring simple changes in value over time.

Referring now to this figure is a functional block diagram of the major components of a compartment or oxygenation monitoring system that can monitor a relationship between blood pressure and oxygenation values according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. The compartment monitoring system can include a CPU A of a display device B that is coupled to compartment sensors a blood pressure probe and a blood pressure monitor . The CPU A may also be coupled to a voice synthesizer and a speaker for providing status information and alarms to a medical practitioner.

The CPU A can receive data from the blood pressure monitor in order to correlate oxygenation levels with blood pressure. The CPU A can activate an alarm such as an audible or visual alarm or both with the voice synthesizer and speaker or displaying a warning message on the display device B when the diastolic pressure of a patient drops. It has been discovered by the inventor that perfusion can be significantly lowered or stopped at low diastolic pressures and when compartment pressures are greater than the diastolic pressure. According to one exemplary embodiment in addition to activating an alarm the CPU A of the compartment monitoring system can increase a frequency of data collection for oxygenation levels and or blood pressure readings when a low blood pressure condition is detected by the oxygenation sensing system .

Referring now to this figure is an exemplary display that can be provided on the display device and which provides current blood pressure values and oxygenation levels of a compartment of interest according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. Display can be accessed by activation of the mode switch of .

In addition to displaying current blood pressure values and oxygenation levels the display can further include graphs that plot a blood pressure curve and an oxygenation level curve . The blood pressure curve can represent blood pressure data taken over time that is plotted against the time axis X axis and the blood pressure axis first Y axis values . The oxygenation level curve can represent oxygenation levels taken over time that is plotted against the time axis X axis and the oxygenation level axis second Y axis values .

In this way the relationship between blood pressure and potential compartment pressure based on the oxygenation levels can be directly tracked and monitored by a medical practitioner. As noted above it has been discovered by the inventor that perfusion can be significantly lowered or stopped at low diastolic pressures and when compartment pressures are greater than the diastolic pressure. So when the blood pressure of a patient starts to drop and if the oxygenation levels of a compartment being tracked also start to drop the CPU A can sound an audible alarm and display a warning message to the medical practitioner to alert him or her of this changing condition. This correlation between hemoglobin concentration oxygenation levels and diastolic pressure can be used to estimate intra compartmental pressures without having to use invasive conventional needle measurements.

Additionally a running average of oxygenation values over a certain time period can be calculated and displayed. The time period could be altered by the m between multiple time periods from seconds to minutes to even hours. The purpose of the running average would be to limit the amount of variability of the oxygenation values displayed on the screen. The current instantaneous value that is displayed in existing models is very labile. By using a running average the trends can be monitored and the instantaneous changes can be smoothed out. This ability to decrease volatility would be important to prevent continual alert triggering if an alarm value was set by the medical practitioner.

In addition with blood pressure input as described above the diastolic systolic and or mean arterial pressure MAP can be displayed not illustrated against time on the same graph. Using the two data series of oxygenation and diastolic blood pressure an estimate of perfusion pressure diastolic pressure minus intra compartmental pressure can also be estimated by the CPU A.

Referring now to this figure is a functional block diagram that illustrates material options for a compartment sensor according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. Functional block indicates that the structure of the compartment sensor can be made with sterile materials. For example the substrate not illustrated of the sensor may be made of anyone or combination of the following materials various polymers such as the polyurethanes polyethylenes polyesters and polyethers or the like may be used. Alternatively each compartment sensor can be made with a sterile coating that encapsulates the compartment sensor . The sterile coating can be applied during manufacturing of the sensor or it can be applied after manufacturing and provided as a container or sealable volume. Additionally once the unit is constructed and finished the device can be sterilized using one or more off multiple processes including but not limited to chemical heat gas or irradiation sterilization.

Referring now to this figure illustrates an exemplary clinical environment of a compartment sensor where the sensor can be positioned within or between a dressing and the skin of a patient according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. Since the inventive compartment sensor can be made with or enclosed by sterile materials as noted in above the compartment sensor or an sensor array can be positioned between a dressing and a skin layer of a patient intra operatively. In this way a medical practitioner can monitor a compartment of interest without the need to remove the dressing or adjust the position of the compartment sensor .

In 2007 a 44 year old Caucasian male fell 20 feet sustaining an isolated closed proximal tibia fracture with extension into the knee. Initial treatment included external fixation for stabilization on the day of injury. During surgery the compartments were firm but compressible. At post operative check revealed that the compartments were more firm. There was mild pain with passive stretch though the patient was diffusely painful throughout both lower extremities. Intra compartmental pressures were measured for all four compartments using a conventional needle method with a Striker device Stryker Surgical Kalamazoo Mich. . The anterior and lateral pressures measured 50 mm Hg and the superficial and deep posterior compartments were 48 mm Hg. The diastolic pressure was 90 mm Hg resulting in a 40 mm Hg perfusion pressure.

Tissue oxygenation StO or oxygenation levels were evaluated using two compartment sensors . The oxygenation levels were approximately 80 in all four compartments. The compartment sensors were placed on the lateral and deep posterior compartments for continual monitoring which maintained oxygenation values near 80 . Higher percentage oxygenation levels indicate more perfusion and higher oxy hemoglobin concentrations.

All clinical decisions were based of the clinical symptoms and pressure measurements and not on the oxygenation levels. Two hours passed and compartment pressures were repeated. The anterior and lateral compartments remained at 50 mm Hg. The superficial and deep posterior compartments rose to 50 mm Hg as well. The patient s diastolic pressure remained at 90 mm Hg maintaining 40 mm Hg of perfusion pressure. The oxygenation values remained near 80 for both the lateral and deep posterior compartments. Clinical symptoms were monitored closely throughout the night.

Approximately 24 hours after the initial injury the patient became more symptomatic and began requiring more pain medication. Intra compartmental measurements were repeated. The anterior and lateral compartments remained at 51 mm Hg. The superficial and deep posterior compartments measured 61 mm Hg and 63 mm Hg respectively. However the diastolic pressure dropped to 74 mm Hg decreasing the perfusion pressure to 11 mm Hg. Based on the pressure measurements and clinical symptoms the patient underwent fasciotomy and was found to have no gross evidence of muscle necrosis or neuromuscular sequelae at late follow up.

Throughout the monitoring period the lateral compartment maintained an oxygenation level of approximately 80 . The oxygenation levels in the deep posterior compartment began in the eighties and started to drop approximately three hours after the second compartment pressure measurement. At time of fasciotomy the oxygenation level for the deep posterior compartment was 58 . The gradual decline in muscle oxygenation mirrored the decrease in perfusion pressure over an extended period of time.

This first case suggests that the compartment sensors can be used to continually monitor an injured extremity. Initially the patient had elevated intra compartmental pressures but the perfusion pressure was greater than 30 mm Hg. The ensuing increase in clinical symptoms and decrease in perfusion pressure correlated with the gradual decrease in oxygenation levels. Impaired perfusion was reflected in a decline in the oxygenation levels. These results are consistent with a previous study by Garr et al. who showed a strong correlation between oxygenation levels and perfusion pressures in a pig model. This case also demonstrates the ability of compartment sensors to differentiate between compartments in the leg since the oxygenation levels in the lateral compartment remained elevated while the deep posterior values declined.

Also in 2007 a 32 year old Hispanic male sustained an isolated closed Schatzker VI tibial plateau fracture after falling from a scaffold. On initial evaluation the patient had tight compartments but there were no clinical symptoms of compartment syndrome. Active and passive range of motion resulted in no significant pain. Based on the concerns for the tense leg intra compartmental pressure measurements were obtained using a Stryker device.

All compartments were greater than 110 mm Hg. The patient s blood pressure was 170 112 mm Hg. The decision to perform a four compartment fasciotomy was made. The compartment sensors were placed on the deep posterior compartment as well as the lateral compartment for continual monitoring. The lateral compartment was unable to give a consistent reading due to hematoma interference. The initial reading for the deep posterior was an oxygenation level of 65 . The deep posterior tissue oxygenation level steadily declined from 65 to 55 over the hour of preoperative preparation.

Upon intubation a sharp drop in the oxygenation levels from 55 to 43 was observed. The anesthesia record showed a concomitant drop in blood pressure at the time of induction from 171 120 mm Hg to 90 51 mm Hg. The patient underwent an uneventful fasciotomy and external fixation. Tissue examination showed no gross signs of muscle necrosis and at nine months follow up there were no signs of sequelea. The oxygenation level monitoring of the compartment was acutely responsive and showed real time changes to a decline in perfusion pressure in an injured extremity.

The responsiveness of the compartment sensors to intra compartmental perfusion pressure is demonstrated by this second case study. This patient was initially asymptomatic even though his compartments were over 110 mm Hg in all compartments. The oxygenation levels from the compartment sensors were able to detect gradual perfusion declines over the hour prior to fasciotomy. Prior to induction of anesthesia the patient was able to maintain some tissue oxygenation by maintaining a high diastolic blood pressure. Once the patient was anesthetized during intubation the diastolic pressure was significantly reduced. The oxygenation levels of the compartments dropped within thirty seconds of induction because the slight perfusion gradient was completely abolished by the induced hypotension.

In 2007 a 62 year old Asian male suffered a closed midshaft tibia fracture in a motor vehicle crash. The patient was unresponsive and hypotensive at the scene of the accident and intubated prior to arrival. Upon presentation the patient was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 90 55 mm Hg. The injured leg was clinically tight on examination.

Oxygenation levels were measured for all four compartments. The oxygenation levels were approximately at 50 for the anterior and lateral compartments while the two posterior compartments were approximately at 80 . The compartment sensors were placed on the anterior and superficial posterior compartments for continued monitoring. Intra compartmental pressures were measured at 50 mm Hg and 52 mm Hg in the anterior and lateral compartments respectively using the conventional Striker device needle pressure measuring method . The superficial and deep compartment pressures were 19 mm Hg and 20 mm Hg respectively. After the patient was stabilized by the trauma team he underwent fasciotomy. There were no gross signs of muscle necrosis and no complications at 7 months follow up. Muscle oxygenation was able to differentiate between compartments with hypoperfusion and adequate perfusion in a hypotensive and intubated patient.

This third case is evidence that the compartment sensors are useful in assessing established or existing compartment syndromes. The compartment sensors can provide useful information in patients that are unable to give feedback during a clinical examination such as this patient who was intubated and hypotensive upon examination. These findings correlate with the findings by Arbabi et al. who demonstrated oxygenation levels to be responsive in hypotensive and hypoxic pigs in a laboratory setting. The compartment sensors can distinguish between different compartments and their respective perfusions. Clinically in this case the whole leg was tense but intra compartmental pressures were only elevated in the anterior and lateral compartments. The oxygenation levels measured by the compartment sensors were proportional to the perfusion pressure with low values in the anterior and lateral compartments but elevated values in the two posterior compartments.

These three cases suggest that compartment sensors are responsive and proportional to perfusion pressures within the injured extremity. These findings support previous studies documenting the importance of perfusion pressure and not an absolute value in the diagnosis of compartment syndrome. The compartment sensors can distinguish between compartments and is useful in the unresponsive intubated and hypotensive patient. Lastly the compartment sensors have the potential to offer a continual noninvasive and real time monitoring system that is sensitive in the early compartment syndrome setting. In all three cases a difference in oxygenation levels was demonstrated prior to any irreversible tissue injury.

A 60 year old Middle Eastern male was shot in the right thigh. Initially the thigh was swollen but the patient was comfortable. After approximately 12 hours after the initial injury the patient began to complain of increasing pain and required more pain medication. The thigh was more tense upon clinical exam. The patient was taken to the OR for fracture fixation and potential fasciotomy of the thigh.

NIRS sensors were placed on the anterior posterior and medial adductors compartments of the thigh. Values for the injured side were similar or decrease when compared to the uninjured side. As previously described injured tissue should show increased values due to hyperemia. The injured side anterior posterior and medial values were 54 53 and 63 respectively. The uninjured values for the anterior posterior and medial were 51 55 and 63 respectively.

The compartment pressures were measured in all three compartments. The intra compartmental pressures for the anterior posterior and adductors were 44 59 and 30 respectively. Once the patient was induced for anesthesia and the patient s blood pressure dropped from 159 90 to 90 61 the patients NIRS values dropped within in 30 seconds of the his blood pressure drop. Once the blood pressure was dropped and the perfusion pressure was eliminated the new values for the anterior posterior and medial compartments were 29 40 and 35.

A study was conducted to determine the sensitivity and responsiveness of the inventive compartment monitoring system . Specifically the purpose of the study was to evaluate the invention over the anterior compartment with a cuff around the thigh at different pressures simulating a compartment Syndrome to show responsiveness to increasing pressures in the leg.

The inventor s hypothesis was that the inventive compartment monitoring system will show normal oxygenation at levels below pressures equivalent to compartment syndrome. Once pressures become equal to the diastolic blood pressure it was believed the inventive system would show significant deoxygenation because the capillary perfusion pressure will be passed. Continued monitoring will be obtained until a plateau or nadir is obtained.

It was confirmed that the compartment monitoring system is sensitive to changing pressures. A correlation with decreased perfusion was discovered once the pressure approaches diastolic pressure. The inventive system does not reflect complete vascular compromise until tourniquet pressure supersedes systolic blood pressure because of venous congestion. These findings are consistent with previously described studies.

A significant difference is observed once tourniquet pressure equals the diastolic pressure Perfusion pressure of zero . The venous congestion phenomenon which has been described with the tourniquet model for compartment syndromes maintains some flow until cuff pressure is raised to above systolic pressure no flow . Venous congestion is the phenomenon when the higher systolic blood pressure is able to overcome the tourniquet pressure applied to the leg during that burst of pressure created by the heart s contraction when the tourniquet compression is above diastolic pressure but below systolic pressure.

Referring now to this figure is a graph of perfusion pressure plotted against oxygenation levels O of the study conducted to determine the sensitivity and responsiveness of the inventive compartment monitoring system . The section between points A and B show the combined points of all subjects studied during the study when the tourniquet pressure was below the diastolic pressure. As shown in the graph the grouping is mostly flat and does not show any decrease as the tourniquet pressure is increased. After point B between point B and C the tourniquet pressure is above the diastolic pressure and the perfusion pressure becomes zero or negative. During this section of the graph there is a significant drop in muscle oxygenation. The data points in use the actual compartment monitoring values which as described above can vary based on skin pigmentation. Therefore there is a wider range of values in oxygenation numbers and a wider spread of data points. See APPENDIX B for the raw data that supports this graph .

Referring now to this figure is a graph of perfusion pressure plotted against a change in the oxygenation levels O from a baseline for each subject of the study conducted to determine the sensitivity and responsiveness of the inventive compartment monitoring system .

In the the change from baseline was used instead of the absolute number presented by the compartment sensor. The effects of pigment were removed when change from baseline values was used. Baseline was defined as the value before the tourniquet was placed. The spread between data points is much less. As shown again between points A and B there is a very small and gradual decrease in tissue oxygenation until point B moving from high perfusion pressures to lower perfusion pressures or from right to left . Once the perfusion pressure becomes zero or negative the change from baseline was much larger and more rapid. Both graphs show how the tissue oxygenation is highly sensitive to perfusion pressure and the critical point is when the perfusion pressure changes from positive to negative. As described above the diagnosis of compartment syndrome is based on the perfusion pressure diastolic pressure minus compartment pressure . Therefore the compartment monitoring system has the capability to show real time changes in perfusion prior to any irreversible tissue damage. See APPENDIX B for the raw data that supports this graph .

This study supports the theory that oxygenation levels measure with the compartment sensors decrease as perfusion pressure also decreases Perfusion pressure diastolic cuff pressure . The study also indicates that there are no significant changes in measured oxygenation levels until there is increase above the diastolic pressure. The findings of this study as illustrated in correlate with previous studies using other determinants of flow Xenon clearance Clayton 1977 Dahn 1967 Heppenstall 1986 Matava 1994 .

Based on the clinical evaluation in established acute compartment syndrome patients the diagnosis of compartment syndrome was made. Its purpose was to evaluate the ability of the inventive compartment monitoring system to detect hypoperfusion in the different compartments of the lower leg. This evaluation was made to demonstrate the invention s sensitivity to increased pressures versus uninjured legs.

There will be a significant difference between the injured and uninjured values of the compartment monitoring system . There will also be an inverse relationship between compartment pressures and measured oxygenation levels by the sensors . In other words the oxygenation values would be directly proportional to perfusion pressures.

Oxygenation levels and pressure measurements for each compartment in established compartment syndromes were obtained. Readings for both legs were compared for each compartment.

Hyperemia increased oxygenation levels for fractures without any compartment syndrome symptoms has been demonstrated by the inventors studies Table 3 and 4 . In early compartment syndromes the oxygenation values were equal between the two different legs. Once the compartment syndrome became advanced and the perfusion pressure was decreased or eliminated the oxygenation values in the injured leg dropped below the uninjured leg. There was some difficulty in obtaining oxygenation levels over a hematoma. Therefore when oxygenation values between the two legs become equal there should be concern for a compartment syndrome and fasciotomy should be considered. Once the injured levels drop below the uninjured leg a fasciotomy should be performed.

Oxygenation levels are extremely responsive to changes in perfusion in regards to pressure changes. Compartment sensors can differentiate between compartments. Oxygenation levels can work and are accurate in intubated patients. Oxygenation levels do respond over extended time periods and over very short periods of time and rapid changes in intra compartmental pressures.

Oxygenation levels and hyperemia are maintained at least two to three days post injury or surgery. Post operative values are also high in the operated on leg 69 72 Standard deviation of 9 12 with an average difference of 15 17 . The compartment sensors work as a noninvasive tool. Oxygenation levels can be monitored by sensors over extended periods of time. Compartment sensors do respond to changes in perfusion both gradual and sudden. The sensors can differentiate between different compartments.

A study of fracture hyperemia with the inventive compartment monitoring system was made. The purpose of this study was to examine non compartment syndrome patients with fractures of the lower leg.

The injured leg will show a hyperemic response to injury and have elevated blood flow causing an increase in oxygenation values.

Compare uninjured leg to injured leg to see if there is a statistical and reproducible increase at time of injury. The data is important to describe normal fracture response to compare with compartment syndrome response.

Patients have approximately 15 pts higher on the injured side compared to the uninjured side. Time of measurement was approximately 16 hours post injury range 2.52 .

In normal lower leg fracture situations without vascular injury or compartment syndrome comparison between injured and uninjured legs show that the injured leg should be significantly higher with and average elevation of between 14 and 17 points. This finding is consistent with the hyperemia associated with injury. This effect is a long lasting effect that lasts over 48 hours after injury and surgery as seen by these results. The p value can be described as the chance that these findings were due to chance alone. In all four compartments the chance of finding the difference 14 17 in average value between the two groups injured and uninjured was less than 0.01 or less than 1 out of 10 000. In other words the likelihood of these findings occurring by chance alone is very unlikely. By convention statistically significant findings are considered to be less than 5 or a p value of 

The p value can be described as the chance that these findings were due to chance alone. In all four compartments the chance of finding the difference 15 17 in average value between the two groups injured and uninjured was less than 0.01 or less than 1 out of 10 000. In other words the likelihood of these findings occurring by chance alone is very unlikely. By convention statistically significant findings are considered to be less than 5 or a p value of 

These findings are important for two different reasons. First the difference between the two legs was very small on average between 1 or 2 points . Therefore the other findings that show significant differences between legs cannot be explained as normal variance. Uninjured patients have oxygenation values between the two legs that are typically very similar within 1 5 points of each other . Second normal oxygenation values for uninjured subjects were in the high 50 s. This value varied based on pigmentation of the skin as showed above. See APPENDIX A for the raw data that supports this data.

Referring now to this figure is logic flow diagram illustrating an exemplary method for monitoring oxygenation levels of a compartment according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. The processes and operations of the inventive compartment monitoring system described below with respect to the logic flow diagram may include the manipulation of signals by a processor and the maintenance of these signals within data structures resident in one or more memory storage devices. For the purposes of this discussion a process can be generally conceived to be a sequence of computer executed steps leading to a desired result.

These steps usually require physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical magnetic or optical signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared or otherwise manipulated.

Referring again to Step is the first step in the process for monitoring oxygenation levels of a compartment according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. In step a compartment sensor may be manufactured from sterile materials as described above in connection with . Alternatively a compartment sensor can be encapsulated with sterile materials so that it can be used in a surgical environment or so that it can be place adjacent to wounds or both .

In step a central scan depth marker can be provided on a compartment sensor . In step an alignment mechanism can also be provided on the compartment sensor to allow a medical practitioner to orient a sensor along a longitudinal axis of a compartment of interest.

In step an expansion device may be provided between two or more grouped compartment sensors as illustrated in . In step the processor and display device may receive input from a user on the type of compartment that is to be monitored by the inventive system .

In step and in response to the input of step the display device can display a location of the selected compartment of interest such as illustrated in . The display device can also display the longitudinal axis of the compartment of interest. Next in step the display device may display an ideal or optimal position for the compartment sensor along the longitudinal axis of the compartment of interest as illustrated in .

In step with the information from steps the medical practitioner can identify a proper position of the compartment sensor on a patient through orienting the alignment mechanism with the longitudinal axis of the compartment and by using the central scan depth marker .

In step the compartment sensor can be placed on the patient. In step the compartment sensor can obtain a skin pigment value of the patient s skin through using a skin sensor as illustrated in or thorough using a shallow sensor as illustrated in . In step the processor A can determine an oxygenation offset value based on the skin pigment value obtained in step .

Next in step the offset value from step can be used during oxygenation level monitoring. In step the blood pressure of the patient can be monitored with a probe and blood pressure monitor as illustrated in and . In step the system can monitor the oxygenation levels of one or more compartments of interest over time. In step the system can also monitor the oxygenation levels of healthy compartments to obtain a baseline while monitoring the compartments adjacent to an injury or trauma as illustrated in .

In step the oxygenation levels of compartments of interest can be displayed on the display device as illustrated in C and . In step the blood pressure of the patient can also be displayed on the display device as illustrated in . In step the display device and its processor can monitor the relationship between the blood pressure values and oxygenation levels as illustrated in .

In step the display device can activate an alarm in the form of an audible or visual message or both when the oxygenation levels drop below a predetermined value or if a significant change in the levels is detected as illustrated in . In step the display device can also activate an alarm in the form of an audible or visual message or both when both the oxygenation levels and blood pressure drop simultaneously or if one of them falls below a predetermined threshold value as described in connection with .

In step the display device and its processor can increase a frequency of data collection for oxygenation levels and blood pressure values if both values drop. The exemplary process then ends.

The inventive compartment monitoring system could also be used for free flap as well as tissue transfer monitoring. Currently skin color and capillary refill are used to evaluate flap viability. This practice requires repeated examinations and subjective criteria. The conventional method requires leaving skin exposed or taking down dressings which can be very labor intensive. As a solution to the conventional approach a sensor can be sterilized and it can record average oxygenation levels over time. The sensor can be placed on the flap free or transferred .

The compartment sensor can also be used to monitor oxygenation of tissue transferred for vascular patency. Specifically for hand or any upper extremity surgery the compartment sensor can be used to monitor the progress of revascularization of fingers hands and arms based on measured oxygenation levels. The sensor can be applied to the injured extremity once vascular repair has been performed in order to continue monitoring of vascular repair. A baseline of a corresponding uninjured or healthy extremity can be made once repair to the injured extremity is done before closure in order to get a baseline value while looking at the repair. Sensors for this application will also need to be sterilized and be able to conduct scans with depths of at least 0.5 centimeters.

Referring now to this Figure is a functional block diagram illustrating additional applications of and Oxygenation Sensing System of such as in Wound Management Monitoring Healing according to one exemplary embodiment of the system.

In this exemplary application of the oxygenation sensing system the properties of traumatized tissue A B will be taken into account by the oxygenation sensing system . One of ordinary skill the art recognizes that traumatized tissue A B does not have the same qualities as uninjured tissue Injured tissue may become hyperperfused along with an elevated temperature. Bleeding may be present as well as other physiological alterations. One of ordinary skill the art recognizes that the physiological state of tissue is very different in injured tissue or diseased tissue. Since the body cannot differentiate between unplanned trauma an accident versus planned trauma surgical intervention this concept includes post surgical tissue.

Injured tissue often becomes a Privileged area relative to other healthy body parts in that the body will typically maintain increased perfusion over other areas that are not injured even in times of poor global perfusion hypotension . The oxygenation sensing system may be designed to accommodate or to account for the different physiological states of injured or traumatized tissue A B.

Specifically predetermined or pre programmed algorithms in the oxygenation sensing system may be used in the setting and monitoring of traumatized or wounded tissue. The oxygenation sensing system may track an Erythema index temperature or other modalities or any combination of factors which can help differentiate traumatized tissue versus non traumatized tissue. The oxygenation sensing system may be designed to anticipate certain characteristics for tissue monitoring depending upon the state of the tissue such as whether the tissue has been injured or has not been injured traumatized non traumatized tissue . Alarms of the oxygenation sensing system may be set based on the type of tissue being monitored.

The sensors of the oxygenation sensing system may be sterilized in order for use during evaluation of open wounds such as illustrated in . The oxygenation sensing system may be used to conduct an initial evaluation in perfused tissue that may include but is not limited to muscle skin soft tissue and or organs . The oxygenation sensing system can aid in determining what should be debrided dead tissue not perfused versus what is viable tissue.

The oxygenation sensing system can also help identify tissue with adequate microcirculation Capillaries arterioles veinules . This is especially beneficial in the evaluation of mangled extremities and for determining if an extremity is salvageable. The oxygenation sensing system may also help with determining if amputations are indicated or if attempted salvage should be considered. The oxygenation sensing system may assist in the assessment of vascularity of the extremity large vessels and small vessel perfusion. The oxygenation sensing system may detect devitalized tissue which when allowed to persist may become a nidus for infection. One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that it is important to debride all dead devitalized tissue to prevent or minimize the risk of infection.

The readings from oxygenation sensing system may indicate whether a limb and or tissue is perfused and has the ability to heal. One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that healing is generally based on the ability of the tissue to obtain nutrients from the blood that is perfused throughout any given tissue.

For Transplanted Tissue Flaps Management Monitoring Healing each sensor of the oxygenation sensing system usually must be sterile to allow placement during a surgical procedure. Each sensor may be placed over the anastomosis connection of two or more ends of a vessel as in a repair of an artery or vein in order to get a direct read on tissue around the connection of the arteries veins that supply the transplanted tissue.

The placement of a sensor at distal tips of tissue allows for monitoring of the most sensitive tissue for tracking poor perfusion and or necrosis. These areas are call watershed areas where the tissue is at most risk for compromised perfusion. The oxygenation sensing system may allow for early warnings of decreased perfusion. Each sensor of the oxygenation sensing system may be placed on tissue during a procedure once vessels are anastomosed. An initial reading from each sensor may be determined in the operating room in order to obtain a baseline reading. Since the body cannot differentiate traumatized tissue from surgical trauma performed by a surgeon the tissue characteristics are similar to traumatized tissue and would be expected to have similar findings and values. Post surgical tissue should have a privileged state of increased perfusion to promote healing.

Usually each sensor of the oxygenation sensing system is maintained in the same position over the transplanted tissue in order to monitor the vascular flow to the transplanted tissue. If the NIRS values detected by each sensor start to decrease past a certain threshold an alarm such as the audible alarm may be activated in order to warn the medical practitioner that the flap or transplanted tissue is threatened.

If a signal of a sensor from the oxygenation sensing system is lost such as during hematoma formation an alarm such as the audible alarm is signaled. The oxygenation sensing system can help detect an anastomosis rupture or thrombosis blockage . Early detection can allow for early intervention such as anastomosis repair or canulation to prevent flap graft failure due to extended lack of perfusion ischemia. One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that an Anastomosis rupture can cause death of the transferred tissue as well as patient death through exsanguination if not diagnosed and treated early and accurately. A sentinel bleed is a small bleed at the site of anastomosis that typically is small in nature but is indicative of vessel rupture or disruption. If the vessel is large and the patient is on anticoagulation typical the blood loss can be significant and ultimately lead to exsanguination. Bleeding that may occur below the skin may be detected with oxygenation sensing system and is usually not detectable by medical practitioners in a timely manner. Additionally hematoma detection through signal loss could play a role in early detection.

The oxygenation sensing system may detect three common ways transplanted tissue A B fails A Arterial clot rupture. Such an event usually causes decreased oxygenation due to lack of new blood with oxygen being brought into the transplanted tissue. B Venous occlusion clot. Poor outflow from transplanted tissue may usually result in venous engorgement and an overall drop in tissue oxygenation due to increased venous blood deoxygenated present in the tissue. C Hematoma development which is usually due to a vessel rupture can potentially cause a loss of signal which may be an event for oxygenation sensing system to activate an alarm such as audible alarm .

Another application for oxygenation sensing system includes the monitoring of the transfer of tram flaps and tissue A B. For these applications the sensors should be sterilized so that they can be positioned on the site of interest very early after the procedure to obtain an initial reading on the operating room OR table. The oxygenation sensing system may provide data that quantitatively measures oxygenation of transferred tissues.

The oxygenation sensing system may sense conditions for organ transplant monitoring. Typically a host versus graft reaction will generally cause an immune response in a patient to vascular supply affecting the vascular flow to the organ. Poor perfusion which can possibly be combated with additional immune suppression may also be detected by oxygenation sensing system . The oxygenation sensing system may detect conditions that allow for early surgical intervention for revisions if needed possible.

The Oxygenation sensing system may also be used to revascularize tissue due to chronic vascular insufficiency . The oxygenation sensing system may be able to manage monitor and or promote healing of revascularized tissue. The oxygenation sensing system may detect conditions related to bypass graft patency. With bypass graft patency chronic poor tissue perfusion of distal extremities typically the lower extremity can be treated by bypassing poor vasculature with a biological or synthetic graft to restore blood flow to distal tissue. Specifically poor large vessel perfusion is bypassed to allow for an adequate supply of blood to distal tissue as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. Any anastomosis can be monitored with a sensor to insure the vessel connection is intact and functioning correctly and remaining open.

The oxygenation sensing system may promote extremity healing in chronic disease conditions. For example diabetes usually causes peripheral vessel disease resulting in the need for extremity typically foot leg amputation. Other autoimmune and vasculitis are other medical conditions which can also cause poor perfusion in extremities. One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that wounds do not heal if they are poorly perfused. Each sensor can be used to determine the ability of the tissue to heal in order to determine the level of amputation. This application is similar to the use in the traumatized mangled extremity and determining what injured tissue to debride versus what to save.

The oxygenation sensing system may also monitor tissue replantation A B. Specifically the system may monitor the status of reattaching tissue that has been traumatically amputated. For example such tissue may include but is not limited to fingers hands arms feet or legs. The oxygenation sensing system may help a medical practitioner monitor anastomosis integrity and distal flow. Specifically the oxygenation sensing system may help a medical practitioner monitor anastomosis of both arterial inflow and venous outflow. One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that replants can fail if not provided with adequate outflow. Replantation typically requires two veins to one artery to allow for adequate blood flow in and out of the replant area.

The oxygenation sensing system may be useful in monitoring vessel injuries and or vessel repairs . Such injuries may include but are not limited to a laceration to a major arterial supply and or extremity organ. One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that reperfusion can cause tissue death or compartment syndrome due swelling once blood flow is restored to the tissue. The oxygenation sensing system may provide data that allows for post operative repair monitoring similar to the transplant of tissue as discussed above and the system can insure the vessel repair is adequate and remains open. Each sensor of the oxygenation sensing system can also monitor tissue pressure to diagnose acute compartment syndrome due to reperfusion injury.

The oxygenation sensing system can also assist with collecting data to help a medical practitioner to decide what is the appropriate treatment for a given tissue region. The oxygenation sensing system may also assist the medical practitioner with determining if a selected procedure has been completed successfully. For example with a fasciotomy uninformed or unfamiliar medical practitioners can fail to release all compartments. Meanwhile one of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that a complete release of all compartments allows for restoration of hyperemia and return of blood flow. An inadequate release from a fasciotomy can occur if the fascia is not released proximal and distally enough or if skin is not released in some cases. A percutaneous release may lead to incomplete release. During and after the fasciotomy the oxygenation sensing system may be able to detect hyperemia. If the treated region does not become hyperemic then such a condition may be a sign of incomplete release or lack of release missed the compartment from the fasciotomy. Additionally if the fasciotomy is performed too late the tissue may be dead already. In this case a lack of return of blood flow would indicate to the surgeon the need for debridement to prevent infection.

Another procedure in which oxygenation sensing system may also assist the medical practitioner to determine if a selected procedure has been completed successfully is revascularization . The oxygenation sensing system may detect if restoration of blood flow has been achieved for a particular site. Hyperemia is expected once blood flow is restored due to a reperfusion effect. The oxygenation sensing system as noted above can detect hyperemia for a particular region. Additionally the system could be used to determine if the bypass is sufficient to restore flow or if additional measures need to be taken.

The oxygenation sensing system may also help a medical practitioner to determine the success of a bypass surgery. The oxygenation sensing system may detect if a bypass anastomosis is present and if adequate blood flow downstream relative to the bypass region has been restored. The oxygenation sensing system may determine if the operated vessel is open and if any related extremity is receiving adequate blood flow.

The oxygenation sensing system may also help a medical practitioner to quantitatively measure the success of operations related to reperfusion injury ACS transplanted tissue A B replantation A B and the like. For transplanted tissue A B the oxygenation sensing system may detect anastomosis and provide data that indicates whether the transplanted tissue is healing and not dying. For operations related to replantation A B the oxygenation sensing system may provide data to indicate whether blood flow is restored to a severed limb. The oxygenation sensing system may also provide data to indicate whether a vessel injury and its related repair have been successful. Specifically the sensors can measure oxygenation of replanted tissue. Exemplary depths in which the sensors can scan include but are not limited to depths of about one centimeter or even less such as for fingers .

For reperfusion injuries the oxygenation sensing system can provide reperfusion monitoring. The oxygenation sensing system can monitor initial hyperperfusion and may provide data to indicate if perfusion has increased or decreased for a particular tissue region.

The oxygenation sensing system may be used to detect other conditions such as Exertional Compartment Syndrome Chronic caused by exercise or other types of physical activities. For detecting this condition the sensors can be the same as those used to detect ACS in injured tissue. For exertional compartment syndrome the regions of interest will most typically be in the legs or forearms of the patient. The oxygenation sensing system may be used to detect conditions in highly trained and conditioned athletes. The oxygenation sensing system may be provided with a base algorithm that compares highly trained athletes compared to recreational athletes and untrained individuals.

The base algorithm for the oxygenation sensing system for detecting exertional compartment system should account for the different physiological conditions associated with exercising. The oxygenation sensing system may require readings for pre exercise intra exercise and post exercise to properly calibrate the algorithm. The algorithm may take into account that unlike ACS exertional compartment syndrome may be present in an environment in which muscles swell with blood and have increased metabolites. These differences between ACS and exertional compartment syndrome may usually be accounted for in the base algorithm for oxygenation sensing system .

The sensors for detecting exertional compartment syndrome may have a placement similar to the placement used to detect ACS. However the sensors may be provided with additional mechanical features such as but not limited to additional cord length spring biased cords etc. to allow for activities like jogging and or marching by the patient. Other mechanical features may include but are not limited to additional adhesive or straps positioned on sensors to insure adequate sensor skin connection. Additionally the sensors could be attached to a mobile unit that allows for monitoring while covering large distances. Further the sensors may be positioned within a sleeve for accurate sensor placement that will not allow for movement of the sensors relative to the region of interest as illustrated in . The sensors and their mechanical features may be designed to function properly in the presence of exercise by products such as sweat from the human body during the physical exertion of the patient being monitored with the oxygenation sensing system . Additionally the sleeve or attachment device should not cause changes in flow due to excessive compression.

Sensors could be used in a wireless fashion or only record data to be analyzed once plugged into a monitor system after training is complete. A memory device can record data then be retrieved later in order to limit the size and weight of the monitoring system.

This concept can be carried over into athletic or military training to guide optimization of physical training without exceeding the tolerance of the muscle. A mobile unit or one placed in a backpack or other carrying device could guide intensity of workouts and training 

For detecting exertional compartment syndrome the oxygenation sensing system may be provided with features for reducing or eliminating noise from the movement of the sensors . For example the oxygenation sensing system may be provided with software and or hardware to implement noise reduction algorithms caused by physical movement of the sensors . In the exertional compartment syndrome monitoring scenario erythema pigment monitoring may not be evaluated since it is unlikely that the tissue of interest is traumatized. However other chemical and environmental factors such as but not limited to pH and temperature may affect the local tissue.

The oxygenation sensing system may provide data that helps a medical practitioner to assess tissue viability. The oxygenation sensing system may be used to monitor superficial trauma on patients. The oxygenation sensing system may replace the prior art black lamps which have been used in the past for evaluating tissue perfusion. Prior art devices are typically intrusive and bulky and are not passive solutions for monitoring and testing perfusion.

Oxygenation sensing system may also provide a guide to a medical practitioner for amputation procedures. The oxygenation sensing system may be useful for patients with diabetes and who may need amputation of a limb due to complications arising from this disease. The oxygenation sensing system may determine a level of amputation for adequate blood flow in lower extremity ulcers infected regions. In other words the oxygenation sensing system can help the medical practitioner determine a level or the line to draw for amputating a limb. The oxygenation sensing system allows a medical practitioner to determine at what level of a limb will heal due to the detection of adequate blood flow by the sensors positioned on the limb of interest. In this monitoring for detecting the level of amputation the position of the sensors can be similar to those used for detecting compartment syndrome to evaluate muscle. Sensors designed for shallow scans may be used to monitor skin values.

Referring to this figure is logic flow diagram illustrating an exemplary method for assessing tissue conditions to assist medical practitioners in determining an amputation line according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. This method describes steps that can be used with either the oxygenation sensing system or the combined system as discussed below.

Step is the first step in the process in which baseline oxygenation values for a cross section of the population of patients with a common medical trait and or condition are identified. For example baseline oxygenation values may be established for patients having diabetes. Oxygenation values may be taken from several patients having diabetes and having a need for amputation of an extremity.

A minimum oxygenation value may be determined from this population of patients that indicates healthy tissue compared to tissue that may need to be the debrided or amputated. One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that the invention is not limited to patients having diabetes. The invention may address any population of patients having a common medical trait and or condition such as a disease so that a baseline level of oxygenation values may be established for the patients having a common medical trait and or condition and who need amputation of an extremity.

Next in step the oxygenation sensors may be applied along a length of an extremity that may require amputation. The sensors should be positioned along tissue which is healthy as well as along tissue which will likely need amputation.

In step the oxygenation sensing system monitors all the sensors positioned along the length of the extremity. Subsequently in step the oxygenation sensing system displays NIRS values for the sensors positioned along the length of the extremity.

In step the oxygenation sensing system compares NIRS values between the respective sensors positioned along the length of the extremity. Next in step the oxygenation sensing system identifies sensors having relatively low values based upon the comparison made among the line of sensors . In step the oxygenation sensing system compares the values from the sensors to the baseline established for the patients having a common medical trait and or condition.

In step the oxygenation sensing system identifies the sensors which have NIRS values that correspond to the baseline set of values that indicate amputation may be needed for an area of tissue. Next in step the oxygenation sensing system displays visuals identifying sensors that may correspond to the amputation level or line on the extremity of the patient. The process then ends.

The oxygenation sensing system may also be used to monitor organ perfusion . Such monitoring is beneficial for operations relating to organ transplantation. The oxygenation sensing system may be used to help a medical practitioner assess acute grafts and to determine if the host body has rejected the transplantation. The oxygenation sensing system may also monitor abdominal compartment syndrome as well as the perfusion of internal organs such as but not limited to the kidneys liver spleen and bowel small large intestines .

The oxygenation sensing system especially the sensors may be adapted or designed for specific body types such as obese individuals having layers of fatty tissue. Problems could arise if sensors with normal scan depths designed for normal body types having nominal fatty layers are used for monitoring obese individuals. Different scaled sensors having deeper scan depths may be provided for obese individuals due to excess layers of skin and fat tissue that are normally present with obese body types.

The oxygenation sensing system may help determine if skin ready for surgery A such as for a pilon fracture. A pilon fracture is a comminuted fracture of the distal tibia. The fracture usually includes a long oblique fracture extending medial to lateral as well as a fracture extending to the tibiotalar articular surface. It results from an axial loading injury with impaction of the talus upon the tibial plafond.

Current methods prior to treating a pilon fracture require a medical practitioner to estimate if swelling has decreased enough to allow for healing i.e. such as if the skin has wrinkles . This prior art subjective judgment of the medical practitioner can now be replaced with sensors which may help determine if skin is well perfused and not stretched too tight. The oxygenation sensing system may be used in the operating room OR to determine if skin closure is too tight and if it is not allowing adequate blood flow to tissue to allow for healing. This data from the oxygenation sensing system will allow the medical practitioner to quantitatively determine if the wound should be left open to heal.

The oxygenation sensing system can generally help a medical practitioner to monitor skin perfusion. The oxygenation sensing system may be used at the time of an attempted closure and it may help prevent skin wound complications and dehiscence. The oxygenation sensing system may help to detect if good blood flow is present for wound healing. Current conventional methods for assessing good blood flow require human observations to determine if skin is wrinkling.

The oxygenation sensing system may be used to help a medical practitioner determine if a patient is experiencing hypotension and or Shock or anemia. The oxygenation sensing system may be used in an emergency room an intensive care unit ICU or an operating room OR . If the oxygenation system detects decreasing NIRS values then the combined system may determine that these decreasing NIRS values are likely due to lower serial hemoglobins Hgb or hematocrits Hct . Table 6 provided and discussed below provides just one example of how certain conditions of a patient may indicate the presence or existence of hemorrhaghic shock or anemia.

The oxygenation sensing system may be designed to allow for comparable values across a variety of patients by utilizing adjusted values. For example short monitoring of tissue may sometimes provide raw values from the oxygenation sensing system that may be very erratic and vary widely. However continual monitoring with the oxygenation system may provide a baseline and allow a medical practitioner to adjust for values after the baseline is established. The oxygenation system may have off set values that may adjust readings for variations of skin pigment erythema age vasculature status respiratory status demographics tobacco use and cardiac health risks.

In summary the oxygenation sensing system may comprise one or more algorithm s to account for different variations in person being monitored in order to get an adjusted value that can be compared across individuals of different skin color age weight sex and or injury status. The oxygenation system may also establish predetermined threshold values for normal perfusion hypoperfusion as well as values that assess viable tissue versus nonviable tissue. Additionally the assessment of the patient such as but not limited to the American Society of Anesthesiology ASA physical status classification could be built into the algorithm to allow for warnings earlier in higher risk individuals.

Referring now to this Figure is a functional block diagram of an intensive care unit ICU central controller and analyzer C according to one exemplary embodiment of the inventive system. According to this exemplary embodiment the oxygenation sensing system described in can be made to be compatible with an ICU central controller C which may be coupled to other sensors and systems.

For example the ICU central controller C may be coupled to a respiration sensor a pH level sensor a temperature sensor a pulse oxygenation sensor a heart rate sensor a ventilation sensor an ultrasound sensor and an altitude sensor as well as a monitor to determine pressure on the injured area under the dressings. The ICU central controller C can provide directions on use of its system components. The ICU central controller C may have analyzing hardware or software or both for providing recommendations for clinical interventions based on the data it collects from the various sensors as well as data that may be entered via keyboard by an operator that is specific to a patient. The ICU central controller C may provide its directions data and recommendations on a display device C.

In another exemplary embodiment the ICU central controller C can be part of an existing sensor system such as a heart rate and or respiratory monitoring system.

According to such an exemplary embodiment the oxygenation sensing system would be designed to be compatible with the ICU central controller C with the appropriate hardware and or software i.e. compatible connector compatible application programming interfaces APIs etc. .

The system may provide a complete ACS smart device that combines monitoring diagnosing and treating up to fasciotomy. The system may intelligently combine all known technology and data to provide medical practitioners with guidelines. The system and particularly its oxygenation sensing system may obtain NIRS values and interpret them based on trends in values.

The central controller C may function as a data collection device which obtains data from ICU devices. The central controller C may obtain directly blood pressure BP pulse ox lab values demographic data and may replace an ICU monitor.

The combined system may include an intramuscular pressure device for monitoring muscle pressure and for filtering exudates. The intramuscular pressure device may comprise an ultrafiltration catheter for pressure reading and a fluid removal system.

The combined system may further comprise a medicine delivery system that may operate in a manner similar to a drip line setup found in an ICU that would automatically administer medication to affect cardiovascular status. The medicine delivery system may administer drugs such as but not limited to pressors to increase blood pressure to allow for elevated perfusion pressures. The system via medicine delivery system may administer medicines automatically based on monitored conditions. For example if the system via the oxygenation sensing system detects decreasing NIRS values then the central controller C could issue a command to the medical delivery system to administer a pressor. The medical delivery system may comprise a small pump for moving liquid medicines into a patient. This system could deliver medicines or other entities such as but not limited to intravenous fluid boluses or blood products.

The combined system may also comprise a tissue firmness device to measure how firm an extremity is and to determine how tense the extremity is. The ability to compress the tissue is a subjective measurement clinicians use to assess injured extremities. As noted previously the combined system may also include an ultrasound sensor . The ultrasound sensor may measure the vibration or wave characteristics of the fascia. The data from each of the sensors of the combined system may be time stamped by the central controller C for review and archival purposes. The data may be stored in the memory device which can comprise volatile or non volatile memory or both .

The combined system may incorporate the vital signs and NIRS values in order to give recommendations for clinical intervention. The combined system may also provide various levels of alarms for the medical practitioner. For example the combined system may have a series of color coded visual indicators to provide a relative status of different conditions for patient. According to one exemplary embodiment the combined system may display a red color coded alarm display CI a yellow color coded alarm display CII and a green color coded alarm display CIII.

According to one exemplary embodiment the red color coded alarm display CI may indicate a danger condition such as low perfusion or that NIRS and blood pressure are in phase or that NIRS values are demonstrating a decreasing trend. A yellow color coded alarm display CII may indicate a moderate drop or downward trend with perfusion existing at minimal levels. This yellow alarm may also indicate that blood pressure and the NIRS values are beginning to become in phase. The combined system and particularly the central controller C may recommend considering other modalities to evaluate perfusion such as intracompartmental pressure measurements pressors and or transfusions. Meanwhile the green color coded alarm display CIII may indicate that there are no signs of poor or below normal perfusion levels.

The oxygenation sensing system of the combined system may activate an audible alarm or anyone of the visual alarms CI CIII any combination thereof to indicate low blood pressure and decreasing NIRS values. The combined system may recommend transfusions intravenous fluids and or pressors. In non traumatized or traumatized patients the oxygenation sensing system could be placed on the leg to monitor patient perfusion status. Poor cardiac function of a patient will usually cause decreased levels of perfusion. So the combined system may utilize the heart rate sensor in such situations for monitoring heart failure patients.

The respiration sensor may be used by the combined system to detect increased respirations as well as pH levels elevated lactic acid typically is associated with lower respiratory alkalosis . The combined system by monitoring the respiration sensor in combination with the oxygenation sensing system may signal an alarm such as the audible alarm or any one of the visual alarms CI CIII or any combination thereof to increase oxygen supplementation or to recommend intubation for a patient.

The combined system may use the pH level sensor to detect changes in pH levels of the patient. A change in pH level of the patient in combination with a decrease in NIRS values detected by the oxygenation sensing system may cause the combined system signal alarm such as the audio alarm or a visual alarm CI or both to indicate the patient has poor resuscitation. Such a condition may typically be found in patients who have had a replacement of blood products after a large amount of blood loss due to an injury or because of surgery.

The intensive care unit C of the combined system may record vital signs detected by the heart rate sensor and the pulse oxygenation sensor in a memory device coupled to the intensive care unit C. The oxygenation sensing system may be designed so that it is compatible with programs of common intensive care units C. If the oxygenation sensing system detects decreasing NIRS values in combination with changes in vital signs such as heart rate blood pressure and or respiration then the intensive care unit C indicate that tissue perfusion may be reaching a vulnerable point. When this vulnerable point is conveyed by the intensive care unit C then a medical practitioner may be required to intervene with the patient.

The combined system may also monitor and calculate if blood products are needed by a patient. Similar to serial hemoglobins Hgb or hematocrits Hct the NIRS values detected by the oxygenation sensing system may be used to monitor perfusion during or after surgery such as after hip or knee replacements or other surgeries or trauma. If the oxygenation sensing system detects decreasing NIRS values then the combined system may determine that these decreasing NIRS values are likely due to lower Hgb or Hct. The combined system may be designed to track transfusions given to the patient so that it may correlate if a particular transfusion increases the Hgb or Hct levels in a patient. According to this exemplary embodiment the combined system becomes a non invasive means of monitoring blood transport of oxygen in an intra or post operation post op setting.

During surgery or after surgery due to continued bleeding either under the skin or through a wound a patient may lose a significant amount of blood that the patient becomes anemic. Typically this condition is followed through serial blood draws that examine factors such as hemoglobin concentrations or hematocrits. Additional things such as lactic acid levels and other factors can also be examined. All these blood draws require needle sticks and can be difficult in sicker patients that have poor vascular systems. The ability of the oxygenation system would be to follow the values through a noninvasive means.

Opposite to traumatized tissue non traumatized tissue is not privileged and will have shunting of blood flow away from it to more vital organs such s the brain heart and other vital organs. As a patient becomes anemic the oxygenation in distal extremities will fall indicating a stressed condition. By correlating decreasing oxygenation values in the extremity or other areas of the body with decreasing Hct or Hgb a standardization and guideline can be determined which would alleviate the need for repeated lab draws. The reverse can also be said regarding the monitoring of oxygenation levels as blood products are replaced. An increase in oxygenation values would be expected as blood is replaced. The combined system may use predetermined tables such as Table 6 provided below in order to help make assessments about a patient. Table 6 provided below provides just one example of how certain conditions of a patient may indicate the presence or existence of Hemorrhagic shock and or Anemia.

Shock is a state of inadequate perfusion which does not sustain the physiologic needs of organ tissues. Many conditions including blood loss but also including nonhemorrhagic states such as dehydration sepsis impaired autoregulation obstruction decreased myocardial function and loss of autonomic tone may produce shock or shocklike states. Hemorrhagic shock is a condition in which blood loss exceeds the body s ability to compensate and provide adequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation. This frequently is due to trauma but it may be caused by spontaneous hemorrhage e.g. gastro intestinal bleeding childbirth surgery and other causes. Most frequently clinical hemorrhagic shock is caused by an acute bleeding episode with a discrete precipitating event. Less commonly hemorrhagic shock may be seen in chronic conditions with subacute blood loss.

In addition to helping a medical practitioner to determine shock in a patient the combined system may also assist the medical practitioner with determining the existence of anemia. Anemia is a condition of the blood where there is not enough oxygen carried to the body s cells. Anemia usually occurs over a longer period of time compared to the suddenness of hemorrhagic shock. Shock occurs can occur within seconds or minutes while anemia generally occurs over hours and days and is systemic. Oxygen is mostly transported on hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells. Anemia is present when amounts of red blood cells and or hemoglobin are below normal. The most common sign of anemia is fatigue. A patient may also feel weak dizzy or just not well. An anemic patient may become pale feel cold and easily short of breath. The patient s blood pressure may become low and heart rate may become rapid.

Table 6 provides exemplary values therefore one of ordinary skill the art recognizes that other values ranges within this table may be adjusted depending upon the subjective conditions of a particular patient and or adjustments provided by one or more medical studies in the field.

By utilizing the values in Table 6 the combined system may help a medical practitioner formulate a proper diagnosis of the presence or existence of hemorrhagic shock or intra post operative anemia.

In addition to the conditions listed in Table 6 provided above the combined system may include NIRS values detected by the oxygenation sensing system as part of a shock assessment. As apparent to one of ordinary skill the art and as illustrated in the several figures the location of measurement for the shock assessment can vary. For example the location of measurement may include but is not limited to the arm leg foot hand torso abdomen buttock and or multiple sites such as illustrated in so that the medical practitioner may have different options based on the local effects of trauma to the tissue at a particular site on the patient.

One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that injury to tissue causes the injured tissue to become privileged with increased blood flow to the injured area at the expense of non injured areas. This means that the medical practitioner may have a need to monitor multiple locations of the patient since the injured area being monitored may have abnormally high readings and may not be responsive to global body perfusion changes. For example an injury or operation to the leg may cause increased values in the injured area leg which may be resistant to global changes since the normal response is to shunt blood to the injured area to promote healing. Therefore a different location than the injured site is required to monitor the global hematologic status of the body such as perhaps the arm or contralateral leg. The monitoring site needs to reflect the changes in the body s hematologic status which would not be the case in a preferred location such as a site of injury.

Referring to this figure is logic flow diagram illustrating an exemplary method for assessing conditions in a patient to help medical practitioners determine if a patient is experiencing anemia and or shock according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. The method also provides a non invasive way to determine if a patient needs additional blood products and or transfusions. This method describes steps that can be used with the combined system as discussed above.

Step is the first step in the process the oxygenation sensors are applied to a patient prior to a surgical procedure. In step which is similar to steps and the medical practitioner may identify which sensors are monitoring healthy or non traumatized tissue and which sensors are monitoring traumatized tissue. As noted above with respect to injured tissue often becomes a Privileged area relative to other healthy body parts in that the body will typically maintain increased perfusion over other areas that are not injured even in times of poor global perfusion hypotension . The oxygenation sensing system and or combined system may be designed to accommodate or to account for the different physiological states of injured or traumatized tissue A B. Either system or may adjust its one or more monitoring algorithms depending upon the state of the tissue.

Also in this step either system or may automatically identify which tissue is traumatized and which is not. The systems and may make these determinations based on detected tissue characteristics such as temperature erythema etc. . They systems and may then use non traumatized tissue as a control relative to the monitored traumatized tissue as discussed above and below.

Next in step the combined system obtain this preoperative baseline NIRS values for the patient from the sensors . In step the combined system may also receive a baseline set of values from traditional blood tests that have been applied to the patient prior to surgery. In this step this baseline set of values from traditional blood tests may be entered via the keyboard or these values may be transferred from another computer system to the intensive care unit C of the combined system . The traditional blood tests may include but are not limited to those which establish levels of hemoglobin Hgb and hemocrit Hct within the blood of the patient.

In step the sensors may be removed from the patient or they may be turned off while the patient undergoes surgery. In step which is similar to steps and step the medical practitioner may identify which sensors are monitoring healthy or non traumatized tissue and which sensors are monitoring traumatized tissue. As noted above with respect to injured tissue often becomes a Privileged area relative to other healthy body parts in that the body will typically maintain increased perfusion over other areas that are not injured even in times of poor global perfusion hypotension . The oxygenation sensing system and or combined system may be designed to accommodate or to account for the different physiological states of injured or traumatized tissue A B. Either system or may adjust its one or more monitoring algorithms depending upon the state of the tissue.

Also in this step either system or may automatically identify which tissue is traumatized and which is not. The systems and may make these determinations based on detected tissue characteristics such as temperature erythema etc. . They systems and may then use non traumatized tissue as a control relative to the monitored traumatized tissue as discussed above and below.

Next in step the oxygenation sensors are again applied to the patient after the surgery and in the same relative locations prior to surgery. In step the combined system monitors the NIRS values for the post operative patient from the sensors .

In step the combined system may receive blood test values for the post operative patient. Similar to step these values from traditional blood tests may be entered via the keyboard of these values may be transferred from another computer system to the intensive care unit C. In step the combined system may automatically correlate the NIRS values from the sensors against the values from the traditional blood tests. In this step the combined system may determine what type of blood products as well as what to a volume of blood transfusions may be necessary to restore normal levels of Hct and or Hgb in the patient.

In step the combined system may display its recommendations regarding blood products and or blood transfusion levels based on its assessment of the NIRS values taken from the sensors . In step the combined system may continue monitoring the NIRS values provided by the sensors .

In step the combined system may monitor the heart rate sensor . In step the combined system may also monitor the blood pressure sensor within the oxygenation sensing system . In step the combined system may also monitor the respiration sensor . The process then continues to step in .

In step of the combined system may compare the monitored data from each of the sensors to a predetermined table or a set of tables such as Table 6 discussed above which lists values for one or more medical conditions. Next in decision step the combined system A. determines if the data corresponds to the certain medical conditions outlined in the predetermined table s such as Table 6. This means that in decision step with the specific exemplary table of Table 6 the combined system may determine if the patient is experiencing an anemic condition and or a shock condition based on the values in the table. One of ordinary skill the art recognizes that the invention is not limited to table 6 that outlines conditions and or properties of anemia and shock. The invention may address any one of a variety of medical conditions based on the values listed for each sensor which are provided in the one or more predetermined tables.

If the inquiry to decision step is positive then the YES branch is followed to step . If the inquiry to decision step is negative then the NO branch is followed and the process returns back to step .

In step the combined system may activate an alarm and display the medical conditions on the display device C that appear to correspond with the values presented in the one or more predetermined tables. The alarm may comprise an audio or visual alarm or both .

The combined system may also take into account the presence of pressors also known as medication that may be used to increase the blood pressure and to potentially allow for increased perfusion in areas with elevated tissue pressure. Pressors are typically used to increase the cardiac output in order to maintain body perfusion. Pressors may be prescribed by the medical practitioner as a way to help prevent acute compartment syndrome by increasing the blood pressure so that it can over come increases in intracompartmental pressures. If a particular patient happens to be on a pressor then the combined system may be able to account for the use of this medication in an algorithm by accessing predetermined tables that have been derived from patients who have been on pressors while being monitored by the combined system . Alternatively or in addition to the medical practitioner may be warmed by the combined system then the NIRS values detected by the oxygenation sensing system may be altered by these types of medications. In a similar manner the combined system may also take into account other drugs that impact other sensors of the combined system such as drugs that may impact respiration which may impact readings by the respiration sensor as well as drugs that may affect the heart which may impact the heart rate sensor .

The blood pressure monitor for may provide diastolic values as well as Mean arterial pressure MAP values. The combined system may use these values to assess artier vascular function as understood by one of ordinary skill the art. The combined system may detect or sense a presence of shock when it detects that the blood pressure values have decreased. An arterial line may be provided with the blood pressure monitor help monitor the blood pressure of a patient.

The temperature sensor of the combined system may be designed to detect key temperature changes which may affect ability of enzymes to perform efficiently. The performance of enzymes may have an impact on blood clotting oxygenation transportation hemoglobin and other functions known to one of ordinary skill the art.

The pulse ox sensor may be used to monitor lung capacity for oxygen exchange. The data from this sensor may allow for insight into the whole body oxygen transport.

The altitude sensor may be useful in situations in which the patient is transported through various different altitudes such as during military operations in which a patient is transported by helicopter or flight evacuation planes to a medical facility. The altitude sensor may be able to assess and determine causes of changes in pressure within closed compartments such as but not limited to the fascia of extremities organs intracranial pressures and the like.

The heart rate sensor may be able to detect circulatory capabilities of the subject and may help detect the presence of shock. The combined system may monitor an increased heart rate with the heart rate sensor and decreased NIRS values with the oxygenation sensing system which may cause the combined system to sound the audible alarm and or one of the visual alarms CI CIII to suggest to the medical practitioner that a transfusion may be needed by the patient.

The respiration sensor may be able to indicate whether a patient has poor oxygenation are not. The combined system may use the signals from the respiration center and the NIRS values from the oxygenation sensing system to determine whether a patient has poor ability to oxygenate and if this condition exists the combined system may activate an alarm to suggest increasing oxygen supplementation or intubation of the patient.

The pH sensor may indicate poor resuscitation if the combined system also detects changes in NIRS values from the oxygenation sensing system .

The demographic data input may help the combined system determine if a patient has certain diseases which may affect perfusion such as diabetes peripheral neuropathy and small vessel disease. The demographic data input may also help the combined system to determine if a patient may have lung disease conditions associated with smoking EtOH Alcohol and conditioned associated with old age. The demographic data input may also allow for a medical practitioner to input a sex of the patient as well as the ability to assign pigment values based on pigment type. If pigment data is provided by the medical practitioner then the combined system may access predetermined charts such as the pigment chart developed by Taylor et al. 2006.

The NIRS sensors of the combined system and particularly of the oxygenation sensing system may be provided with different sizes to correspond with patients having various sizes. For example the NIRS sensors may be provided in at least three different sizes such as small medium and large as illustrated in . These variations in sizes for the sensors may allow for the monitoring of various different body sizes such as for fat average and skinny people due to the different scan depths that may be achieved through varying the distance d between the light source and the light receiver for a particular sensor . The sizes of the sensors may also be tailored for the specific body part being monitored such as for the leg forearm thigh and or foot as illustrated in . In the sensor has a predetermined shape that corresponds to a finger of a human. The variations in sizes for the sensors may allow for the isolation of tissue at specific depths based on the body part being monitored. The sensors may be provided with predetermined scan depths based on a MRI study in which limbs of the human body have been scanned to determine the average depths for each compartment of the human body. Scan depths for each sensor can be achieved by the type of light source provided on each sensor as well as the geometry of the sensor and arrangement in a sensor array for the oxygenation sensing system in order to best fit the compartment being monitored.

The system may communicate with multiple sensor types that are coupled to the system which includes the oxygenation sensing system . Other sensor types may include but are not limited to a cerebral monitor an organ monitor such as the heart rate sensor and the respiration sensor a spine monitor and other like monitors. The system may provide and display directions for use of a sensor such as each sensor and the initiation calibration of each sensor as it establishes communications with system .

The system can provide sensor directions in order to educate medical practitioners on how to use place sensors at start up when either the system is powered on or when a new sensor establishes communications with the system . The system may also allow a medical practitioner to bypass the instructions directions on the system if the medical practitioners familiar with the device application of the system .

The system may have multiple different sockets or inputs from multiple different pad monitoring input sources based on the function of a particular sensor . Different sockets or inputs may allow for different uses of a particular sensor . The sockets or inputs may have labels which match labels positioned on each sensor so that correct sockets and inputs are utilized in so that medical practitioners are not confused when attaching the sensors to the system as illustrated in . Each socket can be made to only fit certain sensors that will be labeled specifically for that use. In other words each socket of a sensor or sockets for a set of sensors may be provided with unique geometric shapes as illustrated in . Additionally based on what socket is used different algorithms can initiated based on what function the sensor for which it is to be used.

A disconnect mechanism as illustrated in can be incorporated into the system that allows the sensors to be disconnected quickly and easily for patient transfer etc. This mechanism will allow for easy disconnection but also easy reconnection so sensors are not reconnected incorrectly. Color coding or different connection mechanisms for each line can insure appropriate reconnection to the accurate site. By using different fitting connection locking mechanisms for each line it insures that only the correct two ends of a line can be attached together.

As noted previously sensors to may store a unique identifier for the system to recognize. Therefore if the sensors are unplugged then reattached the information will be retrieved from previous measurements. In this way if a change from previous readings occurred while the sensor was unplugged i.e. the patient was taken for a diagnostic test the change would be recognized by the system once the sensor was reattached.

Additionally a memory device and mobile monitor may be provided that can be temporarily attached to sensors in order to retain data while the sensors are unplugged from the combined system . As noted above the sensor itself could retain data for processing after it removal or if the sensor was switched between different intensive care units C.

The system may be provided with a keyboard keypad so that patient information such as demographic data may be entered by a medical practitioner. The keyboard keypad A be coupled to the system by a wired or wireless link.

System may take advantage of controls also referred to as uninjured or areas of anatomy which are not of interest to the system . The system may take baseline measurements of the controls in order to compare them with the areas of anatomy which are of interest to the system . For bilateral lower extremity injuries system may use one or more forearms as a control. The upper extremity of the patient should usually be shunted if it is uninjured relative to the bilateral lower extremity injuries. The system may also take into account that injured tissue may become hyperemic and adjust its measurements accordingly.

The system may help the medical practitioner locate the compartments of a human leg. Specifically the system may help the medical practitioner locate the Anterior Lateral Superficial Compartments these compartments can be accessed over any area due to the superficial nature and Deep posterior which is usually more difficult to get a reading . The system can help the medical practitioner locate the most superficial portion of the Deep posterior which may be generally found at the posterior and medial boarder of tibia and is often the best place to take a reading with a sensor . As noted previously the system may provide an initiation of monitoring directions to medical practitioners not familiar with ACS to insure appropriate placement of pads.

Referring to this figure is logic flow diagram illustrating an exemplary method for positioning sensors on a leg and for monitoring conditions for ACS according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. This method describes steps that can be used with either the oxygenation sensing system or the combined system as discussed above. The method may also be part of method of in that the steps of method could be part of Step of in which proper positions for sensors are identified.

Step is the first step in the process in which instructions are displayed on the display device C for entering new patient information into the combined system or into the oxygenation sensing system . New patient information made include but is not limited to name address unique identifiers assigned by a medical facility insurance information and the like. This information can be entered in using a keyboard or keypad .

Next in step the combined system or the oxygenation sensing system may receive the new patient information and store it in memory such as memory storage of . Next in step one or more visual s are displayed on the display device C which illustrate how to reduce fractures of the leg a line the leg and palpate the tibial ridge of the leg . One exemplary visual for step is provided in .

Referring briefly to this figure illustrates the right leg of a patient and how a medical practitioner may provisionally reduce any fractures to align the leg . Referring back to in step one or more visuals may be displayed on the display device C that illustrate how the sensors should be positioned at the mid tibial level or just proximal towards the knee as provided in . Visuals may include but are not limited to graphical computer generated still images that may comprise digital photographs and text as well as video which comprises moving images. The visuals may also comprise computer generated images that provide illustrations instead of digital photographs or any combination thereof. The visuals may or may not be accompanied by audio information such as a narrator describing proper placement of the sensors .

In step one or more visuals may be displayed to illustrate how to position the anterior A sensor lateral to the tibial ridge over the muscle. In most cases this position will be about or approximately two centimeters off the ridge as provided in . Next in step one or more visuals may be displayed on the display device C to illustrate how to position a lateral L sensor over the fibula on the lateral aspect of the leg as provided in .

In step one or more visuals may be displayed on the display device C to illustrate how the mid tibial level may be measured as provided in . In step one or more visuals may be displayed on the display device C illustrating how to position the deep posterior DP sensor just behind to the inner aspect of the shin over the flexor digitorum longus as provided in .

Next in step one or more visuals illustrating how to position the superficial posterior SP sensor on the back part of the leg may be provided on the display device C as provided in . Subsequently in step the system or oxygenation sensing system may receive confirmation from each of the sensors to indicate that they are properly connected to the CPU A. In step the system may initiate readings from the sensors .

In step the medical practitioner may identify which sensors are monitoring healthy or non traumatized tissue and which sensors are monitoring traumatized tissue. As noted above with respect to injured tissue often becomes a Privileged area relative to other healthy body parts in that the body will typically maintain increased perfusion over other areas that are not injured even in times of poor global perfusion hypotension . The oxygenation sensing system and or combined system may be designed to accommodate or to account for the different physiological states of injured or traumatized tissue A B. Either system or may adjust its one or more monitoring algorithms depending upon the state of the tissue. Also in this step either system or may automatically identify which tissue is traumatized and which is not. The systems and may make these determinations based on detected tissue characteristics such as temperature erythema etc. . They systems and may then use non traumatized tissue as a control relative to the monitored traumatized tissue as discussed above and below. The process then continues and it may continue with Steps through of .

In addition to helping the medical practitioner locate the appropriate positions for sensors that monitor the compartments of the leg the system may easily measure and monitor conditions for acute compartment syndrome ACS in a forearm which is known to one of ordinary skill the art as the second most common area for ACS relative to the legs. The system may easily monitor the four different compartments of a forearm which include the following A mobile wad extensor carpi radilis longus brevis and the brachioradilis B Deep flexors flexor digitorum profundus C Superficial flexors flexor digitorum superficialis other flexors wrist pronator teres and D Extensors wrist finger extensors supinator.

The system may provide specific placement instructions including illustrations or video for positioning sensors for measuring and monitoring ACS in a forearm. The system may help the medical practitioner locate the muscles in the forearm. The system may help the medical practitioner identify these muscles by indicating that the muscles are often found more in the proximal than the distal one half of the forearm when the muscle belly of the forearm is typically located. The system may help the medical practitioner place the sensors in the proximal one half of the forearm and over the distal one half of the forearm as possible.

The system may help the medical practitioner to account for the rotation of a forearm to ensure appropriate monitoring and placement of the sensors . The system may prompt the medical practitioner to position the sensors when the forearm is in neutral rotation in which the thumb of the patient is pointing forward or ventral. The system may also monitor conditions in any location of the distal portion of the arm such as but not limited to a hand finger palm thenar hypothenar eminence wrist etc.

Referring to this figure is logic flow diagram illustrating an exemplary method for positioning sensors on an arm and for monitoring conditions for ACS according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. This method describes steps that can be used with either the oxygenation sensing system or the combined system as discussed above. The method may also be part of method of in that the steps of method could be part of Step of in which proper positions for sensors are identified.

Step is the first step in the process in which instructions are displayed on the display device C for entering new patient information into the combined system or into the oxygenation sensing system . New patient information made include but is not limited to name address unique identifiers assigned by a medical facility insurance information and the like. This information can be entered in using a keyboard or keypad .

Next in step the combined system or the oxygenation sensing system may receive the new patient information and store it in memory such as memory storage of . Next in step one or more visuals illustrating how to reduce forearm fracture and how to align the arm in the fully supinated position may be provided on the display device C as provided in . Visuals may include but are not limited to graphical computer generated still images that may comprise digital photographs and text as well as video which comprises moving images. The visuals may also comprise computer generated images that provide illustrations instead of digital photographs or any combination thereof. The visuals may or may not be accompanied by audio information such as a narrator describing proper placement of the sensors .

Next in step one or more visuals illustrating how sensors are placed roughly down the forearm closer to the elbow then the wrist may be provided on display device C as set forth in . In step one or more visuals illustrating how to palpate the ulna of the forearm may be provided on the display device C as provided in .

In step one or more visuals illustrating where to place a first sensor just volar to the ulna as provided in may prove provided on the display device . In step one or more visuals illustrating where to place a second sensor in the mid aspect of the volar surface of the forearm may be provided on the display device as illustrated in . Subsequently in step one or more visuals illustrating where to place a third sensor in line with the thumb and lateral epicondyle may be provided on the display device as set forth in .

Next in step one or more visuals may be displayed on the display device illustrating where to place a fourth sensor just dorsal to the ulna as set forth in . In step the system or oxygenation sensing system may receive confirmation from each of the sensors to indicate that they are properly connected to the CPU A. In step the system may initiate readings from the sensors .

In step which is similar to step the medical practitioner may identify which sensors are monitoring healthy or non traumatized tissue and which sensors are monitoring traumatized tissue. As noted above with respect to injured tissue often becomes a Privileged area relative to other healthy body parts in that the body will typically maintain increased perfusion over other areas that are not injured even in times of poor global perfusion hypotension . The oxygenation sensing system and or combined system may be designed to accommodate or to account for the different physiological states of injured or traumatized tissue A B. Either system or may adjust its one or more monitoring algorithms depending upon the state of the tissue.

Also in this step either system or may automatically identify which tissue is traumatized and which is not. The systems and may make these determinations based on detected tissue characteristics such as temperature erythema etc. . They systems and may then use non traumatized tissue as a control relative to the monitored traumatized tissue as discussed above and below. The process then continues and it may continue with Steps through of .

The combined system may execute algorithms that are designed for specific medical conditions. For example the combined system may execute an algorithm that is specifically for traumatized tissue. According to such a traumatized tissue algorithm the system could record NIRS values from the oxygenation system on the order of minutes instead of smaller increments like seconds or milliseconds since conditions for traumatized tissue do not change that rapidly relative to seconds or milliseconds. However changes may be detected across a scale of minutes such as on the order of every five minutes or so. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the invention is not limited to taking readings every five minutes and can include other magnitudes depending on the tissue patient being monitored. With monitoring traumatized tissue one of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that a medical practitioner usually only needs to know trends conveyed by the collected data to assess healing progress or any complications.

For this specific yet exemplary application the system in monitoring traumatized tissue may use delays to determine if changes are maintained or if they are artifact such as changes detected due to patient movement . The system may be smooth out data by using these delays. The system may signal an audio or visual alarm or both if a trend is maintained for predetermined period of time that can be adjusted by the medical practitioner. For example the medical practitioner could request the system to activate an alarm if a trend of data is constant over a period of two minutes five minutes or thirty minutes just to name a few. These periods set by the medical practitioner can be set to any length as desired by the medical practitioner.

The system may also delay or stop readings for a predetermined period of time in response to other devices acting on a patient. For example oxygenation system sensing may include a blood pressure cuff in addition to its blood pressure probe . The system may cease readings made by the oxygenation sensing system every time the blood pressure cuff cycles since perfusion will be decreased when the blood pressure cuff is expanded on the patient. The system should not activate an alarm every time the blood pressure cuff is inflated.

The system may have the function feature of accessing stored data from previous readings. Such a function feature is beneficial for when patients need to be disconnected to go to bathroom to get tests done or undergo surgery. Each sensor may be provided with a unique serial number or microchip so that the central controller C may recognize previous data from a particular sensor when it reviews its memory . In some exemplary embodiments each sensor may be provided with local memory storage See on the sensor itself.

Each sensor may be provided with labels to provide a user with information on what compartment the sensor should be placed on A or Ant or Anterior for the Anterior compartment or a number on it which then is used in the set up instruction . The combined system may permit set up instructions to be accessed from any screen provided on the display C to assist the medical practitioner with correct placement of the sensors on the tissue of interest.

The system may generate printed labels for each compartment that can be used by the medical practitioner. The medical practitioner can apply these labels on the tissue s of interest so that sensors are not switched if a sensor is removed temporarily for some reason.

The central controller C may be provided with one or more algorithms to determine if the tissue being monitored is a control or if it is the injured tissue based on detected tissue characteristics such as temperature erythema etc. . Once the central controller C determines if the monitored tissue is a control or injured tissue then it can treat readings appropriately. In other words the central controller C may shut off alarms for any tissue that it has determined to be designated as a control relative to an injured tissue being monitored. The designation of control or study injured can be assigned manually for each sensor.

With control tissue the system may determine that if control readings are going down or if a downward trend is detected then the system may alert the medical practitioner that a systemic problem such as a hypotensive condition may be present. The system may also account for body positions of the patient. The system may have predetermined off sets to adjust for positional effects of the patient such as the lying down seated and standing positions . Each sensor may be provided with a motion or gravity sensing device such as accelerometer s to determine a relative position of a patient and or position of the tissue of interest.

The sensors may be formed as a horse tail sensor that comprises one wire that breaks into four sensors with one to two feet or longer of cord for placement on a leg or an arm. One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that the invention is not limited to the exemplary dimensions disclosed and that other dimensions are well within the scope of the invention. Each sensor may be provided with a single insertion plug to allow appropriate monitoring with each sensor labeled . A set such as four sensors grouped together may be plugged in as one unit so each sensor does not plug in individually and allow for them to be switched such as illustrated in .

Each sensor may be provided with physical markings such as with permanent letters and or numbers to allow accurate placement of sensors such as illustrated in . These permanent physical markings cannot be removed or switched permanent at time of manufacturing . Additionally for some sensors a right or left R L designation may also be provided if a particular sensor is sized and shaped for a particular side of an extremity or body part as illustrated in . If each sensor is provided with a unique identifier readable by the central controller C then the central controller can alert the medical practitioner that a particular sensor has been inadvertently relocated by comparing present readings with current readings.

Each sensor may be provided with mechanical features such as plugs with geometries that are easily gripped and matched appropriately with a corresponding socket so that they are easy for medical practitioners to plug in and to remove without inappropriately inadvertently switching sensors as illustrated in .

The system may provide visual instructions on the display device C on how to place sensors at start up. These instructions may be accessible at any time for reattachment of the sensors to the CPU A. Each sensor may be provided with batteries having a life of at least several hours to allow a patient to be transported. However other battery life sizes are possible and within the scope of the invention.

A system where the sensors may be detached from the monitoring system to allow for a smaller mobile device may be provided. This smaller system would still record data but not have the display capabilities interpretational functions and or an alarm system. However it would have a battery sensors and memory to allow for mobile monitoring.

The system may comprise algorithms that are specific or tailored for tissue regions of interest. For example the system may have algorithms specific to a forearm in which proximal sensors are evaluated or weighted secondary to tendon sensors placed distally. The algorithm may adjust or take into account any rotation of the arm. Sensors for the arm can be positioned distally such as on but not limited to the fingers palm thenar and hypothenar eminence just to name a few. For the leg distal regions for sensors may include but are not limited to a plantar surface toes and the ankle. For torso regions sensors may be positioned on the abdomen as well for abdominal compartment syndrome or any other area of the body like the spinal cord brain injury hand foot thigh buttocks etc.

It should be understood that the foregoing relates only to illustrate the embodiments of the invention and that numerous changes may be made therein without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as defined by the following claims.
