title: Concentric electric servomotor/gearbox drive
abstract: A drive system with a central longitudinal axis includes a brushless DC servomotor with a stator and a rotor disposed radially interior of the stator. The rotor defines a coaxial central void space. A planetary gear assembly connected to an input shaft and an output shaft is coaxially disposed in the central void space. A flange fixed to the rotor transfers torque to the input shaft. The ratio of the overall length of the drive system to its outer diameter is about one or less, thereby creating a power density along the central longitudinal axis that is greater than known electric motor/gear box drive systems.

The invention relates in general to electric motor gear drive systems and in particular to electric motor gear drive systems for use in areas with limited space.

Electric motors have been widely used to power machinery. Electric motors are matched to gear drives belts chains and other multipliers to provide more torque. In an environment where space and weight is limited the need for packaging efficiency overall size is a critical factor in the ultimate solution to a torque multiplier problem.

Traditional mounting of the electric motor is to the input face of the gearbox. Gearboxes are generally constructed in an inline or right angle configuration or use chain belt worm or gear drives to transfer motion from a motor to the gearbox. If there are limitations in the available space in the output axis direction an inline motor gearbox may be too long. Compared to an inline gearbox a right angle gearbox will shorten the output axis distance but will add to the space claim in the transverse axes. And the right angle gearbox requires the addition of a gear set i.e. bevel to accomplish the change in direction of motion which will usually limit the torque capacity of the drive. Higher torque capacity drives may require more space increase the overall system weight and have a lower efficiency for example worm drives .

Packaging of a parallel over and under type arrangement between the gearbox and electric motor will provide a short space claim along the output shaft axis but requires the addition of a transfer mechanism of some type chain belt gears etc. . Depending on the torque and speeds of the drive the transfer mechanism can add significant weight and space claim along with an increase in friction losses.

With respect to the electric motor brushless DC servo motors have a greater power density defined as torque output relative to volume of motor in a large diameter short axial length configuration than in a small diameter long axial length configuration. To gain the required torque output of a servomotor in the more traditional small diameter long axial length configuration the axial length can become prohibitive. In traditional systems the motor is mounted directly to the input face of the gearbox resulting in a cantilevered load that is borne by the gearbox structure and mounting. In high g loaded environments high acceleration the cantilevered load can put significant forces into the gearbox. These forces may require the use of a larger frame size configuration than usually needed for a given torque output thereby increasing the weight and space claim of the drive system.

One aspect of the invention is a drive system having a central longitudinal axis. The drive system includes a brushless DC servomotor having a stator and a rotor. The stator includes a stator housing and stator motor windings. The rotor is disposed radially interior of the stator motor windings. The rotor has a hollow cylindrical base and a plurality of magnets fixed to a radially exterior surface of the base. The hollow cylindrical base defines a central void space. The stator and rotor are coaxial with the central longitudinal axis.

A first rotor flange is coaxially fixed to one end of the rotor. The first rotor flange defines a central opening coaxial with the central longitudinal axis. The first rotor flange includes a first portion of a two portion torque transfer mechanism. An input shaft is disposed coaxially with the brushless DC servomotor. The input shaft includes a second portion of the two portion torque transfer mechanism. The second portion of the torque transfer mechanism is in engagement with the first portion on the first rotor flange.

A first stator flange is fixed to one end of the stator housing and is coaxial with the central longitudinal axis. The first rotor flange is concentrically disposed within the first stator flange. A roller bearing is interposed between the first stator flange and the first rotor flange to support the one end of the rotor. A second rotor flange is coaxially fixed to another end of the rotor. The second rotor flange defines a central opening coaxial with the central longitudinal axis.

A second stator flange is fixed to another end of the stator housing and is coaxial with the central longitudinal axis. The second rotor flange is concentrically disposed within the second stator flange. A second roller bearing is disposed between the second stator flange and the second rotor flange to support the other end of the rotor.

A planetary gear assembly is fixed to the second stator flange and is concentric with the central longitudinal axis. The planetary gear assembly includes a housing with a ring gear on an interior of the housing. The housing is disposed in the central void space of the rotor. The input shaft extends into the housing and is rotatable with respect to the housing. The planetary gear assembly further includes a sun gear fixed to and rotatable with the input shaft and a plurality of planet gears that simultaneously mesh with both the ring gear and the sun gear. The planetary gear assembly further includes a carrier rotatably fixed to each of the planet gears.

An output shaft is rotatably fixed to the carrier and is coaxial with the central longitudinal axis. The output shaft extends through the planetary gear housing. The drive system has an overall length L and an external diameter d. Preferably L d is about one or less than one.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A concentrically packaged electric servomotor and gearbox drive system can greatly reduce the space required along the axis of the output shaft and thereby solve the problem of packaging constraints on the available length of the servomotor and gearbox along the axis of the output shaft. The concentric servomotor gearbox drive system can reduce the space required along the transverse axes and the overall system weight compared to a known electric servomotor and gearbox packaged in a side by side configuration. The concentric servomotor gearbox drive system can also eliminate the transfer mechanism and the backlash of the transfer mechanism from motor output axis to the parallel gearbox output axis required in a side by side configuration. The concentric servomotor gearbox drive system advantageously uses the higher power density of a large diameter short axial length servomotor compared to the power density of a motor with a small diameter long axial length.

Packaging the servomotor and gearbox in a concentric fashion reduces interfaces which must be sealed for environmental protection. The electric servomotor and gearbox may share one integrated mounting structure. The servomotor gearbox drive system may include a feedback resolver and a brake for control of the rotary actuation of a shaft driven mechanism.

For a given torque output electric brushless DC servomotors can be configured in two general ways 1 multiple smaller diameter rotor stators oriented on the longitudinal axis or 2 large diameter short axial length rotor stators. The combination of a large diameter short axial length brushless DC servomotor disposed concentrically about an inline planetary gearbox can achieve an unmatched torque output for the axial space that is used.

The concentric electric servomotor gearbox drive provides a greater torque at the output shaft for a given axial length than comparable configurations of traditional servomotor gearbox combinations. An electrically actuated brake and motor feedback position resolver provide greater control of the output torque and speed curve. The servomotor rotor input shaft of the gearbox and output shaft of the gearbox are provided with roller bearings for reduced system friction. The invention may be packaged in an environmentally sealed housing that is sealed with for example O rings lip seals and gaskets.

The brushless DC servomotor drives a planetary gearbox to produce rotary motion and torque at the output shaft. The system is scalable to generate the necessary torques and speeds of output that the driven system requires. The mounting flange at the output shaft may be configured for various mounting schemes. The outboard flange opposite the mounting flange may be used to house and mount auxiliary components such as feedback devices resolvers tachometer switches and control devices brakes shock absorbers dampers .
