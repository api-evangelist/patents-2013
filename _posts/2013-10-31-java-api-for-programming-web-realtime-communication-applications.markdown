The present invention relates to a system and method for programming real time communication web applications. In particular the present invention relates to a JAVA API for programming server side Web real time applications.

With the explosive proliferation of IP enabled mobile and fixed devices capable of offering Web telecom and entertainment services such as 3G 4G enabled smart phones TVs home appliances gaming consoles and automobiles among others operators of mobile broadband and fixed networks are faced with the operational and business challenges of delivering innovative IP based communication services with maximum profitability. In order to achieve this goal customers are increasingly migrating away from expensive closed proprietary and application specific legacy platforms and towards low cost open standards based unified converged application platforms which dramatically lower the time and cost of adding new features and extensions to existing IP based communication services.

Session Initiation Protocol SIP is a control signaling protocol developed to manage interactive multimedia IP sessions including IP telephony presence and instant messaging. SIP is widely used in telecommunication networks. SIP and other communications centric protocols are complex and their implementation requires significant domain expertise. However SIP is not readily compatible with HTTP and use in the Internet domain.

The IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS is an architecture for an integrated network of telecommunications carriers that would facilitate the use of IP Internet Protocol for packet communications in all known forms over wireless or landline. Examples of such packet communications include traditional telephony fax e mail Voice over IP VoIP instant messaging IM videoconference sessions and video on demand VoD . IMS uses a Voice over IP VoIP and runs over the standard Internet Protocol IP . IMS gives network operators and service providers the ability to control and charge for each service. IMS architecture has the capability to support existing phone systems both packet switched and circuit switched . Thus IMS provides the interoperability security session management and QoS capabilities that telecommunications providers lack and desire. IMS is the de facto standard for next generation networks.

HyperText Markup Language HTML is the main markup language for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser. HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags. HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. HTML allows images and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings paragraphs lists links quotes and other items. It can embed scripts written in languages such as JavaScript which affect the behavior of HTML web pages. The purpose of a web browser is to read HTML documents and compose them into visible or audible web pages. The HTML environment has a well known behavior according to standards established by the World Wide Web Consortium W3C which is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web abbreviated WWW or W3 .

HTML5 introduced WebRTC application programming interfaces APIs that make it possible for applications that use JavaScript in an HTML5 environment to take part in real time communications. To make use of this capability applications that reside in the browser environment of one user need to exchange messages with another application to establish media connections. However the signaling process of exchanging and negotiating session information is not specified by W3C and is left to the application to implement. The problem is more complicated if it is desired to make a connection with a non browser media endpoint like a traditional telephony equipment.

It would be desirable provide access to the network services made available in the IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS from the HTML environment and in particular the HTML environments capable of real time communication environment for example HTML5. However extending IMS architecture to the HTML environment is difficult owing to incompatibility of SIP with HTTP over TCP IP and the requirement for domain expertise to overcome such incompatibility. There is presently no simple way to extend the network services of the IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS to HTML5 applications without radical changes to the IMS model and custom extensions to the HTML platform to permit a browser to be used as an endpoint for IMS services. Thus despite the desire to extend the enhanced capabilities that IMS provides to the HTML environment such integration has not been readily feasible.

It would therefore be desirable to provide a system and method for extending IMS architecture to the HTML environment which is effective and simple to implement.

It would further be desirable to provide a system and method for extending IMS architecture to the HTML environment without radical changes to the IMS model or custom extensions to the HTML platform.

It would further be desirable to provide a system and method for extending IMS architecture to the HTML environment which can be implemented without domain expertise.

It would still further be desirable to provide a system and method for extending IMS architecture to the HTML environment while also providing an application programming interface to facilitate programming of server side applications without domain expertise.

The present invention provides a system and method for extending IMS architecture to the HTML environment which overcomes the limitations of the state of the art.

The present invention provides a system and method for extending IMS architecture to the HTML environment which can be implemented without domain expertise.

The present invention provides a system and method for providing an application programming interface to facilitate programming of server side applications without domain expertise.

In part the system and method of the present invention provide a communication channel between an HTML capable application or operating system and the IMS core of a telecommunications network utilizing an integrated web enabled session border controller WSBC at the edge of the IMS architecture network. The system and method overcome the need for domain expertise of complex SIP and other communications centric protocols. The system and method provides a mechanism to combine complex signaling in the IMS telecommunications network into simple operations towards the Web. The present invention thereby provides a platform which enables telecommunications providers to provide a better end to end customer experience accessible from a wide variety of HTML capable consumer devices.

In an embodiment the system and method of the present invention comprise a client side controller a network side controller and a communications protocol for communicating between the client side controller and the network side controller. The client side controller provides a client side JavaScript API to interface with the HTML capable application or operating system and encapsulate the HTTP signaling layer. The network side controller component of the WSBC terminates the communications with the client side and parses and normalizes the communications into an internal protocol suitable for communication with IMS within legacy telecommunications network systems for example SIP and the like . The communications protocol provides a communication channel which is compatible with transmission over the Internet domain.

With HTML5 WebRTC APIs it is possible for applications that use JavaScript in a HTML5 environment like a web browser to take part in real time communications. Usually developers employ a centralized network side server which mediates manages and controls the users of HTML5 applications. A centralized server implementing a signaling engine can also communicate with non HTML5 endpoints within an IMS core. Such centralized servers hold application logic which controls manages and mediates the HTML5 endpoints and also helps such applications to integrate closely with internet and cloud services that are exposed by other providers e.g. FACEBOOK GOOGLE TWITTER etc. . These applications may also need to use one or more data storage technology like databases files etc. They may also need to make use of other technologies like Messaging Transactions WebServices etc. For developers to write an application that spans all of these they need a technology platform and API which does not exist today. Accordingly the present invention provides a JAVA application programming interface API which facilitates programming of server side real time communication applications.

In combination the system and method of the present invention provides a JAVA application programming interface to facilitate programming of server side real time communication applications while simultaneously providing a dedicated signaling channel for all the applications on the server side to interact with the HTML client using web real time communications. Thus in accordance with an embodiment of the invention a JAVA based component platform is provided. The component platform provides all standard JAVA components a developer will need to implement for handling the messages coming from HTML5 applications that employ WebRTC. The component platform also defines standard objects that are injected into such a component which hold the state of the communication between one or more endpoints. These objects are specified at different scopes and hence have different lifecycles. They can be used to control the application model control and data in an effective way.

Advantages of the JAVA API of embodiments of the present invention include enabling developers to implement applications that leverage real time communication capabilities in WebRTC enabling developers to implement signaling between HTML5 endpoints enabling developers to implement mashup and integration between WebServices enabling developers to integrate application with other server side JAVA thereby providing access enterprise application capabilities like Data Persistence Messaging Transactions etc.

Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the various embodiments when read in light of the accompanying drawings.

In the following description the invention will be illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings. References to various embodiments in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment and such references mean at least one. While specific implementations are discussed it is understood that this is provided for illustrative purposes only. A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other components and configurations may be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.

Furthermore in certain instances numerous specific details will be set forth to provide a thorough description of the invention. However it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known features have not been described in as much detail so as not to obscure the invention.

Common reference numerals are used to indicate like elements throughout the drawings and detailed description therefore reference numerals used in a figure may or may not be referenced in the detailed description specific to such figure if the element is described elsewhere. The first digit in a three digit reference numeral indicates the series of figures in which the element first appears.

For developers creating server side applications the key is to leverage existing knowledge and skill set to minimize additional time and resources required by security features implementation. The network side controller is associated with an API that supports multiple platforms running under multiple protocols and a set of client libraries to facilitate smooth development process. The network side controller also provides extensibility framework to extend the capabilities via protocol adaptors and API for the web developers to call the functions of network side controller from their applications. The network side controller supports multiple signaling protocols and ensures correct mapping of the signaling message and routing of the messages based on routing profiles.

JAVA API facilitates programming of server side applications for WebRTC. JAVA API is adapted to facilitate server side applications for real time communication with client side controller . As shown in JAVA API may be used in conjunction with any application servers performing real time communication including but not limited to networks side controller Application Server and external application server .

WebRTC applications may be utilized in networks to control the signaling and media streams setting up conducting and tearing down telephone calls or other interactive media communications Security e.g. protecting the network and devices from malicious attacks fraud and malformed packets topology hiding and encryption Connectivity e.g. facilitate network communication by NAT traversal SIP normalization and VPN connectivity Quality of Service QoS policy can include traffic policing resource allocation rate limiting call admission control measurement of call statistics and quality regulatory like lawful interception media trans coding P CSCF functionality etc. JAVA API facilitates programming of such applications. In an embodiment of the invention JAVA API can be used for example to write applications which allow network operators to manage WebRTC communications that are made on their networks fix or change protocols and protocol syntax to achieve interoperability and also overcome some of the problems that firewalls and network address translators NATs present for WebRTC communications.

Referring again to IMS Core IP Multimedia Subsystem or IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem is an architectural framework for delivering IP multimedia services. As shown in IMS Core comprises S CSCF P CSCF Media gateway controller function MGCF HSS Application Server and Media Server . These elements are shown as an example of conventional IMS architecture. IMS Core may contain additional and or different elements depending upon the implementation of a particular network. The present invention is not limited to any particular implementation of IMS Core . Indeed it is a feature of the present invention that it extends whatever features are present in IMS Core to the Internet domain.

To ease the integration with the Internet IMS uses IETF protocols wherever possible e.g. Session Initiation Protocol SIP . IMS Core includes network elements designed to interact with SIP User Agents and PSTN . As used herein a user agent is an SIP endpoint that can be considered anything that either originates or terminates a SIP session e.g. SIP Phones Soft Phones and the like. Typically such devices must be specifically designed to implement SIP in order to function as SIP User Agents . In addition the IMS Core can exchange signaling and media messages with a public switched telephone network PSTN . IMS Core facilitates access to multimedia and voice applications from wireless and wireline terminals to create a form of fixed mobile convergence FMC . This is done by having a horizontal control layer that isolates the access network from the service layer. From a logical architecture perspective services need not have their own control functions as the control layer is a common horizontal layer.

Referring again to the IMS Core shown in P CSCF represents the proxy call session control function which is an entry point for a SIP user agent and authenticates users and establishes IP security integration with the SIP user agent . Media gateway controller function MGCF is the entry point for signaling and media messages transmitted via public switched telephone network PSTN . MGCF and P CSCF are used to process ingoing and outgoing SIP signaling packets in the IMS Core . On the network side MGCF and P CSCF interact with S CSCF using Session Initiation Protocol SIP .

S CSCF is the central node of the signaling plane. It is a SIP server but also performs session control. S CSCF is located in the home network. It uses Diameter Cx and Dx interfaces to the Home Subscriber Server HSS to download user profiles and upload user to S CSCF associations. All necessary subscriber profile information is loaded from the HSS . S CSCF inspects every message from the SIP user agent and or other network elements and decides where the SIP message should be forwarded for service provision. An Application Server AS hosts and executes services and interfaces with the S CSCF using SIP. Additionally a media server provides media related functions such as media manipulation e.g. voice stream mixing and interfaces with the S CSCF using SIP. S CSCF may also allow for provisioning of services and or media services from an external server .

As described above the elements of IMS Core communicate with the central node of the signaling plane S CSCF using Session Initiation Protocol SIP alternative session oriented protocols may also be used . However SIP is not easily compatible with conventional protocols for transmission over the Web . Integration of IMS Core is therefore difficult owing to incompatibility of protocols used in the two different environments and the requirement for domain expertise to overcome such incompatibility. The present invention provides a solution to such problems and therefore allows for extending the IMS Core to the Web .

Network side controller is an entry point for HTTP traffic from Web . Network side controller . Network side controller terminates Internet domain communications with the client side and parses and normalizes the Internet domain communications into an internal protocol suitable for communicating with elements of the IMS Core e.g. S CSCF within legacy telecommunications network systems for example SIP and the like . Network side controller has the ability to leverage applications in the IMS application server instead of hosting a separate custom business application on its own thus greatly simplifying integration with IMS Core . JAVA API may be utilized to facilitate creation of WebRTC applications in Network side controller Application Server and or External Server . Network side controller communicates with client side controller using a protocol adapted to meet the real time signaling requirements of SIP while remaining compatible with transmission over Web .

The client side controller operating on User equipment provides client side JavaScript APIs to interface with HTML capable applications operating systems and encapsulate the HTTP signaling layer. The system and method thereby provides a dedicated signaling channel for all the HTML capable applications OS on the User Equipment to interact with the IMS Core of the telecommunications network and or HTML capable applications OS on other User Equipment not shown .

User equipment represents any HTML capable device including for example computing devices such as personal computers laptops desktops notebooks netbooks tablets mobile phones and e book readers. Moreover HTML capabilities are being added to consumer devices such as appliances automobiles set top boxes amplifiers audio visual components televisions projectors and the like. HTML capabilities may be provided by a browser for example Safari Firefox Chrome Browser and Internet Explorer. Alternatively HTML capabilities may be a core component of the operating system for example Chrome OS.

Referring again to JAVA component can be deployed in an application container . The application container can be an application server a web signaling sever or other software component e.g. Oracle Communications Converged Application Server OCCAS that can provide a runtime environment to instantiate the JAVA component . The JAVA component can act as a gateway between HTML5 applications that are in browsers and respectively and between an HTML5 application and a SIP user agent . In addition the JAVA component can implement logic which controls manages and mediates WebRTC communications between e.g. HTML5 applications . JAVA component can integrate closely with internet and cloud services that are exposed by other providers e.g. Facebook and Twitter .

In an embodiment of the invention each objects of the JAVA API may need a fair amount of boilerplate code to be instantiated. This boilerplate code can be generated automatically by a tool if the JAVA object is decorated with annotations. Injection is a special type of annotation that defines an injection point where the injected object can be instantiated by an application container . Annotations are often used by frameworks as a way of conveniently applying behaviors to user defined classes and methods that must otherwise be declared in an external source e.g. an XML configuration file or programmatically with API calls.

In an embodiment of the invention the annotation of the Board object can enable the JAVA component to get instantiated by the application container . The Board object can include functions and configurations that get the JAVA component ready for accepting signaling messages from an HTML5 application in a browser .

In an embodiment of the invention a PeerSession object can be the representation of a participant of WebRTC communication e.g. a caller and a callee. The Circuit object can be an interface or connection point where one or more PeerSession objects can be attached to. For example the JAVA component can attach multiple participants each represented by a PeerSession object to the Circuit to create a multi party conference call. The Link object can be a connection from a communication participant e.g. the HTML5 application to the JAVA component . For example it can be a WebSocket connection used to send or receive signaling messages exchanged between HTML5 application endpoints . The PeerSession the Link and the Circuit can be used by the JAVA component to set up a platform to mediate the signaling between a caller and a callee.

In an embodiment of the invention application developers can also create their own JAVA objects and inject them into the JAVA component . For example a Call object can be created to prepare and set up a PeerSession object . In an embodiment of the invention the PeerSession object for the caller can be populated with SDP information received from the HTML5 application . The Call object can also be injected into the JAVA component .

The JAVA component can include a handleOffer method that gets executed in the JAVA component . This method can intercept the signaling messages from a caller e.g. the HTML5 application and send them to a callee which can be an HTML5 application or a SIP user agent such as traditional telephony equipment. In this JAVA method application developers can insert business logic as appropriate and help the JAVA component to integrate closely with internet and cloud services that are exposed by other providers. Some examples are FACEBOOK GOOGLE TWITTER etc. The JAVA component can also use one or more data storage technology like Databases and Files and make use of other technologies like Messaging Transactions WebServices etc. by inserting business logic in this method. A call can be any media initiation from the HTML5 application to the HTML5 application

In an embodiment of the invention the handleOffer method can process signaling messages based on the payload or protocol type. The annotated objects SignalSelector and MessageSelector can be instantiated by the application container to make this selection. The SignalSelector selects a signaling message to process based on the content of the payload of a signaling message it does not depend on a protocol. The MessageSelector however can process protocol specific messages and has additional capabilities to inspect the contents of the signaling message and decide whether to process it based on the action type of a signaling message. In an embodiment of the invention protocol adaptors need to be deployed on the application container for the MessageSelector to work.

In an embodiment of the invention the HandleAnswer method is where the HTML5 application answers the call. Here the JAVA component retrieves the PeerSession for the caller by the identifier of the caller contained in the Call object . The PeerSession for the caller has been created and attached to the Circuit in the handleOffer method . From the PeerSession for the caller a connection can be established through which signaling messages can be exchanged. Similarly in this method business logic can be inserted cloud services can mashed up and other technologies like Messaging Transactions WebServices etc can be integrated with the JAVA component .

In an embodiment of the invention the JAVA component is a standard JAVA component that can be deployed as such. Additional methods can be added as application developers would normally do to a standard JAVA class. For example a method can be added and implemented to handle JSONrtc a proprietary protocol based on JSON and WebSocket.

The JAVA API provides application developers a tool facilitating coding of JAVA applications that can be deployed on a server to interact with HTML5 applications in a browser environment and perform business logic as appropriate. In addition JAVA applications written using the JAVA API can serve as a platform to integrate with services and applications provided by third party vendors.

In an embodiment of the invention the JAVA API can be used to write applications that can serve as a signaling gateway between HTML5 applications and between HTML5 applications and non HTML5 applications. To achieve this purpose the JAVA API can connect with legacy IMS systems and services using existing JAVA APIs such as SIP servlets thus enabling protocol translation and creating a gateway with IMS services. In an embodiment of the invention a JAVA application can be written using the JAVA API with one side being a peer session and the other side being a SIP session or XMPP session thus completing a protocol gateway.

Step involves creating a session object for a caller and a session object for a callee using the PeerSession object and the Call object and attaching both session objects to the Circuit object. The PeerSession object represents an HTML5 endpoint and contains information for the HTML5 application e.g. an identifier of the HTML5 application. The Circuit object represents an interface that the JAVA component uses to attach two or more PeerSession objects thus creating call between two or more parties each party represented by a PeerSession.

At Steps and the application developer can write code to process the signaling messages based on a set of rules. For example the processing logic can decide whether to process a signaling message based on the action type of the message. In addition the business logic can be implemented here to perform desired actions e.g. connecting to Facebook or Twitter or integrating with other cloud services exposed by service providers. Finally at Step the JAVA component can be deployed on an application server e.g. Oracle s OCCAS.

Further details of an embodiment of a system for enabling the extension of the IMS Core to WebRTC communications are shown in where network side controller is implemented as ORACLE WebRTC Session Controller WSC which includes a signaling engine WSC SE that handles the signaling and a media engine WSC ME that handles the media.

RTC Controller provides scalable signaling over HTTP web centric protocols for communicating over Web with RTC Client Signaling Controller . RTC Controller communicates with RTC Client Signaling Controller via WebSocket interface . RTC Controller provides a highly available encapsulated front end interface to the web developer. The RTC Controller terminates the Internet domain communications with the client side by managing the WebSocket connections. The RTC Controller also parses and processes the Internet domain communications. The RTC Controller normalizes the Internet domain communications into an internal SIP for communication within Gateway . Thus RTC Controller communicates internally with Service Composition Controller using a binary SIP.

Service Composition Controller provides for service composition and orchestration across domains and different providers. The Service Composition Controller also provides a unified layer to inject charging and policy control for differentiated service offerings. In an embodiment the functionality of Service Composition Controller can be integrated in to a converged application server for example ORACLE Communications Converged Application Server OCCAS . Alternatively the functionality of Service Composition Controller can be integrated in to a service controller for example ORACLE Communications Service Controller OCSC .

Service Composition Controller adopts and reuses existing internal communication services with support for different signaling protocols. Thus for example Service Composition Controller can mediate Internal Services providing network telephony signaling using the SS7 protocol and Internal Services providing services using internet protocol . Service Composition Controller and Gateway may be implemented using Application Container JAVA Component and JAVA API as previously described.

Service Composition Controller can also mediate the provision of external services provided by an external service provider . Communication with external provider can be conducted using a selected signaling protocol SIP XMPP etc as required by the external provider . Services provided by external provider can include web services provided over Web to a browser client on user equipment . Service Composition Controller thus enables external providers of over the top OTT services to provide OTT services to users clients. The gateway system enables the external providers to make use of the real time communication signaling over IMS. The users clients can then access web applications provided by external providers from a browser on the user equipment.

The gateway system acts as the IMS proxy for both HTML5 and external providers by taking advantage of WebSocket technology to enable and expedite the IMS deployment. The WebSocket Protocol defines a mechanism for fast secure two way communication between a client and a server over the Web. Data is transferred over a full duplex single socket connection allowing messages to be sent and received from both endpoints in real time. To establish a WebSocket connection a specific HTTP based handshake is exchanged between the client and the server. If successful the application layer protocol is upgraded from HTTP to WebSocket using the previously established TCP transport layer connection. After the handshake HTTP is no longer used and data can be sent or received using the WebSocket protocol by both endpoints until the WebSocket connection is closed.

RTC Client Signaling Controller is resident on user equipment and manages multiplexing of signaling request response for all client side applications mediating communication with RTC Controller over HTTP web centric protocols. The particular HTTP protocol used can be defined as required by the particular native or external service for example JSON XML XMPP Skype protocol etc. A client side library of available protocols is provided as part of an SDK in order to extend the services to the client.

For telephony applications low power consumption by user equipment is desirable. Accordingly RTC Client Signaling Controller can be placed in standby operation when not involved in signaling. Moreover WebSocket protocol must be initiated from the client side and is also responsible for keeping the connection alive. Thus the RTC Client Signaling Controller will shut down the WebSocket Connection when there is no traffic. RTC Push Notification Controller can be used by RTC Controller to wake up RTC Client Signaling Controller from the standby state in order to resume communication. The RTC Push Notification Controller may in some embodiments also be used for other notifications such as call notifications message notifications and the like. In an alternative embodiment the keepalive and pingpong capabilities of the WebSocket protocol may be used to maintain WebSocket connection.

RTC Push Notification Controller includes a server side HTTP connection based Push Notification to wake up the client side signaling process. RTC Client Signaling Controller can utilize any push notification mechanism and protocol effective for user equipment . For example RTC Push Notification Controller can utilize the SMS message system to activate RTC Client Signaling Controller thereby causing RTC Client Signaling Controller to reactivate the WebSocket connection with the RTC Controller .

WSC including runtime module supports multiple signaling protocols and ensures correct mapping of the signaling message using parameter transformation module and correct routing of the messages based on routing profiles using routing manager . Parameter transformation routing and JSON templating are all configurable using a configuration file .

WSC performs protocol mapping between the selected client side protocol and the network side protocol SIP . For example WSC is adapted to receive a JSON message parse the SDP information and map it to other supported protocols SIP XMPP . WSC maintains a data definition for the format to parse to. When the JSON request is received at WSC the transformation between the data definition and the JSON message structure must be implemented.

WSC acts as a cross protocol signaling engine. WSC handles the protocol associated state as demanded by the protocol. When WSC is acting as a cross protocol gateway for example JSON WebSocket to SIP the SIP side of WSC maintains the transaction and dialog state. WSC includes a protocol state management module which manages the protocol state and ensures state replication for reliability of message exchange. WSC has the ability to manage enormous amounts of concurrent client connections in order to be able to scale to the applications and users on the web.

For developers the key is to leverage existing knowledge and skill sets to minimize additional time and resources required by security features implementation. WSC comes with APIs that support multiple platforms running under multiple protocols and a set of client libraries to facilitate smooth development process. WSC thus additionally provides an extensibility framework to extend the capabilities via protocol adaptors and APIs for the web developers to call the WSC functions from their applications. The extensibility may be supported by Application Container JAVA Component and JAVA API as previously described.

WSC provides signaling adaption such that WSC handles all the signaling between the browser client and the network end point SIP Proxy PSTN Gateway for example . WSC is adapted to handle the message exchange using several protocols over WebSocket RFC 6455 including for example JSON based protocol via JSON Stack XMPP sub protocol via XMPP Stack SIP sub via SIP Stack BOSH XEP 0124 and COMET Bayeux protocol not shown . On the network carrier side the WSC supports translation into a suitable communication protocol or protocols e.g. XMPP SIP and the like . Thus for example on the network carrier side WSC supports SIP RFC 3261 .

Security for real time communication over the Web requires that the communicating endpoints be able to authenticate each other. While these end points are making calls through the signaling services their identities are authenticated via an Identity Provider Management Module IDP that supports OAuth Facebook Connect FBC and other Identity Protocols using extensions e.g. OpenID connect . IDP Management modules interact with internal and or external user database and identity servers .

WSC thereby acts as an identity service that can attest the identity of the caller of the received request and map it to the from identity of the outbound call. For example WSC includes OAUTH module which introduces security functions that authenticate and authorize the browser based applications to interact with the network services. WSC thereby provides service providers with the ability to control any third party partner s access and usage of its network capabilities.

Establishing real time communication over the Web also utilizes verification of service level agreements SLA for the user and application. SLA Management module includes an authentication module as well as an application SLA module and network SLA module which communicate with internal and or external databases to verify that the communications are provided in conformance with the relevant service level agreements for the user and application.

In a particular embodiment WSC defines a JavaScript Object Notation JSON protocol that is used for exchanging information and to control the set up of media between a browser client and WSC . JSON is a lightweight data interchange format however other data interchange formats may be used in alternative embodiments. The JSON protocol can be used on multiple transports COMET BOSH and WebSocket . When used on WebSocket transport the protocol is defined as a sub protocol of the WebSocket protocol.

The JSON protocol or alternative data interchange format defines the basic structure for the information transfer between the browser client and WSC . The JSON protocol defines the minimum set of messages and state machinery necessary to implement the offer answer model. The JSON protocol defines the message structure that accounts for the reliability reconnect retransmissions timeouts etc of the message. The JSON protocol also handles the necessary headers to function in multilevel secure environment security headers .

WSC also provides an internal routing manager for the routing of the requests to the appropriate end nodes based on variety of parameters. There are multiple WSC instances see and each instance is connected to the network node serving the functionality. The incoming requests JSON messages for example have to be routed to the right application and instance. WSC uses routing manger to route incoming requests based on their origination and destination. WSC provides functionality including performing look ups and route requests for JSON to SIP JSON to XMPP SIP to XMPP XMPP to SIP. Each route in the routing manager has a routing profile. WSC provides a default routing profile and additional routing profiles are configurable as needed or desired.

WSC ensures reconnection of clients due to failover or loss of connectivity. Clients and servers use an implicit sequence numbering protocol for the message transported by the connection. Clients and the servers each maintain their own sequence number. Both client and server acknowledge their receipt of messages by sending acknowledgement ack messages. As per the protocol an ack message indicates that the message has reached the destination as well as all the messages lower than that sequence . Similarly an error message shall be defined as in the JSON protocol section to indicate that the message with a sequence number has met with an error. Retransmission Queue A B allows for retransmission of messages for which there is an error or lack of acknowledgement.

One way in which WSC maintains reliability is to keep the relevant conversation state redundant across different servers A B having instances of WSC . WSC provides for state maintenance and session state mapping across protocols. The relevant conversation state includes a Web Side State Machine and SIP Side State Machine for each In Flight Transaction . WSC maintains the session states both client and server side state in the cache. In order to ensure reliability the cached copy of the state machines is duplicated on several servers. Additionally retransmission queue A B is duplicated across servers A B. WSC uses coherence for state storage and management. If a server for example server A cannot be contacted due to a network failure WSC ensures that the state is retrieved from another active server B as shown by the dashed arrows .

In an embodiment application is a JavaScript Application. Application operates at a high level without having to deal with peer connection directly. The browser client is stateless and contains as little of the implementation of the transport establishment code as possible. Browser client identifies the capabilities of the browser client and user equipment for streaming media. The capabilities are provided to the SDP adapter of the application . SDP adapter provides a description of streaming media initialization parameters a session profile suitable for streaming media to the browser client running on user equipment .

A client side library of available protocols is provided as part of a Client SDK in order to extend the services to the browser client . The particular HTTP protocol used can be defined as required by the particular native or external service for example JSON XML XMPP Skype protocol etc. In a preferred embodiment a JSON protocol is used for communication between client side RTC signaling controller and WSC as described above.

Protocol serialization interacts with protocol state view and connection manger to communicate with WSC over Web . Session Control establishes reliable connection with WSC . This session can be used by the application to create or invoke other objects.

RTC signaling controller comprises a JavaScript SDK which provides the functions necessary for application to manage server connections connection establishment teardown via WebSocket . The JavaScript SDK provides functions necessary to handle the state machine and functions to deal with interoperability issues. For example the JavaScript SDK of application provides functions to create messages or insert messages into the state machine. The JavaScript SDK also provides functions for the client to monitor connection health including the ability to reconnect in case of stale connections and the ability to synchronize state from the server and add modified state back to the server.

JavaScript SDK also provides an application programming interface API which can modify and optimize media parameters session description protocol SDP etc. The API abstracts out complex functionality and provides API to deal with the real time communication session Call etc. The API provides the ability to handle call states media states subscriptions and notifications.

In operation HTML5 applications access the JavaScript APIs to get access to various communication objects as defined in the API . An HTML5 application will create a session object . The session object acts as browser side representation of the communication. From session object application can create different communication objects like Call Subscription etc. The HTML5 application can listen on the callbacks from the objects to receive incoming calls notifications media in the call state changes etc.

The Interactive Connectivity Establishment ICE draft developed by the IETF s MMUSIC working group provides a framework to unify the various NAT traversal techniques. ICE defines a standardized method for clients to determine what type of firewall s exist between clients and determine a set of IP addresses by which clients can establish contact. When an ICE enabled client the initiator wishes to communicate with another device the responder it first collects information on addresses where the client can receive IP traffic. A key benefit that ICE provides is the ability to unify the information provided by these various sources of IP address information to create as many paths as possible by which the endpoints can be reached.

For real time communication over the Web the ICE state machine is maintained by the browser client . When the browser client reloads the application has no knowledge of the ICE Candidates and is forced to perform ICE restart. In order to avoid this application can save this information in WSC . When the initial ICE negotiation finishes the browser client sends the nominated ICE candidate pair of IP addresses to the application which saves this information in WSC . When the browser client reloads the application will fetch the nominated ICE candidate information from the server and then send it to the browser client . This will tell the browser client to use these candidates for media transfer. Since the browser client has kept the local nominated ICE candidate alive all the time as long as the remote side has not released the call the transfer will succeed.

Although the invention has been described above with respect to communication services in a telecommunications network the invention also finds application in any situation where it is necessary or desirable to provide real time communication signaling.
