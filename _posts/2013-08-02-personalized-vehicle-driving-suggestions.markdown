title: Personalized vehicle driving suggestions
abstract: In many vehicular control contexts, a vehicle may monitor the vehicle input control from a driver to detect warning conditions that entail a warning to the user and/or an automatic mitigating action (e.g., detecting hard braking that causes brake lockup, and automatically activating anti-lock braking). Warning and mitigation techniques may address the instant driving conditions, but may not the user driving behavior that caused the condition (e.g., a driving style of the user that resulted in hard braking, such as excessive speed for current driving conditions). Presented herein are techniques for monitoring the user driving behavior of the user in various driving contexts, and presenting driving suggestions of alternative driving behaviors providing advantages over the current user driving behavior of the user. The presentation of the alternative driving behaviors to the user may facilitate changes in user driving behavior that improve the safety, efficiency, and/or comfort of the driving experience.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve the detection of vehicle control input by a user while controlling a vehicle in a driving context. For example a driver of an automobile may manipulate the gas brake gearshift and steering wheel and a device on board the automobile may monitor the vehicle control input to control the automobile according to the input from the user. The device may also evaluate the vehicle control input as a safety precaution e.g. upon detecting a firm application of the brakes resulting in a lockup condition the vehicle may instead activate an antilock braking system that modifies the user s vehicle control input to provide a less firm braking pattern with greater stopping power. The device may also warn the user if the vehicle control input creates a dangerous condition e.g. in a manual transmission automobile upon detecting acceleration into an engine speed range that is beyond the efficient range of the current gear the automobile may advise the driver to upshift and upon an airplane engine falling below a maintainable speed an airplane may warn the pilot of an imminent stall and advise increasing the speed . These monitoring and user feedback techniques may assist the user in the moment to moment control of the vehicle.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

While it may be advantageous to monitor the current conditions of a vehicle for warning conditions and advise the user as to the immediate situation may be advantageous such techniques may be of limited value in changing the driving behavior of the user that led to the warning conditions. As a first example while it may be advantageous to remediate hard braking that may create a lockup scenario by activating antilock braking systems such warnings neither inform the user of the scenario that led to the lockup scenario such as excessive speed for the current driving context inadequate use of headlights e.g. failure to activate high beams or fog lamps or inadequately maintained braking distance with respect to a leading vehicle. As a second example an instance of improper gear selection in a manual transmission vehicle may be remediated by advising the driver to upshift or downshift but such instructions do not address the cause of the improper gear selection e.g. early or late shifting while accelerating or decelerating . In these scenarios either the driver may simply not be aware of the driving behaviors that led to the warning condition and the remediating notification or action the driver may be aware of the cause but may not understand the alternative driving behaviors that may mitigate or avoid the warning condition the driver may be aware of both the causal driving behaviors and the alternative driving behaviors but may not perceive the advantages of the alternative behaviors or the driver may simply have trouble breaking the habit of a disadvantageous driving behavior.

Presented herein are techniques for automatically assisting drivers in improving driving behaviors based on personalized suggestions. In accordance with these techniques a device may monitor a vehicle control input of the vehicle by the user to identify driving behaviors of the user in a driving context. That is rather than simply monitoring the control input of the vehicle and providing ameliorating actions and advice based on the control input such as hard braking or improper gear selection such techniques involve an identification of the user driving behaviors that motivated the input such as the driving style of the user that led to the control input such as excessive speed delayed reaction overreaction or improper perception of driving context . The techniques also involve identifying at least one alternative driving behavior providing an advantage over the user driving behavior of the user for operating the vehicle in the driving context and presenting a driving suggestion to the user of the alternative driving behavior. These techniques may serve to automatically identify and inform the user of changes in driving style that may provide advantages in the operation of the vehicle such as safety reliability comfort and economy of costs and resources.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

In the field of vehicles many scenarios involve a device configured to monitor user control input provided to a vehicle. The device may utilize such input e.g. to translate the user control input to the mechanics of the vehicle and to achieve the intent of the user control input to manage related operating parameters of the vehicle in response to the user control input e.g. adjusting spark ignition timing in response to the accelerator and recording the user control input e.g. an odometer tracking the mileage of a vehicle .

In many such scenarios the monitoring is utilized to evaluate the user control input of the user and in some cases to alter or respond to the user control input in furtherance of conditions such as safety and efficiency. As a first such example a device may monitor the acceleration rate of the vehicle and upon detecting rapid acceleration that is indicative of a collision may activate an airbag. As a second such example antilock braking systems are designed to detect a current braking rate selected by the user and upon detecting hard braking with a tendency to lock up the brakes e.g. upon detecting loss of traction the device may alter the braking rate to an intermittent pattern that provides greater stopping power than sliding induced by continuous braking. As a third such example a hybrid gearshift may provide a mode enabling a user to select a gear but upon detecting a selection of a gear that is not suitable for the current speed of the vehicle and engine may restrict the selection of the selected gear or may select a more suitable gear. Such systems may also advise the user regarding the results of the current selection e.g. that the currently selected gear may damage the vehicle and or advising the user to select a different gear that is more suitable to the present operation of the vehicle . These and other techniques may be utilized to monitor and respond to the user control input of the user to the vehicle in furtherance of advantages such as safety efficiency and comfort of the vehicle.

However devices that monitor the user control input of a user and alter the conditions based on the instant condition of the vehicle or that advise the user to operate the vehicle differently to alleviate an instant problem such as incorrect gear selection may not be capable of addressing the causes of the problems. illustrates exemplary scenarios in which monitoring altering and advising the user regarding the instant conditions of the vehicle may fail to achieve some advantages that may be achievable in other techniques. In a first exemplary scenario of at a first time point and in a particular driving context e.g. sunny daytime weather a user of a second vehicle may operate the vehicle at a particular speed e.g. 45 kilometers per hour and while maintaining a particular braking distance with respect to a first leading vehicle . At a second time point the user of the first vehicle may activate brakes resulting in a hard stop and skidding and the user of the second vehicle may also activate the brakes to avoid a collision. The degree of braking may ordinarily result in a lockup condition that extends the braking distance and results in a collision. Instead the vehicle may activate antilock brakes in order to shorten the achieved braking distance and to stop the second vehicle with a braking margin from the first vehicle and to avoid a collision. The vehicle may also present an antilock braking warning to the user to indicate the use of this braking system. Accordingly the user may correctly perceive that the braking distance form the first vehicle was adequate for the driving context . However in a similar second scenario the user may also operate the vehicle with a braking distance from a first vehicle . However a different driving context of rainy weather may alter the road surface and when the first vehicle activates brakes the same amount of braking and even the activation of the antilock braking system may be unable to mitigate the extended braking distance and may result in a collision .

In the scenarios illustrated in the exemplary scenarios of it may be appreciated that the antilock braking system may have performed adequately in both scenarios even in the second scenario resulting in a collision the reduced braking distance achieved by antilock braking may significantly reduce the severity of the collision . However the active monitoring and response to the instant conditions of the vehicle was inadequate to avoid a collision or to address the cause of the collision i.e. the selected braking distance maintained by the user with respect to the first vehicle . That is the responsiveness of the antilock braking system in the first scenario did not alter the user driving behavior of the user and the same user driving behavior led to the collision in the second exemplary scenario . Indeed the automated activation of the antilock braking system may have reinforced an incorrect perception of the user as to safe braking distances in various driving contexts as an example of the psychological concept identified as moral hazard. 

By contrast the collision in the exemplary first scenario of may have been avoided by other techniques addressing the cause of the collision such as advising the user as to proper braking distances . That is alternative or in addition to advising the user of current conditions e.g. applying antilock brakes to avoid a collision a device may advise the user regarding braking distances both in the instant circumstance and more generally. For example in the second exemplary scenario many thought processes of the user may have resulted in the selection of an inadequate braking distance . As a first example the user may not have understood the inadequacy of the braking distance e.g. an inexperienced driver may not have understood the effect of rain on the road surface . In part the user may have felt that the braking distance was adequate because of the avoidance of the collision in the first exemplary scenario . As a second example the user may have understood the inadequacy of the braking distance but may have incorrectly perceived the availability or value of an alternative selection e.g. that even a modest extension of the braking distance may have significantly reduced the odds of a collision . As a third example the user may have generally understand safe braking distance the inadequacy of the current braking distance and the advantage of leaving an extended braking distance but may simply have failed to attend to the instant scenario e.g. selecting an inadequate braking distance due to distraction habit or an overestimation of the braking distance to the leading vehicle .

These and other factors relating to the user driving behavior of the user with respect to braking distance may have significantly caused the collision in the second exemplary scenario of . It may be appreciated that a device may have automatically monitored the braking distance with respect to a current vehicle and warned the user as to the adequacy of the braking distance e.g. noting in the second exemplary scenario of the extended braking distance due to the rainy weather driving context thus prompting the user to leave more distance that may have avoided the collision . Moreover such advising may assist the user in other driving scenarios such as when operating a different vehicle that is not equipped with a monitoring and advising device.

Presented herein are techniques for assisting a user in the control of a vehicle through personalized advice as to the user driving behaviors of the user. In accordance with these techniques a device may monitor the vehicle control input of the vehicle by a user in order to identify a user driving behavior of the user in a driving context . The device may also identify at least one alternative driving behavior providing an advantage over the user driving behavior of the user for operating the vehicle in the driving context and present to the user a driving suggestion of the alternative driving behavior in the driving context .

The techniques presented herein may confer various advantages as compared with other techniques for responding to user control input such as the exemplary scenarios of . As a first example the techniques presented herein involve the determination of advantageous alternative driving behaviors in view of the user driving behaviors of the particular user . That is the driving suggestions presented herein are personal to the user e.g. a user may not be persuaded by general advice such as slower speeds reduce accidents but may be persuaded by personalized advice such as you are 25 more likely to be involved an accident than if you typically drove 2 km h more slowly. In addition such personalization avoids presenting driving suggestions that are not applicable to the user e.g. it may be undesirable to notify the user that slower speeds typically cause fewer accidents if the typical speed of the user is already optimal for accident avoidance as such inapplicable suggestions may desensitize the user to the presentation of driving suggestions . As a second example the techniques presented herein involve the monitoring of user driving behaviors in particular driving contexts to provide contextual suggestions e.g. particularly examining the typical speed of the user in rainy driving conditions to determine and suggest advantages relating to the speed of the vehicle in rainy driving conditions. As a third example the techniques presented herein are based on the determination of an alternative driving behavior and a specific advantage . For example antilock braking systems may detect and notify the user of currently low traction on an icy road but if the user is unaware of any way of achieving greater traction then the presentation of the notification is futile. Rather the techniques presented herein involve identifying a driving suggestion that confers an advantage such as driving slower leaving more braking distance or braking less firmly as driving suggestions for achieving greater traction in low traction scenarios. These and other advantages may be achievable by the techniques presented herein.

Still another embodiment involves a computer readable medium comprising processor executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may include e.g. computer readable storage media involving a tangible device such as a memory semiconductor e.g. a semiconductor utilizing static random access memory SRAM dynamic random access memory DRAM and or synchronous dynamic random access memory SDRAM technologies a platter of a hard disk drive a flash memory device or a magnetic or optical disc such as a CD R DVD R or floppy disc encoding a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may also include as a class of technologies that are distinct from computer readable storage media various types of communications media such as a signal that may be propagated through various physical phenomena e.g. an electromagnetic signal a sound wave signal or an optical signal and in various wired scenarios e.g. via an Ethernet or fiber optic cable and or wireless scenarios e.g. a wireless local area network WLAN such as WiFi a personal area network PAN such as Bluetooth or a cellular or radio network and which encodes a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein.

An exemplary computer readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in wherein the implementation comprises a computer readable medium e.g. a CD R DVD R or a platter of a hard disk drive on which is encoded computer readable data . This computer readable data in turn comprises a set of computer instructions configured to operate according to the principles set forth herein. In a first such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to advise a user in the operation of a vehicle such as the exemplary method of . In a second such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to implement a system for advising a user in the operation of a vehicle such as the exemplary system of . Some embodiments of this computer readable medium may comprise a nontransitory computer readable storage medium e.g. a hard disk drive an optical disc or a flash memory device that is configured to store processor executable instructions configured in this manner. Many such computer readable media may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

Some embodiments of the techniques presented herein may involve an interoperation of devices in order to achieve the techniques presented herein. presents an illustration of an exemplary scenario featuring a distributed technique involving a server intercommunicating with a device in order to advise a user in the operation of a vehicle . In this exemplary scenario the device detects vehicle control input provided by the user e.g. input to the accelerator brake gearshift and steering wheel while operating the vehicle in a driving context and sends the vehicle control input to the server e.g. through a wireless uplink with a communications network such as the internet . The server performs a driving behavior evaluation e.g. by performing an exemplary method beginning at and involving executing instructions on a processor of the server . In particular the instructions involve receiving from respective vehicles at least one vehicle control input of the vehicle to identify a user driving behavior of the user in a driving context identifying based on the vehicle control input and for the vehicle driving context at least one alternative driving behavior providing an advantage for vehicles operating in the driving context and instructing at least one vehicle operated by a user in a driving context according to a user driving behavior that is less advantageous than the alternative driving behavior to present to the user a driving suggestion of the alternative driving behavior at which point the exemplary method ends at . The vehicle receiving the driving suggestion from the server may therefore present the driving suggestion to the user thus facilitating the user in the optimal operation of the vehicle in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments e.g. the exemplary method of the exemplary system of the exemplary computer readable storage device of and the exemplary method of to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.

A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein such techniques may be utilized.

As a first example of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be used with many types of vehicles including automobiles motorcycles trucks buses watercraft aircraft and spacecraft.

As a second example of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be used to automate the control many types of types of driving features of the vehicle such as an accelerator or throttle brake gear selector steering wheel tiller or yolk. The driving features may also include vehicle accessories including interior and exterior lighting windshield wipers cleaning anti fogging and or de icing controls climate controls sound systems and communication with other vehicles and individuals. Additionally the driving features may be correlated with various types of user driving behaviors such as vehicle speed or vehicle acceleration lane selection among at least two lanes of a causeway vehicle turning rate e.g. the effects of turning too sharply or gradually at different speeds vehicle gear selection vehicle signaling input e.g. the use of turn signals and vehicle climate control e.g. the use of a defogger or windshield wipers to clear weather related obstructions .

As a third example of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be used to evaluate the user driving behaviors of the user while operating the vehicle in a variety of driving contexts including the time of day sunny overcast foggy rainy snowing and or freezing weather conditions a vehicle causeway type context e.g. an unpaved local road a residential side street a main roadway or a highway a traffic congestion context e.g. the volume of traffic in the vicinity of the vehicle a vehicle speed of at least one other vehicle operating near the vehicle e.g. if the vehicle is passing being passed by or keeping pace with other vehicles the route of the vehicle e.g. a short local route a longer cross city route or a long distance route between cities and a vehicle condition context e.g. the maintenance condition and or cargo contents of the vehicle and a vehicle passenger context e.g. the number and identities of other passengers aboard the vehicle .

As a fourth variation of this first aspect the evaluation of the driving behavior of the user may be performed in view of many types of advantages such as the safety of the vehicle or the occupants the safety of other individuals near the vehicle such as other drivers motorcyclists bicyclists and pedestrians the maintenance of the vehicle such as evaluating acceleration with respect to the effects on tire tread and evaluating gearshift operation with respect to preserving the engine components the efficiency of the vehicle such as fuel economy and pollution reduction the compliance with laws such as posted speed limits and traffic control signs assured clear distance limits and the use of headlights for visibility and the driving comfort of the vehicle such as promoting a smooth ride. Many types of advantages may be achievable in view of such considerations such as a fuel economy promoting advantage an emissions reducing advantage a vehicle maintenance promoting advantage a travel time reducing advantage a driving safety promoting advantage a causeway hazard avoiding advantage and a smooth driving experience promoting advantage. These and other variations may be included in various embodiments of the techniques presented herein.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques involves the detection the user driving behaviors of the driving features of the vehicle and the driving context which the user is operating the vehicle in order to select one or more suggestions providing advantages with respect to the operation of the vehicle .

As a first variation of this second aspect the driving context of the vehicle may be detected in various ways. As a first such example the driving context may be detected by a device on board the vehicle through communication with various sensors e.g. a clock that provides the time of day and ambient sensors that detect the temperature light level and moisture. As a second such example the driving context may be inferred from the driving features of the vehicle e.g. inferring from an activation of antilock brakes that a road is wet or icy. As a third such example nearby vehicles traveling in a local region may intercommunicate to determine the driving conditions e.g. a first vehicle that detects a slippery road surface may broadcast this driving context to other vehicles in the area. As a fourth such example the driving context may be received as a set of driving context descriptors from a driving context service e.g. a service accessible over a communications network that informs the device on board the vehicle of the driving conditions in the area such as the ambient weather and road surface conditions .

As a second variation of this second aspect many types of evaluation may be performed to identify alternative driving behaviors conferring an advantage as compared with the current user driving behavior of the user . As a first example a device may comprise a model associating various user driving behaviors with comparative advantages such as the risks of causing an accident while operating a vehicle at different speeds in a particular driving context and the device may compare the current user driving behavior of the user with the model to select an alternative driving behavior presenting a comparative advantage . As a second example a device may comprise a simulator that predicts various effects of a current user driving behavior in a particular driving context and the comparative effects of alternative driving behaviors in the driving context and selects for suggestion the alternative driving behaviors presenting a comparative advantage . For example a simulator may predict the braking distance of a vehicle operating at a current speed in a particular driving context and may also predict the braking distance of the vehicle operating at a different speed . If the current speed provides insufficient braking distance with respect to a leading vehicle or involves an uncomfortable stopping experience and the different speed alleviates these disadvantages then a driving suggestion may be selected and presented based on the different speed and the reduction of the disadvantage.

As a third variation of this second aspect many architectural variations may be utilized to perform the detection and evaluation of user driving behaviors and suggestions related thereto. As a first such example such as illustrated in the exemplary scenario of the detection evaluation and suggestion may be performed by a device on board the vehicle . As a second such example such as illustrated in the exemplary scenario of the vehicle control input may be detected by a device on board the vehicle and sent to a driving behavior evaluating service provided by a server that remotely performs a driving behavior evaluation and sends suggestions back to the device for presentation to the user in the vehicle . Upon receiving the driving suggestion from the user driving behavior service the device may present the driving suggestions to the user . As a third such example rather than sending the driving suggestions to the user the server may present the driving suggestions to the user outside of the vehicle e.g. through email or through a web service for review by the user at a later date in order to alter the user driving behaviors of the user in future driving contexts .

As a fourth variation of this second aspect the selection of suggestions to the user may be limited to those having a comparative advantage exceeding a comparative advantage threshold. For example a user who typically utilizes vehicle brakes in a fairly safe manner that might confer a modest first advantage through an adjustment of such usage e.g. braking slightly more gradually may modestly reduce maintenance costs and may utilize the accelerator in a manner such that an alternative accelerating technique may provide a significant second advantage in terms of reduced maintenance costs. Accordingly the device may present the second suggestion presenting a significant advantage and may refrain from presenting the first suggestion presenting only a modest advantage . Alternatively or additionally two or more alternative driving behaviors may each present an advantage over a current user driving behavior e.g. excessive speed during curves may be alleviated either by braking harder before entering the curve or by initiating braking at a farther distance before the curve . The device may compare the comparative advantages of various alternative driving behaviors to identify a positive comparative advantage e.g. that the comparative advantage of initiating braking farther before a curve presents a greater comparative advantage than braking harder before the curve and may select for presentation the driving suggestion for the alternative behavior having the positive comparative advantage . These and other variations in the detection and evaluation of the user driving behaviors may be incorporated in embodiments of the techniques presented herein.

A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques involves the presentation of suggestions relating to various advantages achievable by various alternative driving behaviors .

As a first set of variations of this third aspect the timing of the presentation of suggestions may be selected to provide contextual relevance to the driving context of the vehicle and user . As a first such example a driving suggestion may be helpfully displayed at a particular location such as a particular geographic position on a road where the driving context for the user driving behavior is likely to arise and the device may identify such suggestion locations and present such suggestions upon the vehicle arriving at such a location. As a second such example the device may identify at least one alternative driving behavior at a first time point that is associated with a first instance of the driving context e.g. detecting that the user did not react advantageously to an instance of skidding on a slippery road surface and may present the driving suggestion to the user at a second time point that is associated with an impending second instance of the driving context e.g. presenting a driving suggestion to the user for handling skidding more advantageously upon later detecting a slippery road surface that may induce skidding . The timing of such suggestions may promote the retention and use of the alternative driving behaviors by the user .

A second set of variations of this third aspect relate to limiting the numbers and types of suggestions presented to the user in order to avoid diluting the driving suggestions and persuasiveness thereof by presenting suggestions that are not of interest to the user .

As a first example of this second variation of this third aspect the selection of suggestions may be customized by the user e.g. based on the types of advantages that are of interest to the user . For example the user may be more interested in suggestions for advantages relating to safety but may be less interested in suggestions for advantages relating to vehicle maintenance. Accordingly the device may receive from the user at least one selected advantage from an advantage set and to present only suggestions that relate to at least one selected advantage received from the user . For example with reference to the exemplary scenario of if reduced speed during curves promotes both the safety of the user and reduces maintenance costs but the user is only interested in suggestions relating to safety the device may present the driving suggestion to start braking sooner and may advise doing so in order to promote the safety of the user but may refrain from additionally noting that the earlier braking reduces maintenance costs.

As a second example of this second variation of this third aspect the selection of suggestions may be customized to reduce the number of suggestions presented in a particular period which may cause the user to become desensitized to the presented suggestions . For example the device may define a suggestion count threshold for a suggestion time period e.g. presenting no more than five messages per day and may present suggestions to the user not exceeding the suggestion count threshold within the suggestion time period.

As a third example of this second variation of this third aspect the selection of suggestions may be implemented to avoid repeatedly presenting suggestions that the user does not wish to receive. For example upon detecting a declinement by the user of a driving suggestion in a driving context a device may refrain from subsequently presenting the driving suggestion to the user in the driving context .

As a third variation of this third aspect a device may assist the user in accepting and or utilizing a driving suggestion .

As a first example of this third variation of this third aspect the device may present to the user an option to accept a driving suggestion and upon receiving an acceptance of the driving suggestion may control the vehicle to implement the driving suggestion . For example if the driving suggestion involves reducing the speed of the vehicle e.g. to expand braking distance with respect to a leading vehicle and the user accepts the driving suggestion the device may automatically and gradually reduce the speed of the vehicle .

As a second example of this third variation of this third aspect the device may offer to the user an alternative driving behavior incentive for accepting a driving suggestion and upon detecting an acceptance of the driving suggestion by the user confer the alternative driving behavior incentive to the user . For example the driving suggestion may comprise the alternative driving behavior of reduced speed of the vehicle in furtherance of the advantage of reduced emissions but the advantage may not be sufficiently appealing to the user to prompt acceptance of the alternative driving behavior . Instead the device may offer to the user an incentive in exchange for reduced speed e.g. credit for free passage through interstate tolls and may confer the incentive to the user upon detecting an acceptance of the driving suggestion . Additionally the magnitude of the alternative driving behavior incentive may be selected proportional to a magnitude of the advantage of the alternative driving behavior e.g. offering a larger credit for reductions in speed that provide a larger reduction of emissions . These and other variations in the presentation of driving suggestions may be included in embodiments of the techniques presented herein.
