This application is based on and claims priority to U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 61 783 632 filed on Mar. 14 2013 and U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 61 712 621 filed on Oct. 11 2012 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

There is an ongoing concern in the tobacco industry to produce cigarettes having wrappers which reduce the ignition proclivity of the smoking article or the tendency of the smoking article to ignite surfaces which come into contact with the lit smoking article. Reports have been made of fires attributed to burning cigarettes coming into contact with combustible materials. A justifiable interest exists in the industry to reduce the tendency of cigarettes or other smoking articles to ignite surfaces and materials used in furniture bedding and the like upon contact.

Thus a desirable feature of smoking articles particularly cigarettes is that they tend to self extinguish upon being dropped or left in a free burning state on combustible materials.

It has long been recognized in the tobacco industry that the cigarette wrapper can have a significant influence on the smolder characteristics of the cigarette. In this regard various attempts have been made in the art to alter or modify the cigarette wrappers in order to achieve the desired tendency of the cigarette to self extinguish or in other words to reduce the ignition proclivity characteristics of cigarettes.

The prior art describes the application of film forming compositions or alternatively cellulosic fibrous compositions to cigarette paper to reduce the paper permeability and control the burn rate. It has been shown that when these materials have been applied in discrete areas along the length of the cigarette the cigarette shows a reduced propensity to ignite a substrate and tends to self extinguish.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 878 753 to Peterson et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 779 530 to Kraker and U.S. Pat. No. 6 725 867 to Peterson et al. which are incorporated herein by reference for example describe a smoking article wrapper being treated with a film forming composition to reduce ignition proclivity. U.S. Pat. No. 5 878 754 to Peterson et al. which is also incorporated herein by reference describes a smoking article wrapper being treated with a non aqueous solution of a solvent soluble polymer dissolved in a non aqueous solution to reduce ignition proclivity.

Although the above patents have provided great advancements in the art further improvements are still needed. For instance the discrete areas formed on the wrapper that are intended to reduce ignition proclivity can have various adverse effects on the deliveries of the smoking article. The treated discrete areas for instance generally have a lower permeability than the base wrapper. The lower permeability in the treated areas can have an adverse impact upon the sensory attributes of the smoking article creating mainstream smoke with a harsher taste in comparison to the remainder of the smoking article.

In the past in order to counteract some of the above effects treated discrete areas were produced having a permeability that gradually changed from a minimum to a maximum over the width of the treated discrete areas in the direction of the burning coal. This arrangement has provided various improvements.

In the past particular film forming compositions have been proposed that contain a film forming material having a relatively low molecular weight. These film forming compositions were applied to the wrapper at relatively high solids concentrations. This arrangement also allowed for some improvement in controlling permeability of the treated discrete areas.

Further improvements however are still needed. For instance a need exists for a wrapper for a smoking article having treated discrete areas in which the treated discrete areas have a relatively high permeability. Specifically a need exists for a method of increasing the permeability in the treated areas without having to be limited to particular film forming materials.

A need also exists for producing treated discrete areas on a wrapper that reduce the ignition proclivity of a smoking article to desired levels while having a minimal impact upon permeability and while also using a minimal amount of material added to the wrapper.

The present disclosure is generally directed to paper wrappers for smoking articles with reduced ignition proclivity and to a process for producing the wrappers.

In one embodiment for instance the present disclosure is directed to a wrapper for a smoking article. The wrapper comprises a paper substrate comprising cellulose fibers and a filler. A plurality of discrete reduced ignition areas extend in a width direction on the paper substrate and are spaced along a length direction. At least one burn accelerating area is positioned in between a first reduced ignition area and a second reduced ignition area. The burn accelerating area comprises a burn promoting agent that has been applied to the paper substrate. In accordance with the present disclosure the reduced ignition areas are free of the burn promoting agent. Placing the burn promoting agent only in between the reduced ignition areas allows for the reduced ignition areas to have a greater permeability while still having the required reduced ignition properties. For example in accordance with the present disclosure the reduced ignition areas may have a permeability that is no more than 85 lower such as no more than 80 lower such as no more than 70 lower than the permeability of the paper substrate. For instance the permeability of the reduced ignition areas may be no more than about 65 less than the permeability of the paper substrate such as no more than about 60 less such as no more than about 55 less such as no more than about 50 less such as no more than about 45 less such as no more than about 40 less than the paper substrate.

In one embodiment the permeability of the reduced ignition areas can be greater than about 20 CORESTA such as greater than about 25 CORESTA such as greater than about 30 CORESTA such as greater than about 35 CORESTA such as greater than about 40 CORESTA such as greater than about 45 CORESTA.

The discrete reduced ignition areas can have the above permeability characteristics while still providing the wrapper with the desired reduced ignition properties. For instance in one embodiment the reduced ignition areas can have a diffusivity of less than about 0.5 cm s at 23 C. In an alternative embodiment when the wrapper is incorporated into a smoking article and tested according to ASTM Test E2187 09 at least 75 of the smoking articles self extinguish due to the presence of the reduced ignition areas.

In an alternative embodiment the present disclosure is directed to a wrapper for a smoking article that includes a paper substrate comprising cellulose fibers and a filler. A plurality of discrete reduced ignition areas extend in a width direction of the paper substrate and are spaced along a length direction. Each discrete reduced ignition area comprises a reduced ignition composition that has been applied to the paper substrate. The reduced ignition composition in accordance with the present disclosure is free of any cellulose fibers or particles. At least one burn accelerating area is located on the wrapper and is positioned in between a first reduced ignition area and a second reduced ignition area. The burn accelerating area comprises a burn promoting agent. In accordance with the present disclosure the reduced ignition areas are partially or totally free of the burn promoting agent. Through the above construction the reduced ignition areas can have a relatively high permeability such as the permeability characteristics described above.

In still another embodiment the present disclosure is directed to a wrapper for a smoking article. The wrapper comprises a paper substrate comprising cellulose fibers and a filler. A plurality of discrete reduced ignition areas extend in a width direction on the paper substrate and are spaced along a length direction. At least one burn accelerating area is positioned in between a first reduced ignition area and a second adjacent reduced ignition area. The burn accelerating area comprises a burn promoting agent. The burn accelerating area includes a first edge facing the first reduced ignition area and a second edge facing the second reduced ignition area.

The wrapper further includes at least one untreated area or buffer region. The untreated area is located between the first edge of the burn accelerating area and the first reduced ignition area. In one embodiment the wrapper can include a second untreated area that is located between the second edge of the burn accelerating area and the second reduced ignition area. In accordance with the present disclosure the untreated areas and the reduced ignition areas are free of the burn promoting agent.

According to the above embodiment as a burning coal advances along a smoking article incorporating the wrapper the burning coal enters a discrete reduced ignition area then enters an untreated area then enters a burn accelerating area. From the burn accelerating area the burning coal may burn through another untreated area and then into a second discrete reduced ignition area. In this manner a controlled burn rate profile along the entire length of the smoking article can be produced. In addition the smoking article can have the desired reduced ignition characteristics.

In some of the embodiments described above the reduced ignition areas are described as being free of the burn promoting agent. In an alternative embodiment however the reduced ignition areas may contain one or more burn promoting agents in amounts less per area than the amount of burn promoting agents contained in the at least one burn accelerating area. For example the reduced ignition areas may contain one or more burn promoting agents in a cumulative amount of less than about 0.4 by weight such as in an amount of less than 0.3 by weight such as in an amount less than 0.2 by weight such as in amount less than 0.15 by weight such as in an amount less than 0.1 by weight. Adding relatively minor amounts of one or more burn promoting agents in the reduced ignition areas may still provide the benefits and advantages of the present disclosure as described above while also providing improved ash characteristics. Adding small amounts of one or more burn promoting agents in the reduced ignition areas for instance may improve ash whiteness improve ash cohesiveness and or prevent spotting on the paper wrapper as a smoking article is smoked. Adding small amounts of one or more burn promoting agents in the reduced ignition areas also unexpectedly improved the reduced ignition proclivity characteristics of smoking articles by showing an increase in the percentage of articles passing the Cigarette Extinction Test according to ASTM Test E2187 09 and by showing a decrease when tested according to the Free Air Self Extinguishment Test.

In the embodiment described above the wrapper may also include buffer regions located adjacent the edges of the reduced ignition areas. The buffer region can generally contain the same amount of one or more burn promoting agents as contained in the reduced ignition areas. In this embodiment as a burning coal advances along a smoking article incorporating the wrapper the burning coal enters a discrete reduced ignition area then enters a buffer region then enters a burn accelerating area. From the burn accelerating area the burning coal may burn through another buffer region then into a second discrete reduced ignition area.

The present disclosure is also directed to a method for increasing the permeability of a reduced ignition area in a paper wrapper for a smoking article with reduced ignition proclivity. The wrapper comprises a paper substrate comprising cellulose fibers and a filler. A plurality of discrete reduced ignition areas extend in a width direction on the paper substrate and are spaced along a length direction. At least one burn accelerating area is positioned in between a first reduced ignition area and a second reduced ignition area. The burn accelerating area comprises a burn promoting agent that has been applied to the paper substrate. In accordance with the present disclosure the reduced ignition areas are free of the burn promoting agent.

According to the method above in one embodiment the wrapper may further include a burn accelerating area that includes a first edge facing the first reduced ignition area and a second edge facing the second reduced ignition area. The wrapper may also include at least one untreated area. The untreated area is located between the first edge of the burn accelerating area and the first reduced ignition area. In one embodiment the wrapper can include a second untreated area that is located between the second edge of the burn accelerating area and the second reduced ignition area. In accordance with the present disclosure the untreated areas and the reduced ignition areas are free of the burn promoting agent. Through the above methods the reduced ignition areas can have a greater permeability while still having the desired reduced ignition properties.

The present disclosure is also directed to the use of a paper substrate for the preparation of a wrapper for a smoking article. In one embodiment the present disclosure is also directed to the use of a burn promoting agent for the preparation of a wrapper for a smoking article. In one embodiment the present disclosure is also directed to the use of a burn promoting agent for increasing the permeability of the reduced ignition areas in a wrapper for a smoking article with reduced ignition proclivity. According to the uses above the paper substrate comprises cellulose fibers and a filler. A plurality of discrete reduced ignition areas extend in a width direction on the paper substrate and are spaced along a length direction. At least one burn accelerating area is positioned in between a first reduced ignition area and a second reduced ignition area. The burn accelerating area comprises a burn promoting agent that has been applied to the paper substrate. In accordance with the present disclosure the reduced ignition areas are free of the burn promoting agent.

According to any of the uses above in one embodiment the paper substrate may further include a burn accelerating area that includes a first edge facing the first reduced ignition area and a second edge facing the second reduced ignition area. The wrapper may also include at least one untreated area. The untreated area is located between the first edge of the burn accelerating area and the first reduced ignition area. In one embodiment the wrapper can include a second untreated area that is located between the second edge of the burn accelerating area and the second reduced ignition area.

The paper wrapper used in the above described embodiments can generally be made from cellulosic fibers and filler particles. The cellulosic fibers for instance may comprise flax fibers softwood fibers hardwood fibers and mixtures thereof. The filler particles on the other hand can comprise any suitable filler particles such as calcium carbonate or a metal oxide such as magnesium oxide iron oxide and or titanium dioxide. The filler particles may be present in the paper wrapper in an amount from about 10 to about 50 by weight such as from about 20 to about 40 by weight.

Unexpectedly it has also been discovered that in some applications smoking articles incorporating paper wrappers made according to the present disclosure have reduced carbon monoxide delivery especially within the reduced ignition areas. The reduced carbon monoxide delivery within the reduced ignition areas may be attributable to increased air flow within the reduced ignition areas. For example the reduced ignition areas may produce at least 3 such as at least 5 such as at least a 10 less carbon monoxide per puff the puff being taken in the reduced ignition area in comparison to an identical smoking article containing identical reduced ignition areas but containing the same amount of one or more burn promoting agents within in the reduced ignition areas as are contained in between the reduced ignition areas.

Repeat use of reference characters in the present specification and drawings is intended to represent the same or analogous features or elements of the present invention.

Reference now will be made in detail to the embodiments of the invention one or more examples of which are set forth below. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention not limitation of the invention. In fact it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used on another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus it is intended that the present invention cover such modifications and variations.

For purposes of explanation of the invention the embodiments and principles of the invention will be discussed in regards to a cigarette. However this is for the purposes of explanation of the invention only and is not meant to limit the invention only to cigarettes. Any manner of smoking article is within the scope and spirit of the invention.

The present disclosure relates to a smoking article and a wrapper for a smoking article having improved ignition proclivity control characteristics. Ignition proclivity is a measure of the tendency of the smoking article or cigarette to ignite a flammable substrate if the burning cigarette is dropped or otherwise left on a flammable substrate.

A test for ignition proclivity is referred to as the Cigarette Extinction Test The Cigarette Extinction Test is ASTM Test No. E2187 09 using 10 layers of filter paper. In the Cigarette Extinction Test a lit cigarette is placed on 10 layers of filter paper. If the cigarette self extinguishes the cigarette passes the test. If the cigarette burns all the way to its end however the cigarette fails. Smoking articles made in accordance with the present invention can be designed to pass the above test. Unless otherwise indicated herein a wrapper is tested according to ASTM Test No. E2187 09 by being formed into a cigarette containing a standard American blend tobacco at a packing density of 230 mg cmand having a circumference of 25 mm.

In addition to the above test smoking articles having reduced ignition proclivity cigarettes are typically also tested for free air self extinguishment FASE . During the free air self extinguishment test the smoking articles are allowed to burn in free air within a fume hood while being held by a pin without being puffed and without being placed on an adjacent surface. In most applications it is desirable for a smoking article to pass the cigarette extinction test while not self extinguishing when left burning in free air. Thus lower FASE rates are preferred. Of particular advantage smoking articles constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention may be configured to self extinguish when placed on an adjacent surface but yet have relatively low FASE rates.

In the past the assignee of the present application has obtained various patents directed to smoking articles with reduced ignition proclivity characteristics. For example paper wrappers treated with a film forming composition that forms treated discrete areas on the wrapper are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 779 530 to Peterson et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 725 867 to Kraker which are both incorporated herein by reference.

In both the 530 patent and in the 867 patent the film forming composition is described as in one embodiment being applied as circumferential cross directional bands. The film forming composition is a composition that is capable of forming a continuous film and is to be differentiated from forming bands from only or primarily a fibrous material. The bands are spaced apart from each other on the cigarette wrapper along the length of the cigarette. Both patents discuss applying the film forming composition to an outside surface of the paper wrapper or to an inside surface of the paper wrapper so that the treated areas are adjacent to a tobacco filler.

The assignee of the present application has also made reduced ignition paper wrappers for cigarettes that included treated discrete areas made from a cellulosic slurry which is a fibrous material. Such wrappers may be described for instance in U.S. Pat. No. 5 417 228 to Baldwin et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 474 095 to Allen et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 534 114 to Cutright et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5 997 691 to Gautam et al. which are all incorporated herein by reference. The treated areas are made from fibrous cellulose such as fibers fibrils or microfibrils and may contain a binder. The additional slurry applied to the paper forms a fibrous mat on top of the paper.

In the past cigarette wrappers including cigarette wrappers having reduced ignition proclivity characteristics have been treated with a burn promoting agent such as a citrate. The citrate is typically applied to the paper to improve ash appearance. The burn promoting agent is applied over the entire surface area of the paper typically before the treated discrete areas are formed on the wrapper. The present inventors however unexpectedly discovered that various benefits and advantages can be obtained if the burn promoting agent is applied to the wrapper only in between the discrete reduced ignition areas or as present in the discrete reduced ignition areas at lower levels than present in between the reduced ignition areas.

For example because the reduced ignition areas do not contain a burn promoting agent or contain a lower amount of burn promoting agent it was discovered that the reduced ignition areas can have a higher permeability while still having the desired reduced ignition characteristics. Because no burn promoting agent is present in the reduced ignition areas on the wrapper for instance the wrapper decomposes at a higher temperature within the reduced ignition areas. As a consequence the reduced ignition areas can have a higher permeability while being able to pass the Cigarette Extinction Test when incorporated into a cigarette as described above.

Ultimately less material can be applied to the wrapper when producing the reduced ignition areas. Applying smaller amounts of an ignition reducing composition to the wrapper minimizes any adverse impacts on taste. Wrappers made according to the present disclosure thus produce mainstream smoke deliveries that are more comparable to conventional wrappers made in the past that did not include any reduced ignition areas.

In one embodiment wrappers made according to the present disclosure can include reduced ignition areas having unique diffusivity characteristics. As used herein diffusivity is measured using a Sodium CODiffusivity Meter with a 4 mm 20 mm head. The diffusivity tester provides D measurements in units of cm s. These diffusivity measurements are also referred to in the art as diffusion capacity. In accordance with the present disclosure reduced ignition areas can be produced having a relatively high diffusivity at room temperature such as at 23 C. For instance the diffusivity at 23 C. can be greater than 0.1 cm s. The reduced ignition areas can have diffusivity values within the above ranges while still causing at least 75 of smoking articles to self extinguish when tested according to ASTM Test E2187 09. The above characteristics indicate that the reduced ignition areas have excellent low ignition propensity properties while still having relatively high air flow. The higher air flow leads to better cigarette mainstream smoke properties. For instance the mainstream smoke may have lower carbon monoxide levels and have more favorable deliveries that lead to a product having better subjective taste properties.

Applying lesser amounts of a reduced ignition composition to the wrapper and or producing reduced ignition areas having higher air flow properties can lead to the design of smoking articles that have lower carbon monoxide deliveries. A reduction in carbon monoxide may be observed even if the ASTM cigarette extinction test percentage does not substantially change. Thus it was also unexpectedly discovered that many embodiments of the present disclosure produce lower carbon monoxide levels especially in relation to tar levels.

In addition it has been unexpectedly discovered that the carbon monoxide levels within the reduced ignition areas are reduced when the reduced ignition areas contain little or no burn promoting agents. For instance when testing for carbon monoxide within a puff taken within a reduced ignition area carbon monoxide levels can be decreased by greater than about 3 such as greater than about 5 such as greater than about 8 such as even greater than about 10 . The carbon monoxide reduction can be up to about 50 . The carbon monoxide reduction is in comparison to an identical smoking article having an identical wrapper wherein the burn promoting agents are present at the same level within the reduced ignition areas as within the areas in between the reduced ignition areas.

In U.S. Patent Publication No. 2011 0290436 to Dumas et al. a paper for a cigarette is disclosed comprising areas treated with a coating formulation adapted to reduce the ignition propensity. The 436 application is particularly directed to forming the treated areas from nanoparticles of cellulose having a median dimension equal to or less than 5 micrometers. The 436 application states that accelerating salts may be applied to the non treated areas. The 436 application states however that a comparison between the tests conducted firstly on fully citrated papers and the test conducted on papers discretely coated with the combustion accelerating saline solution showed that this type of coating has very little impact on the permeability of the low ignition propensity bands. In fact the permeability of the LIP areas in the examples of the 436 application are all very low. The 436 application indicates by the examples that permeabilities need to be around 10 CORESTA in order to produce a cigarette that passes ASTM Test E2187 09 greater than 75 of the time.

In view of the 436 application the results discovered by the present inventor are even more surprising and unexpected. As will be shown in the examples below the present inventors discovered that when a burn promoting agent is only applied in between the reduced ignition areas or is contained in the reduced ignition areas at lower levels the reduced ignition areas can have a substantially higher permeability while still retaining the desired reduced ignition characteristics. As described above the 436 application teaches that the treated areas must include nanoparticles of cellulose. It is believed that many benefits and advantages of the present disclosure can be obtained when using non cellulose materials such as non fibrous and non particle cellulose materials. For instance since burn promoting agents are not applied uniformly over the surface of the wrapper according to the present disclosure the reduced ignition composition is applied to the wrapper in areas that are free of any burn promoting agent or contain burn promoting agents at reduced levels. The reduced ignition composition may comprise for instance a non fibrous film forming composition.

Generally paper wrappers made according to the present disclosure contain cellulosic fibers in combination with filler particles. The cellulosic fibers can be for instance flax fibers softwood fibers hardwood fibers or mixtures thereof. In order to vary the properties of the paper web as desired various mixtures of cellulosic fibers can be used and the extent to which the fibers are refined can also be varied.

The filler particles incorporated into the paper web can vary depending upon the particular application. In general any suitable filler may be used. The filler can be for instance calcium carbonate particles or metal oxide particles. Suitable metal oxide particles include magnesium oxide particles iron oxide or titanium dioxide particles. The total filler loading added to the paper web can be from about 10 by weight to about 50 by weight such as from about 20 by weight to about 40 by weight.

Paper wrappers made according to the present disclosure can have any suitable permeability and basis weight as desired based upon the particular application. The permeability of the paper wrapper for instance can generally be from about 10 CORESTA units to about 200 CORESTA units. In some applications the permeability can be between about 15 CORESTA units to about 55 CORESTA units. In one embodiment of the present invention however the initial permeability of the paper wrapper is relatively high. For instance in one embodiment the permeability of the paper wrapper can be from about 50 CORESTA units to about 110 CORESTA units. In various embodiments for example the initial permeability of the paper wrapper may be greater than about 60 CORESTA units greater than about 70 CORESTA units greater than about 90 CORESTA units or greater than about 100 CORESTA units. The initial permeability of the paper wrapper is generally less than about 160 CORESTA units such as less than about 140 CORESTA units such as less than about 120 CORESTA units.

The basis weight of cigarette wrapping paper is usually between about 15 gsm to about 60 gsm and more particularly between about 15 gsm to about 40 gsm such as from about 20 gsm to about 27 gsm such as from about 25 gsm to about 27 gsm. Wrapping papers according to the present invention can be made within any of these ranges.

In accordance with the present disclosure a reduced ignition composition is applied to the paper wrapper at discrete locations in order to form reduced ignition areas. The reduced ignition areas are designed to cause a smoking article incorporating the wrapper to self extinguish if left burning on an adjacent surface. In this regard an ignition reducing composition is applied to the wrapper in an amount sufficient for the wrapper to have certain characteristics and properties. For instance in one embodiment an ignition reducing composition is applied to the wrapper to produce ignition reducing areas that have a diffusivity and have a certain surface area that causes a smoking article that incorporates the wrapper to self extinguish.

In accordance with the present disclosure in one embodiment the ignition reducing composition is applied to the wrapper or paper substrate where the wrapper or paper substrate remains untreated with any other chemicals. For instance the ignition reducing composition can be applied to the paper wrapper in areas where the paper wrapper remains in its virgin state without any post processing treatments. For instance in accordance with the present disclosure the reduced ignition areas are applied to the wrapper in areas where the wrapper has not been treated with a burn promoting agent. It should be understood however that many wrappers are produced with residual amounts of burn promoting agent due to the burn promoting agent being present in the fiber furnish in the recycled water or somehow be present on the forming fabrics or papermaking equipment. Thus as used herein untreated with a burn promoting agent refers to areas on the paper wrapper where topical application of a burn promoting agent by size or chemical press printing spraying or the like has not occurred.

In accordance with the present disclosure one or more burn promoting agents are applied to the paper wrapper at locations in between the discrete reduced ignition areas. The burn promoting agent is applied in order to control the overall burn characteristics of the smoking article while also providing the smoking article with excellent ash conditioning properties. According to the present disclosure even when the burn promoting agent applied to the wrapper is present between the discrete reduced ignition areas the wrapper may still exhibit a suitable ash and provide a reduced carbon monoxide level.

The present disclosure is also directed to a method for increasing the permeability of a reduced ignition area in a paper wrapper for a smoking article with reduced ignition proclivity. The wrapper comprises a paper substrate comprising cellulose fibers and a filler. A plurality of discrete reduced ignition areas extend in a width direction on the paper substrate and are spaced along a length direction. At least one burn accelerating area is positioned in between a first reduced ignition area and a second reduced ignition area. The burn accelerating area comprises a burn promoting agent that has been applied to the paper substrate. In accordance with the present disclosure in one embodiment the reduced ignition areas are free of the burn promoting agent.

According to the method above in one embodiment the wrapper may further include a burn accelerating area that includes a first edge facing the first reduced ignition area and a second edge facing the second reduced ignition area. The wrapper may also include at least one untreated area or barrier region. The untreated area is located between the first edge of the burn accelerating area and the first reduced ignition area. In one embodiment the wrapper can include a second untreated area that is located between the second edge of the burn accelerating area and the second reduced ignition area. In accordance with the present disclosure the untreated areas and the reduced ignition areas are free of the burn promoting agent.

In accordance with the present disclosure by placing the burn promoting agent only in the burn accelerating area the methods above allow for the reduced ignition areas to have a greater permeability while still having the desired reduced ignition properties.

The present disclosure is also directed to the use of a paper substrate for the preparation of a wrapper for a smoking article. The paper substrate comprises cellulose fibers and a filler. A plurality of discrete reduced ignition areas extend in a width direction on the paper substrate and are spaced along a length direction. At least one burn accelerating area is positioned in between a first reduced ignition area and a second reduced ignition area. The burn accelerating area comprises a burn promoting agent that has been applied to the paper substrate. In accordance with the present disclosure in one embodiment the reduced ignition areas are free of the burn promoting agent.

The present disclosure is also directed to the use of a burn promoting agent for increasing the permeability of the reduced ignition areas in a wrapper for a smoking article with reduced ignition proclivity. The wrapper comprises a paper substrate comprising cellulose fibers and a filler. A plurality of discrete reduced ignition areas extend in a width direction on the paper substrate and are spaced along a length direction. At least one burn accelerating area is positioned in between a first reduced ignition area and a second reduced ignition area.

In accordance with the present disclosure the reduced ignition areas are free of the burn promoting agent or contain reduced levels of the burn promoting agent.

According to any of the uses above in one embodiment the paper substrate may further include a burn accelerating area that includes a first edge facing the first reduced ignition area and a second edge facing the second reduced ignition area. The wrapper may also include at least one untreated area or a barrier region. The untreated area is located between the first edge of the burn accelerating area and the first reduced ignition area. In one embodiment the wrapper can include a second untreated area that is located between the second edge of the burn accelerating area and the second reduced ignition area.

In accordance with the present disclosure by placing the burn promoting agent only in the burn accelerating area or at reduced levels in the reduced ignition areas the uses above allow for the reduced ignition areas to have a greater permeability while still having the desired reduced ignition properties.

In order to assist in describing and explaining the present disclosure one embodiment of a smoking article in accordance with the present disclosure is illustrated generally in . A smoking article cigarette generally having improved ignition proclivity characteristics includes a tobacco column within a wrapper . Article may include a filter .

Paper web defines an outer circumferential surface when wrapped around tobacco column . Discrete areas of outer circumferential surface are treated with the ignition reducing composition. It should also be understood that treated areas could also be disposed on the inner surface of wrapper . In other words wrapper could be rolled around tobacco column so that treated areas are adjacent to the tobacco.

The tobacco column is generally made from shredded tobacco leaves and or reconstituted tobacco. The tobacco column can generally have a tobacco density of from about 170 mg cmto about 260 mg cm such as from about 200 mg cmto about 250 mg cm. For instance the tobacco density can be from about 220 mg cmto about 240 mg cm. The tobacco column can have a circumference of from about 20 mm to about 30 mm such as from about 23 mm to about 27 mm.

In the embodiment illustrated in treated areas are defined as circumferential cross directional bands . Bands are spaced apart from each other longitudinally along the length of cigarette . The bands are indicated in phantom in . However it should be understood that the treated areas can be essentially invisible in the formed cigarette as shown in . In other words a smoker may not discern from any outward sign that the wrapper has been treated in discrete areas . In this regard treated areas can have a smooth and flat texture essentially the same as the areas .

The width and spacing of bands are dependent on a number of variables such as the initial permeability of wrapper density of tobacco column etc. The bands preferably have a width so that oxygen is limited to the burning coal for a sufficient length or period of time to extinguish the coal. In other words if band were too narrow the burning coal would burn through band before self extinguishing. For most applications a minimum band width of 3 mm is desired. For example the band width can be from about 4 mm to about 10 mm.

The spacing between bands is also a factor of a number of variables. The spacing should not be so great that the cigarette burns for a sufficient length of time to ignite a substrate before the coal ever burns into a treated area . The spacing between bands also affects the thermal inertia of the burning coal or the ability of the coal to burn through the treated bands without self extinguishing. In the cigarettes tested applicants have found that a band spacing distance between edges of adjacent reduced ignition areas of between 5 and 50 mm is appropriate and particularly between about 10 mm and 40 mm. However it should be understood that the band spacing can be any suitable width as determined by any number of variables. For most applications the smoking article can contain from 1 to about 3 bands using the above spacing.

In general any suitable ignition reducing composition can be applied to the paper web . In one embodiment for instance the ignition reducing composition contains a film forming material. For example film forming materials that can be used in accordance with the present invention include alginates guar gum pectin polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl acetate cellulose derivatives such as ethyl cellulose methyl cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose starch starch derivatives and the like.

In one particular embodiment the film forming material may comprise an alginate alone or in combination with starch. In general an alginate is a derivative of an acidic polysaccaride or gum which occurs as the insoluble mixed calcium sodium potassium and magnesium salt in the Phaeophyceae brown seaweeds. Generally speaking these derivatives are calcium sodium potassium and or magnesium salts of high molecular weight polysaccarides composed of varying proportions of D mannuronic acid and L guluronic acid. Exemplary salts or derivatives of alginic acid include ammonium alginate potassium alginate sodium alginate propylene glycol alginate and or mixtures thereof.

In one embodiment a relatively low molecular weight alginate may be used. For example the alginates may have a viscosity of less than about 500 cP when contained in a 3 by weight aqueous solution at 25 C. More particularly the alginates may have a viscosity of less than 250 cP at the above conditions particularly less than 100 cP and in one embodiment at a viscosity of about 20 60 cP. As used herein viscosity is determined by a Brookfield LVF Viscometer with a suitable spindle according to the viscosity. At the above lower viscosity levels alginate compositions can be formed at a higher solids content but yet at a low enough solution viscosity to permit the application of the composition to a paper wrapper using conventional techniques. For example the solids content of an alginate solution made in accordance with the present invention can be greater than about 6 particularly greater than about 10 and more particularly from about 10 to about 20 by weight.

At the above solids levels alginate compositions used in accordance with the present invention can have a solution viscosity of greater than about 250 cP particularly greater than about 500 cP more particularly greater than about 800 cP and in one embodiment at a viscosity of greater than about 1 000 cP at 25 C. In general the solution viscosity of the alginate film forming composition can be adjusted depending upon the manner in which the composition is being applied to the paper. For instance the solution viscosity of the composition can be adjusted depending upon whether or not the composition is being sprayed onto the paper or printed onto the paper.

In other embodiments it should also be understood that depending upon the application a relatively high molecular weight alginate may be used. For example the alginate may have a viscosity of greater than about 500 cP when contained in a 3 by weight aqueous solution at 25 C.

In addition to the film forming material the film forming composition applied to the paper wrapper can contain various other ingredients.

For instance in one embodiment a filler can be contained within the composition. The filler can be for instance calcium carbonate calcium chloride calcium lactate calcium gluconate and the like. In addition to calcium compounds other various particles may be used including magnesium compounds such as magnesium oxide clay particles and the like.

The ignition reducing composition in one embodiment can be water based. In particular the ignition reducing composition may comprise an aqueous dispersion or aqueous solution. Alternatively the ignition reducing composition prior to being applied to the paper wrapper may comprise a non aqueous solution or dispersion. In this embodiment for instance an alcohol may be present for applying the composition to the wrapper.

As opposed to a film forming composition the ignition reducing composition may also comprise a cellulose slurry a type of dispersion . As used herein a slurry containing papermaking materials is not a film forming composition. The cellulose slurry applied to the paper substrate may comprise fibrous cellulose one or more fillers and or cellulose particles. As used herein cellulose fibers and cellulose particles are to be differentiated from derivatized cellulose such as carboxymethyl cellulose. Cellulose fibers and cellulose particles for instance are not water soluble. In one embodiment the cellulose slurry applied to the paper substrate may comprise microcrystalline cellulose.

Although cellulose as described above may be used to form the reduced ignition areas some disadvantages may occur when using these materials. For example the use of cellulose particles may actually interfere with some of the advantages and benefits of the present disclosure. For instance the use of cellulosic slurries may interfere with the ability to obtain treated areas with higher permeabilities at the desired reduced ignition proclivity characteristics.

Once the ignition reducing composition is formulated the composition can be applied to a paper wrapper in discrete areas. The manner in which the composition is applied to the paper wrapper can vary. For example the composition can be sprayed brushed applied with a moving orifice or printed onto the wrapper. To form a treated area the composition can be applied in a single pass or in a multiple pass operation. For instance the composition can be applied to the wrapping paper in successive steps in order to form areas on the paper having reduced ignition proclivity. In general during a multiple pass process the treated areas can be formed by applying the composition during from about 2 to about 8 passes.

In accordance with the present disclosure the areas illustrated in are treated with a burn promoting agent. In particular the burn promoting agent is applied to the areas leaving the treated areas free of the burn promoting agent.

Examples of burn promoting agents include alkali metal salts alkaline earth metal salts and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment the burn promoting agent may comprise a salt of a carboxylic acid. In particular examples for instance the burn promoting agent may comprise an acetic acid salt a citric acid salt a malic acid salt a lactic acid salt a tartaric acid salt a carbonic acid salt a formic acid salt a propionic acid salt a glycolic acid salt a fumaric acid salt an oxalic acid salt a malonic acid salt a succinic acid salt a nitric acid salt a phosphoric acid salt and mixtures thereof. In one particular application for instance the burn promoting agent may comprise potassium citrate sodium citrate potassium succinate sodium succinate or mixtures thereof.

The amount of burn promoting agent applied to the areas on the paper substrate can vary depending upon the particular application. In one embodiment for instance the burn promoting agent may be applied to the areas in an amount of at least about 0.1 by weight such as at least about 0.3 by weight such as at least 0.5 by weight and less than about 5 by weight such as less than about 2.5 by weight. In one embodiment burn promoting agent may be applied in an amount from about 0.1 to about 5 by weight such as from about 0.1 to about 2.5 by weight such as from 0.5 to about 2 by weight. The amount of burn promoting agent applied to the paper wrapper is based on the total weight of the paper wrapper and based on the weight of an anhydrous citric acid or corresponding anhydrous acid.

The amount of reduced ignition composition applied to the paper substrate can also vary. Applying the reduced ignition composition to the untreated paper allows for lesser amounts of the composition to be applied especially when the composition comprises a film forming composition. For instance the composition can be applied to the paper substrate in an amount less than about 15 by weight such as less than about 10 by weight such as less than about 8 by weight. In general the composition is applied in an amount greater than 1 by weight based upon the weight of the composition within the reduced ignition areas.

As used herein the above weight percentages are based on the area treated with the chemical components. In other words the weight percentages above for the film forming composition or the burn promoting agents is the amount applied within the treated areas as opposed to the total amount applied over the entire surface of the paper wrapper.

Through the process of the present disclosure reduced ignition areas can be produced having a relatively high permeability while also having a relatively low diffusivity. For instance the reduced ignition areas can have a permeability greater than 20 CORESTA while still being capable of producing smoking articles that pass ASTM Test E2187 09 at least 75 of the time.

In one embodiment for instance the reduced ignition areas have a permeability that reduces the permeability of the paper substrate by no more than about 85 such as no more than about 80 such as no more than about 70 such as by no more than about 65 such as by no more than about 60 such as by no more than about 55 such as by no more than about 50 such as by no more than about 45 such as by no more than about 40 .

The permeability of the reduced ignition areas can depend upon various factors especially the permeability of the paper substrate. In general the reduced ignition areas can have a permeability of greater than about 15 CORESTA such as greater than about 20 CORESTA such as greater than about 25 CORESTA such as greater than about 30 CORESTA such as greater than about 35 CORESTA such as greater than about 40 CORESTA such as greater than about 45 CORESTA and generally less than 60 CORESTA.

In general the reduced ignition areas have a diffusivity that is relatively low. The diffusivity can be measured at room temperature 23 C. . In general the diffusivity at 23 C. of the reduced ignition areas is less than about 0.5 cm s such as less than 0.4 cm s such as less than 0.3 cm s. In one embodiment the reduced ignition areas may have a diffusivity of greater than about 0.1 cm s such as greater than about 0.15 cm s such as greater than 0.16 cm s such as greater than 0.17 cm s while still having the desired reduced ignition proclivity characteristics. Diffusivity is measured using a Sodium COdiffusivity tester.

The above diffusivity characteristics of the reduced ignition areas demonstrate that the reduced ignition areas have higher air flow while still having the necessary reduced ignition proclivity characteristics. By having greater air flow the reduced ignition areas can have better mainstream properties. For instance the mainstream smoke generated within the reduced ignition areas can have lower carbon monoxide levels. In addition the mainstream smoke generated by the reduced ignition areas can have deliveries similar to conventional non banded cigarettes made in the past. Ultimately a cigarette can be produced with reduced ignition proclivity characteristics that have excellent subjective taste properties.

In one alternative embodiment of the present disclosure one or more burn promoting agents are present within the reduced ignition areas but at reduced levels in relation to the remainder of the wrapper. Adding minor amounts of one or more burn promoting agents in the reduced ignition areas may provide various benefits. For instance the minor amounts of burn promoting agent may improve the ash characteristics of a smoking article incorporating the wrapper. The ash produced by the smoking article may be more cohesive and or may be whiter. Adding minor amounts of burn promoting agent within the reduced ignition areas may also decrease spotting or discoloration of the wrapper while the smoking article is smoked. The above advantages can be obtained while still having the ability to produce reduced ignition areas having high permeabilities and increased air flow.

For instance in one embodiment the reduced ignition areas may contain one or more burn promoting agents in an amount less than 0.5 by weight such as an amount less than 0.4 by weight such as in an amount less 0.3 by weight such as in an amount less than 0.2 by weight such as in an amount less than 0.1 by weight. When present in the reduced ignition areas one or more burn promoters may be added to the reduced ignition areas in an amount greater than 0.05 by weight such as an amount greater than about 0.1 by weight. In accordance with the present disclosure greater amounts of one or more burn promoting agents are present in the burn accelerating areas positioned in between the reduced ignition areas. For instance one or more burn promoters may be present in the burn accelerating areas in an amount greater than 0.5 by weight such in amounts greater than 0.6 by weight such as in amounts greater than 0.7 by weight such as in amounts greater than 0.8 by weight. The one or more burn promoting agents can be present in the burn accelerating areas in an amount less than 5 by weight such as in an amount less than 2 by weight.

In one embodiment the amount of burn promoting agents contained in the reduced ignition areas is from about 5 to about 60 such as from about 10 to about 30 of the amount of burn promoting agents contained in the burn accelerating areas.

In the embodiment described above one or more burn promoting agents may be applied in minor amounts to the entire surface of the paper wrapper. For instance a first continuous coating may be applied to the paper wrapper in an amount from about 0.05 to about 0.5 by weight such as in an amount from about 0.1 to about 0.3 by weight. Greater amounts of one or more burn promoting agents can then be applied to the wrapper in between the reduced ignition areas. In this manner the reduced ignition areas contain significantly less amounts of the burn promoting agent in relation to the burn accelerating areas.

As described above in one embodiment a relatively light coat of one or more burn promoting agents may be applied to the wrapper in a continuous manner. In an alternative embodiment however one or more burn promoting agents may be applied to the wrapper initially in the form of a pattern that includes treated areas and untreated areas. The pattern can be coordinated with the amount of burn promoting agents contained within the burn accelerating areas in order to fall in the ranges described above.

Referring to another embodiment of a smoking article made in accordance with the present disclosure is illustrated. Like reference numerals have been used to indicate similar elements.

As shown a smoking article is illustrated that includes a column of tobacco surrounded by a wrapper comprising a paper substrate. The wrapper attaches the column of tobacco to a filter .

In accordance with the present disclosure the wrapper includes reduced ignition areas that provide the smoking article with reduced ignition proclivity characteristics. The reduced ignition areas are directly applied to the wrapper without any underlying chemical treatments. For instance the reduced ignition areas are free of any burn promoting agents.

Alternatively as described above minor amounts of one or more burn promoting agents may be present within the reduced ignition areas .

The wrapper is also treated with a burn promoting agent in areas . As shown the areas are located before in between and after the reduced ignition areas . A burn promoting agent is applied to the wrapper for controlling burn rate and improving the ash characteristics.

In the embodiment illustrated in the wrapper further includes barrier regions or untreated areas . The untreated areas are located in between the areas treated with the burn promoting agent and the reduced ignition areas .

By including at least one untreated area or barrier region on the wrapper it is believed that various advantages and benefits may be obtained in certain embodiments. In the embodiment illustrated for instance the burning coal burns through an area treated with a burn promoting agent. The burning coal then enters an untreated area or barrier region before entering a reduced ignition area . From the reduced ignition area the burning coal then burns through an untreated area prior to entering an area treated with a burn promoting agent. In this manner the burn rate gradually slows as the coal enters the reduced ignition area . The presence of the untreated areas may further provide control over the mainstream smoke and may produce a smoking article with an overall taste that is preferable to smokers. The untreated areas or barrier regions are free of one or more burn promoting agents or contain minor amounts of one or more burn promoting agents. The untreated area or barrier regions for instance contain less burn promoting agents than are contained in the burn accelerating areas.

Another advantage to including the untreated areas or barrier regions is that the untreated areas or barrier regions will retard potential migration of the burn promoting agents into the reduced ignition areas. Consequently the untreated areas or barrier regions can be used to ensure that the burn retarding areas are free of one or more burn promoting agents or contain burn promoting agents in the desired amounts.

The untreated areas or barrier regions can also assist a manufacturer in producing wrappers of the present disclosure. For example cigarette wrappers are typically produced at high speeds. By including untreated areas or barrier regions the tolerances needed to apply the burn retarding composition to the paper at specific locations can be relaxed. Specifically by including untreated areas or barrier regions it will be easier to manufacture the wrappers without having the burn retarding areas overlap with the burn accelerating areas.

The untreated areas or barrier regions can have any suitable width depending upon the particular application. In one embodiment for instance the untreated areas may have a width a width of at least 0.1 mm such as at least 0.5 mm such as at least 1 mm but less than about 10 mm such as less than about 7.5 mm such as less than about 5 mm such as less than about 4 mm such as less than about 3 mm such as less than about 2 mm such as less than about 1.5 mm. In one embodiment the treated areas or barrier regions may have a width of from about 0.1 mm to about 4 mm such as from about 0.5 mm to about 2.0 mm.

When producing the wrapper as shown in in one embodiment an untreated wrapper may be fed through a printing process. The printing process may include multiple stations. One station may print the burn promoting agent to produce the areas while a second station may be used to produce the reduced ignition areas . The different print stations may be aligned with one another in order to leave certain areas of the paper substrate untreated and thus forming the untreated areas .

In an alternative embodiment the printing process may include an additional print station. In this embodiment a light layer of one or more burn promoting agents may be applied to the wrapper either as a continuous coating or as a discontinuous pattern. The one or more burn promoting agents may be applied at relatively minor amounts such as in the amounts described above. In particular the one or more burn promoting agents may be applied in amounts from about 0.1 by weight to about 0.4 by weight. In this embodiment the one or more burn promoting agents are present in the untreated areas and in the reduced ignition areas . Greater amounts of the one or more burn promoting agents are present in the burn accelerating areas due to the additional print step.

In the untreated areas or barrier regions are shown in the shape of bands. The untreated areas or barrier regions however may have any suitable shape. For instance instead of straight bands the untreated areas or barrier regions may have arc shaped edges.

As described above in one embodiment the untreated areas or barrier regions and the reduced ignition areas may contain one or more burn promoting agents in relatively minor amounts in relation to the burn accelerating areas. In one embodiment one or more burn promoting agents may be present within the untreated areas or barrier regions while the reduced ignition areas can be free of any burn promoting agents. In yet another embodiment one or more burn promoting agents may be present in the reduced ignition areas while the untreated areas are free of one or more burn promoting agents.

Once incorporated into a smoking article paper wrappers made according to the present disclosure are well suited to reducing the ignition proclivity characteristics of the article. For instance smoking articles made in accordance with the present disclosure can have an ASTM Test No. E2187 09 Cigarette Extinction Test pass rating of at least about 75 such as at least about 80 such as at least about 90 such as even 100 pass rating. In addition such smoking articles can also have a free air self extinguishment FASE rating of less than about 50 such as less than about 30 such as less than about 20 such as even less than about 10 .

The following tests were conducted to demonstrate some of the teachings of the present disclosure. In this example a commercially available low ignition propensity LIP cigarette paper was compared with a wrapper made according to the present disclosure. The commercially available wrapper was uniformly treated over its entire surface area with a citrate. Bands of a reduced ignition composition were then applied to the wrapper. In comparison a wrapper was constructed in which a burn promoting agent was only applied in between reduced ignition bands. The reduced ignition bands were formed by applying an alginate to the wrapper.

The commercial paper had a permeability of 60 CU and was treated with 0.8 mixed citrate. The base paper contained relatively uniform amounts of fiber and a filler calcium carbonate .

In contrast the bands of the sample made according to the present disclosure were applied to regions that had no burn promoting agent present.

The above described wrappers were formed into cigarettes. The tobacco used was a standard American blend at a density of about 240 mg cc.

The following table shows a comparison of properties between the commercially available paper Comparative Samples 1 and 3 and the paper of the present disclosure Samples 2 and 4 .

In order to obtain some of the test results below the smoking articles or cigarettes were placed into a smoking machine. A Borgwaldt Model RM20 Kit Smoking Machine was used. Air permeability was measured using a Borgwaldt Air Permeability Tester model A10 using a 2 mm 15 mm head. Diffusivity diffusion capacitance D was measured using a Sodium CODiffusivity Meter.

As shown above smoking articles made according to the present disclosure outperformed the comparative paper. The major differences were 1 much higher band permeability and 2 lower tar nicotine and CO deliveries at an equivalent puff number. Also the ASTM was above 90 for both articles so there was no noticeable drop off in LIP performance.

Therefore Samples 2 and 4 mitigated a multitude of the drawbacks associated with commercially available cigarette paper while maintaining good LIP performance.

As shown above the samples made according to the present disclosure had significantly higher band permeabilities while still maintaining excellent reduced ignition characteristics ASTM test . The wrappers made according to the present disclosure also had a higher diffusivity at room temperature which further indicates better air flow properties.

Further wrappers were constructed and tested according to some of the tests described in Example 1 above. In this Example Sample 5 below was uniformly treated over its entire surface area with potassium citrate. Bands of a reduced ignition composition were then applied to the wrapper. The bands were made from an alginate composition. The paper wrapper was made from a mixture of softwood fibers hardwood fibers and a filler.

Sample 6 below had no burn promoting agent present in the reduced ignition bands. In addition the wrapper contained untreated areas prior to and after each reduced ignition band. The untreated areas were free of any burn promoting agents and had a width of 0.25 mm.

The wrappers were used to produce cigarettes. A standard American blend was used as the tobacco filler. The cigarettes were constructed such that Sample 5 and Sample 6 had approximately the same ASTM rating and FASE rating.

In order to obtain some of the test results below the smoking articles or cigarettes were placed into a smoking machine. A Borgwaldt Smoking Machine model R04 was used. The carbon monoxide results were obtained using a Borgwaldt CO Analyzer model C21.

As shown above Sample 6 had a significantly higher band permeability than Sample 5. In this Example carbon monoxide was measured in the banded regions. In particular the cigarettes were placed into a smoking machine and a puff within the banded region was analyzed for carbon monoxide. As shown above the sample made according to the present disclosure displayed a 17 reduction in carbon monoxide within the bands.

The banded areas also went under thermogravimetric analysis. The TGA plot was obtained using Model No. TGA Q50 sold by TA Instruments. The TGA plot is illustrated in . As shown Sample 6 degraded at a higher temperature meaning that the reduced ignition area remained intact for a longer period of time than Sample 5.

Further wrappers were constructed and tested. Sample 7 was made similar to Sample 5 in Example 2. Sample 8 was made similar to Sample 6 in Example 2. Sample 8 however had a gap width of 2 mm in the untreated areas.

Sample 9 was made in accordance with the present disclosure and includes a two tone citrate treatment. In Sample 9 the entire wrapper was first treated with 0.3 by weight sodium citrate. An additional 0.8 by weight potassium citrate was then applied in between the reduced ignition bands. In addition untreated regions or barrier regions were created that had a gap width of 2 mm.

In this Example the wrappers were constructed so as to have a similar band diffusivity at 23 C. using a wrapper having a lower permeability. The following results were obtained.

As shown above Samples 8 and 9 had significantly better ASTM ratings at the same band diffusivity. Unexpectedly Sample 9 had better ASTM ratings and FASE ratings than Sample 8.

Cigarettes made from the wrappers were placed into a smoking machine for visual observation only. While the cigarettes were in the machine it was noticed that the wrapper of Sample 8 underwent a noticeable amount of staining in relation to the wrapper made according to Sample 9. are representative drawings of the cigarettes as they were smoked by the smoking machine. represents the cigarette made with the wrapper of Sample 8 while the cigarette shown by was made with the wrapper of Sample 9. As shown by comparing the figures the wrapper in did not produce as many stains on the wrapper during smoking as the wrapper illustrated in . The reduction in staining is believed to have occurred due to the presence of minor amounts of burn promoting agents in the banded regions.

These and other modifications and variations to the present invention may be practiced by those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention which is more particularly set forth in the appended claims. In addition it should be understood that aspects of the various embodiments may be interchanged both in whole or in part. Furthermore those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the foregoing description is by way of example only and is not intended to limit the invention so further described in such appended claims.
