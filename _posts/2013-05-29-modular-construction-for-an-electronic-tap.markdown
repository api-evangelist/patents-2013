The present invention relates to a device forming a tap in particular an electronic tap in particular for a washbasin in particular designed for high frequency use for example in a hospital a motorway service station or public places etc.

Devices are already known that form an electronic tap for a washbasin of this kind which comprise a water circuit between a water inlet point and a water outlet point means for controlling the opening closing of the water circuit in particular an electronically controlled valve the assembly being integrated into a main part known as a body which is fixed to the bowl of the washbasin. The device forming the tap of the prior art has disadvantages. In particular the body forming the main part of the tap has a complex structure and has to receive or form on the inside different constituent elements such as the electronically controlled valve the inlet the outlet the supply pipe and possibly a mixing device etc. Furthermore if the tap is defective in order to repair it it is necessary to remove the body from the basin which means that it is necessary to completely disconnect all of the elements of the water supply network.

The present invention aims to overcome the disadvantages of the prior art by proposing a device forming a tap in particular for a washbasin the maintenance of which in particular access to different elements of the water circuit between the inlet point and the outlet point for example elements ensuring the opening closing of the water circuit is made much easier in comparison to the prior art by making it possible in particular to perform maintenance of this kind without having to disconnect the water supply network.

According to the invention a device forming a tap in particular an electronic tap for a washbasin in particular for high frequency use which defines a water circuit between a water inlet point and a water outlet point and which comprises opening closing means of the water circuit is as defined in claim and refinements thereof are defined in the subordinate claims.

Thus according to the invention by means of the shell forming the outer casing of the tap which is independent of the technical element of the tap and in particular of the water circuit and the opening closing device of the water circuit when it is necessary to perform maintenance operations on the circuit or the opening closing device for example an electronically controlled valve it is not necessary to remove the assembly of the tap from the basin and it is simply necessary to disconnect the shell from the baseplate to obtain easy access to the technical element. Furthermore an additional advantage is that it is possible to provide a plurality of shells which have different external features from one another corresponding to different commercial products which can each be adapted to the same said technical element thus reducing the number of parts necessary in stock. Furthermore the implementation of the new product is facilitated by the fact that it is possible to work either on the technical element and maintain the same shell or keep the same technical element and modify the shell which increases the possible options for new taps and simplifies their design and implementation.

According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the technical element in particular the water outlet point is also fixed in a detachable manner to the water outlet opening of the shell.

According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the opening closing means of the water circuit comprise an electronically controlled valve.

According to a particularly simple embodiment of the invention the baseplate is in the form of a substantially circular disc and the detachable fixing means of the baseplate to the opening of the baseplate of the shell are formed on the one hand by at least one lug preferably a plurality of lugs projecting laterally from the lateral wall of the baseplate and on the other hand by at least one groove preferably a plurality of grooves formed in the interior wall of the opening the groove or grooves receiving the lug or lugs to allow the detachable securing of the baseplate to the opening of the baseplate of the shell.

According to a preferred embodiment of the invention each lug is arranged at a distance from the lower face of the baseplate and each corresponding groove comprises a first section extending from the outer edge of the opening of the baseplate having a transverse dimension complementary to that of the lug over a height corresponding to the distance between the lower face of the baseplate and the lug and a second section with a greater width than the first section in particular with a width between 1.1 and 1.5 times the width of the first section such that the lug is introduced into the first section then slid upwards until it reaches the second section by a simple rotation of several degrees of the shell the lug locks against the shoulder formed between the second section and the first section so as to lock all mutual relative movement between the shell and the baseplate in vertical direction a simple rotation of several degrees in the other direction allowing unlocking.

According to another embodiment of the invention which can also be complementary to the preceding embodiments it is possible to provide at least one protuberance preferably a plurality of protuberances each penetrating into respective complementary notches each protuberance extending over the whole height of the lateral wall of the baseplate between the lower face and the upper face of the baseplate the traversing holes being formed in the wall of the shell at the level of notches and holes being formed in each protuberance such that when the baseplate is inserted into the opening of the baseplate the hole or holes of the notches are aligned with the hole or holes of the protuberances and it is then possible to screw them together respectively by means of a screw.

According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the screw enabling the connection of the facing holes is a screw with a conical head such that from the exterior the more one tries to unscrew it and remove it the more the conical head penetrates into the hole of the notch by the interior and bears against its side thus further preventing the mutual displacement of the shell and the baseplate.

According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the shell comprises a cover. In particular this cover can comprise means for locking the technical element to the water outlet opening of the shell in a detachable manner in particular the water outlet point of the technical element.

Said baseplate is shown in a more precise manner in . The baseplate is pierced by two transverse holes and which receive two end pieces and respectively designed for connecting to the supply network of hot water and cold water respectively through pipes not shown in the figures entering from below the baseplate .

The technical element comprises following the baseplate a mixing device which is fixed to the upper face of the baseplate . According to another embodiment of the invention it is possible to provide said mixing device upstream of the baseplate that is at the level of the basin and single water supply pipe coming from the mixer at the level of the basin entering into the baseplate instead of two pipes as in the embodiment of the invention shown in the figures. The present invention clearly covers these two embodiments effectively the water inlet point being formed in one case by two end pieces and in the other by a single end piece.

The mixing device is positioned relative to the baseplate by the cooperation of three cylindrical holes which cover three lugs emerging from the upper face of the baseplate and screws which ensure the mutual fixing of the holes and lugs . The mixing device also comprises a horizontal pipe pierced by two holes not shown in the figures facing the end pieces and and through which water can pass in the pipe where there is a mixing cylinder ensuring the mixing of hot and cold water coming from the end pieces and to allow the outlet of the mixture upwards through a hole opening into the upper part of the mixing stage .

Above the mixing device is an electronically controlled valve which is fixed to the mixing device by means of screws which penetrate corresponding holes formed on the upper face of the mixing stage . Following the electronically controlled valve a pipe extends for the passage of water towards an end piece forming the water outlet.

The so called technical assembly which thus comprises a water inlet point at the level of the two end pieces and for supplying water and a water outlet point at the level of the end piece forms with the covering shell a tap device according to the invention. The shell comprises a lower opening the inner side of which is designed to cooperate with the baseplate to ensure the mutual detachable fixing of the shell and the baseplate. The shell also comprises an opening the inner side of which is designed to cooperate with the end piece for the detachable mutual securing of the end piece and the shell. A cover closes the interior space of the shell from above.

The baseplate is substantially in the form of a circular disc with an upper face a lower face and a lateral face . Three lugs of rectangular shape project from the wall and are distributed substantially uniformly at an angle to the lateral face . Each lug with a rectangular shape is spaced apart from the lower face . Said rectangular lugs are designed to cooperate with corresponding grooves formed in the interior wall of the side of the lower opening of the shell to ensure the detachable mutual fixing of the baseplate to the shell.

Said grooves are shown in detail in particular in . They each comprise a first section of the same width as the width of the rectangular lug which extends over a height corresponding to the distance of the lug from the lower face of the baseplate . The groove comprises after this section a section with a greater width than the first section and which extends over a height substantially equal to the length of the lug . This second section of the groove with a larger width forms a shoulder with the first section. Thus when the lugs cooperate with the grooves they penetrate through the first section then having reached the second section the shell is pivoted slightly such that the lug fully received in the second section abuts against the shoulder so as to fix the baseplate to the shell in a detachable manner preventing all movement in vertical direction. The baseplate also comprises two protuberances with a rectangular form which extend over the whole height of the lateral face of the baseplate . Said rectangular protuberances are associated with complementary grooves formed in the inner wall of the side of the opening . Said grooves with a complementary shape to the rectangular protuberances are each pierced with traverse holes respectively.

Likewise the protuberances are pierced with oblong holes corresponding with holes when the protuberances are located in the grooves . It is then possible to ensure the screwing of the baseplate to the shell by means of a screw not shown and in particular by means of screws with a conical head mounted in such a way that from the exterior the more one tries to unscrew the screw to remove it from the hole the more the conical head is pressed against the side of the hole and the more the mutual fixing of the baseplate to the shell is locked which makes it possible to prevent people with malicious intentions trying to remove the tap from the basin.

The baseplate can be fixed to the basin as shown in by means of screws and associated holes opening towards the lower face of the baseplate.

The end piece forming the water outlet point which is arranged at the end of the pipe outlet is received in a kind of housing formed by the inner edge of the water outlet opening of the shell . The end piece comprises a part forming a base pedestal with a substantially circular cylindrical form of the lateral wall from which two diametrically opposite lugs project which penetrate into the respective grooves formed in the inner wall of the side . Said grooves are the same type as grooves and each comprise a first section with a width that is substantially identical to the width of the lugs and a second section with a greater width which forms a shoulder with the first section. Thus when the end piece is inserted via its pedestal into the receiving housing the two lugs are aligned with the first sections then the assembly is pushed towards the outlet such that the lugs reach the level of the second section from which moment the pedestal is subjected to a slight rotation so that the shoulder formed between the two sections of different widths locks the assembly so as to prevent any movement in vertical direction. Furthermore on the upper surface of the end piece a rectangular plate projects upwards which when the end piece is locked in vertical position by the cooperation of the lugs and grooves is at a distance from an inner front wall of the shell . Thus a gap is formed between the front wall on the inside of the shell and this plate . Thus a plate with a complementary form to said gap projects downwards such that when the shell is closed by the cover said plate coming from the cover penetrates into the gap between the plate and the front wall of the shell in order to prevent in this way any mutual rotation between the end piece and the shell thus fixing the end piece in a fixed position in translation and rotation.

As shown in the cover is fixed to the shell by means of a screw and two holes and formed in protuberances emerging respectively from the inner surface of the cover and from the inner lower face of the shell the hole formed in the shell being traverse.

At the end of the side of the opening it is possible to attach a water aeration washer in the form of an aerating end piece which is standard in this field to the end piece .
