This U.S. non provisional patent application is a Continuation of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 070 347 filed on Mar. 23 2011 and U.S. Patent No. 8 582 360 which claims priority under 35 USC 119 to Korean Patent Application No. 10 2010 0028008 filed on Mar. 29 2010 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

Semiconductor memory devices are microelectronic devices that are used to design digital logic circuits such as microprocessor based applications and computers for the fields ranging from satellite to consumer electronics. Therefore an advance in memory fabrication technology including technology development and process improvement obtained through scaling for high speed and high integration density assists in establishing the performance standards of other digital logic systems.

Semiconductor memory devices are generally classified into volatile memory devices and nonvolatile memory devices. Examples of the volatile memory devices include static random access memory SRAM devices and dynamic random access memory DRAM devices. The SRAM devices store logic information by setting the logic state of a bistable flip flop and the DRAM devices store logic information by charging a capacitor. The volatile memory devices store and read data in a power on state but lose the stored data in a power off state.

Examples of the nonvolatile memory devices include magnetic read only memory MROM devices programmable read only memory PROM devices erasable programmable read only memory EPROM devices electrically erasable programmable read only memory EEPROM devices and flash memory devices. The nonvolatile memory devices can retain data stored therein even when power supply thereto is interrupted. The state of data stored in the nonvolatile memory devices may be permanent or reprogrammable according to memory fabrication technologies. The nonvolatile memory devices are used to store programs and microcodes in various applications such as computers avionics communications and consumer electronic technologies. A combination of volatile and nonvolatile memory storage modes in a single chip may also be used in devices such as nonvolatile RAMs nvRAMs in a system that requires quick and reprogrammable nonvolatile memories. In addition specific memory structures including some additional logic circuits have been developed to optimize the performance for application oriented tasks.

Since nonvolatile memory devices such as MROM devices PROM devices and EPROM devices are not allowed to erase and write it is not easy for general users to update data stored in such nonvolatile memory devices. On the other hand since nonvolatile memory devices such as EEPROM devices and flash memory devices are electrically erasable and programmable their applications are expanding to auxiliary memory devices or system programming that require continuous data update.

The present disclosure provides a nonvolatile memory device a data storage system and a read method thereof which can improve a read performance.

According to one embodiment a read method for a nonvolatile memory device is disclosed. The read method includes a first read step including reading a first memory cell of the nonvolatile memory device by applying a first set of read voltages to the first memory cell. The read method further includes a second read step including reading the first memory cell by applying a second set of read voltages and none of the voltages in the first set to the first memory cell when it is determined that the first read step results in an error and cannot be corrected with error correction. The second read step is performed by using data resulting from the first read step.

In further embodiment a read method for a nonvolatile memory device is disclosed. The read method includes a hard decision read step including reading a first memory cell of the nonvolatile memory device by applying a first voltage to the first memory cell. The read method further includes a first soft decision read step including reading the first memory cell by applying a first set of read voltages to the first memory cell when it is determined that the hard decision read step results in an error and cannot be corrected with error correction. The read method additionally includes a second soft decision read step including reading the first memory cell by applying a second set of read voltages and none of the voltages in the first set to the first memory cell when it is determined that the first soft decision read step results in an error and cannot be corrected with error correction. The second soft decision read step is performed by using data resulting from the first soft decision read step.

The second soft decision read step includes reading the first memory cell by applying a second set of read voltages and none of the voltages in the first set to the first memory cell when it is determined that the first soft decision read step results in an error and cannot be corrected with error correction. The second soft decision read step further includes using the data resulting from the first soft decision read step.

For example a first element could be termed a second element and similarly a second element could be termed a first element without departing from the scope of example embodiments. As used herein the term and or includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.

Hereinafter exemplary embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.

Referring to a data storage system according to an exemplary embodiment includes one or more nonvolatile memory devices and a memory controller . Nonvolatile memory device may comprise for example a chip or stack of chips. For convenience s sake illustrates only one nonvolatile memory device . As a storage medium the nonvolatile memory device operates in response to the control of the memory controller and is used to store multi bit or multi level data. For example the nonvolatile memory device is configured to store M bit data M an integer equal to or greater than 2 in each memory cell.

The memory controller controls the nonvolatile memory device in response to the request from an external device e.g. a host . The memory controller includes an error correction code ECC unit that generates ECC data or ECC parity data on the basis of data to be stored in the nonvolatile memory device and detects corrects an error in data read from the nonvolatile memory device . For example an error correction capability of the ECC unit is determined on the basis of the number of data bits stored in each memory cell. For example the error correction capability depends on storage regions e.g. a meta region a code region and a user region of the nonvolatile memory device and wear leveling information of the nonvolatile memory device . The ECC unit may be implemented in software hardware or a combination thereof. The nonvolatile memory device may include the ECC unit . The memory controller further includes a buffer memory for temporarily storing data read from the nonvolatile memory device . The buffer memory may additionally be used to temporarily store data received from an external device e.g. a host .

The memory controller further includes a stepwise read resolution scheduler hereinafter referred to simply as scheduler . The scheduler controls the nonvolatile memory device in response to an external request e.g. a data read operation . For example when an error in data read from the nonvolatile memory device is determined to be uncorrectable using typical ECC methods that is when an error in data read by a normal read operation or a hard decision read operation is determined to be uncorrectable the scheduler enables one of soft decision read operations with different read resolutions e.g. different number of read voltages applied to memory cell s to determine the memory cell s data . Herein the read resolutions of the soft decision read operations increase in ascending order. For example the first selected soft decision read operation has the lowest read resolution and the last selected soft decision read operation has the highest read resolution. An increase in the read resolution causes an increase in the read sense count. In particular even if all or some of the soft decision read operations with different read resolutions are sequentially enabled the memory controller may restrict the total read time i.e. the time taken to perform soft decision read operations and or hard decision read operations by the read time necessary for the last selected soft decision read operation.

In an exemplary embodiment the scheduler may include a processing unit and a ROM or the like that stores software or firmware executed by the processing unit.

Referring to the nonvolatile memory device may be for example a NAND flash memory device. However it will be well understood that the nonvolatile memory device is not limited to a NAND flash memory device. The nonvolatile memory device includes a memory cell array having memory cells arranged in rows word lines WL and columns bit lines BL . Each memory cell stores 1 bit data or M bit data M an integer equal to or greater than 2 . Each memory cell may be implemented using a memory cell with a charge storage layer such as a charge trap layer or a floating gate a memory cell with a variable resistor or the like. The memory cell array may be configured to have a single layer array structure e.g. a two dimensional array structure or a multi layer array structure e.g. a three dimensional array structure . Examples of the three dimensional array structure are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008 0023747 titled SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY DEVICE WITH MEMORY CELLS ON MULTIPLE LAYERS and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008 0084729 titled SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE WITH THREE DIMENSIONAL ARRAY STRUCTURE the entirety of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

A row decoder is configured to select drive the rows of the memory cell array . A voltage generator is controlled by a control logic and is configured to generate voltages for program erase read operations e.g. a program voltage a pass voltage an erase voltage and a read voltage . The control logic is configured to control an overall operation of the nonvolatile memory device . The control logic is configured to control a hard decision read operation or a normal read operation or a soft decision read operation according to the control of the memory controller of . A read write circuit is controlled by the control logic and operates as a sense amplifier or a write driver according to a mode of operation. For example in a read operation the read write circuit operates as a sense amplifier that senses data from memory cells or selected memory cells of a selected row. The read data are provided through an input output I O circuit to an external device on a predetermined I O unit. In a program operation the read write circuit operates as a write driver that drives memory cells of a selected row according to program data. The read write circuit includes page buffers corresponding respectively to bit lines or bit line pairs. If each of the memory cells stores multi bit multi level data each page buffer of the read write circuit is configured to have a plurality of latches. In another exemplary embodiment each page buffer of the read write circuit may be configured to have a plurality of latches that perform a logic function e.g. an XNOR function according to the control of the control logic . The I O circuit is configured to interface with an external device e.g. the memory controller .

In an exemplary embodiment a plurality of storage elements in the same column are connected in series to constitute a NAND string . One terminal of the NAND string is connected to a corresponding bit line through a selection transistor controlled by a string selection line SSL and the other terminal thereof is connected to a common source line CSL through a selection transistor controlled by a ground selection line GSL.

In another exemplary embodiment called the odd even bit line architecture bit lines are divided into even bit lines BLe and odd bit lines BLo. In the odd even bit line architecture storage elements which belong to a common word line and are connected to odd bit lines are programmed in a first time and storage elements which belong to a common word line and are connected to even bit lines are programmed in a second time. Data may be programmed in different blocks and may be read from different blocks. These operations may be performed simultaneously.

If 2 bit data or 4 level data 2 page data are stored in one memory cell each of the memory cells in a flash memory device has a threshold voltage in one of 4 threshold voltage distributions and as illustrated in . Herein the threshold voltage distribution includes threshold voltages of erased memory cells and the other threshold voltage distributions include threshold voltages of programmed memory cells. Voltages VP VP and VP represent verify read voltages for determining whether the memory cells are programmed respectively to the threshold voltage distributions . Threshold voltages of memory cells in a selected word line are distributed as illustrated in after 4 level data or 2 page data are programmed in the memory cells of the selected word line.

If 3 bit data or 8 level data 3 page data are stored in one memory cell each of the memory cells has a threshold voltage in one of 8 threshold voltage distributions as illustrated in . The threshold voltage distribution includes threshold voltages of erased memory cells and the other threshold voltage distributions include threshold voltages of programmed memory cells. Voltages VP VP represent verify read voltages for determining whether the memory cells are programmed respectively to the threshold voltage distributions . Threshold voltages of memory cells in a selected word line are distributed as illustrated in after 8 level data or 3 page data are programmed in the memory cells of the selected word line.

If 4 bit data or 16 level data 4 page data are stored in one memory cell each of memory cells has a threshold voltage in one of threshold voltage distributions as illustrated in . The threshold voltage distribution includes threshold voltages of erased memory cells and the other threshold voltage distributions include threshold voltages of programmed memory cells. Voltages VP VP represent verify read voltages for determining whether the memory cells are programmed respectively to the threshold voltage distributions . Threshold voltages of memory cells in a selected word line are distributed as illustrated in after 16 level data or 4 page data are programmed in the memory cells of the selected word line.

Referring to two states Si and Si 1 represented by a solid line are discriminated by a read voltage . A read operation performed by the read voltage is referred to as a hard decision read operation. If the states Si and Si 1 change as represented by a dotted line it is difficult to discriminate the dotted line states Si and Si 1 by the read voltage . As a result discrimination of the states Si and Si 1 illustrated by a dotted line may be performed through a soft decision read operation. For example data of a memory cell having a threshold voltage represented by a black dot may be discriminated by a 2 bit soft decision read operation. The 2 bit soft decision read operation includes three sense operations that are successively performed by read voltages and . Hard decision data and error probability data may be generated by encoding the data read through the three sense operations. The actual data i.e. the data that the memory cell actually represents consequently may be determined as correct or incorrect according to the error probability data.

Typically the 2 bit soft decision read operation requires three sense operations as described with reference to .

In an exemplary embodiment it will be well understood that a method for encoding the data read by the 2 bit soft decision read operation may be implemented variously. The encoding may be performed by the memory controller or by the read write circuit of the nonvolatile memory device under the control of the control logic .

However if the states Si and Si 1 change as represented by a dotted line it is difficult to discriminate the states Si and Si 1 illustrated by a dotted line by the read voltage . Discrimination of the states Si and Si 1 illustrated by a dotted line may be performed through a soft decision read operation. For example data of a memory cell having a threshold voltage represented by a black dot may be discriminated by a 3 bit soft decision read operation. The 3 bit soft decision read operation includes seven sense operations that are performed by seven read voltages. Actual data and error probability data may be generated by encoding the data read through the seven sense operations. The actual data i.e. the data that the memory cell actually represents consequently may be determined as correct or incorrect according to the error probability data.

In an exemplary embodiment it will be well understood that a method for encoding the data read by the 3 bit soft decision read operation may be implemented variously. The encoding may be performed by the memory controller or by the read write circuit of the nonvolatile memory device under the control of the control logic .

Referring to when a read operation request is received from an external device e.g. a controller or host outside of the memory controller and nonvolatile memory device in step S the memory controller controls the nonvolatile memory device to perform a normal read operation. In one embodiment the normal read operation is performed by applying a first set of read voltages for example a single voltage or plurality of voltages to a selected memory cell or selected memory cells such as in sense operation circle around shown in . Data read by the normal read operation are transmitted from the nonvolatile memory device to the memory controller . The transmitted data are temporarily stored in the buffer memory of the memory controller . For convenience sake a read method of a nonvolatile memory device will be described under the assumption that the read data are erroneous. If no error exists in the read data the data stored in the buffer memory are transmitted to the external device. If the read data is erroneous the ECC unit determines whether the error in the read data is correctable in step S. If the error in the read data is correctable in step S the read operation is completed. That is the ECC unit corrects the error in the read data and the memory controller transmits the error corrected data to the external device.

If the error in the read data is uncorrectable the memory controller controls the nonvolatile memory device to perform a low level soft decision read operation in step . In one embodiment the low level soft decision read operation is performed by applying a second set of read voltages and none of the voltages in the first set to the selected memory cell or the selected memory cells. In this case data stored in the buffer memory i.e. hard decision data are retained and the voltage applied in the hard decision read operation need not be applied. In an exemplary embodiment the low level soft decision read operation is different from the 2 bit soft decision read operation described with reference to in that the low level soft decision read operation includes only two sense operations. More specifically the low level soft decision read operation includes two sense operations circle around and circle around as illustrated in . The two sense operations circle around and circle around may be performed by applying two different voltages to the selected memory cell or the selected memory cells without repeating the application of a first voltage applied in sense operation circle around . Error probability data are generated on the basis of the data read through the two sense operations circle around and circle around . The error probability data may be generated in the same way as described above or may be generated differently from the above described way. The low level soft decision read operation is performed using the hard decision data resulting from and already previously determined in the hard decision read operation or the normal read operation to result in 2 bit soft decision data. Therefore an additional sense operation performed to obtain the hard decision data is omitted. In step S the memory controller determines whether an error in the low level soft decision data is correctable. If the error in the low level soft decision data is correctable the ECC unit corrects the error in the low level soft decision data and the memory controller transmits the error corrected data to the external device. That is the read operation is completed.

If the error in the low level soft decision data is uncorrectable the memory controller controls the nonvolatile memory device to perform a high level soft decision read operation in step S. In this case data stored in the buffer memory i.e. hard decision data and error probability data are retained. In an exemplary embodiment the high level soft decision read operation is different from the 3 bit soft decision read operation described with reference to in that it includes only 4 sense operations. More specifically the high level soft decision read operation includes four sense operations circle around circle around circle around and circle around as illustrated in . The four sense operations circle around circle around circle around and circle around may be performed by applying four different voltages that are different from any of the two voltages applied in the low level soft decision read operation or the one or more voltages applied in the hard decision read operation to the selected memory cell or the selected memory cells. Error probability data are generated on the basis of the data read through the four sense operations circle around circle around circle around and circle around . The error probability data may be generated in the same way as described above or may be generated differently from the above described way. The high level soft decision read operation is performed using the hard decision data resulting from and already previously determined in the hard decision read operation or the normal read operation and the error probability data resulting from and already previously determined in the low level soft decision read operation to result in high level soft decision data. Therefore a sense operation performed to obtain the hard decision data and the error probability data is omitted.

In step S the memory controller determines whether an error in the high level soft decision data is correctable. If the error in the high level soft decision data is correctable the read method proceeds to step S . In step S the ECC unit corrects the error in the high level soft decision data and the memory controller transmits the error corrected data to the external device e.g. the host . That is the read operation is completed. If the error in the high level soft decision data is uncorrectable in step S the read operation requested by the host is treated as fail.

In an exemplary embodiment it will be well understood that additional soft decision read operations having read resolutions other than the low level and high level soft decision read operations may be performed. The additional soft decision read operations may also be performed using the hard decision data already stored and the error probability data determined based on newly applied voltages.

Except for the following differences the read method of is substantially identical to the read method of . In step S a hard decision read operation is performed. If hard decision data are uncorrectable a 2 bit soft decision read operation or a first soft decision read operation is performed in step S. The 2 bit soft decision read operation includes three sense operations that are performed in the same way as described with reference to . Hard decision data and error probability data are generated on the basis of the data read through the three sense operations resulting in 2 bit soft decision data. If an error in the 2 bit soft decision data is uncorrectable by the error probability data a 3 bit soft decision read operation or a second soft decision read operation is performed in step S. The 3 bit soft decision read operation is performed in substantially the same way as the high level soft decision read operation described with reference to . That is four sense operations are performed and in the 3 bit soft decision read operation the hard decision data the error probability data generated through the 2 bit soft decision read operation and the error probability data generated through the 3 bit soft decision read operation are used. If an error in the hard decision data is correctable the read operation is completed. If an error in the hard decision data is uncorrectable the read operation is treated as fail.

If an error in data read by a normal read operation is uncorrectable a read operation is performed as illustrated in .

Referring to in step S it is determined whether a high level soft decision read operation is selected. If a high level soft decision read operation is not selected the read method proceeds to step S in which a low level soft decision read operation is performed in the same way as described with reference to or . In step S it is determined whether an error in data read through a normal read operation is correctable. If so in step S the low level soft decision read operation is completed. If not the read method proceeds to step S in which a soft decision option changes. For example the soft decision option changes from a low level soft decision operation to a high level soft decision operation. That is a high level soft decision operation is selected. Thereafter the read method returns to step S.

In step S it is determined whether a high level soft decision read operation is selected. Since a high level soft decision read operation is selected the read method proceeds to step S in which a high level soft decision read operation is performed in the same way as described with reference to or . In step S it is determined whether an error in data read through a normal read operation is correctable. If so in step S the high level soft decision read operation is completed. If not in step S the read operation is treated as fail.

In an exemplary embodiment an operation of determining a new read voltage for a hard decision read operation may be performed before the soft decision read operation. For example the operation of determining the new read voltage may be performed between steps S and S of or before step S of . A method of determining the new read voltage is disclosed in U.S. Pat.
