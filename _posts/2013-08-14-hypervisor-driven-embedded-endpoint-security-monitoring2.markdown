Computer network may be any suitable computer network including the Internet an intranet a wide area network WAN a local area network LAN a wireless network a digital subscriber line DSL network a frame relay network an asynchronous transfer mode ATM network a virtual private network VPN or any combination of any of the same. Communications links and may be any communications links suitable for communicating between workstations and server e.g. network control center such as network links dial up links wireless links hard wired links as well as network types developed in the future and the like. A virtual machine may be a software implementation of a computer that executes computer programs as if it were a standalone physical machine.

Referring to in an example a computing device boots up into a bare metal hypervisor and transparently to the user the hypervisor may launch a virtual machine VM operating system. The bare metal or Type I hypervisor communicates directly with the computer hardware of computer device acting as a physical hardware host. Concurrently the hypervisor also launches transparently to the user a security virtual machine e.g. security monitoring stack or security engine . In one example the security VM includes the network scrubbing or anti virus tasks and other security functions to prevent hostile or intrusive software e.g. malware code scripts and other rogue software infecting the computing device. In one construction this security VM may include dedicated communication storage and computer components used for checking integrity authenticity or security monitoring of the computer as a node endpoint on the network cloud.

In some constructions the security VM can managed certain factors of data security and secure communications. For example an IPSEC circuit is commonly to pertain to IP Security a set of protocols to support secure exchange of packet at the IP layer in a TCP IP network system. IPSEC systems have been deployed widely to implement Virtual Private Networks VPNs . Under an IPSEC system two encryption modes are supported Transport and Tunnel. Transport mode encrypts only the payload portion of each packet but leaves the header. The Tunnel mode encrypts both the header and the payload. On the receiving side an IPSEC compliant device decrypts each packet. The methods and features recited herein further may be implemented through any number of non transitory computer readable media that are able to store computer readable instructions.

The security software functions are provided in a separate virtual machine that intercepts the data traffic that comes in and out of the user OS VM by the way of the hypervisor and inspects the data traffic to make sure that the data integrity is maintained and protected without the running anti virus applications locally on the computing device . In one implementation the data traffic to the user VM is mirrored to the security VM . Hence when the computing device boots up into hypervisor and VM operating system environment the security functions reside in the security VM . In this way the security VM isolates malicious software that could otherwise occur in the user OS VM and the user experience is greatly improved as well reduce memory processing overhead. Correspondingly the security VM enables introspection of the shared memory space and to analyze the shared memory space for hostile or intrusive code for example.

The bare metal hypervisor mediates access to the computer for the operating system VM and the security VM . In one example the hypervisor includes an application programming interface API that can be abstracted as a virtual switch at the hypervisor level such that the security VM has full access to the virtual switch. In this manner the security VM runs itself when utilizing the virtual switch and is inspecting the data to the computer abstracted as node endpoints on the network. This construction enables the traffic from the user operating system VM to be directed the through the same hypervisor that comprises the virtual switch to get to the network cloud. In this way the security VM would see data traffic in and out of the computer and going to the user operating system VM .

Referring to in the security monitoring context for a network control center NCC the security VM is transparent to the user and can be centrally managed for that security monitoring through virtual machine introspection from one machine discerning what is happening on another machine. In one example the NCC with one or more server computers can receive data representative of security information from a designated computing device e.g. workstation . The computing device may have at least a user OS virtual machine a security virtual machine and hypervisor which provides communication between the user OS virtual machine and the security virtual machine.

The security VM is enabled to provide data to store an electronic data log of activity in which the notions of what has occurred on the user OS VM is recorded. The security VM can be enabled to communicate securely on a LAN WAN or VPN to a security operating center SOC of the NCC via the bare metal hypervisor virtual switch or other software component s . In such case the security VMs become network endpoint sensors that can be monitored for large scale data abstractions of the computers on the network . For example the data log of the security VM provides an indication of what happened on the particular computer. The security VM would be set up so that it be can centrally accessed from anywhere connected to the LAN WAN or VPN and get details about what happened on that machine as well as any other machine within the control of the NCC.

The NCC has a connection to the hypervisor and then subsequently access to the security VM . In this way an ecosystem is created around a large data sensor grid of nodes endpoints e.g. a plurality of security VMs that are listening in and reporting back data information to be collected for the centrally controlled operation at the NCC. The security VM would not be subject to malware infection the type of malicious attacks that the user OS VM could experience. In the ecosystem software components can be deployed in the network to the hypervisors or user operating system VMs in response to data analyzed in the sensor grid. In other words the NCC can consolidate the data received from the plurality of security VMs designated on the computers of the network via the hypervisors.

In one example from the NCC the security VM enables the separate stack to monitor the full security of the designated computer through virtual machine introspection or via the traffic inspection. The system inspects data that comes in and out of designated machine and processes the memory and the network traffic itself. In one example shared memory of the designated computer can be inspected using the security VM remotely at the NCC.
