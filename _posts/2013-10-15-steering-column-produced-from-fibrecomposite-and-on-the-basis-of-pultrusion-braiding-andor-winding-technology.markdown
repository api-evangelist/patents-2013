This application is a U.S. National Stage Entry of International Patent Application Serial Number PCT EP2013 071508 filed Oct. 15 2013 which claims priority to German patent application no. DE 102013001442.5 filed Jan. 29 2013 the entire contents of both of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The invention relates to a steering column assembly for a vehicle and to a process for producing components for such a steering column assembly.

Steering column assemblies or steering columns of the type in question are used for fitting in a motor vehicle and transmitting the torques applied by the driver to a steering wheel into a steering system of the vehicle. Furthermore steering columns have to stand a variety of loads during use in particular when the vehicle collides with an obstacle the crash case.

DE 10 2005 034 952 B3 discloses for example a steering column which is adjustable in its height and its inclination. A steering spindle is mounted rotatably in an adjusting part which is also referred to as a casing unit. The casing unit is held in a retaining part and the retaining part is mounted in a retaining clip which can be fastened to a vehicle body. Provided for adapting the position of the steering spindle or a steering wheel fastened thereto is a clamping system which can be adjusted by an adjusting lever between an open position and a closed position. In the open position of the clamping system the casing unit can be displaced in its longitudinal direction with respect to the retaining part and at the same time the retaining part can be pivoted in its inclination with respect to the retaining clip about a pivot axis. In the closed position of the clamping system the steering spindle is fixed with respect to the retaining clip which is fixed to the body. Such steering columns and clamping systems are known in various configurations in the prior art.

In keeping with the prior art the components of such steering columns are made of cast steel aluminum or magnesium.

To favorably influence fuel consumption and to improve the driving dynamics of motor vehicles and also to increase the range of electric powered vehicles there is a general desire to make such steering columns particularly lightweight and of great rigidity. For this purpose DE 101 55 891 B4 proposes generally making the casing unit that forms the central bearing tube from a thermoplastic or a thermoplastic tube with a glass fiber or carbon fiber filling. However how such a bearing tube may actually be formed is left open by the disclosure.

EP 0091671 B1 discloses a safety steering column in which a tube part of the steering spindle is formed in one piece with a rigid steering column portion of fiber reinforced plastic. In this case it is disclosed that the steering column is produced by a technique of winding around a core for example of rigid polyurethane foam. However this greatly restricts the possibilities for the design of the steering column.

DE 102 42 527 A1 discloses a steering column supporting housing consisting of a polymer composite material and having a mounting support the steering column supporting housing and the mounting support comprising a multiplicity of fibers within a composite material.

Furthermore DE 198 09 264 A1 discloses a fibrous structure arrangement and a process for producing a preform. In the fibrous structure arrangement individual layers of fiber are laid one on top of the other and sewn with sewing threads in some cases with adhesive mats inserted as intermediate layers. This arrangement includes a meltable layer which is only activated during a forming process and after forming into a desired three dimensional shape provides permanent solidification of the preform.

The object of the invention is to provide a lightweight steering column with which there is a great freedom of design.

The object is achieved by a steering column corresponding to the feature of claim . Advantageous developments of the invention are presented in the subclaims. In the case of a steering column for a motor vehicle with a steering spindle mounted rotatably about a longitudinal axis in a steering spindle bearing unit and with a supporting unit that is designed to form the connection of the steering spindle bearing unit to the body of the motor vehicle in which at least one component of the steering column is at least partially formed from a fiber reinforced composite material great freedom of design is obtained because it is further provided that the component lies in the flux of force of the steering column between the steering spindle and the body and that at least one pultrusion layer is provided comprising as reinforcing fibers multiple pultrusion fibers oriented in the direction of the longitudinal axis and parallel to one another. This makes it possible to dispense with a core in the production of the fiber composite component. It is also possible to form on the outer surface regions that are concave in the circumferential direction which cannot be accomplished or only with great difficulty in the case of braiding or winding processes.

Because the process for producing a steering column with a steering spindle that is mounted rotatably about its axis in a steering spindle bearing unit and with a supporting unit that is designed to connect the steering spindle bearing unit directly or indirectly to the body of the motor vehicle at least one of the components of the steering column being formed as a fiber composite component comprises the following steps 

2. forming a shaped piece by braiding and or winding reinforcing fibers around the support along predetermined paths on the surface of the support 

3. bringing the shaped piece into a mold either the supporting fibers and the reinforcing fibers being impregnated with a curable resin before their processing or said fibers being impregnated with a curable resin after the forming of the shaped piece and subsequently 4. curing the resin and forming the fiber composite component 5. and mounting the steering column while incorporating the fiber composite component in the steering column the steering column can be made with relatively low weight and of great rigidity with great freedom of design.

The support formed by the pultrusion may in this case be braided and or wound from its inner surface and or from its outer surface for forming the shaped piece. In particular it is also conceivable and possible to form multiple supports in the pultrusion process and to form the shaped piece with braided and or wound layers interposed.

The invention can be applied in particular to a steering column assembly that is adjustable in its length and or inclination. For this purpose the supporting unit is advantageously formed by a retaining part which can be connected to the body of the motor vehicle and receives a guiding clip which retains the steering spindle bearing unit. Also provided in the case of an adjustable steering column is a fixing system which can be set according to choice between an open position and a closed position. With the fixing system open the steering spindle can be adjusted preferably by the guiding clip being pivotable in a pivot axis in the retaining part and the steering spindle bearing unit being displaceable in the guiding clip. However the invention can also be applied to adjustable steering columns with which the adjusting functions take some other form as are known in the prior art.

Preferably the pultrusion fibers support at least one structure layer formed by fibers for example a woven or knitted fabric or a braid or a wound structure. In this respect it is preferred if the structure layer is a woven fabric since particularly good torsional rigidity can thus be achieved.

If the pultrusion fibers surround the steering spindle by at least 180 in the circumferential direction in the manner of a shell a geometry that is advantageous for later mounting can be achieved already during the production of the component without the component created subsequently having to be cut open as is the case with tubular blanks.

The torsional rigidity is further improved if the at least one structure layer comprises a woven fabric or a braid with a proportion of over 50 of fibers oriented within the structure layer these fibers being oriented at an angle between 20 and 70 in relation to the pultrusion fibers.

It is advantageous for the overall load bearing capacity of the component if at least two structure layers are provided the pultrusion layer being arranged between the structure layers and at least one structure layer lying on the outside and the at least one other structure layer lying on the inside.

A good compromise between mechanical properties weight and costs is achieved by the at least one layer that is lying on the outside being produced from glass fiber and the pultrusion layer and or the at least one layer that is lying on the inside being produced from carbon fiber.

The overall weight of the steering column is reduced if the component produced from fiber composite material bears the steering spindle indirectly or directly. For this purpose it is further preferred that the at least one structure layer bears functional elements that are molded on for example attached by material bonding or laminated in.

The functional elements are preferably selected from the group comprising fastening straps guides movement restrictors and holders for cable harnesses. In particular the functional elements may be metal butt straps with openings drilled holes or clearances.

In the case of the steering column according to the invention it is particularly preferred if the component is a guiding clip for the steering spindle bearing unit. The attachment of further functional elements of the steering column is simplified if the guiding clip is open in a central region on a side that lies upward during operation. Here for example a steering lock may be arranged.

The present disclosure will be discussed in further detail below with reference to the attached drawing figures.

To increase the rigidity and strength of the component in the circumferential direction for receiving bearings or transmitting torsional moments one or more further processes may be arranged upstream or downstream of the pultrusion process. The winding process and the braiding process are suitable for this.

In all of the variants a subsequent braiding and or winding operation and or also a pultrusion operation may be arranged downstream.

In a way corresponding to a blank of fiber composite material is produced by means of pultrusion also known as extrusion and downstream braiding.

In the case of process sequence b represented here preimpregnated rovings consisting of preimpregnated uncured continuous fibers arranged in parallel not represented here are used.

At the end of the process sequence the rovings are pulled through a first template by a pulling device likewise not represented here and brought into the desired profiled shape. The pulling force applied by the pulling device is in this case so great that the arrangement of the rovings and consequently the profiled shape is also retained in the other steps of the process.

After the first template the rovings that have been brought into shape are passed through a braiding head . By arranging the braiding process downstream the pultruded profile can be used as a structure or core and be reinforced with one or more wound or braided layers. The same result as in the case of the braiding process can also be achieved by winding. By contrast in the case of winding the rovings are not arranged in a crosswise directional structure but are wound around. In this case multiple rovings may be wound in a correspondingly offset manner so that virtually the same arrangement of the rovings is produced.

In order to refine the shaping after the braiding head the entire braid is passed through a second template and a third template . Following that the braid is pulled through a heated curing zone . In the curing zone the synthetic resin solidifies under the effect of heat and forms a blank . For this the resin is mixed with a catalyst. This curing may take place by introducing an increased temperature and or by introducing ultrasound and or by introducing ultraviolet light.

The mold core advantageously extends over the entire distance from the beginning of pultrusion or of the braiding or winding process to the curing of the curable resin. This makes it possible to arrange a braid or a fiber winding around the core within the support formed by the pultrusion.

Here rovings are brought into the profiled shape by being pulled through a first template not represented here . After that as in the previous embodiment a second layer of rovings is braided onto the arrangement of the rovings by being introduced into the braiding head . After the braiding head the braid runs through an impregnating bath in which it is impregnated with a liquid synthetic resin. Subsequently in a heated curing zone which at the same time forms a mold the synthetic resin is cured. The mold provided ensures the profiled shape and can perform further shaping operations. After the curing the blank is cut to size or sawn by a cutting device .

As an alternative to the impregnation of the rovings in an impregnating bath it is also conceivable and possible to introduce the curable resin directly into the mold preferably with pressure and thereby impregnate the fibers with the resin.

A schematic representation of process sequence b is reproduced in . In a first step the rovings are unwound by a roller unwinder and tensioned. After that they run through the first template before a braid is applied by the braiding head and the entire profile is passed through the second template . Subsequently the rovings run through the impregnating bath the mold and the curing zone . The resin received in the impregnating bath is cured in the curing zone . Downstream of the curing zone there is a pulling device which has not been shown in the previous . The rovings are tensioned and pulled by this pulling device from left to right through the individual components of the construction. In the last step of the process the cutting device provides that the blank is cut to the correct length.

In further steps the blank is completed to form a casing tube of a steering column according to the invention. As indicated in for this purpose a first milled relief with an opening is introduced into a guiding ridge of the blank at an end face . Furthermore a second milled relief is introduced at the guiding ridge and acting together with further elements may serve as a linear stop of the steering column according to the invention. Furthermore on both sides of the blank two bearing receptacles and corresponding bearings for bearing a steering spindle are attached to the blank . In the preassembled casing tube is shown. To finish it off a holder for an immobilizer not shown here is provided on the first milled relief of the guiding ridge at the end face of the blank so that the immobilizer can engage through the opening into a steering shaft that is not shown here.

In a profile of a preferred layered construction of a blank is represented. The profile shows the cured synthetic resin with the rovings embedded therein in three layers. Hatchings should in this case not be regarded as rovings .

The inner layer consists of pultrusion rovings which in the case of components that are predominantly subjected to tensile or flexural loading such as for example the casing tube of a steering column lie in the component appropriately for the flux of force in the axial direction.

The outer layers of the layered construction consist of arrangements created by braiding or winding technology with an angle of approximately 45 . The fiber layers oriented at 45 allow tensile stresses that are caused by transverse forces to be absorbed.

All of the fibers of the layered construction may consist of glass aramid or carbon. Other materials may also serve for forming the fibers. With preference the outer layers are formed with glass fibers and the inner layers which are pultruded layers are fog ned with carbon fibers.

In this case glass fibers for the outer layers the regions in which contact with other components in particular metallic components of the steering column is intended are used to improve the corrosion resistance.

Illustrated in are a mold and a blank of an alternative type of casing tube in which no guiding ridge is provided and the casing tube is formed in a multi cornered polygonal shape. One advantage of the process according to the invention is that the configuration of the profile can be freely chosen and consequently the shaping of the casing tube is not restricted.

Furthermore in the case of the process according to the invention the cross section of a blank can be chosen within a wide range. Both closed and open components can be produced for example a guiding clip. illustrate the representation of a guiding clip . As represented in a corresponding blank is produced in a combination of pultrusion and braiding and winding technology. Subsequently in a way corresponding to an end piece a bearing receptacle and a bearing for the steering shaft are attached and also wedge elements for the clamping system of the steering column are inserted in the blank . In a module preassembled in this way is represented. Subsequently the circumferentially closed blank is cut open in a cutting operation in order to obtain the desired opening in the swiveling lever . In an alternative embodiment of the guiding clip with the corresponding cutouts is represented. shows the engagement of a clamping bolt in the guiding ridge which in the open position of the clamping system limits the linear adjustment by the stops.

To form the steering column the individual components of which at least one component has been produced by the technology described are assembled.

The clamping bolt passes through slots in the side pieces of the retaining part and holes in the side faces of the guiding clip . The cam mechanism is arranged on one end of the clamping bolt and the pressure bearing is arranged on the other end of the clamping bolt . The side pieces and also the side faces as well as the casing tube are arranged between the cam mechanism and the pressure bearing .

By turning the clamping lever the fixing system can be switched over according to choice into an open position or a closed position. In the open position the steering spindle or the steering wheel fastened thereto not represented in the figures can be adjusted in its position in particular be displaced in the longitudinal direction and in the direction of its height or inclination . In the closed position of the fixing system the steering column is fixed in its position.
