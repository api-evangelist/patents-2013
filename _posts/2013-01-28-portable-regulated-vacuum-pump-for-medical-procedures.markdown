This invention relates to vacuum assisted devices that require the use of a vacuum in order to attach to body parts and or tissue.

A grasping cup obstetric bonnet or ventouse cap are some of the names given to the devices used in the field of obstetrics. These devices use a suction cup to assist in the vaginal and operative delivery of newborns. Typically the suction cup is applied to the fetal scalp during the second stage pushing through the birth canal of labor. The obstetrician then applies traction to the infant s head via a flexible or rigid shaft with a handle coupled to the suction cup. The traction is applied in an outward fashion while the delivering mother pushes thereby assisting in the delivery of the newborn. These suction cups are typically made of silicone rubber vinyl or other plastic or combinations of plastic and rubber. Suction is generally applied through suction tubing which is coupled to a nipple on the vacuum cup the nipple communicating with the interior of the cup. The method by which the suction is produced can vary from large stationary mechanical vacuum suction devices to hand held pumps similar to those which are used to bleed brake fluid from brake lines of automobiles. The suction cup has been reported to be safer than forceps and is intended to more gently ease a baby from the womb than forceps.

Suction devices can also be used to manipulate tissue during surgery. For example U.S. Pat. No. 5 196 003 to Bilweis discloses an endoscopic surgical instrument which includes a tube with a suction cup at one end and a bulb at its opposite end. The cup is placed on a target tissue and the bulb is compressed and released in order to apply suction to the tissue. The tissue is released by again compressing the bulb.

In an embodiment of the present invention a pump is used to apply a vacuum to a vacuum device attached to a body part. The vacuum device comprises the suction device or suction cup a sensor for monitoring the vacuum applied to the suction device a pump for increasing the vacuum to the suction device a tube for applying the vacuum to the suction device and a control circuit for activating the pump. In an embodiment of the present invention the control circuit is operated by the surgeon holding the suction device. In an embodiment of the present invention the surgeon controls the vacuum applied while performing the surgical procedure. In an embodiment of the present invention the suction device can be manipulated and the vacuum device can be controlled by a surgeon alone while the surgical procedure is carried out.

The treatment of open wounds too large to spontaneously close have long been a troublesome area of medical practice. The initial stage of healing is characterized by the formation of granulation tissue which can take several hours. When an open wound is present or formed during surgery it is not feasible to wait for normal wound healing. In order to help address this situation application of vacuum has been proposed as a sealing device for the abnormal tissue. If a tissue displays a site which is bleeding a suction cup may be applied at that site to tamponade active bleeding until the surgery can progress sufficiently to repair or remove the structure in question.

When a vacuum is applied to a suction cup on a structure having a blood flow blood can typically pool inside the site which may lead to the formation of a hematoma. When an obstetrical vacuum extractor is applied to a fetal scalp during vacuum extraction assisted deliveries of newborns for example occasionally a small bruise or hematoma occurs on the scalp. Additionally some soft tissue edema and swelling may occur on the area of the scalp where the vacuum was applied.

There is a significant need for vacuum assisted devices in surgical and obstetrical delivery procedures. For example procedures that involve the use of vacuum cups grasping cups a tamponade apparatus or suction cups that attach to body tissue require the use of external vacuum generation pumps.

Before describing the invention in detail it is helpful to describe an example environment in which the invention may be implemented. The present invention is particularly useful in obstetrical delivery where the surgical procedure requires that a grasping cup or suction cup be attached to the fetal skull during the obstetrical delivery. Under these circumstances monitoring of the suction cup can be partially obscured as the cup is attached in utero during the second stage of labor. The presence or absence of hair on the fetus scalp the weight of the fetus and amount of fatty tissue on the scalp the position of the fetus in the womb and the location that the suction device is applied to the fetus scalp can all affect the effectiveness of this vacuum device and the procedure for its use. In this manner the vacuum device can considerably assist the surgeon. The surgeon is able to diagnose on a continually unfolding basis the important features affecting the delivery procedure in a timely and accurate fashion and use this diagnosis to set appropriate vacuum levels for the vacuum device . Further the ability of the surgeon to be able to make use of real time changes to the delivery procedure in changing the vacuum levels applied to the vacuum device to maintain the fixed vacuum to the suction device can allow the surgeon to compensate for many of the variations related to these important features.

Surgical and obstetrical delivery procedures require suction devices including vacuum cups grasping cups a tamponade apparatus or other fixtures that attach to body tissue. Each of these devices requires a vacuum be applied to attach the device to tissue. The vacuum can be applied by a pump. Further these procedures require continual monitoring manipulation and re activation of the pump by the physician. As such the monitoring and manipulation create additional workload that distracts the physician from the primary surgical task.

Suction devices to manipulate tissue during surgery have exhibited various disadvantages. The suction devices are difficult to utilize in that the surgeon has very little control over the level of vacuum applied to the tissue. There is a check release valve on the hand held pump and the surgeon has the ability to re pump up the vacuum. However these tasks are difficult when the physician is concentrating on other facets of the surgical procedure. Importantly the surgeon s ability to monitor the vacuum level that is applied through a suction cup and fine tune manipulations to increase or decrease vacuum pressure is very imprecise. Further although the hand pumps can include a gauge the physician does not have the time to visually monitor the gauge. More importantly even if the physician had the ability to visually monitor the pressure of the gauge the physician s manual reflexes would not allow the physician to react to the pressure fluctuations in time to avoid for example separation of the suction device. In an embodiment of the invention the vacuum can prevent separation at the margin i.e. at the suction device rim contact site. Further releasing the vacuum on the tissue can only be carried out by releasing the check relief valve. Moreover manipulation of the tissue using the suction device is limited by the direct application of force along the tube. In addition the field of movement is not versatile and may be inadequate for purposes of a given surgery. Additionally applying the vacuum requires the assistance of a second medical professional.

A vacuum of atmospheric pressure is 1 atmosphere 760 torr. Generally approximately in this pressure range encompasses a range of pressures from below 7.6 10torr to 7.6 10torr. A pressure of below 10torr would constitute a high vacuum. A pressure of below 10torr would constitute a medium vacuum. A pressure between atmospheric pressure and a medium vacuum constitutes a low vacuum. In an embodiment of the invention a vacuum is sensed at a suction device . In an alternative embodiment of the invention a vacuum is sensed at a wound . In another embodiment of the invention a vacuum is sensed at a tissue. In an embodiment of the invention the vacuum sensed at the tissue compensates for out gassing and leaks when the suction device is applied to the tissue. Generally approximately in a low vacuum pressure range encompasses a range of pressures from between 5 10torr to 5 10torr. Generally approximately in a medium vacuum pressure range encompasses a range of pressures from between 5 10torr to 5 10torr. In an embodiment of the invention a marginal increase in vacuum is an increase of vacuum from 10torr to 5 10torr. In an alternative embodiment of the invention a marginal increase in vacuum is an increase of vacuum from 5 10torr to 10torr. The vacuum device can operate to lower the pressure from atmospheric pressure to generate a high vacuum. In an embodiment of the invention a low vacuum can be applied in for example obstetric suction devices. In an embodiment of the invention a medium vacuum can be applied in for example orthopedic suction devices. In an embodiment of the invention immediate release of a low vacuum reduces the vacuum to approximately atmospheric pressure in between a lower limit of approximately 0.1 second and an upper limit of approximately 0.5 second. In an embodiment of the invention immediate release of a medium vacuum reduces the vacuum to approximately atmospheric pressure in between a lower limit of approximately 0.3 second and an upper limit of approximately 1.0 second. In an embodiment of the invention a force of approximately 10Newton can be applied to tissue with the vacuum device through a suction device . In an alternative embodiment of the invention a force of approximately 10Newton can be applied to tissue with the vacuum device through a suction device .

In various embodiments of the invention the vacuum device can allow grasping of structures through a suction device during various types of surgery. Any organ or structure that has a smooth surface to which a vacuum device can attach and manipulate can be a candidate for use with the vacuum device. U.S. Pat. No. 6 641 575 SURGICAL VACUUM INSTRUMENT FOR RETRACTING EXTRACTING AND MANIPULATING TISSUE by Neal M. Lonky outlines an open cup grasper suction device as envisaged in various embodiments of the invention attached to the vacuum device . The open cup graspers can be adapted for use with the vacuum device for open abdominal laparotomy chest thoracotomy brain craniotomy or orthopedic uses vacuum traction or manipulation of bony surfaces . In addition there is a more retroperitoneal surgical approach that can benefit from the vacuum device . Urology surgeons use an incision in the back to get to the kidneys. During this surgery the kidneys or other surfaces can be manipulated using the vacuum device.

Unexpectedly it was found that application and maintenance of a fixed constant vacuum from a vacuum device prevented separation of the margin of the suction device from tissue when traction was applied or when patient movement jarred the margin of the device in the setting of tamponade of a bleeding site. In particular it was found that the degree and range of motion and amount of force which could be applied in traction extraction tamponade and manipulation were all enhanced by the application of a constant vacuum.

In discussions with surgery assistants during procedures where only the hand pump was available to a number of surgeons it became apparent that a mechanical pump led to procedural failures due to surgeon fatigue. The effort required in constantly monitoring the pressure gauge and reinitiating the mechanical pumping by grasping and compressing the handle exacerbated psychological pressure and physical fatigue due to the surgical procedure. In experiments with an animal model or simulations with human tissue it was observed that pop off detachments were significantly minimized with the automated vacuum device . This result was unexpected based on the informal questioning of a group of five surgeons who were shown a prototype vacuum device in these model or simulation environments. This result was also unexpected inasmuch as all surgeons consulted indicated that they did not know marginal separation was a factor that could be addressed by a constant vacuum pump until shown the prototype and or the results.

If traction force exceeds the pressure under the suction device the attachment force the suction device edge furthest from the traction point will lift and separate from the tissue causing the leakage leading to cup pop off . Essentially when that equilibrium is reached and the two pressures equilibrate there is a slow leak. It was learned after consulting with surgical assistants that the surgeon does not sense this release and thereby cannot manually pump the hand held vacuum pump to counteract the leakage in time before the suction device releases completely. Unexpectedly it was found that a machine driven pump sensor can detect the release as measured by the drop in vacuum and compensate for the release by activating the automated pump and compensating for the partial release thereby allowing application of greater traction force without experiencing pop off .

When a suction device is applied to a fetal scalp on which lanugo vellus or terminal hair is present the hair can disturb the seal between the suction device and the scalp and thereby result in a vacuum leak. Application of a constant vacuum can compensate for the vacuum leak allowing for traction extraction and manipulation of the fetal head. Once the head has exited the vagina the surgeon needs to be able to release the suction device and manually deliver the fetus. Complete venting of the relief valve via a solenoid allows instantaneous release of the suction device . When a suction device is applied to an organ containing an uneven or obstructed tissue surface the uneven surface can result in a vacuum leak. Application of a constant vacuum can compensate for the vacuum leak allowing for traction extraction and manipulation of the organ.

Application of a suction device at a tissue site which is bleeding with a constant vacuum i.e. an applied vacuum that compensates for the changed clotting behavior of the wound with time can allow enhanced clotting and cessation of the bleeding from the site. It could be expected that a vacuum device with a vacuum tube delivering a vacuum to a suction device applied to the wound would accelerate the flow of blood. Contrary to this preconceived idea application of vacuum constricts the tissue at the margin of the bleeding site into toward the bleeding site. As a result the margin collapses allowing pooling of blood and clotting factors aiding clotting and cessation of blood flow.

In an embodiment of the invention the timing and periodicity of the application of the vacuum can be applied in a pulsatile flow opposite that of a patient s pulse. In an embodiment of the invention the vacuum can be applied to tissue. The tissue can include epithelial layers organs osseous tissue bony tissue and connective tissue exposed by an open incision during a laparotomy thoracotomy craniotomy retroperitoneal surgery and orthopedic vacuum traction or manipulation of bony surfaces. In an embodiment of the invention the vacuum can be applied to a wound when the surgeon senses diastoly to more actively collapse the wound. The wound can be one or more of a subcutaneous hematoma an incision made by the surgeon a site of removal of tissue by the surgeon a site of removal of an organ made by the surgeon one or more puncture holes being treated by the surgeon or one or more laceration sites being treated by the surgeon. Treating the wound can include stopping the blood flow from a site reducing the blood from a site assisting in the arrest of the flow of blood to a site stopping the blood flow to a subcutaneous hematoma reducing the blood flow to a subcutaneous hematoma assisting in the arrest of the flow of blood to a subcutaneous hematoma limiting its size and scope. In an embodiment of the invention the vacuum can be increased to the wound when the surgeon senses diastoly to more actively collapse the wound. In effect the surgeon can use the patient s own tissue and the suction device as a tourniquet and the vacuum can be increased to tighten the tourniquet. In an embodiment of the invention marginally increased vacuum pressure can be applied in diastoly and thereby more easily applied and then the vacuum can be maintained to overcome the systolic pressure pulse thus slowing or arresting the flow of blood.

In an embodiment of the invention the vacuum can be adjusted to compensate for the pulse pressure variation maintaining or slightly exceeding the suction device vacuum against the higher systolic pressure to secure placement at or over the bleeding site. Maintenance of the suction device on the bleeding site will ultimately more actively collapse the wound. In various embodiments of the invention the vacuum device can increase or decrease the vacuum to the wound in synchronization with a patient s heart changing from diastol to systoly to more actively collapse the wound. In this manner the clotting and cessation of blood flow of a wound can be further improved. It was unexpected that vacuum constriction applied when the patient s blood pressure is low could reduce bleeding. It was also unexpected that the ability of a surgeon to simultaneously perform surgery and monitor the pulse pressure would be near impossible which was observed when we interviewed surgeons in a simulation of a bleeding site event.

Further it is noted that undetected vacuum loss may result in the untoward premature detachment of the vacuum cup device from the body surface under manipulation. Improper or negligent operation of the vacuum pump or the manipulation of the tissue in contact with the various procedure cups devices may hamper the medical procedure or damage the affected tissue.

In the past vacuum assisted devices or vacuum generating devices have not recorded or maintained a record of operation of parameters including the applied vacuum vacuum leak being compensated time of application temperature change in conditions during procedure or notes regarding the classification of the surface and the nature of the problem addressed that can be reviewed and archived for inclusion in medical records. As such these vacuum assist devices do not allow the physician to utilize insight and intuition to choose conditions for the procedure that are similar to conditions previously utilized. Finally these vacuum assist devices do not allow the surgeon to select conditions based not only on the similarity of the procedure but also based on the surgeon performing the procedure.

Post surgical examination of the parameters used during a number of surgical procedures including vacuum applied nature of tissue evenness of surface vacuum leak due to uneven surface force of extraction manipulation applied time duration of vacuum applied and variation of vacuum applied allow review and establishment of guidelines that advance the safety and efficacy of the various surgical procedures being undertaken for a given patient sub population. By recording all the data obtained during surgery pertaining to the use of the vacuum device and making this data available together with other details of the patient and the operating surgeon a surgeon can store useful data and proactively select parameters for future use in similar circumstances based on stored data. For example ultrasound analysis of the fetus prior to birth can be performed to determine how much hair is present on the fetal scalp. This information can be used to select appropriate conditions for use in the childbirth should a suction device be required. In addition to the absence or presence of hair and the relative amount of hair the surgeon can also select the size and type of the specific suction device and the specific type of vacuum device based on the performance characteristics of the specific suction device and the specific type of vacuum device . During specific surgical procedures a variable vacuum can be desirable where the vacuum applied to the suction device is varied depending on the stage of the surgical procedure. In such circumstances the surgeon can manually indicate the different stages of the surgical procedure through a single depression of a control unit button or through voice activated recognition and response by the vacuum device . In an alternative embodiment of the invention the different stages of the surgical procedure can be communicated to or noted by an assistant who enters the appropriate information in the vacuum device . In an embodiment of the invention the control unit is attached to the suction device . In an embodiment of the invention the control unit can be held by the surgeon while holding and controlling the suction device . In an embodiment of the invention the control unit can be held by the surgeon with the same hand holding and controlling the suction device .
