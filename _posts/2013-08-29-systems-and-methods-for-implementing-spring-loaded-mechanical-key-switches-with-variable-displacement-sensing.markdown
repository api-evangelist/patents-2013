The present application is related in subject matter to concurrently filed patent application Ser. No. 14 013 603 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR LIGHTING SPRING LOADED MECHANICAL KEY SWITCHES by Casparian et al. which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This invention relates generally to information handling systems and more particularly to spring loaded mechanical key switches having variable displacement sensing capability.

As the value and use of information continues to increase individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option available to users is information handling systems. An information handling system generally processes compiles stores and or communicates information or data for business personal or other purposes thereby allowing users to take advantage of the value of the information. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements vary between different users or applications information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled how the information is handled how much information is processed stored or communicated and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed stored or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing airline reservations enterprise data storage or global communications. In addition information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process store and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems data storage systems and networking systems.

Keyboards using spring loaded mechanical key switches are popular input devices for information handling systems such as desktop and notebook computers. Keyboards that employ spring loaded mechanical key switches are particularly popular among users of gaming applications such as PC Gamers. Examples of conventional mechanical key switches that are employed in keyboards include Cherry MX Key Switches available from ZF Electronic Systems of Pleasant Prairie Wis. These keys are spring loaded and provide continuous tension throughout a downward key stroke which has a total travel length of approximately 4 millimeters. The make connection for the mechanical switch is made at approximately the 2 millimeter downward key travel position i.e. 50 downward travel . With a spring in place beneath the key there is always tension on the user s finger throughout the downward key stroke. After the make connection is made no further electrical signals are created as the key travels further downward a distance of another 2 millimeters as the user continues to apply more downward pressure to the key.

Other types of information handling system keyboards include dome switch keyboards that do not employ a mechanical switch but instead employs a rubber dome that overlies two electrically separated conductive layers at each key location. When a key is pressed by a user the rubber dome contacts and compresses the two conductive layers together to cause an electrical connection to be made between the two conductive layers at the key location. The occurrence of this electrical connection creates a digital signal that is provided to a keyboard controller to indicate that the particular key location has been pressed by the user. QWERTY style dome switch keyboards have been backlit using 10 to 12 edge mounted light emitting diodes RGB or single color LEDs that illuminate a polycarbonate light spreader layer located under and oriented parallel to the conductive layers of the dome switch keyboard. Light emanates from the side surface of the light spreader and shines up in free space and through the intervening light transmissive conductive layers of the keyboard to backlight the keys which have light transmissive characters that are laser etched into the keycaps.

Disclosed herein are systems and methods that may be implemented to provide spring loaded mechanical key switches having variable displacement sensing and reporting capabilities.

In one embodiment such variable displacement sensing spring loaded mechanical key switches may be advantageously implemented as individual variable displacement key switches of a keyboard for providing variable displacement output signals that may be processed by a controller for input to a host processing device of an information handling system such as a desktop or notebook computer. In a further embodiment such a keyboard may be optimized or otherwise employed by a user for gaming applications such as PC games that execute on an information handling system. In a further embodiment the processed variable displacement output signals may be utilized by an information handling system as a proxy for or indication of the amount of pressure applied by a user to a key switch of a keyboard e.g. for purposes of software applications and other software and or firmware that utilize relative pressure and or absolute amount of pressure applied by a user to a keyboard key as a variable input signal.

In one particular implementation a variable displacement sensing spring loaded mechanical key switch may be configured to provide both a single digital make connection signal e.g. a single digital on off signal occurring at about a 50 downward travel of the keystroke and a separate variable displacement output signal s e.g. as one or more analog output signals that are representative of amount of downward displacement currently being applied to the given key each of which may be processed for input to host processing device of an information handling system such as desktop or notebook computer However it will be understood that a variable pressure sensing spring loaded mechanical key switch may alternatively be configured to provide only variable displacement output signal s and without providing a separate digital on off output signal. Either way a spring loaded mechanical key switch may be provided that supports both a spring loaded key feel and variable displacement sensing capability.

Also disclosed herein are systems and methods that may be implemented in one embodiment to provide key cap lighting to a spring loaded mechanical key switch e.g. via a light pipe without requiring a chassis housing of the mechanical key switch to include a dedicated power consuming light source e.g. such as a light emitting diode LED mounted to or otherwise positioned at the location of the individual key switch chassis housing. In a further embodiment one or more common power consuming light source s e.g. such as one or common LEDs may be employed to simultaneously provide key cap lighting to multiple spring loaded mechanical key switches without requiring a dedicated power consuming light source mounted to or otherwise positioned at the chassis housing location of any of the individual spring loaded key switches e.g. by feeding light to each key cap though a common light spreader and through an individual non power consuming light pipe provided for each key switch.

Using the disclosed key cap lighting systems and methods large savings in keyboard power consumption and decreased keyboard assembly complexity may be achieved for keyboards having multiple spring loaded mechanical key switches by employing a non power consuming light source e.g. light pipe to light each key switch cap rather than using a separate power consuming light source e.g. such as a LED mounted into or at the location of each separate key switch chassis housing. In this regard overall keyboard power consumption may be reduced because the number of common power consuming light sources that are employed to light a given number of spring loaded mechanical key switches of a keyboard may be less than the total number of lighted mechanical key switches present in the keyboard. Thus in one exemplary embodiment it is possible that USB power from an information handling system may be sufficient alone to light multiple or all spring loaded mechanical key switch caps of a keyboard e.g. such as QWERTY keyboard without requiring use of an AC DC adapter which would otherwise be required if separate power consuming light switches were required to be present at each key switch. Moreover the total number of power traces on the keyboard PCB the total number of individual power consuming light sources in the keyboard and the number of pins provided on each spring loaded key switch chassis may also be advantageously reduced saving assembly cost and complexity.

In one respect disclosed herein is a keyboard system including one or more spring loaded mechanical key switch assemblies. Each of the key switch assemblies may itself include a key switch housing having a first end and a second end a depressable key component movably received within the key switch chassis housing and having a first end and a second end the first end of the depressable key component being movable between an extended position and a depressed position relative to the first end of the key switch housing with the first end of the depressable key component being closer to the first end of the key switch housing in the depressed position than in the extended position a spring element configured to provide a resilient force to resist downward movement of the depressable key component from the extended position to the depressed position and variable displacement sensing circuitry configured to detect displacement of the depressable key component relative to the key switch housing and to provide one or more variable displacement signals that vary in character based on the amount of displacement of the depressable key component between the extended position and the depressed position. The keyboard system may further include displacement measurement circuitry coupled to receive the variable displacement signals and to determine in real time the relative displacement of the depressable key component between the extended position and the depressed position based on the character of the provided variable displacement signals.

In another respect disclosed herein is a spring loaded mechanical key switch assembly that include a key switch housing having a first end and a second end a depressable key component movably received within the key switch chassis housing and having a first end and a second end the first end of the depressable key component being movable between an extended position and a depressed position relative to the first end of the key switch housing with the first end of the depressable key component being closer to the first end of the key switch housing in the depressed position than in the extended position a spring element configured to provide a resilient force to resist downward movement of the depressable key component from the extended position to the depressed position and variable displacement sensing circuitry configured to detect displacement of the depressable key component relative to the key switch housing and to provide one or more variable displacement signals that vary in character based on the amount of displacement of the depressable key component between the extended position and the depressed position.

In another respect disclosed herein is a method of operating one or more key switch assemblies including providing one or more spring loaded mechanical key switch assemblies. Each of the provided key switch assemblies may include a key switch housing having a first end and a second end a depressable key component movably received within the key switch chassis housing and having a first end and a second end the first end of the depressable key component being movable between an extended position and a depressed position relative to the first end of the key switch housing with the first end of the depressable key component being closer to the first end of the key switch housing in the depressed position than in the extended position a spring element configured to provide a resilient force to resist downward movement of the depressable key component from the extended position to the depressed position and variable displacement sensing circuitry. The method may further include responding to displacement of the depressable key component between the extended position and the depressed position by using the variable displacement sensing circuitry to detect displacement of the depressable key component relative to the key switch housing and to provide one or more variable displacement signals that vary in character based on the amount of displacement of the depressable key component between the extended position and the depressed position.

Still referring to key switch housing of this embodiment includes a displacement sensing key well having a plunger cavity defined therein into which plunger axle is received when key cap is depressed downward by a force as shown in e.g. such as may be provided by a user s finger pressing the key cap . In this exemplary embodiment an internal spring element in the form of a compression coil or helical spring made of metal e.g. such as stainless steel spring steel etc. that is resting on the top of key well e.g. by virtue of the diameter of coil spring being greater than the internal diameter of plunger cavity and the external diameter of plunger axle may be provided as shown wrapped around plunger axle and configured to be compressed against the top of key well when key cap is depressed downward within key switch housing chassis . In this manner compression of internal spring provides a resilient force to resist the downward movement of depressable key component and or to urge depressable key component upward within key switch housing chassis such that there is always tension on the user s finger and to return the depressable key component to its non depressed extended position. It will be understood that a spring loaded mechanical key switch assembly may be provided with any alternative configuration of one or more spring elements of metal or other suitably elastic material that is suitable for providing a resilient force to resist the downward movement of a depressable key component imparting tension to a user s finger during downward travel and or for urging a depressable key component to return to its extended position e.g. such as metal torsion springs metal clock springs etc. Moreover it is also possible that more than one spring element may be present.

Also shown in is optional digital signal circuitry that is coupled to provide an on off digital output signal e.g. to a legacy keyboard controller of an information handling system when depressable key component is depressed downward by a predetermined extent e.g. such as when depressable key component has been depressed downward by about 50 of the total possible downward travel length of depressable key component . Although the spring loaded mechanical key switch assembly of is illustrated having both digital signal circuitry and a displacement sensing key well that includes variable displacement sensing circuitry it will be understood that in other embodiments a spring loaded mechanical key switch assembly may only be provided with a displacement sensing key well that includes variable displacement sensing circuitry and not provided with any digital signal circuitry e.g. mechanical make break key contacts such that the spring loaded mechanical key switch assembly is incapable of providing on off digital output signals .

As further shown in displacement sensing key well includes variable displacement sensing circuitry that is configured to detect and measure downward and or upward key travel and or current position of depressable key switch component and to provide variable displacement signals of varying character to displacement measurement circuitry as shown. In this regard the character e.g. voltage current signal state etc. of variable displacement signals may vary according to the relative displacement of the depressable key component between the extended position and the depressed position of depressable key switch component so as to indicate or to be indicative of the relative displacement of the depressable key component between the extended position and the depressed position. Variable displacement sensing circuitry may be implemented using any type or combination of types of sensor circuitry e.g. one or more positional sensors that is suitable for detecting changes in downward travel distance or depth of depressable key switch component corresponding to downward displacement of a key cap . Example types of electrical sensor circuitry that may be employed include but are not limited to capacitive sensing circuitry resistive sensing circuitry optical sensing circuitry electrical field E field or magnetic field H field change detection circuitry etc. In this regard variable displacement sensing circuitry may be configured to detect and measure downward and or upward key travel of depressable key switch component and provide variable displacement signals throughout the entire downward and upward travel range of depressable key switch component independent of the operation of digital signal circuitry and conduction of on off digital output signal .

However variable displacement sensing circuitry may be alternatively configured to detect and measure downward and or upward key travel of depressable key switch component and provide variable displacement signals only after depressable key component has been depressed downward by a predetermined extent e.g. about 50 of the total possible downward travel length to cause digital signal circuitry to provide an on off digital output signal . In either embodiment a user will be able to feel their finger continuing to travel beyond the 50 initial make digital signal point and the variable displacement sensing circuitry will continue to report various plunger depth levels until 100 downward key travel has been achieved.

In one embodiment where depressable key component has a total downward travel length of about 4 millimeters make break key contacts and may be configured such that the make on or closed condition connection for the switch assembly is made at about the 2 millimeter downward travel position i.e. greater than or equal to about 50 downward travel of depressable key component while the break off or open condition connection for the switch assembly is maintained above the 2 millimeter downward travel position i.e. less than about 50 downward travel of depressable key component . However it will be understood that downward travel lengths that are greater or less than about 4 millimeters may be employed as desired or needed for a given application and or that make break points may be configured to occur at positions of depressable key component that are greater than or less than 50 downward travel. For example a total downward travel length of about 2 millimeters or 1.5 millimeters may be employed in one embodiment for spring loaded mechanical key switch assemblies that are installed in a notebook computer or other relatively thin form factor information handling system. In such a case the make connection for the switch assembly may be made at about the 1 millimeter or 0.75 millimeter downward travel position respectively.

As further shown in displacement sensing key well includes variable displacement sensing circuitry that in this exemplary embodiment employs capacitive sensing technology to determine the travel position of the plunger axle . In particular variable displacement sensing circuitry of this embodiment includes a set of electrical sensors configured as a set of multiple stationary conductive e.g. metal elements in the form of aligned conductive sensor rings to and a movable conductive e.g. metal element e.g. plate ring strip etc. that may be provided as shown disposed on a distal end of plunger axle so that it travels with plunger axle to extend through successive conductive sensor rings to in different positions as depressable key component is depressed downward. In conductive sensor rings are drawn in perspective view for purpose of illustration relative to plunger axle which extends therethrough. Although illustrated as conductive rings in it will be understood that stationary conductive sensor ring may be configured any other suitable geometry bar shaped solid plate shaped solid rectangular or square ring shape diamond ring shape oval ring shape etc. for acting as a stationary capacitive plate to allow measurement of the positioning of movable conductive element relative to each of stationary conductive sensor rings in a manner as described elsewhere herein. The movable conductive element may be made with a flat or non flat surface relative to the conductive sensor rings . In one exemplary embodiment the design and configuration of sensor rings and movable conductive element may be made to ensure that the distance between the stationary and movable elements is constant and with a constant dielectric gap width between the stationary and movable elements in this case air is the dielectric although a dielectric is not limited to this and other dielectric materials may be employed .

In the illustrated embodiment movable conductive element otherwise known as the target functions as a movable capacitive plate which may either be coupled to ground or to any constant voltage e.g. via wire conductor or any other suitable method such as using an electrical conductor within metal plunger axle that itself is electrically coupled to ground or any constant voltage. Each of stationary conductive elements to may function as individual stationary second capacitor plates that are each coupled to a respective analog signal trace as an input to displacement measurement circuitry which in this embodiment is provided in the form of a microcontroller e.g. a Texas Instruments MSP430F55xx family of USB enabled 16 bit ultra low power microcontrollers MCU such as the MSP430F2111 or MSP430F5508 available from Texas Instruments of Dallas Tex. that runs firmware stored on a memory device associated with the microcontroller. In this embodiment a voltage may be applied to the set of stationary conductive sensor rings and changes in the electric field between each sensor ring and the movable target are measured as values or relative levels of induced voltage measured at each sensor ring . The peak voltage of all the sensor rings is sensed by the displacement sensing circuitry and used to determine the travel position of the plunger axle and thus the downward displacement of depressable key component . It will be understood however that any other type of digital and or analog displacement measurement circuitry may be employed that is suitable for measuring or otherwise recognizing or reacting to changes in state of variable displacement signals of any variable displacement sensing mechanical key switch assembly disclosed herein due to downward and upward travel of depressable key switch component along the axis of plunger axle .

In one embodiment displacement measurement circuitry may employ RC capacitive measurement methodology with falling edge event driven interrupt performed on a per pin or signal trace basis. Further information on variable capacitive sensing and or RC capacitive measurement may be found for example in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 316 703 filed Dec. 16 2008 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 802 468 filed Jun. 8 2010 in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 930 125 filed Dec. 29 2010 and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 232 707 filed Sep. 14 2011 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. It will also be understood that any other type of suitable capacitive sensing circuitry may be employed including for example any circuitry that uses RC discharge time to measure sensor capacitance as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3 936 674 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

In one exemplary embodiment displacement measurement circuitry may be configured to monitor induced voltage on each of stationary conductive elements in real time via respective signal traces including at any time during keyboard operation that depressable key component is depressed downward within key switch housing chassis . In this regard measured induced voltage will be greatest for any given one of stationary conductive elements to when movable conductive element is positioned opposite at its closest point to the given stationary conductive element . Moreover the relative induced voltage of stationary conductive elements to may be compared or otherwise analyzed to determine e.g. by interpolation of the measured voltage values a position of movable conductive element when it is located between any given two of stationary conductive elements to as well as when it is positioned above conductive element or below conductive element . For example in a case where measured induced voltage is near baseline voltage non depressed value for conductive elements and while at the same time measured induced voltage is at an elevated and substantially equal value for conductive elements and an interpolation may be made by displacement measurement circuitry to calculate the current position of movable conductive element as being located in between conductive elements and . This indicates that depressable key component is almost entirely pressed downward to its furthest extent.

Thus for example in one exemplary embodiment spring loaded mechanical key switch assembly may be configured such that depressable key component has a total downward travel length of about 4 millimeters within cavity although greater or lesser travel lengths are alternatively possible. In such an embodiment four individual stationary conductive elements may be spaced center to center by about 0.5 millimeters apart and such that the center of movable conductive element is directly opposite or even with the center of stationary conductive element when depressable key component has been displaced downward by about 2 millimeters directly opposite or even with the center of stationary conductive element when depressable key component has been displaced downward by about 2.5 millimeters as shown in directly opposite or even with the center of stationary conductive element when depressable key component has been displaced downward by about 3 millimeters and directly opposite or even with the center of stationary conductive element when depressable key component has been displaced downward by the full 4 millimeters displacement. Although four stationary conductive elements are illustrated in it will be understood that any number of one or more stationary conductive elements may alternatively be employed depending on the displacement measurement resolution that is desired or needed for a given application including greater than or less than four stationary conductive elements . Moreover the center to center spacing between adjacent stationary conductive elements may be selected to define the desired granularity of key travel measurement to be detected for depressable key component .

It will be understood that the embodiment of is exemplary only and that other mechanical and electrical contact configurations of spring loaded mechanical key switch assembly and or sensor configurations of displacement sensing circuitry may be employed in other embodiments. In this regard displacement sensing circuitry may be any other suitable type or combination of types of sensor circuitry that is suitable for detecting changes in downward travel distance of plunger axle corresponding to press depth of a key cap . For example illustrates another exemplary embodiment of a spring loaded mechanical key switch assembly that is also configured to have variable displacement sensing capability using optical sensing circuitry. In this embodiment key switch assembly also includes a depressable key component that is movably received within a complementary dimensioned cavity defined within key switch chassis housing . The depressable key component may include a key cap coupled to a shaft plunger body and plunger axle as shown.

Similar to the embodiment of key switch housing of the embodiment includes a displacement sensing key well having a plunger cavity defined therein into which plunger axle is received when key cap is depressed downward by a force as shown in . An internal coil spring e.g. resting on the top of key well may also be provided as before around plunger axle and configured to be compressed when key cap is depressed downward within key switch housing chassis . In mechanical make break key contacts and of one exemplary embodiment of digital signal circuitry are coupled to respective separate key switch conductors and to provide an on off digital output signal when depressable key component is depressed to cause contacts and to make contact with each other as shown in i.e. in this embodiment by bending contact toward contact . After contact is made the 323 to 325 electrical make connection is continued thru the duration of the 2 mm 4 mm key travel or other travel distance with which the key switch assembly has been configured . In this embodiment plunger body is provided with an extending finger that is positioned and configured to displace contact toward contact as depressable key component moves downward within key switch chassis housing . In this embodiment no optional stepped and ramped surface is provided so that no snap or click action is detectable by the user when depressable key component is depressed downward in the manner as of the embodiment of . Thus it will be understood that variable displacement sensing capability may be provided for a variety of configurations of spring loaded mechanical key switches including different types of make break contacts and or different configurations of depressable key components and key switch housing chassis .

In the embodiment of a displacement sensing key well is employed that includes displacement sensing circuitry that in this exemplary embodiment includes multiple single channel optical sensor pairs configured as four multiple light sources e.g. light emitting diodes LEDs or other suitable light emitting elements to stacked on top of each other on one side of plunger cavity and that are each mechanically and optically aligned with a corresponding one of four respective optical sensors e.g. phototransistors to on the other side of the plunger cavity . Optical sensors may be for example photo microsensors or other suitable optical sensor elements that are stacked on top of each other on an opposing side of plunger cavity as shown with each light source optical sensor pair being positioned at a different key travel depth it being understood that more than four or less than four optical sensor pairs may be alternatively employed depending on the displacement travel measurement resolution that is desired or needed for a given application. Moreover a fewer number of light sources may be provided than optical sensors e.g. one light source configured to illuminate four optical sensors .

One example of a suitable LED phototransistor combination known as a Dual Channel Transmissive optical sensor is available as part number TCUT1300X01 from Vishay and provides one LED paired to two phototransistors. Such a multi channel optical sensor may be employed in one embodiment to achieve space savings over use of multiple single channel sensors. Examples of other suitable optical sensors include phototransistor devices available from Omron Electronic Components LLC. In yet another embodiment a displacement sensing key well may be employed that includes displacement sensing circuitry that includes multiple transmissive type photointerrupters such as ROHM part number RPI 121 available from Rohm Co. Ltd. which are stacked on top of each other 4 total shown . The transmissive type photointerrupter has a LED light source on one side of plunger cavity and is mechanically and optically aligned with a corresponding one of four respective optical sensors e.g. phototransistors on the other side of the plunger cavity . Use of the transmissive type photointerrupter may be selected due to its ability to be minimally influenced from stray light. In yet another exemplary embodiment a displacement sensing key well may be employed that includes displacement sensing circuitry that includes multiple reflective type photo sensors such as ROHM part number RPR 220 available from Rohm Co. Ltd.

As with the embodiment of depressable key component may be configured in one exemplary embodiment to have a total downward travel length capability of about 4 millimeters within cavity and optical sensor pairs may be spaced center to center by about 0.5 millimeters apart although other values of key component travel length and or center to center spacing may be employed in other embodiments. In this regard the center to center spacing between adjacent stacked optical sensor pairs may be selected to define the desired granularity of key travel to be detected for a given depressable key component . In this embodiment the number of displacement levels detected and reported by signals corresponds to the number of optical sensor pairs provided within displacement measurement circuitry .

In operation of circuitry each light source is configured to emit a light beam across plunger cavity to a corresponding one of light sensors . As shown in when depressable key component is in its non depressed fully extended state plunger cavity is open to allow a light beam from each of light sources to be received by its corresponding optical sensor indicating that depressable key component is not depressed. However as shown in as key cap is depressed downward by a force the distal end of plunger axle enters plunger cavity between the successive pairs of aligned light sources and optical sensors in different positions as depressable key component is depressed downward as shown.

In this alternative embodiment displacement measurement circuitry may be configured to monitor in real time analog signal traces corresponding to each of the individual respective optical sensors to to detect when a light beam from a corresponding respective paired light source is being received across cavity and when it has been obscured by presence of plunger axle within cavity . In this way displacement measurement circuitry may continually determine and re determine how far plunger axle and depressable key component has been depressed or displaced downward at any given time based on the which optical sensors are still receiving light from light source s . For example in the light sources for all optical sensors have been blocked by plunger axle except for the lowermost pair of light source optical sensor . This state is indicated by signal traces and may be communicated to displacement measurement circuitry indicating to displacement measurement circuitry that depressable key component has been depressed downward to a distance that corresponds to location of optical sensor since optical sensors and are blocked from receiving light from respective light sources and but not to a distance that corresponds to optical sensor since light sensor still receives light from light source .

Still referring to the embodiment of spring loaded mechanical key switch assembly is shown mounted e.g. by pop in mechanical interference fit within an optional opening or hole defined in a component side of a printed circuit board PCB that includes circuitry such as separate key switch conductors and that are configured for coupling to provide an on off digital output signal e.g. to circuitry such as a legacy keyboard controller of it being understood that a key switch assembly may be mounted to a PCB or other suitable support structure in any suitable manner e.g. including surface mounted to PCB . It will also be understood that the spring loaded mechanical switch assembly of may be similarly mounted to a PCB e.g. for a computer keyboard assembly application. Any suitable type of displacement measurement circuitry may be coupled to receive a signal output of each of phototransistors via leads extending from key switch chassis housing e.g. via signal traces that may be provided on PCB as shown and soldered to leads to provide signals from LED phototransistor pairs e.g. such as to displacement measurement circuitry of . Power for light sources LEDs may be provided by voltage signals found on the PCB e.g. a voltage trace on PCB such as a filtered or switched version of a USB Vcc signal . In the particular embodiment of some of the sensors are found internal to the key switch housing on the component side of the PCB and some are found in the key switch housing but requiring a hole in the PCB to accommodate deeper key travel distance.

In one exemplary embodiment may be implemented using displacement measurement circuitry that is similar as the embodiment of . For example displacement measurement circuitry may be provided in the form of a controller e.g. a 16 bit ultra low power capacitive sensing microcontroller part number MSP430F2111 available from Texas Instruments of Dallas Tex. However in this optical sensor embodiment displacement measurement circuitry may be configured to measure the voltage from each phototransistor output and determine the amount of key displacement.

As shown in light pipe passes through an opening defined in the key switch chassis housing to one side of the mechanical switch components shaft plunger body plunger axle spring and key well from a planar light spreader component e.g. acrylic sheet polycarbonate sheet such as Lexan or other suitable light transmitting material through an opening defined in PCB to a position beneath the key cap . Light pipe may be any suitable light conductive structure that is configured to pipe light from light spreader through PCB and switch chassis housing to the underside of key cap . In one embodiment light spreader may be a substantially light transparent material that may be optionally laser etched to control diffusion of light received from light sources e.g. so as to control light spreading in order to contain emitted light from selected light sources within specified regions of light spreader such as further described in relation to .

As further shown in an optional light reflective film e.g. flexible white colored plastic film may be provided beneath light spreader component as shown for purposes of reflecting and spreading light from light sources more evenly across light spreader . In the space shown between PCB and light spreader and the space shown between light spreader and reflective film may be configured as suitable to allow for operative cooperation between these components and in one exemplary embodiment these may be planar components that are closely butted up against each other with substantially no space between the components with the exception that tolerance of spacing between PCB and light spreader may be configured to accommodate the depth of key well . Any needed or desired spacing between PCB and light spreader may be provided by a separate spacer layer s provided between PCB and light spreader and length and therefore depth of light pipe may be adjusted accordingly to maintain suitable operative relationship with light spreader .

Light pipe of may be constructed of any suitable light transmissive material e.g. such as acrylic polycarbonate etc. and may be configured as an elongated cylindrical shape as shown although other shapes are possible such as elongated square shape elongated oval shape elongated rectangular shape etc. Light pipe may be of any dimension length cross sectional area etc. that is suitable for transmitting sufficient light from light spreader that is positioned below the key assembly to illuminate a desired portion or portions of key cap in un pressed or fully depressed position of the key cap . The upper light emitting end of light pipe underneath key cap may be flush with a top surface of key switch chassis housing or may alternatively be recessed below key switch chassis housing or extend above key switch chassis housing . The upper light emitting end of light pipe underneath key cap may also be optionally textured angled or otherwise configured in a manner that diffuses emitted light or directs the emitted light in one or more desired directions e.g. such as directed toward the center of the key cap and away from the outer edge of the key cap . Moreover it will also be understood that more than one light pipe may be provided to illuminate a key cap of a given single spring loaded mechanical key switch assembly .

Still referring to a lower first end of light pipe may be positioned to butt up against or otherwise contact or lie adjacent to light spreader component in a manner that allows light to be transferred from light spreader to light pipe . A relatively small diffuser area e.g. a laser etched dot may be provided on spreader at each point where a given light pipe contacts or lies adjacent light spreader to facilitate transmission of light from light spreader to the given light pipe . Light spreader may in turn be edge lit from right angle oriented LEDs e.g. RGB LEDs or single color LEDs as shown it being understood that light sources may be alternatively oriented relative to spreader at angles other than 90 degrees and or in any other position relative to edges or sides of light spreader that is suitable for emitting light that is transferred into light spreader . The light transferred from light spreader to light pipe is then transmitted through light pipe so as to shine upwards to the underside of key cap in a manner such that the light illuminates the light transmissive key feature in a manner that is visible by a user.

In the practice of the disclosed systems and methods light pipe may be assembled to other components in any suitable manner. For example in one exemplary embodiment light pipe may be pre assembled as an integral part of a spring loaded mechanical key switch assembly that is then assembled to PCB through aperture at the same time the remainder of spring loaded mechanical key switch assembly e.g. key well and electrical pins and are assembled to PCB . In another exemplary embodiment light pipe may be provided as an integral part of light spreader e.g. glued to or inserted with a friction fit into an complementary dimensioned opening defined in the upper surface of spreader to which the spring loaded mechanical key switch assembly and PCB are then assembled by sliding aperture of the key switch housing chassis over light pipe when assembling key assembly to PCB .

Also shown in are four additional pairs of key assembly openings and light pipe openings defined in PCB for receiving additional spring loaded mechanical key switch assemblies and light pipes . In this regard it will be understood that a keyboard assembly may be configured with any pattern and number of pairs of key assembly openings and light pipe openings as needed or desired to fit a given back lighted keyboard application. For example in one exemplary embodiment pairs of key assembly openings and light pipe openings may be defined in PCB in a pattern suitable for mounting and backlighting spring loaded mechanical key switch assemblies of a QWERTY keyboard although other patterns and numbers of pairs of key assembly openings and light pipe openings may be provided in other embodiments to support other types and sizes of keyboard assemblies.

As an example positions for multiple key assembly openings and corresponding light pipe openings of an overlying PCB are illustrated in dashed outline to show how each backlighting zone and of a light spreader may separately illuminate a different group of spring loaded mechanical key switch assemblies . Specifically illustrates a configuration capable of backlighting 15 mechanical key switch assemblies in each of zones 1 2 and 3 and 21 mechanical key switch assemblies in zone using two light sources in each zone. This translates into a ratio of backlit keys to light sources that is equal to 66 keys 8 light sources or 8.25 backlit keys per light source. Thus using the disclosed systems and methods key caps of multiple spring loaded mechanical key switches may be backlit by one or more common light sources to achieve a ratio of backlit keys to light sources that is greater than 1. This is as opposed to conventional spring loaded mechanical key switches that each employ a separate LED for key lighting i.e. using a ratio of backlit keys to light sources that is equal to 1.

Advantageously the disclosed systems and methods thus may be implemented in one embodiment using fewer light sources powered only by USB bus power without an AC adapter to backlight substantially all the keys of a large keyboard assembly e.g. including keyboard assemblies having 80 or more keys such as a 104 key QWERTY keyboard than would be required by a conventional spring loaded mechanical key switch keyboard assembly of similar size and having one light source per key which would require use of an AC adapter . For example a typical RGB LED light source draws 60 milliamps 20 mA for red 20 mA for green and 20 mA blue . Thus a conventional mechanical key switch keyboard assembly with 104 keys that each has its own RGB LED key light would draw a total 31 watts to power the 104 LEDs alone and would therefore require an AC DC adapter to power the lighted keyboard assembly. In contrast a 104 key mechanical key switch keyboard assembly employing 12 edge mounted RGB LEDs as light sources to illuminate a light spreader and light pipes provided for each key in a manner as disclosed herein would only draw a total of 3.5 watts and could therefore be powered by two USB 2.0 ports from an attached information handling system which have a maximum capacity of 5 watts. This avoids the need for powering the disclosed keyboard assembly from an AC DC adapter.

In an embodiment such as illustrated in light sources may be separately controlled to provide different lighting characteristics e.g. different light intensity different light color different light flashing pattern etc. and or lighting animation graphics at any given time to the light pipes and key caps overlying zone than light sources and display to the light pipes and key caps overlying zones 2 3 and or 4. Each of zoned light sources and may also be separately controlled relative to light sources and to each other. In this way light sources of the different zones and may be individually controlled to display a light pattern that moves across the keyboard area e.g. such as a sequential change of color or flashing pattern in the form of a wave moving from one zone to another across the keyboard to display different colors simultaneously in different zones to display a pattern of flashing light in one zone while all other zones are non flashing etc.

Also illustrated in are optional backlighting circuitry components that include one or more backlight controller s e.g. such as an ST Micro 8051F347 microcontroller available from ST Microelectronics of Geneva Switzerland. In such an embodiment event driven backlighting may be implemented by communicating events from an application programming interface API executing on a host information handling system across communication interface to the backlight controller which responds by communicating lighting commands e.g. via IC bus to light source current driver circuitry component s which each drive one or more light sources e.g. LEDs accordingly to control on off and or color operation of the light sources. In one exemplary embodiment each of light source current driver circuitry component s may be a MAX7313 serial interfaced peripheral available from Maxim Integrated of San Jose Calif. each of which is capable of driving up to five RGB LEDs of a given backlighting zone or of light spreader of e.g. to light individual spring loaded mechanical key switch assemblies or equipped with light pipes previously described.

As depicted in for this embodiment a keyboard controller is coupled to receive an on off digital output signal e.g. via a legacy key matrix from digital signal circuitry of each key switch assembly and that is detected by controller as representing a digital key switch assembly that is either pressed or not pressed. Keyboard controller may be implemented for example as a microcontroller e.g. legacy 8051 based microcontroller or custom microcontroller that runs firmware stored on a memory device associated with the keyboard controller . Control circuitry within the keyboard controller processes these digital key signals and is connected to an output communication path so that this processed digital key information can be communicated to external devices that are external to the keyboard system such as host components of an information handling system e.g. such as desktop computer or notebook computer that includes a host processor such as a CPU e.g. through a universal serial bus USB interface or other suitable interface. In one exemplary embodiment all components of keyboard system may contained within a chassis of a keyboard assembly such as illustrated in although this is optional. In such a case external devices such as host processing devices may be coupled to receive signals from the components of keyboard system that are contained within a chassis .

In addition external devices can optionally communicate control and or other configuration information to the keyboard controller through this same output communication interface . Further information on legacy keyboard controller operation may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 802 468 filed Jun. 8 2010 in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 930 125 filed Dec. 29 2010 and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 232 707 filed Sep. 14 2011 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Examples of possible information handling system components may be found described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 586 676 filed Sep. 25 2009 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 307 222 and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 232 707 filed Sep. 14 2011 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Still referring to displacement sensing circuitry of each key switch assembly provides variable displacement signals to displacement measurement circuitry as shown. For example in the exemplary embodiment of multiple phototransistor outputs may be routed to GPIO input lines of a microcontroller configured to operate as displacement measurement circuitry . Variable displacement signals may be analog signals indicating the amount of downward displacement that has been applied to depressable key components of one or more key switch assemblies as previously described. When a given spring loaded mechanical switch assembly is depressed one or more corresponding analog signal s indicating or indicative of the amount of downward displacement that has been applied to depressable key components of the given key switch assembly may be provided to variable displacement analysis block displacement measurement circuitry as shown. It will be understood that in one embodiment the variable displacement signals may alternatively be multiplexed with each other to reduce the number of separate signal paths required e.g. using a crossbar switch or other suitable signal multiplexing technology. In another exemplary embodiment multiple variable displacement keys may be pressed simultaneously and multiple corresponding analog signal outputs received from each key may be processed by the displacement measurement circuitry for each of the multiple displacement outputs reported one per respective key .

Following is an exemplary description of the operation for a dual make break and displacement sensing operation of a spring loaded mechanical key switch assembly such as illustrated in assuming for sake of illustration only that the spring loaded mechanical key switch assembly is configured to support a total of 4 millimeter of downward travel for depressable key component from fully extended position and has four optical sensor pairs . In this example the operation of spring loaded mechanical key switch assembly proceeds as follows in response to a downward pressure applied by the finger of a user.

First as the user presses the keycap and depressable key component downward by about 2 millimeters i.e. about 50 of full travel distance the electrical make connection is made by virtue of contact between make and break key contacts and and is reported to the keyboard controller e.g. a conventional legacy Keyboard MCU . In parallel and at the same time the first uppermost optical sensor pair detects that depressable key component has traveled downward to its depth and sends a corresponding signal to the displacement measurement circuitry to indicate this has key displacement event occurred. As shown in other sensor pairs are stacked on top of one another e.g. to detect each additional 0.5 mm travel of key press depth from one another. Thus as a user continues to press keycap and depressable key component further downward to about 2.5 millimeters the second optical sensor pair detects this occurrence and sends a corresponding signal to the displacement measurement circuitry to indicate this key displacement event has occurred. Similarly as a user continues to press keycap and depressable key component further downward to about 3 millimeters the third optical sensor pair detects this occurrence and sends a corresponding signal to the displacement measurement circuitry to indicate this key displacement event has occurred. Finally as a user continues to press keycap and depressable key component further downward to about 3.5 millimeters the fourth optical sensor pair detects this occurrence and sends a corresponding signal to the displacement measurement circuitry to indicate this key displacement event has occurred.

Displacement measurement circuitry may be provided in one exemplary embodiment as an integrated part of a keyboard device body e.g. contained within a chassis of the keyboard together with other components of a keyboard assembly such as illustrated in . However one or more components and or processing tasks of displacement measurement circuitry may alternatively be integrated or otherwise implemented within a microcontroller that is operating as the keyboard controller and or as part of the host information handling system to which the keyboard is connected if desired. One or more of the components of displacement measurement circuitry could also be implemented with external circuitry as well. Thus it will be understood that the components and or processing tasks of displacement measurement circuitry may be implemented by any alternative configuration of one or more processing devices e.g. controller microcontroller processor microprocessor ASIC FPGA CPU etc. of an information handling system or a peripheral component thereof and alone or together with other types of information handling system processing tasks.

In the embodiment of displacement measurement circuitry includes a variable displacement analysis block that receives variable displacement signals and memory that include variable displacement profile data e.g. as user configurable control parameters per level or extent of sensed key displacement on a per game or per application basis . In this embodiment the variable displacement profile data may be loaded and or modified in memory from an external device across communication path e.g. from an attached host using an application programming interface API . The variable displacement profile data may be loaded from memory into the Variable Displacement Analysis block VDA . The profile data may be used by VDA block as parameters for making decisions in the VDA block e.g. such as understanding how much key switch displacement is required before triggering a particular scan code and or for specifying behavior resulting from any particular pressed variable displacement sensing spring loaded mechanical key switch assembly . The scan code is output from the VDA via the communication path to the communication interface to an external device e.g. such as to a Host PC system via a USB bus interface .

In one exemplary embodiment a user may assign a multi character sequence or macro to the variable displacement profile data for at least one given variable displacement sensing key switch assembly that corresponds to one or more particular sensed displacement levels for the given key assembly . When it is sensed that the given key assembly is pressed and a given displacement level is sensed a unique scan code corresponding to the sensed displacement level may be output from displacement measurement circuitry and sent via path to an appropriate device driver e.g. USB Human Interface Device HID driver executing on a CPU of a host system. The USB HID device driver may then generate and send a HID keyboard report in the form of a variable displacement keyboard event to a variable displacement macro selector component of a middleware layer executing on the CPU of the host system. The variable displacement macro selector component intercepts this keyboard event information and may in turn provide a modified variable displacement scan code to a user application layer that provides the multi character sequence desired for the sensed displacement level of the given key switch assembly . For example keyboard profile data may be customized on a per game basis and the appropriate profile data loaded into the VDA once the corresponding game is loaded and running on the connected host information handling system.

In one exemplary embodiment this capability may be supported by assigning individual macros to an unassigned scan code that is one of multiple scan codes supported by each variable displacement sensing key switch assembly of a keyboard assembly or other input output device. In this way scan codes may be dynamically selected in real time depending on the amount of pressure translating into measured key displacement that is applied to a given key switch based on the user defined profile data for that given key switch in a manner as described for variable pressure sensing in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 930 125 filed Dec. 29 2010 and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 232 707 filed Sep. 14 2011 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In this regard variable displacement based scan codes may be generated and processed in the same manner as described for VPS scan codes in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 232 707 in which case the same type of USB HID driver may receive the variable displacement based scan codes as receives the VPS pressure based scan codes in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 232 707. Moreover the variable displacement keyboard events may be generated by the USB HID driver in the same manner as VPS keyboard events are generated in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 232 707 and the USB HID driver may provide these variable displacement keyboard events to a variable displacement macro selector of a middleware layer that operates in the same manner as VPS macro selector component of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 232 707 and which in turn may select the modified variable displacement based scan codes e.g. macro information in the form of a multi key sequence from a variable displacement profile based on the identity of the pressed key and the sensed displacement level of the pressed key in the same manner as VPS macro selector component of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 232 707 performs these tasks based on identity of a pressed key and the key s pressure level sensed.

Thus a single spring loaded mechanical switch key assembly may be employed to support performing for example 5 macros acting as 5 virtual keys to support switching between macro outputs in real time based on a variable input such as sensed key displacement and or to support different e.g. user programmable and or selectable correlations of key output behaviors to sensed key displacement. It will be understood that use of scan codes and other variable pressure sensing features described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 930 125 filed Dec. 29 2010 and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 232 707 with regard to pressure sensing digital output circuitry and variable pressure keys may be similarly implemented using displacement measurement circuitry e.g. using sensed key displacement as a proxy for sensed key pressure.

It will be understood that the particular embodiments illustrated herein are exemplary only and that the components and function of displacement measurement circuitry may be implemented using any one or more circuitry components suitable for receiving analog signals representative of key displacement from variable displacement sensing circuitry of key switch assemblies and for selecting and providing in real time scan code s corresponding to the key displacement applied to each of key switch assemblies . In addition external devices may optionally communicate control and or other configuration information to the displacement measurement circuitry and or keyboard controller through communication interface . Although a USB interface is illustrated in it will be understood that communication paths and or may alternatively communicate with other devices in other wired or wireless ways for example via a Bluetooth interface if a wireless interface is desired.

Also illustrated in is optional mode signal that may be provided from variable displacement analysis block of displacement measurement circuitry to keyboard controller to indicate to keyboard controller whether or not to output processed digital key information on output communication path corresponding to on off digital output signals from variable displacement sensing key switch assemblies . For example during a designated variable displacement operation mode one or more of key assemblies may be designated for sole operation as variable displacement keys e.g. such as W A S and D keys . In such a variable displacement only operation mode keyboard controller only outputs displacement based scan codes based on signals from key switch assemblies but does not output digital key information corresponding to on off digital output signals received from key switch assemblies .

However in some cases the attached host information handling systems may enter a standby or a security state e.g. due to a specified elapsed time of inactivity that requires entry of a password using digital on off key signals entered from one or more of the designated variable displacement only key switch assemblies . In other cases a user may desire to use one or more of the designated variable displacement only key switch assemblies as momentary on digital keys to provide digital on off key signals e.g. for data or password entry. Accordingly displacement measurement circuitry may be controlled e.g. by a control signal received from a host processor on occurrence of host standby condition and or by user keyboard entry code to provide mode signal to cause keyboard controller to output processed digital key information corresponding to on off digital output signals received from key switch assemblies for as long as necessary or desired e.g. for a particular operation purpose. In this way mode signal may be used to toggle key operation for variable displacement sensing key switch assemblies between variable displacement only analog output operation and digital output operation.

It will be understood that in further embodiments displacement measurement circuitry may alternatively or additionally be implemented to process analog variable displacement signals received from variable displacement sensing key switch assemblies in the same manner that pressure sensing digital output circuitry processes analog output signals from variable pressure sensing analog keys as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 232 707 filed Sep. 14 2011 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Further keyboard controller may alternatively or additionally be implemented to process on off digital output signals from digital signal circuitry of each key switch assembly and in the same manner that legacy keyboard controller processes digital output signals received via a key matrix from digital keys as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 232 707 filed Sep. 14 2011 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In this way variable displacement sensing capability may be advantageously utilized to implement variable pressure features and operation of displacement measurement circuitry may interact with operation of keyboard controller in the same way that pressure sensing digital output circuitry interacts with the legacy keyboard controller of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 232 707.

Further it will also be understood that legacy keyboard support and or haptics capability may be provided to a keyboard assembly that employs variable displacement sensing spring loaded mechanical key switch assemblies by utilizing features similar to those described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 930 125 filed Dec. 29 2010 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In this regard displacement measurement circuitry may be configured to output to switching circuitry a high and low high low digital output bit stream signal having a frequency that is representative of the degree or percent of downward displacement being currently applied to a depressable key component of one or more of variable pressure sensing mechanical key switch assemblies and the switching circuitry may then provide a toggled key pressure indication signal in the form of alternating open short off on digital signal to a legacy keyboard controller in a manner that emulates toggling of a conventional momentary off on digital key. Additionally or displacement measurement circuitry may be configured to output to provided haptics control circuitry a digital signal e.g. high low digital signal representative of the degree or percent of downward displacement being currently applied to a depressable key component of one or more variable pressure sensing mechanical key switch assemblies which in turn provides a haptics control signal to cause provided haptics actuation circuitry of variable displacement sensing spring loaded mechanical key switch assemblies to produce a variable haptics motion characteristic corresponding to the pressure level applied to the given pressure sensitive key e.g. as a vibration waveform having a particular vibration intensity and or frequency that corresponds to the currently applied real time key pressure level . Examples of such haptics actuation circuitry include a piezo transducer that may be provided within or under a keycap as separate circuitry from the haptics actuation circuitry of any other keycaps of a keyboard assembly as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 930 118 filed Dec. 29 2010 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
