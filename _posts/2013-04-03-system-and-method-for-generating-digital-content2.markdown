This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 620 328 System And Method For Generating Digital Content filed Apr. 4 2012.

The described embodiments relate to methods and systems for generating digital content and in particular to methods and systems for generating modifying updating and publishing digital content.

Online publishers often employ a content management system CMS to manage workflows and publishing of news and entertainment content in a collaborative environment.

A CMS may be used in a live reporting scenario for example where an online publisher may wish to allow authorized individuals to directly report news regarding a current event. In another example an online publisher may wish to encourage audience participation by soliciting real time comments and feedback in response to a live discussion. However while conventional CMS systems might be adaptable to provide such features frequent updating may require significant computing and bandwidth resources. One reason for this is that conventional CMS systems typically publish complete pages which results in considerable redundancy when the complete page is repeatedly transferred to a client that is requesting frequent updates.

Users may wish to use a CMS to create and aggregate content such as web pages papers essays stories articles posts commentary reviews videos and images for example and electronically publish the content for display on other user computing devices. The content may not be static and a user may update and republish the content. Multiple users may work together to create aggregate edit update or moderate content. Multiple users work together to create aggregate edit update or moderate content even when some or all of the users are in remote locations.

Reference is first made to in which there is shown a simplified schematic diagram of an exemplary content publishing system .

Content publishing system comprises a dynamic publishing server which may comprise a database . Content publishing system can be configured to publish digital content e.g. a publication object comprising one or more data collections or data items which can be retrieved by clients and assembled into complete pages.

A data collection can comprise one or more data items. In some cases a data collection may comprise one or more other data collections in addition to other data items. For example a data collection may be a live blog relating to an event that may include other data collections such as blog entries or posts which in turn data items such as images audio text video data feeds and so on. In the context of dynamic content the data items in a data collection may be modified in real time. In particular new data items may be added to the data collection and existing data items in the data collection may be changed or deleted. As will be described herein a new data collection may be created by reusing repurposing and retailoring existing data collections and data items from published content e.g. publications objects including one or more data collections or data items such as other live blogs about events for example.

In general a data collection may comprise any reference to one or more data items or data collections. In some cases the reference may be one or more specific references and individual data items in the data collection may be identified with indices tokens tags or other suitable identifiers.

For example a unique index can provide an address to facilitate look ups for a particular data item. An index may be one or more attributes used to identify the object a hash value or a unique token such as a series of reference characters that can be used to directly or indirectly identify the data item. An index may include different kinds of values depending on the data item such as a token for one data item and a positional value for another data item. The index for a data item may also include multiple values such as both a token and a positional value for one data item. A positional value may be defined as in relation to other data items.

The data collection may also comprise one or more references in the form of a search query comprising one or more keywords where the keywords may serve to identify data items relating to a particular event topic keyword or other grouping mechanism. Each of the data items identified via a search query may still have an identifier e.g. index token tag etc. .

The data collection may also comprise additional properties or metadata defined by an attribute set for the data collection as described herein.

Individual data items may comprise characters and text e.g. captions tags prose etc. images audio video content data feed content computing applications and so on. In some cases data items may also comprise executable instructions e.g. JavaScript . In some cases data items may provide a reference identifier for a specific content file.

For the purposes of exposition the terms content and data collection may be used interchangeably herein.

Dynamic publishing server may provide frequent updates to a publication object without the resource burden that might be incurred by a conventional CMS. A publication object can comprise one or more data collections and their associated data items and may take the form of HTML content including formatting and scripts. In some cases a publication object may form the entire contents of a web page.

Publication objects may be contrasted with publication targets. Publication targets can be a specific web page a web site directory an embeddable object such as a Flash object or the like.

In general a publication target is the location that a publication object is or will be published. Accordingly if the publication object is a complete web page the publication target may be a web site directory. Conversely if the publication object is a block of HTML content the publication target may be a portion of a specific web page where the block of HTML content is to be inserted or embedded.

Dynamic publishing server may be connected to one or more networks and . In some cases networks or may form parts of a single larger network such as the Internet or may be selectively interconnected with each other. One or more of networks or may be a wired or wireless local area network a wide area network a virtual private network a mobile data network or other suitable network for facilitating data communication.

One or more input devices communicate directly or indirectly with dynamic publishing server via network . Input devices which may also be referred to as client devices or writer devices may be communication or computing devices such as desktop or laptop computers mobile devices telephones and the like. In some cases input devices may be additional content publishing systems which can be federated. Input device also referred to as client device may be any networked computing device including a processor and memory such as a personal computer workstation server portable computer mobile device personal digital assistant laptop smart phone WAP phone an interactive television a smart television video display terminals gaming consoles an electronic reading device and portable electronic devices or a combination of these.

In some cases dynamic publishing server may have a local input device which can be an alternative input interface. For example dynamic publishing server may have a telephony including VOIP or voicemail system for recording voice messages or may integrate with such a system. Accordingly voice messages may be used as input or transcribed and used as input. Subsequently the voice messages may be published in audio form or transcribed and published in written form. Such features may be beneficial in situations where access to the dynamic publishing server by data communication means is impractical or otherwise restricted e.g. due to Internet faults or censorship .

In some cases an input device may be configured to extend services to one or more additional input devices. For example an input device may aggregate input data from one or more additional input devices that are on a local network and transmit the aggregated data to dynamic publishing server .

Similarly one or more publishing partners may be connected to dynamic publishing server via network . Publishing partners may be content publishing servers or services such as public or private web sites content management systems and the like. Examples of publishing partners include news and entertainment publishing organizations news aggregators photo sharing websites social networks and other content providers. In general any party that creates or manages a publication object or which provides a data collection or data item may be considered a publishing partner . Accordingly freelance journalists photographers and the like may also be publishing partners . In some cases input devices may also be considered publishing partners .

In some cases publishing partners may include telephony including voice over IP services. Accordingly published content may be in or converted to audio form. Likewise input content may be received in or converted to audio form.

It will be appreciated that dynamic publishing server may also comprise one or more primary servers and one or more caching servers to reduce processing load on the primary servers. For example dynamic publishing server may comprise a server dedicated to one or more publishing partners .

Optionally dynamic publishing server may be connected to storage system via network . Storage system can be configured to store or distribute content over the Internet or the World Wide Web in particular in a scalable manner. In particular storage system can be a cloud based web storage and retrieval system such as Amazon Simple Storage Service S3 .

Storage system can be a caching server a distributed storage system a storage service a content distribution network or content delivery network CDN reverse proxy or the like.

Dynamic publishing server or optionally storage system can be connected to a CDN . CDN can be a specialized distribution network adapted to synchronize and distribute content to a plurality of geographically distributed edge nodes to facilitate scalable high availability and low latency delivery to a large number of end users.

CDN may comprise a core network for interconnection with a plurality of edge nodes . The internal structure of CDN may be structured in a tiered or other fashion as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.

A plurality of clients can connect to CDN . In general CDN is configured to identify the edge node that is nearest or which can provide the best quality of service to a particular client .

By utilizing CDN and storage system dynamic publishing server can be insulated from the effects of high demand for services from end user clients. Likewise dynamic publishing server can be designed to provide scalability high availability and low latency delivery independently of the number of end user clients. In particular the bandwidth requirement for dynamic publishing server can be dependent simply on the amount of content being published. Likewise by using CDN and or storage system dynamic publisher server can serve a large number of clients without the corresponding requirement to open a large number of sockets service a large number of requests per second and the like. In contrast storage system and CDN can distribute content to a large number of end user clients and can be scaled to respond to large fluctuations in demand.

When a data collection is updated with new or changed data items or a data item is deleted dynamic publishing server may transmit a modification representation corresponding to the data collection once to storage system or CDN whereupon storage system or CDN can distribute to a large number of users according to their respective designs. Publication of content is described in further detail herein for example with reference to .

For ease of reference the functionality of dynamic publishing server storage system and CDN are described herein as being provided by separate servers. However the functionality of one or both of storage system and CDN may be integrated into dynamic publishing server or omitted entirely. Likewise storage system may be configured to provide some or all of the functionality of CDN and vice versa. For example storage system may employ the Amazon S3 service to provide scalability high availability and low latency delivery.

Content publishing system may be adapted to publish content in real time. In particular content publishing system may publish publication objects containing data collections comprising one or more data items. The data collections may comprises data items that are associated chronologically by topic or otherwise. For example the data collections may relate to a live content stream a live question answer session a live interview updates on a current event and the like. Alternatively the content published in real time may take the form of a rapidly changing news article or other non chronological data format e.g. an article with real time updates . Content publishing system may be further adapted to create new data collections using data collection and data items from other publication objects and publish the new data collection as a new or updated publication object. Accordingly content publishing system enables existing data collections and data items to be reused retailored repurposed and modified in order to create new data collections.

In some cases content publishing system may also be adapted to publish other content such as advertisements pre written content or other static content.

Referring now to there is shown a block diagram of modules comprised in an exemplary dynamic publishing server. Dynamic publishing server which may be the same or similar to dynamic publishing server can comprise a database a permission module a content input module a template module a content management module and a publication module .

Database may comprise one or more relational databases e.g. SQL or in some cases a flat file database e.g. NoSQL . Database may be used to store data used by dynamic publishing server including accounts and permission data for users writers and administrators template data data referring to publication objects data collections data items and other data.

Permission module may be used to store and manage system permissions relating to providing content to dynamic publishing server such as permissions associated with a user computer e.g. permissions associated with users commenters and administrators . Permission module may also be used to store and manage system permissions associated with data collections and publication objects such as for example publication times for a publication object. In general permission module may operate in similar fashion as the permissions system of other content management systems CMS in which writers administrators commenters and end users are provided with varying degrees of access according to security considerations and content accessibility needs.

Content input module may be used to manage the reception of input data for processing and generation of data items by dynamic publishing server . Operation of content input module is described in further detail herein for example with reference to .

Template module may be used to manage the retrieval and processing of publication templates by dynamic publishing server . Operation of template module is described in further detail herein for example with reference to .

Content management module may be used to process data items for publication such as those data items generated by content input module . Operation of content management module is described in further detail herein for example with reference to .

Publication module may be used to create and configure a publication object for the publication of one or more data items associated with a data collection. For example publication module may be used to identify a data collection and the associated one or more data items and create and configure a publication target for publishing the one or more data items. As noted a publication target can be a specific web page a web site directory an embeddable object such as a Flash object or the like.

In one example a publication target can be a web page that will contain a publication object created for a live event. Ongoing updates may be provided by one or more writers in the form of input data which can be used to generate modified including new or updated data items and which may be associated with one or more data collections in turn associated with the publication object created for the live event . Accordingly publication module may be configured to process and publish the data items in a suitable manner via the publication targets.

Referring now to there is shown a process flow diagram for creating an exemplary publication object which may be performed by publication module . Each publication object can have one or more associated data collections.

Creation process begins by creating a new data collection at . For example the data collection may be created by generating a new data collection entry in a database such as database . However in some cases a data collection need not be created in the database. For example the data collection may comprise one or more rules for identifying associated content such as social network posts containing one or more query terms posts from the same geographic area e.g. based on geographically identifying data associated with the post and posts in the same language.

One or more publication targets can be configured at . As described a publication target may be a web page a web site an embeddable object such as a Flash object or the like. Each publication target can be preconfigured by an administrator and may be displayed to a user for example as a descriptive name a domain a subdomain a URL or some portion of a URL e.g. shortened path name or file name . Each publication target may have one or more user selectable template objects associated therewith.

Template objects may be received from template servers which may be websites belonging to third parties associated with particular publication targets and processed to generate a template for publishing a publication object and its data collections and associated data items . For example if a publication target is live.example.com another website at www.example.com may be the template server. Accordingly a template may be retrieved from for example www.example.com template.html and data items published at the publication target of live.example.com may be formatted based on the retrieved template.

Each publication object may have one or more publication targets. Accordingly each publication object may be published to one or more locations and if the publication targets have different templates the publication object may be formatted differently depending on the publication target.

A publication object may be prepared in advance in anticipation of publication at a later time for example by identifying a known data collection e.g. a search query . In some cases the data collection may be associated with a live event in which case it may be used to aggregate in real time content relating to a specific topic e.g. submitted by users viewing one or more web pages . Examples of such live events include for example reporting news on a current event a live question answer session with a person of interest and the like. Optionally at the publication type of the publication object may be selected. The publication type may be set to live dynamic search or some other value as may be appropriate.

The publication time for the publication object may also be configured. The publication time may be immediate deferred until a predetermined future time e.g. if the data collection is in a draft or prepublication state or it may indicate that the publication object should not be published at all e.g. if its data collection relates to system messages private metadata or the like .

If the publication type indicates that the object relates for example to a live event and a determination is made that the object relates to a live event at a start and end time of the publication may be chosen. The start time indicates when the scheduled event will begin and the live event is considered open . Conversely the end time indicates when the scheduled event will end and the event is considered closed . The open or closed state of the event may be used to control other features such as commenting or to alter the appearance of the published data items. For example when an event is open published data items may appear in reverse chronological order such that newly added data items appear above older data items. Correspondingly when an event is closed data items may appear in chronological order for ease of reading.

Alternatively the start and end time of the publication object may be used to determine if the data collection relates to a live event. For example if the current time is between the start time and the end time the publication object may be considered live and the data items associated with the data collection may be published accordingly.

Alternatively or in addition to the publication object may be manually configured by an administrative user to specify that the object is open or closed at . In such cases start and end times may be optional and not configured. In some cases the publication object may be configured to automatically become closed for example after a predetermined period has passed without any activity.

If the publication type is not a live event the process may proceed directly to configuration of user commenting at . If user commenting is enabled for a publication object end users viewing the data collection e.g. at a publication target may be enabled to submit comments regarding the data collection. In some cases commenters may also submit content via external sources such as e mail Twitter Facebook and the like. However some templates may prevent user commenting in certain cases even if user commenting is enabled.

User comments may be input data that is submitted by third party end users and which may be used to create additional user generated data items associated with the data collection. In some cases user generated data items originating from the user comments may simply be aggregated with other data items originating from writer devices e.g. input devices and other authorized users e.g. those that are already registered with the dynamic publishing system . The user generated data items may be distinguished from writer generated data items using a distinct visual or audible presentation such as a different color scheme or the like.

In some cases a live query may be configured to generate user comments based on external content such as e mail Twitter and the like.

In some other cases user generated data items may be held for approval by a writer or administrator. The writer or administrator may approve certain of the user generated data items which may then be published.

In some cases writer generated data items may be processed in the same manner as user generated data items and vice versa.

In cases where user generated data items can be held for approval there may be a delay between the submission of the held user comment and the approval and actual publication of the data item. In a chat or question answer type live event such delay may result in confusing and disorderly presentation of the data items to the end user.

In some cases to maintain continuity and orderly presentation user generated data items may be placed in a comment collection and associated with other data items for publication substantially contemporaneously e.g. in a desired order . In some cases the comment collection may be modeled as a queue. Accordingly continuity and ease of reading can be facilitated. However in other cases the comment collection need not be ordered by date or time.

At other options associated with the publication object can be configured. Additional options include a description a header image a game id a language setting HTML code event location time zone profanity and objectionable language filtering spam filtering live language translation user or Internet Protocol IP address filtering writer and or commenter e mail addresses e.g. for submitting data items directly via e mail and Short Message Service SMS short codes or phone numbers e.g. for submitting data items directly via phone .

In some cases the data collection may comprise one or more external queries. External queries can be search terms or external sources from which data items can be obtained. Data items may be obtainable in some cases only when the data collection is open . However in other cases data items may also be pulled when the data collection is closed . An external query may specify a search term for use on an external social network such as Twitter or Facebook . For example content published on the external website twitter.com containing the desired hashtag and published while the data collection is open can be retrieved and used as a data item. The external data items may be treated as distinct from writer generated data items and or user generated data items.

Similarly external queries can be links to a specific external source. For example an external query may identify a specific user or group on a photo sharing website. Accordingly content uploaded to the photo sharing website while the data collection is open can be retrieved and used as a data item.

As described dynamic publishing server may provide a list of template objects and publication targets which may be associated with one or more external sites or subdomains. A user configuring a publication object may elect to associate its data collection with one or more publication targets.

In one example a publication target may be live.example.com which can be hosted by storage system . The site live.example.com may be affiliated with www.example.com which may have a standard content presentation style. Accordingly www.example.com may be used as a template server. In some cases one or more template pages may be prearranged as is described herein.

Alternatively a subdirectory www.example.com live may be provided for hosting publication objects generated by dynamic publishing server . For example the contents of the live directory may be hosted by storage system or CDN and dynamic publishing server may be configured to transmit the required content e.g. data items associated with a data collection in the publication object to storage system or CDN .

Accordingly when a search engine indexes content belonging to example.com the content including any publication objects provided at live.example.com will appear as though it is published by the publisher of www.example.com since both live.example.com and www.example.com belong to the same domain example.com. This may have advantages for content indexing and search engine optimization purposes. When the publication object is published dynamic publishing server may publish several versions corresponding to each of the selected publication targets. Accordingly the publication object may appear to be published in several locations perhaps by several parties.

Optionally at invitations to contribute input data to be used in the data collection created at may be generated and transmitted. For example a list of e mail addresses may be collected and an e mail invitation containing login information a registration link or the like may be sent to the provided e mail addresses. Recipients of the e mail invitations can use the provided login information or registration link to access a user interface for submitting input data.

In some cases predetermined users e.g. identified by e mail address phone number or other identifiers may be preconfigured with access to contribute input data to create data items for the data collection created at .

Referring now to there is shown an exemplary user interface for submitting input data. User interface may be provided for example in an HTML document rendered and provided by a web browser on a client computer.

A content input box may be provided for enabling a user to enter content as part of the input data to be submitted. A submission button can be used to transmit the input data contained in content input box whereupon the input data can be processed to generate a data item corresponding to the input data. In some cases the data item may be published immediately and the web browser may be configured to retrieve and display the newly published data item along with previously published data items as described further herein for example with reference to .

Previously published data items may also be editable upon selecting an appropriate edit control . Further controls not shown in may also be provided to otherwise manipulate previously published data items e.g. delete sticky reply etc. . In some cases data items may be directly editable without first selecting an edit control.

If other users are also editing data items and submitting input data in respective user interfaces each of their previously published data items may also be updated in real time to reflect new data items submitted by other users as described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 449 540 filed Mar. 4 2011 the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In general the display of individual data items may correspond with the view of a data collection that is provided to certain users or administrators depending on their permission level.

Data collection updating and synchronization is described in further detail herein for example with reference to .

Input data and data items may contain multimedia content. Accordingly controls can be provided to enable access to additional editing and multimedia sharing features. For example controls may enable formatting entered text e.g. to alter type face or uploading multimedia files including images audio and video to include as part of the data item. A URL control not shown may be provided for submitting URLs to incorporate in the data item. In some cases URLs entered in content input box may be interpreted and the content at the URL or a representation or variation which may include interactive or streaming elements such as video may be retrieved linked or referenced for inclusion in the data item.

Various alternative or complementary content input interfaces and features may be employed such as a dedicated native client software program an application programming interface API and the like.

In some cases a webcam or audio recording control not shown may be provided to facilitate the capture of live video or audio for inclusion in the data item.

If commenting is enabled comment moderation controls may also be displayed to users with appropriate permissions. Accordingly comments may be displayed with associated controls to approve or disapprove each comment.

If a comment collection or queue is enabled a collection deck may also be displayed. For example comments that have been placed on hold tagged as spam or even approved may be placed in collection deck for later posting by selecting the associated post control .

In some cases collection deck may be used to display the results of an external query or live search. A live search may be an automatic continuous query or dynamic query of an internal or external source. For example a live search may be a continuous search of sources identified in external queries. Photos or other content may be continuously or periodically retrieved from the external queries and presented in approval deck for selection and approval. A search box not shown may also be provided to augment the external queries with additional searches.

A live search may repeatedly conduct the same query e.g. pull model or it may comprise an open connection for receiving results e.g. push model .

In some cases a second collection deck may be provided in parallel with collection deck to display the results of the live search.

Various additional known multimedia content editing and content management features may also be provided as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.

Likewise it will be appreciated that a plurality of users may have access to a user interface for managing and editing the same data items. Different users may have differing degrees of access to manage and edit the data items. For example some users may be limited to providing input data for new data items and may be prevented from later editing or deleting data items. Other users may only be enabled to moderate comments. Still other users may have full permission to provide input data for new data items edit existing data items and moderate comments.

Referring now to there is shown an exemplary content input process flow which may be carried out by content input module . Content input process flow begins by receiving input data. The input data may be entered using an interface such as interface and associated with a data collection at . The input data may be original input data authored by a known user using a writer or client device input data retrieved from an external query or a comment received from an end user a server etc. The writer device may be a mobile communication device a desktop or laptop computer or other suitable computing device. The input data can be associated with a particular data collection e.g. according to the URL ID etc. used to submit the input data. In particular the submission URL may contain a unique identifier associated with the data collection. Alternatively content input module may associate the input data with the data collection if the input data was retrieved by dynamic publishing server using an external query.

The input data may be processed at by content input module to generate a data item for storage in database . For example content input module may sanitize text recompress images generate icon or thumbnail representations of links or images and the like.

Content input module may also generate or update a content index for identifying the data item. The content index may be an incrementally numbered index value a character string a timestamp or any other suitable index value as described herein. In some cases the content index may be managed as described in as described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 449 540 filed Mar. 4 2011 the entire content of which is incorporated by reference herein.

Once the content index has been generated or updated the data item and content index are stored in database in association with the data collection.

Referring now to there is shown an exemplary update process flow which may be carried out by content management module . Update process flow may be performed asynchronously from the generation of data items and publishing of the data items. In particular process flow may be performed periodically at predetermined intervals for example by dynamic publishing server . In some cases process flow may be performed substantially continuously.

This update process flow may occur for example when content publishing system updates a modifiable data collections using data collection and data items from other publication objects and publishes the modified data collection as a new or updated publication object. As described herein content publishing system enables existing data collections and data items from publication objects to be copied and added to other data collections in order to be reuse retailor repurpose and modify existing data collections and data items. In some embodiments the copied data collection and the original data collection may be treated as separate data collections. The update process described in is an example only and other techniques may be used for updates to the modifiable data collection. For example describes a technique based on polling a database but others ways to provide updates may be used such as a technique based on pushing data from a database. For example another technique may involve holding a socket open which connects a client device to a server in turn connected to a database and the server may send modifications as they occur through the socket. As a further example a browser on a client device may send a request to a server where the request stays open until the action i.e. modification occurs. These are examples only and other polling or pushing techniques may be used.

Content management module may maintain a record of the current state of each data item associated with one or more data collections. Accordingly process flow may be performed independently for each data collection managed by dynamic publishing server . There may be more than one content management module operating on each dynamic publishing server each associated with one or more data collections.

At content management module may query a content database such as database to determine if data items associated with a particular data collection have been modified since the last query was performed. The query may be implemented as a polling technique. Alternatively when a modification occurs then the content management module may be notified based on a pushing technique. Modifications may comprise the addition deletion or change e.g. editing of a data item. If there are no modifications to the data items content management module may take no other action and wait a predetermined period before another query is generated.

If modifications to the one or more data items have occurred content management module identifies the modified data items at and generates or regenerates a modification representation associated with the data collection at . In some cases the modification representation may be a delta or diff identifying changes relative to a previous version. In other cases the modification representation may comprise the entirety or a substantial portion of the added deleted or changed data items. In general the modification representation is a data structure suitable for instructing a device with a previous version of the data collection to update its local version of the data items to a current state or representation. The modification representation may include an index associated with the modified data. The index enables client devices to efficiently locate previous versions of the data that need to be updated.

In some embodiments the modification representation may be provided as a data item comprising executable instructions e.g. JavaScript to update one or more other data items in the relevant data collection.

In some other embodiments the modification representation may be provided as a replacement data collection.

Any additions changes or deletions in the data collection may be marked up or highlighted as desired.

Content management module may also generate an update indication which can be used to notify client devices that modifications have occurred. The update indication may be a unique identifier such as a timestamp. In some cases the update indication may comprise the modification representation itself. As noted an update may involve an addition deletion change resize reformat reorder and so on.

At content management module generates one or more files corresponding to the update indication and or the modification representation. The files can be published to a publication server such as storage system or CDN . In particular the files associated with a particular data collection can be published at the one or more publication targets that are associated with the data collection and its corresponding publication object.

The modification representation files may be formatted for example according to the JavaScript Object Notation JSON data interchange format although other suitable formats e.g. XML may also be used.

To generate a complete copy of a data collection at a client device the data items can be retrieved and assembled in a desired order. In some cases the publication object may also comprise one or more code objects for assembling and encapsulating the data collection. For example a code object may be an HTML web page comprising JavaScript code for retrieving the one or more data items associated with a data collection and periodically retrieving modification representations to update the data collection. The code object may be generated using a template object and thus be formatted in a style corresponding to the template object. In one example the code object may comprise HTML and JavaScript configured to employ JSONP JSON with padding when retrieving data item and modification representation files although other suitable approaches may also be used.

In some cases files associated with a publication object can be stored on a storage system and a proxy server may be used in combination with AJAX techniques to deliver content to end users. The proxy server may be in some cases a server associated with the external publisher. Accordingly it may be necessary to account for some cross domain limitations associated with JavaScript or Flash.

Separation of functionality between content input module and content management module can serve to de link the input process from the publishing or transmitting process thus allowing for scalable delivery and facilitating backup and failover methods.

For example content input module can store newly added data items or modification representation files in two or more redundant databases with a first primary database and one or more secondary failover databases. In the event that a database fails dynamic publishing server can substantially immediately switch to a failover database without loss of database consistency or interruption of service. Once the failed database is restored it can be synchronized with an in service database and brought back into service.

Similarly by transmitting files to storage system or CDN which can have multiple redundancy built in content management module can ensure that no interruptions in service occur in the event of a hardware or network failure.

In many cases it may be desirable for a content provider to generate and manage content such as a data collection comprising data items and also to have the data collection be available for publication and dissemination via multiple publication targets.

In some cases the provider of the data collection may wish to add change delete or otherwise modify the data items that form the data collection even after the data collection has been published. For example if the data collection relates to a live event e.g. an ongoing news story there may be a need to update the data collection with new data items or modify existing data items on an ongoing basis.

Individually updating a large number of publication targets would in many cases be unwieldy and inconvenient. However by using data collections a content provider can continue to add change or delete data items without the need to individually update multiple publication objects.

As one example there may be a live blog dedicated to a particular news topic. A live blog can be a publication object e.g. a web page that automatically provides updated content in real time as new entries are generated or posted. The updates may be done seamlessly from the client perspective such that the user may not be required to manually refresh the web page to see the updated content. The live blog may publish a publication object associated with a data collection where the data collection comprises data items generated by the live blog writer or provider.

A live blog may be contrasted with an article with real time updates described herein with reference to .

In some cases the live blog provider may wish to augment the data collection with additional data collections or data items. For example the data collection may comprise live updates regarding an unfolding news story.

Referring now to there is shown an exemplary template generation process flow which may be carried out by template module . The template generation process flow may be carried out with each page request at predetermined intervals manually upon request by an administrator or omitted entirely.

At a page request for a code object associated with a publication object is received. For example the page request may be passed back by CDN in response to an end user client request. In some cases the request may originate directly from an end user or from a local server or process.

At template module retrieves one or more template objects associated with the requested publication object from database . Generating the page with the available template object ensures that the requested code object can be delivered without any delays imposed by the template retrieval and re generation process.

Once the page has been generated template module may determine if a newer template object should be retrieved or generated at . For example template module may examine a timestamp or expiry time associated with the retrieved template object.

If it is determined that a newer template object should be retrieved template module may optionally spawn a template retrieval thread at . The decision to spawn a new thread may depend on whether an existing template request is pending which can be determined at . Alternatively template module can continue the original thread.

If a template retrieval thread has been spawned at template module can request a new template object e.g. page from a template server such as a third party website. The template page provided by the template server may be a preconfigured dummy page hosted by the third party website which may contain headers footers layout information and other ancillary content. In some cases the provided template page may contain a placeholder or content marker indicating where a publication object e.g. comprising data items in a data collection can be inserted. In some cases the provided template page may not contain any primary content. The content marker may be a predetermined text marker e.g. INSERT CONTENT HERE a token or a preconfigured HTML tag ID or class. In still other cases the provided template page may contain existing content that can be discarded.

At the template page may be received and template module may determine if a content marker is present in the template page at . If a content marker is present the template page may be used to update the current template object to use the new template object and stored in database at . In some cases template module may discard the received template page for example if an error has occurred.

In some cases such as when a preconfigured template page is not provided by the template source a template object may need to be manually generated or edited by an administrator. In such cases template module may reschedule template retrieval for a later time. Optionally template module may generate and transmit a message to an administrator that manual intervention is required either to identify a content marker or to otherwise prepare the template object.

Template generation process may also be performed periodically at predetermined intervals or on demand based on some other event such as a manual template update request.

Referring now to there is shown an exemplary display process flow which may be carried out by a client device to display a publication object and its associated data collection. The client device may be a mobile communication device a desktop or laptop computer or other suitable computing device. In particular display process may be performed by a client program such as a web browser or other program code such as a mobile device application.

At the client program requests the publication object from a publication server such as dynamic publishing server storage system or CDN . A response to the initial request may return simply a code object associated with the publication object at .

As noted the code object may be an HTML document which can contain or reference program code for assembling one or more data items associated with the data collection of the publication object.

When the client program first requests the publication object a selection of data items associated with its data collection may be sent. The selection of the data items that is sent may be considered an initial representation of the data items. For example the initial representation may simply comprise the current form of all data items associated with the data collection. In some cases the initial representation may comprise all data items dated within a recent interval period e.g. all data items received or generated in the past 30 minutes . Likewise the initial representation may be paginated with only more recent data items appearing directly in the initial representation whereas older data items may be linked or may be revealed progressively as a user scrolls through a list of data items.

At the client may request an indication of when the most recent update or modification to the data collection occurred. The indication may be a unique identifier which can be sequentially numbered so that the client device can determine when an update has occurred. For example the indication may comprise a timestamp identifying the time of the last update.

At the client requests the initial representation of the data collection. Generally the initial representation will contain up to date data items. Accordingly the initial indication may be used simply as a reference so that later updates can be identified.

Once data items associated with the data collection begin to be received the client may at render the data items in the presentation or output display in the appropriate order.

If the data collection is a live event or is being updated the code object may indicate that the client should periodically poll for an update indication. Accordingly at the client may be instructed to wait a predetermined interval. Upon expiry of the interval the client may request the update indication again at .

The client may determine if an update indication exists at . If an update indication exists the client may return to to request a modification representation. If there is no update indication e.g. because the data collection has not been updated the client may return to to wait the predetermined interval before attempting to request an update indication again.

In some cases certain steps of display process may be omitted. For example if a request is made through an API display step may be omitted.

Thus to generate the presentation display containing the data collection and its respective data items the client retrieves a code object an indication and one or more corresponding data item files. The client also periodically polls for an update indication. If an update indication exists the client can retrieve a modification representation to generate at the client a current representation of the data collection.

In some cases each modification representation may represent all additions deletions and changes since the last update indication was generated. However in other cases each modification representation may represent only those additions deletions and changes that have occurred within a recent predetermined time interval. Accordingly the current representation of the data collection that is maintained at a client device may not fully reflect the actual data collection maintained by dynamic publishing server . This may be an acceptable trade off in some cases such as a fast changing live event.

Providing a large number of data items in an output display may be unwieldy and inefficient. Accordingly in some cases it may be desirable to limit the number of data items that are displayed at once. For example the data collection may be paginated or subdivided into groups or pages of a predetermined size. Each of the groups or pages may have a URL associated with it which when selected can result in the retrieval of the relevant group of data items.

Pagination may be displayed in a different manner depending on the state or type of publication object. For example links to the groups of data items may be displayed in reverse chronological order when the publication object is live and displayed in forward chronological order when the publication object is not live.

In general the number of data items in a group can be kept within a predetermined limit of data items. However in some cases a hard limit may not be desirable. For example if a most recent group of data items exceeds the predetermined limit it may not be desirable to perform pagination immediately as this may result in a group with very few data items which would provide little context for an end user. Accordingly pagination may be delayed in some cases until the number of data items displayed in the current representation exceeds the predetermined limit of data items by a predetermined threshold e.g. 20 .

Use of the client in this manner relieves dynamic publishing server storage system and CDN of the additional burden of regenerating a complete page for each new data item that is added deleted or changed in the data collection. Each added deleted or changed data item requires only a small amount of resources to provide as it requires only small static files to be used e.g. the update indication and the modification representation which can be cached and made available at a common location e.g. URL so that all watchers can poll the common location periodically. Likewise a push notification is not necessary as the client is instructed to periodically determine if there is new content to be retrieved.

There may be a relatively small increase in bandwidth relative to a push based system due to client requests for new content index files. However this relatively small burden can be easily handled by CDN or storage system and provides the benefit of significantly reducing resource requirements for dynamic publishing server and even storage system where CDN is used .

For the purposes of illustration a number of exemplary uses of the described embodiments will now be provided.

In some cases it may be desirable for the publisher of an online publication such as a live blog to be able to provide content in real time while maintaining the ability to scale to a large number of clients. The live blog may provide a collection of real time live blog entries which may be in the form of text images audio or video. Accordingly each entry may be a data item in a data collection created for the live blog.

In order to scalably publish and update the live blog the live blog entries e.g. data items may be entered into a database and associated with a data collection of the live blog.

The database may be periodically polled by a content management module to identify at least one modification of the live blog entries including additions changes or deletions of the entries in the live blog.

If a modification of one or more live blog entries is identified the content management module can generate and store a modification representation of the changes. The modification representation may be information that can be used to reproduce changes to the live blog entries based on a previous version. In addition to the modification representation the content management module may also generate an indication of the changes which may be a file with a timestamp signifying the last known update to the live blog.

Each of the live blog entries the modification representations and the indications can be published on a storage system such as Amazon S3. A CDN may be also be used to distribute the content stored on the storage system.

Accordingly a client can receive content directly from the CDN or in some cases from the storage system without directly communicating with the live blog publishing server although this may be permitted in some cases.

From the client perspective the client may receive an initial representation of the live blog comprising each of the live blog entries to date. If there are a large number of live blog entries the client may receive only a number of most recent entries with the remainder being paginated . In particular pagination may allow older entries to be retrieved when a user clicks a link or scrolls beyond a predetermined point alleviating the need for the client to retrieve all entries in the live blog initially.

The client can display the initial representation comprising the live blog entries. The client may also be configured based on code embedded in the live blog to periodically request an update indication such as the indication generated by the publishing server. If the update indication is available and indicates that the live blog has changed such that the client s version is no longer up to date the client may request the modification representation currently available. Based on the modification representation the client may update its own initial representation or subsequent representations created with previous modification representations . Accordingly the representation of the live blog at the client can be updated in real time. It will be appreciated that the client need not interact directly with the publishing server. The publishing server can publish files to a storage system and or CDN. Conversely the client need only interact with the CDN and or storage system. In some cases the client may be able to communicate directly with the publishing server.

In some cases a content provider may wish to provide a consistent presentation style or to adopt the presentation style of a third party. For this purpose templates may be used. It may be desirable for the templates to be periodically updated to ensure that content generated by publishing server is provided in a current presentation style.

For example a live blog for a news organization may be presented using a template associated with the main website of the news organization. The news organization may periodically even frequently update the presentation of the main website. Accordingly the live blog template may need to be updated periodically to reflect these changes.

When publishing the live blog a template module may determine if a current template exists. If the current template exists the live blog may be published using the current template. In some cases an expiry time of the current template may be checked and if it is determined that the current template should be updated a template update process can be initiated. In some other cases there may be an offline process to perform the template update process.

If the template update process is initiated it may comprise retrieving a predetermined page from the main website of the news organization. The predetermined page may be a dummy page with a content placeholder or an empty area of the page reserved for the live blog content. In some cases the dummy page may be a regular content page. Accordingly in some cases it may be necessary for an administrator to manually edit the dummy page to generate the updated template.

Publication object may be a web page comprising a data collection and other content . Other content may be a navigation menu advertisements static content or any other suitable content.

As shown publication object comprises a data collection . Data collection comprises data items and . Data item comprises text content and image content . Similarly data item comprises image content and data item comprises video content . Although not shown data collection could also comprise data items for example with audio content or computer executable instructions. The computer executable instructions may not be visible when the publication object is displayed by a client.

As described herein in the context of dynamic content the data items and in data collection may be modified in real time. In particular new data items may be added and the existing data items in the data collection may be changed or deleted.

In one example data collection may be a block of HTML content for example enclosed in a DIV tag. Data items and may be identified with indices tokens tags or other suitable identifiers as described herein.

Optionally there may be one or more additional data collections . In some cases the additional data collections may be displayed separately. In some other cases the additional data collections may be integrated with data collection .

Referring now to there is shown an exemplary live blog publication object comprising data collection .

Data item comprises a text item written by a writer. Data item comprises an audio comment which may be automatically generated for example based on data received from a VOIP interface. Data item comprises a video . Data item comprises an image posted by the writer of the live blog. Data item may comprise a user comment posted to the live blog using a comment entry form not shown . The user comment may appear in the live blog stream immediately upon submission. Alternatively the user comment may be held for moderation as described herein.

In the exemplary embodiment each of data items to may be separate live blog posts. For example each of the data items may have a date or timestamp associated therewith. However in some cases some or all of the data items to may appear to be part of the same live blog post.

The live blog publication object may contain data collections and data objects that may be copied and added to create or update other data collections. Similarly the live blog publication may contain a data collection that was created or updated using copied data collections or data items from other publication objects. This enables data collection and data items to be reused modified repurposed retailored in different data collections.

Referring now to there is shown an exemplary publication object comprising an article portion and a live blog portion. The article portion may be an article with real time updates as described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 449 540 filed Mar. 4 2011 the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

Publication object comprises a first data collection and a second data collection . In some embodiments the first data collection may comprise the second data collection or vice versa. The data collections may contain data collections and data objects that may be copied and added to create or update other data collections. Similarly the data collections may have been created or updated using copied data collections or data items from other publication objects.

First data collection comprises data items including text blocks and an inserted text block and a user comment interface . First data collection also comprises an image data collection .

Text blocks and may be for example HTML content comprising text content and appropriate mark up tags.

Image data collection may be a data collection that comprises an image data item and a caption data item.

Each data item in first data collection may be modified added or deleted in real time as described herein. In particular inserted text block may be a data item that is added to the first data collection in real time.

Each data collection and data item may be associated with a set of attributes. An attribute defines a property of the data collection or data item and a given instance of such property. That is the set of attributes define metadata for the data collection or data item. An attribute may include a name and a value pair. For example a name may be creator and the value may identify the creator name for that specific data item. An attribute may also define a data type or class for the data collection or data item. The set of attributes may include different types of attributes for each data collection or data item or the set of attributes may be a standard set of attributes for all data collections and data items. The set of attributes may be modified to include additional attributes and delete attributes. The values of attributes may also be modified. The set of attributes may be defined by a data structure of name value pairs. Examples of attributes include creator name last modified date time permissions source identifier s destination identifier s creation date time copyright owner organization responsible color style encoding rate location publication location identifiers index link dimensions font data type and so on.

Referring now to which may collectively be referred to as there is shown a diagram of a process for modifying and publishing a data collection as a publication object in accordance with embodiments described herein. The process may be performed by content publishing system and in particular publication module of the publishing server connected to the CDN having access to a database maintained by the content management module . Each publication object can have one or more associated data collections. For example the publication object may have an article portion with real time updates a live blog portion and so on. The associated data collections may include articles with real time updates articles live blogs live blog entries data feeds content from social networking systems and so on. Each data collection is associated with data items such as images video text and so on. The data collection may also be associated other data collections. Each data collection and data item may also be associated with a set of attributes defining metadata for the data collection or data item.

At content publishing system identifies a modifiable data collection which is a data collection capable of being modified edited or updated. In some examples the identified modifiable data collection will be a new data collection and at a new data collection may be created and stored in the database. The new data collection may be created using various mechanisms. For example the data collection may be created by generating a new data collection entry in a database such as database . However in some cases a data collection need not be created in the database. For example the data collection may comprise one or more rules for identifying associated content such as social network posts containing one or more query terms posts from the same geographic area e.g. based on geographically identifying data associated with the post and posts in the same language.

Content publishing system may create a new data collection that is empty and contains no content. Content publishing system may also create a new data collection that already contains content such as one or more other data collections and data items. Content publishing system is operable to efficiently add data collections and data items to the new data collection from other publication objects. The added data collections and data items may be newly created such as when a user submits new text new images and new videos. The added data collections and data items may also be reused or repurposed from other publication objects as will be explained herein. Reusing and repurposing data collections and data items may be efficient as a user does not have to have to start from scratch by recreating all content in order to modify data collection. A user may efficiently update a modifiable data collection by reusing content data collections or data items from other publication objects such as video text images and so on. When a modifiable data collection is modified by adding data collections or data items from other publications objects the set of attributes associated with the reused data collections and data items may also be added to the modified data collection or reference thereto may be added. The modified data collection may also have its own set of attributes associated therewith. In this manner content publishing system efficiently obtains potentially valuable metadata about the reused data collection or data item in the modified data collection for subsequent reference. For example a reused data item may be an image and an attribute may identify an owner of the image which may be subsequently recalled and referenced using the modified data collection. Otherwise content publishing system may have to locate the publication object that the reused data item was obtained from in order to access the attribute set and if content publishing system cannot locate the publication object then it may not be able to locate and access the attribute set. As a further example an attribute may be permissions indicating whether the data item may be reused i.e. reproduced and conditions for reuse. For example the data item may only be reused if the owner is identified in a caption. Accordingly for the modified data collection content publishing system requires access to the set of attributes included therein to comply with the permissions conditions. As a further example an attribute may define a style treatment for text such as a quote which may indicate that the text be indented and that an author for the quote be included along with the text and the value i.e. the author s name to include as the author.

In accordance with some embodiments when a data collection or data item is reused and added to the modifiable data collection then a copy of the data collection or data item is made and added to the modifiable data collection. The copy of the data collection or data item may be independent of the original or linked thereto. In making the copy content publishing system is operable to modify the data collection and data item such that it differs from the original. In addition content publishing system is further operable to make a copy of the associated attribute set and add the copy to the modifiable data collection. The copy of the attribute set may be independent of the original or linked thereto. In some embodiments the original data item may include a reference to a location that the attribute set is stored in memory and a copy of the reference may be added to the copy of the data item to be added to the modifiable data collection.

In accordance with some example embodiments when a copy of the associated attribute set is made then the copy of the attribute set may be modified such as by changing values for one or more attributes. For example an attribute may include an index identifying the associated data collection or data item such as a token tag positional value and so on. The index in the copy of the attribute set may change to a new a value that identifies the copy of the associated data collection as opposed to the original data collection that the original attribute set referred to. The changed index value may still relate to or link to the original index value such as for example by adding an affix header footer and so on such that the two index values overlap to some degree. In other example embodiments the copy of the associated attribute set is not modified.

In some example embodiments content publishing system is operable to maintain a tracking log of all sources of a given data collection or data item. For example a source may be a publication object publishing a given data collection or data item. As another example a source may be a data collection including a given data collection or data item. As noted herein each publication object data collection and data item may be identified by an index. Content publishing system may detect each time a data collection or data item is published using a publication object or included within another data collection. Content publishing system may update the tracking log to refer to the publication object or enclosing data collection such as by adding an index identifying the publication object or enclosing data collection.

In some example embodiments content publishing system is operable to maintain a tracking log using the set of attributes for a data collection or data item. This enables content publishing system to efficiently determine each location a given data item is published in or contained enclosed in. This may be desirable to efficiently make updates to data items to implement user permissions to monitor usage of the data item to track copies for copyright purposes and so on. A set of attributes may include one or more source identifiers which reference publication objects or enclosing data collections for the associated data item or data collection. A source identifier value may be an index of a publication object or enclosing data collection. There may be a source identifier value for each publication object publishing and data collection enclosing the data item or data collection associated with the source identifier attribute. Alternatively the source identifier value may also refer to the original publication object that originally published the data collection or data item and the tracking log may be implemented using a tracking attribute and so on.

In accordance with some embodiments a data collection that includes a given data item or data collection may include a reference to a location in the database where the attribute set associated with the given data item is stored. When content publishing system copies the given data item and adds it to a modifiable data collection then content publishing system is operable to include a copy of the reference to the set of attributes in the modifiable data collection. Accordingly in some embodiments the same attribute set may be referenced by the original data collection and all copies thereof. Content publishing system is further operable to update the set of attributes associated with the copied data item. When a copy of a data collection or data item is made and added to a modifiable data collection then the attribute set associated with the copied data item may be updated to refer to the modifiable data collection. For example the attribute set may include a source identifier or a tracking attribute referring to each enclosing data collection. The attribute may be updated to include a value referring to the modifiable data collection such as for example the index identifying the modifiable data collection. The attribute may also include a value referring to the publication object publishing the modifiable data collection such as for example the index identifying the publication object publishing the modifiable data collection.

In accordance with some embodiments when a data collection or data item is reused and added to the modifiable data collection then a reference is added to the modifiable data collection where the reference identifies a location of the reused data collection or data item in a database. In such embodiments a copy of the data collection or data item does not have to be made and added to the modifiable data collection and the reference may contain code to instruct a publication object how to retrieve and publish the data item. This may provide an efficient use of memory and storage capabilities if the data item to be added is large in size such as a large video file for example. Further this may provide an efficient update mechanism because the original publication object and the modifiable data collection will both refer to the same data item so when an update is made thereto it will automatically be reflected in the original publication object and the modifiable data collection. A reference to a location in the database of the associated attribute set may also be added to the modifiable data collection.

Referring now to there is shown an exemplary interface for modifying and publishing a new data collection . The content publishing system may be configured to provide the interface for display on user computers.

The modifiable data collection may include data items such as a text data item image data item video data item and may also include data collection with text and an image. Other example data items and data collections include articles blog posts data feeds audio content from social media systems and so on. The modifiable data collection may also be empty with no contents containing no data collections and data items or may contain a different combination of data collections and data items. The modifiable data collection may be edited and updated using interface .

The interface may include a drop down box which when activated displays a listing of modifiable data collections. Each modifiable data collection in the listing not shown is selectable and the selected modifiable data collection will be the one identified at . As shown data collection is selected and identified as the modifiable data collection. The set of modifiable data collections may be associated with a specific user may be all available modifiable data collections most recently accessed modifiable data collections and so on. A graphical representation of the contents of the selected and identified data collection is displayed below in the interface as the modifiable data collection .

The interface is illustrated in in an editing mode to modify change or update the modifiable data collection . The interface includes editing tools such as font size color styles alignment and so on. The interface further includes a publish button to trigger the creation of a new publication object or an update to an existing publication object in order to publish the modifiable data collection and updates or edits made thereto to one or more publication targets. The interface also includes a save button to trigger storing the updates made to the modifiable data collection in the database.

In this example the modifiable data collection forms part of a larger data collection along with at least one other data collection . For example the larger data collection may be a live blog for an event and the modifiable data collection may be a live article or blog entry relating to the event. The other data collection may also relate to the event or may be associated with the modifiable data collection in another way.

In this example interface only one modifiable data collection is shown but in other embodiments there may be multiple modifiable data collection displayed in interface . For example there may be multiple columns or other graphical representations one for each of the modifiable data collections. Accordingly a user may edit multiple modifiable data collections simultaneously. For example a listing of modifiable data collections may be displayed by activating the dropdown button and one or more of them may be simultaneously selected for display and editing. Each selected modifiable data collection may displayed simultaneously in the interface . For example interface may generate a column frame or pop up window for each selected modifiable data collection. A user may also change which modifiable data collection is being edited and displayed in interface by selecting another modifiable data collection to edit using a drop down button to activate a listing of modifiable data collection and upon selection the interface may update to display the newly selected modifiable data collection. The drop down button configuration is an example only and other configurations may be used to display modifiable data collections that may be selected for editing.

Referring back to at content publishing system provides using the CDN a listing of publication objects. Each publication object is associated with one or more publication targets. Each publication object is associated with one or more data collection s . Each data collection may include one or more data items and may also include other data collections. Referring back to interface may include a drop down button which when activated displays a listing of publications objects such as for example publication object publication object publication object publication object . Each publication object in the listing of publications objects is selectable using interface . The listing of publications objects may include all publication objects maintained by content publishing system or a subset thereof. For example the listing of publications objects may include only those publication objects that are open or live . As another example the listing of publications objects may only include those publication objects accessible e.g. based on permissions to a user currently using interface to update the modifiable data collection . As a further example the listing of publications objects may be configured by a user currently using interface to create the new data collection i.e. the modifiable data collection such as most frequently used publications object or most recently used publication objects. The listing of publication objects may also be generated in response to a search query. A drop down list is an example of a listing of publication objects and other configurations may be used such as icons a dialog box text box search results and so on. Content publishing system is further operable to check permissions e.g. permissions attributes rules relating to permissions associated with the publication objects prior to including them in the listing . For example only certain publication objects may be permitted to be accessed by a user. The listing may be tailored to a particular user to include only those publication objects permitted to be accessed by the user.

Referring back to at content publishing system receives a selected publication object from the listing of publication objects . The selection may be received when a publication object identified in the listing of publication objects is activated in interface via a mouse click for example. As shown in content publishing system may position the selected publication object in the top spot of the listing of publication objects next to the drop down button which is publication object in this example. Once a publication object from the listing of publication objects is selected then the listing of publications objects may hide until the drop down button is activated. Alternatively the listing of publication objects may remain displayed within interface . The publication object is selected in order to reuse data collections and data items associated therewith in the modifiable data collection . The publication object is selected so that a user may review data collections and data items associated therewith in order to select and add one or more to the modifiable data collection . Accordingly data collections and data items associated with the selected publication object may be reused repurposed modified and so on for the new data collection. As noted herein the set of attributes associated with the data items and data collections may also be accessed by the modifiable data collection .

In accordance with some embodiments multiple publication objects may be selected from the listing simultaneously and each selected publication object may be displayed in interface simultaneously. For example interface may generate a column frame pop up window and so on for each selected publication object. Accordingly although only one column is shown in interface for a modifiable data collection and although only one column is shown in interface for a selected publication object there may be multiple columns or frames pop up windows and so on one for each selected modifiable data collection and publication object. This may enable a user to select data items and data collections from multiple selected publication objects to be reused and repurposed in one or more selected modifiable data collections displayed in interface .

At content publishing system displays data collections or data items associated with the selected publication object. As shown in interface displays a set of data collections and data items associated with the selected publication object. The set may include all data collections and data items used in the selected publication object or the set may only be a subset of the data collections and data items used in the selected publication object. For example the subset may include the most recently added data collections and data items the most frequently accessed data collections and data items a configured set of data collections and data items related to a particular topic or keyword and so on. The set may include text data items image data items video data items text image data collection audio formatting data embedded computing applications data feeds and so on. Interface may provide a scroll or navigation mechanism in order to navigate through the set . Data collections and data items associated with the selected publication are displayed within interface so that a user can review them and select one or more to include in the modifiable data collection . Each data collection and data item may be selectable by the user for addition to the new data collection. Content publishing system is further operable to check permissions e.g. permissions attributes rules relating to permissions associated with the data items and data objects of the selected publication object prior to displaying them in the interface for selection and reuse. For example only certain data items and data collections may be permitted to be reused. The permissions may be based on specific users or may apply to all users. The restrictions for reuse may be defined by permissions e.g. permissions attributes rules relating to permissions .

The selected publication object may be continuously updated in real time by one user or multiple users. If a new data collection or data object is added to the selected publication object then interface is operable to update the display of the data collections or data items associated with the selected publication object to display the new updates so that they may be selected and added to the modifiable data collection . For example the selected publication object may be a live blog for an event such as an election and include audio video images and text relating the election. The modifiable data collection may relate to a particular candidate in the election or region of the election. One or more users of content publishing system may be updating the live blog for the election with new audio video images and text in real time and interface is operable to update the set to include these updates for selection and addition to the modifiable data collection . Similarly the modifiable data collection may be continuously updated in real time by one user or multiple users.

At content publishing system receives a selected data collection or data item from the displayed data collections and data items. For example interface may enable selection of a data collection or data item via a mouse click. As another example interface may be used with a touchscreen display and interface may enable selection of a data collection or data item via a touch.

At content publishing system adds the selected data collection or data item to the modifiable data collection . For example interface may enable addition of the selected data collection by dragging the selected data collection or data item to a position within the modifiable data collection . Other data collections and data items in the modifiable data collection may change position to accommodate the newly added data collection or data item. As shown in as an example image may be selected and added to the modifiable data collection as a copy of the image such that the original image remains in the selected publication object. Alternatively a reference to the image may be added to the modifiable data collection . As noted above a copy of the set of attributes associated with the image may also be added to the modifiable data collection or a reference thereto.

Accordingly data collections and data items from the selected publication object may be efficiently reused repurposed modified and so on in the modifiable data collection while still providing access to the corresponding set of attributes and the metadata maintained thereby. For example the selected publication object may relate to an event such as a professional basketball game and may include text photos video audio and the like relating to the professional basketball game. The new data collection may be a live blog about a particular player that participated in the professional basketball game. Accordingly text photos audio and video relating to the player may be part of the selected publication object for the event and may be added to the new data collection about the particular player. The set of attributes such as permissions author owner and so on may also be added to the modifiable data collection .

In order to add the selected data item or data collection to the new data collection content publishing system is operable to copy the selected data item or data collection and add the copy of the selected data item or data collection to the new data collection. In some instances the original selected data item or data collection and the copy of the selected data item or data collection may be linked together so that modifications made to one may be reflected in the other. In other embodiments modifications made to one will not be reflected in the other. The copy of the selected data item or data collection may be treated as a separate or independent data item or data collection from the original data item or data collection. The copy of the selected data item and data collection may be associated with a new index and may be tracked independently for updates and modifications. The copy of the selected data item may also be identified using a new index in the set of attributes associated therewith.

The newly added data collection or data item may be positioned anywhere within the new data collection by selecting the newly added data collection or data item and dragging it to a position within the display of the new data collection. The newly added data collection or data item may also be re positioned within the new data collection. When the newly added data collection or data item is positioned within a data collection which includes images text and so on then those existing images text may be re positioned around the newly added data collection or data item. For example text in the new data collection may wrap around the newly added data collection or data item.

Content publishing system enables edits manipulations and modifications to the newly added data collection or data item. As shown in interface may include editing tools for editing manipulating and modifying the newly added data collection or data item. For example the newly added data collection or data item may be resized aligned rotated cropped reformatted and so on. A caption may be added to the newly added data collection or data item. If the newly added data collection or data item is text then it may be modified and formatted. The newly added data collection or data item may also be deleted from the new data collection.

In accordance with some embodiments when a modification is made to the newly added data collection or data item then a corresponding modification is made to the original data collection or data item the copy was made from. In other embodiments when a modification is made to the newly added data collection or data item then the original data collection or data item the copy was made from remains unchanged or unaffected. Further in accordance with some embodiments when a modification is made to the original data collection or data item that the newly added data collection or data item is copied from then a corresponding modification is made to the newly added data collection or data item. In accordance with other embodiments when a modification is made to the original data collection or data item that the newly added data collection or data item is copied from then the newly added data collection or data item remains unchanged or unaffected. For example the original data collection may be a slideshow of images and as the original slideshow is updated to include new images the copy of the slideshow in the modifiable data collection may also be automatically updated. In other cases the copy may not be updated when the original is updated. As another example the original data collection may be generated based on a data feed from a social media platform and as the data feed updates the original data collection then the copy may also be automatically updated.

Content publishing system may enable the creation of a slide show in the modifiable data collection including newly added data collections and data items. The slide show may be a representation of text video images and other data items and data collections. The representation may be graphical voice over and so on.

Content publishing system is operable to detect that a selected data collection or data item is moved to a position on top of another data collection or data item in the modifiable data collection . In response content publishing system is operable to generate a slideshow comprising the selected data collection or data item and the other data collection or data item. Further content publishing system is operable to add the slideshow to the modifiable data collection for publication. This may be repeated as additional data items or data collections are moved to the position on top of the slideshow and content publishing system is operable to add those data items to the slideshow.

For example the new data collection may include an image and another image may be added thereto from the selected publication object. If a new image is selected and dragged on top of the existing image then content publishing system may automatically create a slideshow of the two images. More images text video and so on may be added to the slideshow by selecting and dragging the data items to a position on top of the slideshow. The interface is operable to update to provide an indication that a data item or data collection is at a position on top of the slide show. Again additional media such as video audio text and so on may also be used in the slideshow.

Content publishing system may also enable new images audio text and video to be created and added to the new data collection. For example a user may enter new text to be added to the new data collection.

After the selected data collection or data item is added to the new data collection content publishing system is operable to return to and continue to display the set so that additional data collections or data items from the selected publication object may be added to the new data collection. Content publishing system is further operable to return to and provide the listing of publication objects for selection so that additional data collections or data items from other publication objects may also be added to the new data collection. For example each time the drop down button is activated then content publishing system is operable to display a listing of publication objects so that a user can browse data collections and data items from multiple publication objects before deciding which to reuse in the new data collection. Content publishing system is further operable to return to and provide the listing of modifiable data collections for selection so that additional modifiable data collections may be modified updated or changed using interface .

In accordance with some embodiments each data collection and data item is associated with a set of attributes which includes a permissions attribute indicating whether the respective data collection or data item is permitted to be added to another data collection. Content publishing system may be further operable to at prior to adding the selected data collection or data item to the modifiable data collection check the permission attribute of the selected data collection or data item to determine whether the selected data collection or data item is permitted to be added to the modifiable data collection. The permissions attribute may depend on particular modifiable data collections or may be a default permissions attribute application to all data collections. For example the permissions attribute of the selected data item may indicate that if an owner attribute of the modifiable data collection is of a particular value then the selected data item may be added to the modifiable data collection. As another example the permissions attribute of the selected data item may indicate that the selected data item may not be added to any other data collections. Upon determining that the selected data collection or data item is permitted to be added to the modifiable data collection then content publishing system is operable to add the selected data collection or data item to the modifiable data collection. Upon determining that the selected data collection or data item is not permitted to be added to the modifiable data collection then the content publishing system is operable to display an error message.

In accordance with some embodiments at content publishing system is operable to modify the selected data collection or data item for the modifiable data collection. For example the selected data collection or data item may be reformatted for the modifiable data collection. As a further example a caption indicating the original source may be added to the selected data item before it is added to the modifiable data collection .

In accordance with some embodiments content publishing system is operable to provide a rules engine of rules defining whether for each data item and data collection the data item or data collection is permitted to be added to the modifiable data collection. At prior to adding the selected data collection or data item to the modifiable data collection content publishing system is operable to use the rules engine to determine whether the selected data collection or data item is permitted to be added to the modifiable data collection. The rules may also define whether the selected data item should be modified and how it should be modified.

As described herein content publishing system may track each data collection and data item. Each data collection and data item may be associated with one or more source identifiers or tracking attribute for tracking publication of the respective data collection or data item. Each source identifier or tracking attribute refers to a publication object publishing the respective data collection or data item or data collection enclosing the respective data item. At upon adding the selected data item to the modifiable data collection content publishing system is operable to update the attribute of the selected data collection or data item with a source identifier referring to the modifiable data collection or publication object publishing the modifiable data collection. In other example embodiments content publishing system is operable to maintain a tracking log for each data item and at content publishing system is operable to update the tracking log to identify the modifiable data collection .

As noted herein at content publishing system is operable to add a reference to the modifiable data collection wherein the references identifies a location of the selected data collection or data item in the database instead of a copy of the selected data collection or data item.

Referring to the process proceeds to and content publishing system determines whether a new publication object should be created for publishing the modifiable data collection or whether an existing publication object should be updated based on updates made to the modifiable data collection . As shown in interface includes a publish button which may be activated in order to publish the modifiable data collection as a publication object at one or more publication targets. The new data collection may have been previously published and a publication object for the data collection may already exist. Interface may be used to update an already published modifiable data collection by adding selected data collections and data items thereto. Alternatively the modifiable data collection may not have been previously published and accordingly a publication object for the modifiable data collection may not exist. The interface may also include a save button which saves the modifiable data collection for example for later publication for later modification pre publication and so on.

If it is determined at that the new data collection has not been previously published as a publication object or that a new publication object should be created for another reason then at content publishing system creates a new publication object based on the modifiable data collection and stores the new publication object in the memory.

If it is determined at that the modifiable data collection has been previously published as a publication object or that an existing publication object is associated with the modifiable data collection for another reason then at content publishing system updates the existing publication object based on the modifiable data collection . This existing publication object is used to publish the modifiable data collection at one or more publication targets. This publication object may be different from the selected publication object.

Content publishing system is operable to publish the modifiable data collection as the publication object for display on each of multiple client devices. The publication object may be formatting differently for each or some of the client devices. As described herein content publishing system is operable to efficiently update the publication objects displayed on the multiple client devices to reflect changes modifications and updates made to the modifiable data collection . Content publishing system is operable to receive at least one modification of the modifiable data collection such as at when the selected data collection is added to the modifiable data collection . Content publishing system is operable to store the at least one modification of the modifiable data collection in the database. Content management module is operable to independently asynchronously and periodically identify modifications in the database. For example content management module is operable to poll the database or receive a push notification in order to identify the at least one modification of the modifiable data collection. If the polling or push notification identifies at least one modification of the modifiable data collection content management module is operable to generate a modification representation identifying the modification of the modifiable data collection. The modification representation may be a data structure suitable for instructing each of the client devices to update the publication object with the modification to the modifiable data collection . Content management module transmits the modification representation to a server system and which in turn distributes the modification representation to the client devices. The modification representation updates the previously published publication object independently for each of the plurality of client devices.

In accordance with some embodiments content management module periodically receives a request from a client device for an indication that a modification to one or more data items has occurred. After identifying the at least one modification content management module is operable to generating an indication comprising a unique identifier indicating when the at least one modification occurred and in response to the request and after generating the indication content management module is operable to transmit the indication to the client device to notify the client device that the at least one modification has occurred.

At content publishing system may configure one or more publication targets which are associated with the new or updated publication object. As described a publication target may be a web page a web site an embeddable object such as an iFrame or Flash object or the like. Each publication target can be preconfigured by an administrator and may be displayed to a user for example as a descriptive name a domain a subdomain a URL or some portion of a URL e.g. shortened path name or file name . Each publication target may have one or more user selectable template objects associated therewith.

As an example interface may display a listing of live event blogs to select as publication targets where the publication object may become a post entry or article for the live event blog. The publication object may be associated with multiple publication targets. Interface may also include a text field to receive a publication target.

If a publication object already existed and was updated then it may already be associated with one or more publication targets. However at optionally additional publication targets may be associated with the publication object.

The publication target s may be different than the publication targets associated with the selected publication object or may include some of the same.

Template objects may be received from template servers which may be websites belonging to third parties associated with particular publication targets and processed to generate a template for publishing the publication object and the new data collection . A template may be retrieved from a template server for example and the new data collection published at the publication target may be formatted based on the retrieved template.

The new or updated publication object may have one or more publication targets. Accordingly the new or updated publication object may be published to one or more locations and if the publication targets have different templates the publication object may be formatted differently depending on the publication target.

The new or updated publication object may be prepared in advance in anticipation of publication at a later time. In some cases the newly created data collection may be associated with a live event in which case it may be used to aggregate in real time content relating to a specific topic in the modifiable data collection including the newly added data collection s or data item s selected from other publication object s . Examples of such live events include for example reporting news on a current event a live question answer session with a person of interest and so on.

Optionally at content publishing system receives a selection of publication type for the publication object. The publication type may be set to live dynamic search or some other value as may be appropriate.

The publication time for the publication object may also be configured. The publication time may be immediate deferred until a predetermined future time e.g. if the data collection is in a draft or prepublication state and saved for later publication or it may indicate that the publication object should not be published at all e.g. if its data collection relates to system messages private metadata or the like .

At optionally content publishing system determines whether the publication object relates to a live event and a start and end time of the publication may be chosen. The start time indicates when the scheduled event will begin and the live event is considered open . Conversely the end time indicates when the scheduled event will end and the event is considered closed . The open or closed state of the event may be used to control other features such as commenting or to alter the appearance of the published data items. For example when an event is open published data items may appear in reverse chronological order such that newly added data items appear above older data items. Correspondingly when an event is closed data items may appear in chronological order for ease of reading.

Alternatively the start and end time of the publication object may be used to determine if the data collection relates to a live event. For example if the current time is between the start time and the end time the publication object may be considered live and the data items associated with the data collection may be published accordingly.

Alternatively or in addition to the publication object may be manually configured by an administrative user to specify that the object is open or closed . In such cases start and end times may be optional and not configured. In some cases the publication object may be configured to automatically become closed for example after a predetermined period has passed without any activity.

If the publication type is not a live event the process may proceed directly to configuration of user commenting at . If user commenting is enabled for the publication object end users viewing the modifiable data collection e.g. at a publication target may be enabled to submit comments regarding the modifiable data collection . In some cases commenters may also submit content via external sources such as e mail Twitter Facebook and the like. However some templates may prevent user commenting in certain cases even if user commenting is enabled.

User comments may be input data that is submitted by third party end users and which may be used to create additional user generated data items associated with the data collection. In some cases user generated data items originating from the user comments may simply be aggregated with other data items originating from writer devices e.g. input devices and other authorized users e.g. those that are already registered with the dynamic publishing system . The user generated data items may be distinguished from writer generated data items using a distinct visual or audible presentation such as a different color scheme or the like.

In some cases a live query may be configured to generate user comments based on external content such as e mail Twitter and the like.

In some other cases user generated data items may be held for approval by a writer or administrator. The writer or administrator may approve certain of the user generated data items which may then be published.

In some cases writer generated data items may be processed in the same manner as user generated data items and vice versa.

In cases where user generated data items can be held for approval there may be a delay between the submission of the held user comment and the approval and actual publication of the data item. In a chat or question answer type live event such delay may result in confusing and disorderly presentation of the data items to the end user.

In some cases to maintain continuity and orderly presentation user generated data items may be placed in a comment collection and associated with other data items for publication substantially contemporaneously e.g. in a desired order . In some cases the comment collection may be modeled as a queue. Accordingly continuity and ease of reading can be facilitated. However in other cases the comment collection need not be ordered by date or time.

At content publishing system may configure other options associated with the new publication object. Additional options include a description a header image a game id a language setting HTML code event location time zone profanity and objectionable language filtering spam filtering live language translation user or Internet Protocol IP address filtering writer and or commenter e mail addresses e.g. for submitting data items directly via e mail and Short Message Service SMS short codes or phone numbers e.g. for submitting data items directly via phone .

In some cases the modifiable data collection may comprise one or more external queries. External queries can be search terms or external sources from which data items can be obtained. Data items may be obtainable in some cases only when the data collection is open . However in other cases data items may also be pulled when the data collection is closed . An external query may specify a search term for use on an external social network such as Twitter or Facebook . For example content published on the external website twitter.com containing the desired hashtag and published while the data collection is open can be retrieved and used as a data item. The external data items may be treated as distinct from writer generated data items and or user generated data items.

Similarly external queries can be links to a specific external source. For example an external query may identify a specific user or group on a photo sharing website. Accordingly content uploaded to the photo sharing website while the data collection is open can be retrieved and used as a data item.

As described dynamic publishing server may provide a list of template objects and publication targets which may be associated with one or more external sites or subdomains. A user configuring the new publication object may elect to associate its data collection with one or more publication targets.

In one example a publication target may be live.example.com which can be hosted by storage system . The site live.example.com may be affiliated with www.example.com which may have a standard content presentation style. Accordingly www.example.com may be used as a template server. In some cases one or more template pages may be prearranged as is described herein.

Alternatively a subdirectory www.example.com live may be provided for hosting publication objects generated by dynamic publishing server . For example the contents of the live directory may be hosted by storage system or CDN and dynamic publishing server may be configured to transmit the required content e.g. data items associated with a data collection in the publication object to storage system or CDN .

Accordingly when a search engine indexes content belonging to example.com the content including any publication objects provided at live.example.com will appear as though it is published by the publisher of www.example.com since both live.example.com and www.example.com belong to the same domain example.com. This may have advantages for content indexing and search engine optimization purposes. When the publication object is published dynamic publishing server may publish several versions corresponding to each of the selected publication targets. Accordingly the publication object may appear to be published in several locations perhaps by several parties.

Optionally at invitations to contribute input data to be used in the new data collection created at may be generated and transmitted. For example a list of e mail addresses may be collected and an e mail invitation containing login information a registration link or the like may be sent to the provided e mail addresses. Recipients of the e mail invitations can use the provided login information or registration link to access a user interface for submitting input data.

In some cases predetermined users e.g. identified by e mail address phone number or other identifiers may be preconfigured with access to contribute input data to create data items for the data collection created at .

Referring now to there is shown an example publication object . For this example the publication object includes two publication objects . The publication object may be a live event blog with two or more articles . One publication object is associated with the modifiable data collection . As shown the modifiable data collection includes data items such as text images including a copy of the example selected data item image video and a data collection including both text and images. The other publication object is associated with another data collection . Accordingly the process described in may be used to create new articles or posts for live event blogs using content from other publication objects such as live event blogs articles posts and so on. The re used content may be modified edited and manipulated for the modifiable data collection .

After the modifiable data collection is published as the new or updated publication object it may subsequently be updated in various ways. For example content publishing system may return to and display a listing of publication objects for selection. As a further example content publishing system may return to to display the data collections and data items for selection from the previously selected publication object to receive additional selections at and additions at .

Accordingly content publishing system is operable to implement a method of providing a user interface on client devices for modifying and publishing the modifiable data collection . For example content publishing system is operable to display as part of the interface a graphical representation of a modifiable data collection . Content publishing system is operable to display as part of the interface a graphical representation of a listing of one or more publication objects received from the publishing server where each publication object is associated with one or more publication targets and comprises one or more data collections and data items stored in a database. Content publishing system is operable to receive at the interface a first selected publication object from the listing of one or more publication objects . In response content publishing system is operable to provide the first selected publication object to the publishing server. Content publishing system is operable to update the interface to display a graphical representation of a portion of the one or more data collections and data items of the selected publication object . Content publishing system is operable to receive at the interface a selected data collection or data item from the portion of the one or more data collections and data items of the first selected publication object . Content publishing system is operable to update the interface to display a reproduction of the selected data collection or data item as part of the graphical representation of the modifiable data collection . Content publishing system is operable to receiving at the interface a command to publish the modifiable data collection such as via publication button as a publication object. The publication object may be associated with a publication target that is different than the one or more publication targets associated with the first selected publication object. Finally content publishing system is operable to transmit the modifiable data collection with the selected data collection or data item to the publication server.

The modifiable data collection may be a live article and include real time updates by multiple client devices. The updates may include additions from other publication objects as described herein. Content publishing system is operable to facilitate synchronization of live article on multiple client devices in a peer to peer configuration or by involving server.

Content publishing system is operable to display the modifiable data collection interface listing of publication objects and set of data collections and data items on each of the client devices. Each client device may also include a modification module that is operable to detect modifications to the modifiable data collection listing of publication objects and set initiated on the respective user computer. The modification module is further operable to determine the type of modification and create a representation of the modification for transmission to the other client devices that may also be displaying the modifiable data collection interface listing of publication objects and set of data collections and data items. A modification module at those client devices will generate a corresponding modification to the modifiable data collection residing or rendered thereon.

The modifiable data collection may include text formatting data image audio video embedded computing applications data feeds or a combination thereof in an electronic format that is capable of being provided to or displayed on client devices. The modifiable data collection may be edited manipulated modified and so one by the multiple client devices so that multiple users can collaborate on the modifiable data collection . For example the modifiable data collection and interface may be displayed in a browser on the client devices as part of an electronic document or page including for example document editing application documents markup language documents such as HTML XML XHTML and the like. Similarly the publication objects and the data collections and data items associated therewith and identified in set may also be displayed on client devices and updated on client devices.

In some embodiments before displaying the modifiable data collection or publication objects and the data collections and data items associated therewith content publishing system is operable to verify that it is displaying the most update to date version of the modifiable data collection . Content publishing system may send a call out or request to all one or more client devices connected to content publishing system for representations of modifications a most up to date or recent copy of the modifiable data collection or a combination thereof. Content publishing system generates the corresponding modifications before displaying the modifiable data collection to provide an up to date live version of the modifiable data collection . Content publishing system is operable to do this for the modifiable data collection as well as the selected publication objects to ensure an up to date listing of data collections and data items associated therewith.

Content publishing system is operable to detect at least one modification to the modifiable data collection initiated on a client device. Examples of modifications includes adding data collections or data items such as text or an image deleting data collections or data items changing the formatting of data collections or data items changing the value of data collections or data items dragging in data collections or data items from a selected publication object and so on. Content publishing system is operable to detect the modification at the client device at which the modification was initiated or at a server. Content publishing system is operable to detect a modification to the modifiable data collection without displaying the modifiable data collection such as for example upon receiving a request to directly add data items or detecting an update to data feeds to populate the new data collection. Examples of data feeds are for the score in a sporting event current temperature contest results polling data and the like. Content publishing system is operable to receive input from a client device via input devices or receive an update via data feeds and content publishing system is operable to detect that a modification has occurred. The modification may be initiated on the client device that received the input or data feed update or the server that received the input or data feed update. Content publishing system may detect that a modification has occurred after a predetermined time duration e.g. 500 ms has expired since the last received input. Content publishing system is operable to periodically check the data after a predetermined time duration has expired to detect modifications. Content publishing system is operable to store a previous version of the modifiable data collection and compare the previous version to new versions to detect modifications. For example content publishing system will detect a modification to the data if the size length height and other attributes of the new version of the modifiable data collection is different than the previous version of the modifiable data collection .

The modifiable data collection may be maintained in a data structure as objects. An object is a computer representation of data that is associated with attributes and the like. Content publishing system assigns an index to one or more of the objects where the index provides an address for the object within the data structure. Content publishing system updates the data structure to maintain the modification as well. The modification may also be represented in the data structure as objects and an index may also be assigned to the objects representing the modification. For example the data may be displayed in a browser on client devices as part of a document or page and the data structure may organize data on the document or page to provide structure for the data to define relationships between data components and so on.

In accordance with some embodiments the objects are organized in the data structure as a connected tree of nodes each node in the tree corresponding to an object wherein each node in the connected tree has zero or more parent nodes zero or more sibling nodes and zero or more children nodes and wherein the connected tree comprises a root node having zero parent nodes. The objects may also be organized in other types of data structures such as an array a vector a graph a list and so on.

In accordance with some embodiments content publishing system uses the Document Object Model DOM to define a data structure as a connected tree of nodes. The DOM is a model that describes how all objects or elements in an page like input fields images paragraphs and so on are related to the topmost structure the document itself. The DOM provides an application programming interface API for accessing interacting with and modifying the objects in the document. For example content publishing system is operable to use the DOM API to configure the objects and retrieve set attributes regarding the objects.

As an illustrative example the modifiable data collection may form part of an online news article and content publishing system is operable to enable a plurality of reporters and authors to work on the news article collaboratively and in sync via client devices where the new data collection is accessible via the Internet and the data structure is defined by the DOM.

For this illustrative example in order for content publishing system to access the new data collection in source XML documents the source XML files are converted into an XML document object in memory by an XML parser which results provide a set objects a document object defined by the DOM. The DOM provides a model of how the various objects in the set of objects are related to each other. This set of objects can be represented as a tree of nodes that contain the data and structure of the information contained in the XML document. Content publishing system can access interact with and modify the tree of nodes using the DOM API. Each object whatever type it may be may be represented as a node.

Content publishing system is operable to associate a user identifier with each modification to track which client device initiated the modification. The user identifier may be a hash or string of characters used to identify a client device or a user thereof. For example content publishing system may require that a user of a user computer logs in to content publishing system using a user identifier in order to access the data. If a modification is initiated at a user computer associated with the user then content publishing system is operable to associate data that indicates the user identifier with those modifications. Content publishing system may include the user identifier in the representation. Content publishing system is further operable to store a user identifier in association with modifications to maintain a record of user that initiated modifications. Further content publishing system is operable to include other attributes in the representation as part of a class name or in another part of the representation. Content publishing system is operable to associate a user identifier with modifications to consider specific styles or other formatting data that apply to a user to determine whether the user has the required data permissions to make the modification s to subsequently determine which user made the modification and so on.

As noted herein the data may be maintained in a data structure as objects and the content publishing system is operable to assign an index to one or more objects in the data structure. An index for an object provides an address in the data structure for the object so that content publishing system can look up the object. An index for an object may be an identifier associated with the object or may indirectly reference the object by its parent. The index may be one or more attributes that content publishing system uses to identify the object. For example the index may comprise a unique token used to directly identify the object such as a series of reference characters. For example the index may be a hash value for the object.

As another example the data structure may maintain each object in a position relative to other objects and the index may be a positional value for the object. For example the index may comprise a coordinate storing the position of its assigned object in relation to the other objects. In some embodiments the index may include a coordinate that is defined by at least three other nodes in a tree. For example the three other nodes may be a previous sibling node in the tree a next sibling node in the tree and a parent node in the tree. The positional value may contain a reference to at least three other nodes in the event of those three nodes are also changed by the modifications. For example an object may be represented as a parent node another object may be represented as a child node to the parent node and another object may be represented as another child node to the parent node. The positional value may reference both the parent and sibling nodes. Modifications may first move the sibling nodes being to another position and then delete the parent node. The content publishing system may implement these modifications in sequence and using a positional value that references more than one other node in the tree provides multiple mechanisms to identify an object in the event a parent or a sibling is modified as well to ensure the parent or siblings is properly referenced.

An index for an object may reference the position of a parent node to the object. If the content publishing system determines that the object is changed by the modification then the content publishing system could include the entire changed contents of the parent node in the representation.

In some embodiments the data structure may organize the objects as an array and the indexes may be positional values in the array of objects. The index may include a token a positional value or both the token and the positional value such as the coordinate for example .

The index may include different kinds of values depending on the object such as a token for one object and a positional value for another object. The index for an object may include multiple values such as both a token and a positional value for one object. The token is a character or series of characters used to identify the object. The positional value may be defined as in relation to other nodes in the tree.

In some embodiments content publishing system is operable to locate text objects with siblings that are container objects that are not wrapped with a container object. Content publishing system is further operable to modify the data to wrap the located text objects with container objects.

Content publishing system is operable to determine at least one type of modification for the at least one modification. Example types include deleting a data collection or data item from the modifiable data collection adding a data collection or data item to the modifiable data collection editing a data collection or data item of the modifiable data collection moving a data collection or data item from a first position to a second position and changing the modifiable data collection by more than a threshold amount of data. Another example includes changing the attributes of a data collection or data item such as for example an index that is a coordinate defined by the siblings and parent nodes of an object. This may occur if a new sibling is added.

Upon detecting that a modification occurred to the modifiable data collection content publishing system is operable to update the data structure to reflect the modification. For example if the modification includes bolding text that results in adding new objects and modifying existing objects then content publishing system is operable to update the data structure by adding new objects and modifying the existing data collections and data items.

Content publishing system is operable to create a representation of the at least one modification. The representation comprises a reference to one or more indexes assigned to the one or more updated objects. The representation may also include a reference to the at least one type of modification.

The representation may be any format that instructs the other user computers how to generate a corresponding modification. The representation may be relatively small in size compared to the entire data so that transmitting only the representation of the modification will be more efficient than transmitting the entire modifiable data collection or publication object each time a modification is detected. The representation may include a reference to the type of modification a reference or indications of what objects are modified how the objects are modified or a combination thereof. The representation may also include the index associated with the modification i.e. the data item that was modified and the index may be used to locate the data item to be updated at the client device. The representation is in any format that can be processed and parsed by the user computers. For example the format of the representation may be JSON JavaScript Object Notation which is a lightweight data interchange format. Content publishing system is operable to generate different formats for the same representation or translate the representation into different formats to be compatible with the various user computers. For example one client device may require a representation in a different format such as XML then another client device may require a representation in JSON. Content publishing system is operable to translate a representation in one format into another format.

The representation may not list out each individual modification and may instead provide a portion of data to add to the data structures maintaining the data on the other client devices or to use as replacement data. For example if content publishing system determines that the modification changed multiple objects that are all children to the same parent object the content publishing system may include a copy of the parent object and all children in the representation along with the index assigned to the parent object. The representation will instruct the other computers to replace the previous parent object with the new copy of the parent object in the representation.

Content publishing system is operable to transmit the representation. Content publishing system is operable to transmit the representation to other user computers that are connected to content publishing system and listening for modifications to the modifiable data collection or selected publication object for example . Content publishing system may transmit the representation to all other client devices except for the client device at which the modification was detected or may transmit to a portion thereof. Content publishing system may also transmit the representation to a server which may in turn transmit the representation to other client devices that are connected to content publishing system and listening for modifications to the modifiable data collection . Server may store some or all received representations in order to maintain a central repository of all modifications or versions of the data.

Content publishing system may also transmit representations to other client devices in response to a request for updates. For example before displaying the modifiable data collection content publishing system may issue a call to other client devices for an updated version. Alternatively the other client devices may automatically send their latest version of the data to content publishing system so that content publishing system maintains the most recent copy of the modifiable data collection . If another client device wants to join the session to collaborate on modifiable data collection then the content publishing system may provide the client device with the most recent copy of the modifiable data collection .

Content publishing system is operable to generate a corresponding modification to the data on the other client devices using the representation and locate the previous version of the data using the index in the representation. For example content publishing system is operable to update the display of data on the other client devices to synchronize the display of data on the client device on which the modification was detected. At the other client devices content publishing system is operable to parse and process the representation in order to generate a corresponding modification.

Content publishing system is operable to generate a corresponding modification by indicating the modification on the display of the client devices by marking up the previous version of the data highlighting the modification animating the modification providing a description of the modification or otherwise indicating the modification.

In order to publish the modifiable data collection and modifications thereto as a publication object in accordance with at least some embodiments a current version of the modifiable data collection may be published to a server for retrieval by client devices for display thereon. The server may also publish computer readable instructions such as JavaScript code for causing the client devices to periodically poll for updates to the modifiable data collection e.g. in the form of representations of modifications to the data or another indication that modifications have been made .

Subsequently the content publishing system may periodically determine whether modifications to the modifiable data collection have been made during a predetermined interval and whether representations of the modifications have been transmitted. If modifications have been made the content publishing system is operable to transmit the representation to a server for retrieval by the client devices. The content publishing system may also transmit an indication that modifications have been made e.g. a timestamp .

Accordingly the client devices while periodically polling for modifications to the modifiable data collection can determine that modifications have been made and retrieve the representation of the modifications. Based on the representation content publishing system can modify each client device s version of the content resulting in a modified version of the content at the client device. The index in the representation enables to the client device to efficiently locate the modified data.

While this synchronization of content on multiple client devices has be described in relation to the modifiable data collection content publishing system may facilitate synchronization of a selected publication object so that an up to date version of data collections and data items associated therewith is provided in interface for selection and addition to the modifiable data collection . For example the selected publication object may relate to a live blog or article that is updated by multiple client devices and the modifications will be reflected in the set displayed in interface .
