title: Holder that converges jets created by a plurality of shape charges
abstract: A shape charge holder includes a platform where all the charges are symmetrically positioned about equidistance from each adjacent charge and about an equal distance from a center point. The center point is generally the centroid of the platform. The holder has an explosive bridge fixture which enables simultaneous detonation of at least three shape charges. The charges are angularly mounted in sockets having holes through the platform. When detonated, each jet formed by the exploding shape charge proceeds to a convergence point located orthogonal to the platform. The holder includes a supporting structure that establishes a standoff distance of the platform/charges from a target. In operation, the explosive fixture is attached to each charge and is filled with an explosive that extends to each charge. The explosive fixture includes a single igniter assuring that when the explosive is detonated, so are the shape charges.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

The invention relates generally to shape charges and the jets created by them and more particularly to a shape charge holder that can effect the simultaneous detonation of three or more shape charges therein creating jets that converge at a point within a target.

The NAVORD REPORT 1248 a MANUAL FOR SHAPED CHARGE DESIGN By Robert A. Brimner intended for the practical designer of shaped charges is a scientific treatise on the art of making shape charges. It contains multiple passages on how the effectiveness of charges can be negatively impacted by a number of factors. The factors include casting imperfections such as bubbles and the location of the bubbles. Bubbles near the base of the liner are much more troublesome than if they occur close to or at the apex. Near the liner bubbles reduce penetration while near the apex little harm is done.

The report teaches that cone inclination and charge axis may be inclined only 0.5 degrees with respect to each other without causing serious impairment of the jet formation and subsequent penetration.

A cone may show an ellipticity of 1 percent of the cone diameter without significant effect on the performance. A difference of 1.7 percent results in a decrease of more than 10 percent in penetration.

A triangularly deformed cone showing a difference of as much as 1 percent of the base diameter gives a penetration 10 percent below the normal. A difference of 0.5 percent may be tolerated without significant harmful effect.

An off center placement of the detonator displacement 10 percent of the charge diameter will cause scattering of the jet and a decrease in the depth of penetration unless the charge is very long.

Wires rods and other solid inert materials in the cavity of the cone adversely affect penetration by interfering with the jet formation.

The disclosed invention in one aspect is a shape charge holder that converges jets formed by three or more shape charges where the shape charges are simultaneously detonated therein each creating a jet. The holder has a platform where generally all the charges are symmetrically positioned about equidistance from each adjacent charge and about an equal distance from a center point where the center point is generally the centroid of the platform. The charges are angularly mounted in sockets having holes through the platform. When detonated each jet formed by the exploding shape charge proceeds to a convergence point located orthogonal to the platform. The shape charges have an angular tilt relative to a common linear segment where the common linear segment has a length as measured from the center point to a convergence point of the jets. In an exemplary embodiment there are three shape charges each located in an angled socket on a planar platform such as a substantially equilateral triangular base. All the shape charges are positioned distributed about equidistance from each other and about the same distance to the platform s centroid which is coincident with the center point. The common linear segment extends perpendicularly from the platform s centroid until it reaches the convergence point where the convergence point is generally within a target or proximate to an outer surface of the target. In another exemplary embodiment having four shape charges each charge is located in an angled socket proximate to a vertex of a square base where all the shape charges are about equidistance from each other and about the same distance from the square platform s centroid.

The distance from the center point to all the charges does not have to be same If this distance is different then the angular tilt of the shaped charge will have to be adjusted to insure that the jet is properly aimed at the convergence point. Another potential problem arises if the distance from the center point to each charge is not identical then changing the angular tilt also changes the time required for a jet to reach the convergence point. If the angle is smaller it will reach the convergence point early and not converge with the other jets. If the angle is larger then that jet will be late. The Applicant appreciates that in some circumstances staggering the arrival of jets may be desired. If this situation exists then this situation may be affected by changing the angle of tilt along with the distance from the center point.

The holder in a second exemplary aspect includes a platform with three or more angled sockets where each angled socket has a hole with an axial bore. The axial bore is generally angled such that an axis of the bore of each socket intercepts the common linear segment at the convergence point. Each angled socket may also have a guide sleeve with a sloped rim where the sloped rim establishes an angle of tilt of the shape charge so that it is properly aimed at the convergence point.

A third aspect of the invention is that each shape charge is substantially cylindrical and is individually seated mounted in its own charge receptacle. The charge receptacle has a shelf that contacts the sloped rim of the guide sleeve and each charge receptacle is mounted in one of the angled sockets. On ignition the shape charges simultaneously detonate and the resulting emitted jets are appropriately angled with respect to the common line segment. Each jet is tilted from perpendicular such that cumulatively all jets are aimed at and will rapidly propagate to the convergence point. The convergence point as previously discussed is generally within the target and usually proximate to the outer surface of the target. At the point of convergence the converging jets cumulatively form an intensified spawned jet that has more concentrated energy greater penetration and a stronger shockwave with an elevated temperature. The elevated temperature is hot enough to vaporize many materials enabling the possibility that the vaporized materials also burn therein producing additional energy. The convergence point is generally selected inside the target in part to maximize the effect of the shaped charge spawned jet.

The shape charges have an optimum stand off distance from the target where the optimum stand off distance is function of the properties of the charges and the target. The holder includes structural supports for the platform therein the charges mounted on the platform are positioned within an acceptable range of the optimum stand off distance. The angle of the tilted shape charges in the receptacles is set such that for the optimum stand off distance all of the jets meet simultaneously and are at least proximate to the convergence point. In general as the stand off distance increases the angle of tilt is decreased. It is understood that the holder is appropriately sized to accommodate at least three shaped charges.

A fourth exemplary aspect of the invention is the development of an explosive bridge fixture where the explosive bridge fixture ensures that all shape charges are detonated simultaneously. The explosive bridge fixture helps secure the shape charges. In a departure from the prior art teaching the invented explosive bridge fixture includes a cavity filled with a powerful explosive in communication with the shape charges and a single ignition point versus multiple electrical ignition leads to multiple charges. The explosive is selected from the group consisting of pentaerythritol tetranitrate PETN cyclotri methylenetrinitramine RDX and military high explosives that are powerful and brisant. The cavity of the explosive bridge fixture may be accessed to facilitate loading the explosive. In one exemplary variation there is a covering element and a channeled element. The channeled element has a plurality of extensions where there is an extension for each charge. Each extension has an arched channel and a connecting end that functions to secure the explosive bridge fixture to a shape charge where the connection provides a route to funnel explosive material to the connected shape charge. The connecting end generally enables an integral locking connection with the shape charge. The covering element of the bridge fixture encases the explosive material in the channeled element and in one variation the covering element has a hollow hub element through which additional explosive may be added to the channel. The hollow hub element may house the ignition source and other axial elements may be fastened. The covering element encloses the channeled element and adds strength to the explosive bridge fixture and therein further stabilizes the position of the shape charges. The single ignition source to the explosive in the explosive bridge fixture ensures that all the shape charges detonate at the same time thus substantially producing simultaneous convergence of the jets.

The illustrated invented holder has a novel explosive bridge fixture which enables the substantially simultaneous detonation of three or more shape charges. The shape charges are angularly positioned in a platform that is offset from the target with structural supports. The charges mounted on the platform are positioned within an acceptable range of the optimum stand off. Positioning and standoff enables all the jets to be focused at the convergence point. In application the convergence point is generally somewhere within the target. The control over detonation positioning and standoff results in the approximate simultaneous arrival of all the jets at a relatively precise time and location point. At a relatively precise time the converging jets cumulatively form an intensified spawned jet that has more concentrated energy greater penetration and a stronger shockwave with an elevated temperature. The elevated temperature is hot enough to vaporize many materials enabling the vaporized materials to also burn producing additional energy.

Referring to which is a perspective side view of a three shape charge holder the holder has a platform with a plurality of angled sockets that are symmetrically positioned about equidistance from each adjacent charge and about an equal distance from a center point where the center point is generally the centroid of the platform . Each socket has a hole see with an axial bore where the axial bore is substantially angled such that the jet from the shaped charge seated in the socket intercepts a common linear segment at the convergence point . The sockets are distributed substantially equidistant from each other and from a centroid for the platform which is substantially a triangle . In the illustrated exemplary embodiment each angled socket has a guide sleeve with a sloped rim see where the slope of the rim is selected to help establish an angle of tilt previously referred to as the angular position of the shape charge . Each socket is fitted with a charge receptacle where each charge receptacle holds a shaped charge by its cylindrical body and base. The charge receptacle has a necked in region on which rests the charge s base. As illustrated the necked in region functions as a shelf see that contacts the sloped rim of the guide sleeve and each charge receptacle is mounted in one of the angled sockets . The fixed angle of each seated shape charge mounted in its socket may be fine tuned through the use of shim rings not shown positioned between the sloped rim see of the guide sleeve and the shelf see of the charge receptacle . It is also anticipated that the angle of tilt may be confirmed using a laser beam tool.

Referring to and the holder has an explosive bridge fixture where the explosive bridge fixture ensures that all shape charges are detonated simultaneously and the fixture helps secure the alignment of the shape charges mounted in the charge receptacles in the platform s sockets. The invented explosive bridge fixture has a cavity filled with a powerful explosive such as PETN or RDX based explosive in communication with the shape charges and a single ignition point. In the explosive bridge fixture is shown as separated components. The cavity of the explosive bridge fixture may be accessed by removing a covering element exposing an interior of a channeled element . The channeled element has a plurality of extensions . There is one extension for each charge . Each extension has an arched channel and a connecting end for receiving the explosive of choice. The connecting end functions to secure the explosive bridge fixture to a shape charge where the connection provides a route to funnel explosive material into the connected shape charge. The connecting end enables an integral locking connection with the head atop a conical portion of the bylindrical body of the shape charge . The covering element when snapped on the channeled element encases the explosive material in the channeled element . As shown in the figures in the illustrated embodiment the covering element has a hollow hub element through which additional explosive not shown may be added to fill completely the arched channels all the way to the heads of the shape charges . The covering element and the channeled element cumulatively form the cavity. The hollow hub element may house the ignition source not shown and other axial elements may be fastened. The cover element adds additional strength to the explosive bridge fixture and therein further stabilizes the position of the shape charges. The explosive bridge fixture has a single ignition source that ignites the explosive filling the extension channels thus ensuring that all the shape charges detonate at substantially the same time.

The resulting emitted jets are angled with respect to the common line segment each jet tilted such that cumulatively they all proceed to the convergence point.

The platform has a supporting structure that in this embodiment includes a set of legs that rest on a surface of the target . The supporting structure establishes the stand off distance from the target s surface . The convergence point is within the target and the linear segment extends from the centroid past the surface to the convergence point . To accommodate for the difference in length from the surface and the convergence point the supporting structure that is in this embodiment the legs the legs are appropriately shortened. Each leg is substantially an assembly of overlapping elongate L shaped elements which may be extended or shortened. The supporting structure may be selected from extendable poles jacks or any other suitable mechanism.

Referring to which is an overhead plan view of an exemplary four shape charge holder where the four shape charge holder is very similar to the three shape charge holder . The structural change is that the platform would be larger to accommodate another similar sized shape charge and the explosive bridge fixture has four extensions and a covering element suitable for the channel element not visible .

Referring to which is a table that illustrates the relationship of the positioning of the shape charges the angle of tilt and the length of the line segment. The data is sorted based on the length of the common linear segment. Recall the common linear segment is the segment that extends from the centroid to the convergence point . If the convergence point is located on the target surface then the length of the standoff distance and the linear segment are the same. In an exemplary embodiment the convergence point is beneath the surface within the target so the linear segment is actually longer than the standoff distance and the tilt angle has to be calculated providing for the added length. On the other hand many exemplary embodiment target surfaces are curved. Depending on the crowning the supporting structure may or may not need adjustment. The table in assumes an exemplary flat surface and only addresses the dimensions on the platform including the placement of the charges and how the geometric factors influence the convergence point. The trend is that relatively small changes in the distance from the centroid to the center of the charge increase the degrees and in particular by a factor of 6 degrees. Another way of looking at the data if your convergence point is 10 on the linear segment then you need a tilt angle of 12.08 degrees. If the tilt is wrong and is actually 14.98 then instead of converging at length 10.00 the jet will intercept the linear segment at length 8.00.

Referring to which is a line representation of the calculations shown in . The charges on the right are 2.14 3.14 and 4.15 from the centroid and located in same horizontal plane. The convergence point is located just beneath the target surface . Jets illustrate the relationship between the distance from the centroid to the center of the charge and the angle of tilt. As seen the greater the angle the longer the path to the convergence point and the greater the delay in time. In this exemplary embodiment not all the shape charges are located the same distance from the center. Nonetheless meeting at the convergence point is still desired. While all charges are detonated at the same time the jets produced by those charges mounted further from the center will take longer to reach the convergence point. Therefore the convergence will be less intense but cover a slightly longer period of time.

Finally any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations for example by using the term about that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding.
