This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 271 984 filed Oct. 12 2011 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Geological models may be employed to assist with resource assessment and recovery. A typical geological modeling process includes acquisition of seismic data for a geological site and analysis of the seismic data to construct a model of the site. Given a model an engineer may make assessments as to a subterranean resource at the site and may generate model based simulation data that sheds light on potential recovery of the resource from the site.

Geological models are multidimensional in space e.g. three dimensional correspond to the present time e.g. time of seismic data acquisition and allow for simulations that focus on resource recovery to take place over a relatively short period of time compared to geological time. Accordingly various aspects of geological time may be neglected. In various examples technologies and techniques may provide for analyses with respect to geological time.

A method can include providing a geological time data structure configured to link objects of a geological model to geological times. By linking an object of a geological model to a geological time and generating simulation results for the geological model such a method can provide for outputting simulation results along a geological time axis. Various other apparatuses systems methods etc. are also disclosed.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in limiting the scope of the claimed subject matter.

The following description includes the best mode presently contemplated for practicing the described implementations. This description is not to be taken in a limiting sense but rather is made merely for the purpose of describing the general principles of the implementations. The scope of the described implementations should be ascertained with reference to the issued claims.

In the example of the management components include a seismic data component an information component a processing component a simulation component an attribute component an analysis visualization component and a workflow component . In operation seismic data and other information provided per the components and may be input to the simulation component .

In an example embodiment the simulation component may rely on entities . Entities may include earth entities or geological objects such as wells surfaces reservoirs etc. In the system the entities can include virtual representations of actual physical entities that are reconstructed for purposes of simulation. The entities may include entities based on data acquired via sensing observation etc. e.g. the seismic data and other information .

In an example embodiment the simulation component may rely on a software framework such as an object based framework. In such a framework entities may include entities based on pre defined classes to facilitate modeling and simulation. A commercially available example of an object based framework is the MICROSOFT .NET framework Redmond Wash. which provides a set of extensible object classes. In the .NET framework an object class encapsulates a module of reusable code and associated data structures. Object classes can be used to instantiate object instances for use in by a program script etc. For example borehole classes may define objects for representing boreholes based on well data.

In the example of the simulation component may process information to conform to one or more attributes specified by the attribute component which may include a library of attributes. Such processing may occur prior to input to the simulation component . Alternatively or in addition to the simulation component may perform operations on input information based on one or more attributes specified by the attribute component . In an example embodiment the simulation component may construct one or more models of the geologic environment which may be relied on to simulate behavior of the geologic environment e.g. responsive to one or more acts whether natural or artificial . In the example of the analysis visualization component may allow for interaction with a model or model based results. Additionally or alternatively output from the simulation component may be input to one or more other workflows as indicated by a workflow component .

In an example embodiment the management components may include features of a commercially available simulation framework such as the PETREL seismic to simulation software framework Schlumberger Limited Houston Tex. . The PETREL framework provides components that allow for optimization of exploration and development operations. The PETREL framework includes seismic to simulation software components that can output information for use in increasing reservoir performance for example by improving asset team productivity. Through use of such a framework various professionals e.g. geophysicists geologists and reservoir engineers can develop collaborative workflows and integrate operations to streamline processes. Such a framework may be considered an application and may be considered a data driven application e.g. where data is input for purposes of simulating a geologic environment .

In an example embodiment the management components may include features for geology and geological modeling to generate high resolution geological models of reservoir structure and stratigraphy e.g. classification and estimation facies modeling well correlation surface imaging structural and fault analysis well path design data analysis fracture modeling workflow editing uncertainty and optimization modeling petrophysical modeling etc. . Particular features may allow for performance of rapid 2D and 3D seismic interpretation optionally for integration with geological and engineering tools e.g. classification and estimation well path design seismic interpretation seismic attribute analysis seismic sampling seismic volume rendering geobody extraction domain conversion etc. . As to reservoir engineering for a generated model one or more features may allow for simulation workflow to perform streamline simulation reduce uncertainty and assist in future well planning e.g. uncertainty analysis and optimization workflow well path design advanced gridding and upscaling history match analysis etc. . The management components may include features for drilling workflows including well path design drilling visualization and real time model updates e.g. via real time data links .

In an example embodiment various aspects of the management components may include add ons or plug ins that operate according to specifications of a framework environment. For example a commercially available framework environment marketed as the OCEAN framework environment Schlumberger Limited allows for seamless integration of add ons or plug ins into a PETREL framework workflow. The OCEAN framework environment leverages .NET tools Microsoft Corporation Redmond Wash. and offers stable user friendly interfaces for efficient development. In an example embodiment various components may be implemented as add ons or plug ins that conform to and operate according to specifications of a framework environment e.g. according to application programming interface API specifications etc. .

The model simulation layer may provide domain objects act as a data source provide for rendering and provide for various user interfaces . Rendering may provide a graphical environment in which applications can display their data while the user interfaces may provide a common look and feel for application user interface components.

In the example of the domain objects can include entity objects property objects and optionally other objects. Entity objects may be used to geometrically represent wells surfaces reservoirs etc. while property objects may be used to provide property values as well as data versions and display parameters. For example an entity object may represent a well where a property object provides log information as well as version information and display information e.g. to display the well as part of a model .

In the example of data may be stored in one or more data sources or data stores generally physical data storage devices which may be at the same or different physical sites and accessible via one or more networks. The model simulation layer may be configured to model projects. As such a particular project may be stored where stored project information may include inputs models results and cases. Thus upon completion of a modeling session a user may store a project. At a later time the project can be accessed and restored using the model simulation layer which can recreate instances of the relevant domain objects.

In the example scenario a geological time object may be instantiated to provide an object backbone e.g. a backbone for links to other objects or data . In such an example the geological time object may be referred to as a geotime backbone object as it may be configured to structure data for purposes of presenting data along a geological time axis.

In the example scenario the object backbone may reference or be based on one or more geological time data sources which may be provided through one or more geological time data source components and rendered using one or more geological time rendering components . For example a geological time data source component may be configured to access data for a chronographic axis or chart e.g. with details extending from Period P to Epoch E to Stage S and then rendered to a display e.g. a screen a monitor etc. . In an example embodiment a geological time graphic may be an interactive graphical user interface GUI for example implemented by one or more UI components .

In the example scenario a vertical GUI or horizontal GUI may be rendered to allow for user interaction for example to populate the object backbone via a menu control e.g. to create links or structure data with respect to one or more geological times . As shown the object backbone is populated with objects at a time of 100 Ma and with objects at a time of 40 Ma. As indicated processes may be assigned to objects associated with the object backbone for example to provide output to one or more workflows see e.g. Work Flow X and Work Flow Y .

In an example embodiment population of an object backbone may occur through linking. In an example embodiment linking may link entities to inherently link to data or data elements . Linking may involve tagging for example where a geological object of a geological model or its associated data can be tagged to indicate a link to one or more geological time objects such as the object associated with the object backbone . In an example embodiment linking and tagging may optionally occur in an essentially simultaneous manner e.g. where a linking operation automatically causes an object or data to be tagged .

For the input tab graphical controls allow for model choices while time trends allow for selection of trends that may occur with respect to time. In the example of the time trends include a basal heat flow trend set up graphic a sediment water interface temperature set up graphic and a paleo water depth set up graphic . Through selection of graphics a user may set up the various time trends to form input instructions for running a simulation. For example time trend selection information may be stored in a geological time data structure defined on a geotime backbone accessible by a simulation module to thereby allow for output of simulation results that again include geological time data for association with a geotime backbone. Consider an example scenario where a user selects the Input tab from the tabs provides input specifications via the various graphical controls e.g. and and then selects the Run tab from the tabs to run a simulation that in turn outputs at least some simulation results e.g. properties with respect to time. In this example scenario a geological time data structure can link to objects of a geological model such that generated simulation results can be output along a geological time axis. In such an example the geological time data structure may be defined by a geotime object e.g. a geotime component class that provides input fields to store input specifications that instruct data linking or data gathering operations e.g. via simulation processing etc. to structure data in output fields with respect to geological time e.g. along a geological time axis . In various examples output fields can be filled with properties e.g. values associated with entities e.g. a well a reservoir etc. . In an object oriented environment properties may be defined by property objects and entities by entity objects where for example a geotime object may define a data structure having at least one input field to hold an object identifier that dictates what data will populate an output field or fields. In this example the data in the output field or fields may be presented along a geological time axis e.g. the data structure may include one or more fields that hold a geological time or times .

An example of a data structure is shown in as including a task field an object ID field a property field a geotime field and another field. In this example the data structure may include one or more fields for data methods instructions etc. The data structure may be populated at least in part by input from a configuration file a GUI or other mechanism. In the example of the data structure may optionally provide a listing of tasks to instruct a computing system to perform various actions. Some examples of populated fields are shown in the data structure of . Consider a scenario where a user selects an object having an object ID 54 and an associated property P for output along a full range of geological time Full with a color scheme Color . As another example consider a scenario where a user selects an object having an object ID 23 and an associated property P for output with respect to a specific geological time of 18 Ma where any property values are normalized Normalize . In yet another example consider a scenario where a user selects an object having an object ID 6 and an associated property P for output with respect to Eocene times where property values are transformed to log values Log . In an example embodiment a data structure includes an input field to specify an object of a geological model a geological time field to specify one or more geological times e.g. a specific time or a range of times and an output field to hold data for presentation with respect to a geological time e.g. with respect to a geological time axis . Such a data structure can link objects of a geological model to geological times. By linking an object of a geological model to a geological time and generating simulation results for the geological model such a data structure can facilitate outputting simulation results along a geological time axis. The GUI may also include graphical controls for example to allow for issuance of basic operations such as Apply OK and Cancel .

In the example of the method includes a provision block for providing a geological time data structure configured to link objects of a geological model to geological times a linkage block for linking one of the objects of the geological model to one of the geological times a generation block for generating simulation results for the geological model and an output block for based at least in part on the geological time data structure outputting at least some of the simulation results along a geological time axis.

The method is shown in in association with various computer readable media CRM blocks and . Such blocks generally include instructions suitable for execution by one or more processors or cores to instruct a computing device or system to perform one or more actions. While various blocks are shown a single medium may be configured with instructions to allow for at least in part performance of various actions of the method .

In an example embodiment one or more computer readable media can include computer executable instructions to instruct a computing system to instantiate a geological time object configured to provide a geological time axis link property data of a geological model to geological times of the geological time axis of the instantiated geological time object and structure the linked property data with respect to the geological time axis in a screen renderable format. For example the CRM may provide instructions for instantiating a geological time object the CRM may provide instructions for linking property data of a geological model to geological times of the geological time axis of the instantiated geological time object and the CRM may provide instructions to structure the linked property data with respect to the geological time axis in a screen renderable format. In an example embodiment computer executable instructions may be provided to instruct a computing system to exchange data between an object of a geological model and a geological time object which may optionally occur during a simulation or other computing process.

The GUI also includes tabs for chronostratigraphic selections and for lithofacies selections e.g. associated facies lithology petroleum systems element etc. . As shown in the example of the chronostratigraphic tab includes a series of selectable configuration graphics and a chronstratigraphic graphic which may be configured and rendered in response to selection of one of the graphics .

As indicated a so called chart may be created or loaded. In the chart cls simple is loaded and available for editing. The chart includes various fields such as geotime events geotimes colors and comments . For each geotime e.g. 0 Ma 2.5 Ma 5 Ma 24 Ma 35 Ma 55 Ma and 65 Ma an associated event is shown for example as an entity which may be a spatial layer or surface. To facilitate analysis the color field allows a color to be assigned to each of the events. A series of graphic controls allow a user to instruct the GUI to apply edits entries selections etc. to OK edits entries selections etc. for saving to memory e.g. a file and to cancel edits entries selections etc. Through the GUI a user may create or edit a chart that provides fields for explicitly linking geological objects to geological time. Further graphical properties may be assigned such as color to allow for enhanced visuals when information is rendered to a screen. As such a GUI may be part of an analysis or more generally a workflow the comment field allows a user or users to enter comments which may be helpful to assess or engineer solutions associated with an environment a reservoir etc.

In the example of the GUI includes a geological time axis and a depth axis along with layer boundary lines temperature contours and a lithology graphic e.g. for lithology of various layers . In the example of temperature contours are indicated by hatching however these may be presented in colors shadings or other form. Further lithology may be presented for example via patterns. As an example consider colored temperature contours and lithology patterns that allow a user to examine associations between temperature and lithology.

In the example of the list of selectable features indicates that the GUI is configured with instructions for selection of one or more layers a temperature or temperature range rock or lithology properties oil water or one or more user definable features. As an example upon receipt of an instruction that indicates a layer has been selected the GUI may call for rendering of the menu . As shown in the example of the menu provides for additional analysis options such as temperature heat flow or other.

As indicated by the method a selection block may provide for selection of UI features a process block may provide for processing responsive to a selection and a render block may provide for rendering results responsive to completion or at least partial completion of processing. For example a user may select a layer select a heat flow and then instruct processing to produce results for rendering to a display or screen e.g. according to data structure provided by a geotime object .

The method is shown in in association with various computer readable media CRM blocks and . Such blocks generally include instructions suitable for execution by one or more processors or cores to instruct a computing device or system to perform one or more actions. While various blocks are shown a single medium may be configured with instructions to allow for at least in part performance of various actions of the method .

In the example of the geological time data component includes instructions to access data associated with the selected layer for processing to allow for rendering of the GUI . As indicated in the GUI the selected layer spans the entire geological time axis and therefore the GUI renders heat flow data for this entire period of time. In contrast for another selected layer associated with the GUI the temperature and additional plotted information extend from the geological origination time for that layer. Accordingly in an example embodiment upon selection of an object or feature a geological time data component may access geological time data associated with that object or feature to provide for rendering along a geological time axis. Such an approach can be implemented in conjunction with the petroleum system events chart object which associates events with features. In the example of a critical moment can be discerned on the basis of associating events and features.

With respect to petroleum system elements PSE temporal aspects can include for example depositional or formation ages critical moment and preservation time. In a PSE analysis a critical moment is the time that best depicts the generation migration accumulation of hydrocarbons in a petroleum system and preservation time of a petroleum system begins immediately after the generation migration accumulation process occurs and may extend to the present day.

A PSE chart may be arranged according to an ideal or successful order of events. For example the source rock could be generated and expel hydrocarbons once the trap is formed. With a PSE chart one can readily check the order of events if they are arranged according to an ideal order or successful order . In an example embodiment a PSE chart may serve as a basis for risk analysis or be transformed into a risk chart for example to better evaluate a play or prospect. As an example decisions from a risk chart analysis may be entered via a GUI and support management decisions on bidding drilling etc.

In an example embodiment a method can include outputting at least some of the simulation results along a geological time axis e.g. in Ma and at least some of the simulation results along another axis which may be for example an orthogonal axis a log axis a depth axis a temperature axis a heat flow axis and a hydrocarbon generation axis. As shown in the example of a method can include outputting e.g. based at least in part on simulation results petroleum systems events along a geological time axis which may include a critical moment indicated along the geological time axis. In an example embodiment a method can include providing a graphical user interface slider tool configured for selection of a time along a geological time axis and for output of information associated with the selected time which may be a range of times. As explained where various graphics are to be rendered to a screen manipulation of a tool may provide for synchronous changes in the various graphics e.g. to a selected time or range of times . In an example embodiment a method can include providing a graphical user interface tool configured for selection of a spatial geographical feature. Such a tool may optionally provide for selection of the same feature across multiple graphics e.g. in various windows etc. .

In an example embodiment a geological time data structure may be a geological time object e.g. a geotime object . A method may include exchanging data between a spatial geological object e.g. of a reservoir model and a geological time object. In an example embodiment such a method may exchange data by issuing at least one application programming interface call and receiving data in response to the call. Where a simulation occurs to generate simulation results exchanging data may occur at least in part during generation of the simulation results. With respect to output a method can optionally include issuing at least one control command to control resource exploration or recovery equipment associated with a physical reservoir.

In the example of the GUI shows a burial history plot the GUI shows a first time plot the GUI shows a second time plot and the GUI shows a PSE chart. In this example the GUIs and are coupled to show a common time range. Color and other annotations applied to one of the plots may be applied one or more other plots to enhance visualization. The geological time rendering component may be configured to select a time or times e.g. a range of times to act as a geo time slider that can be used to control other components for output of information as indicated by an output block . Such components may be a 3D component for output of information as a 3D plot a depth extraction tool component for presentation of burial history etc.

In an example embodiment one or more computer readable media can include computer executable instructions to instruct a computing system to receive simulation data from a geological model based simulation see e.g. the block generate a simulation data plot along a geological time axis and a geological spatial axis see e.g. the block generate a graphical control tool configured to select a time along the geological time axis see e.g. the block and generate output information responsive to selection of a time by the graphical control tool see e.g. the block . As mentioned a graphical control tool may allow for selection of a time range along the geological time axis. In an example embodiment a computing system can include a communication interface to communicate output information e.g. responsive to interaction s with a GUI to control resource recovery equipment associated with a physical reservoir. As shown in the example of the geological time data component can include instructions for a graphical control tool configured to select a geological spatial feature of a plot e.g. one or more layers etc. . As to receipt of data e.g. per the block such data can include simulation data received from a geological model based simulation for example where the data is accessed from a stored geological time object that includes a link to a spatial geological object.

As shown in the geological object properties GUI may present information in a table format that includes fields such as layer name name and characteristics of a stratigraphic unit e.g. Naust Formation shales Brygge Formation shales etc. color assignment pattern assignment lithology PSE and kinetics. In an example embodiment such properties or others may be stored with respect to a geotime object e.g. the geotime object which may be a GUI component accessible by a rendering component to render such information to a screen see e.g. the GUIs of optionally with graphic controls for selecting colors patterns names etc.

As shown in the method includes a time entry block for entering one or more times a render block for rendering a geological object link graphic a link block for linking geological objects to times and optionally properties and a process block for processing linked information for example to generate output e.g. graphics charts control commands etc. .

The method is shown in in association with various computer readable media CRM blocks and . Such blocks generally include instructions suitable for execution by one or more processors or cores to instruct a computing device or system to perform one or more actions. While various blocks are shown a single medium may be configured with instructions to allow for at least in part performance of various actions of the method .

In the example of a linking mechanism may be provided to link or provide properties where such a mechanism may rely on one or more application programming interfaces APIs . For example a framework may provide for use of templates written in a domain specific language or other form. Upon consumption of the template a GUI may be rendered with controls that conform to one or more APIs. In turn upon selection of a control an API call may be issued to a data store with information about spatial components. A GUI may provide for selection of one of the spatial components and upon selection issuance of an API mediated instruction to link or tag that spatial component as being assigned to a geotime object such as the backbone object . Such linking or tagging of the spatial component may be considered an indirect manner for ultimately accessing underlying data e.g. property data .

Alternatively or additionally a GUI may allow for direct linking or tagging to property data. For example consider a control that presents data storage locations for property data where a link may be established directly to such data. In such an example a time backbone may be rendered with appropriate data without a need for an instance of the corresponding property object.

In the example of the spatial components may include entity objects property objects and optionally other objects . In an example embodiment the entity objects provide for geometrically representing wells surfaces layers reservoirs etc. while the property objects may provide for property values as well as display parameters. For example an entity object may represent a layer where a property object provides lithology information.

As to the geotime components the geotime backbone object may be defined as a data type that may include a series of events through time to thereby provide the backbone see e.g. the object backbone of . For example where organized as a series of events through time the mechanism may provide for linking each time event in the series to an identifier or identifiers e.g. a name or names for one or more spatial components . As to the one or more other geotime objects each of these may include time information already associated with properties e.g. values which readily allow for handling by the geotime backbone object .

In an example embodiment properties can be assigned to a geotime object where the properties may be spatial properties or optionally other properties. Accordingly in the framework the geotime backbone object can be linked to one or more of the objects or . In such a scheme property values may be aligned with respective geotime events to provide resolution in time akin to resolution in space. Further the one or more other geotime objects may optionally be types of objects for example to assist with GUIs linking rendering output etc.

In an example embodiment a geotime object may also provide for specifying input as well as specifying output from the perspective of a certain simulation or calculation module. For example to enable selection and assignment by a user as well as to define receipt of input by one or more workflows transmission of output may occur to one or more workflows etc. In such a manner a geotime object can provide for coupling of components.

In the scenario the components provide inputs for a process which in turn provides outputs . As an example consider a 1D petroleum system simulation that includes a geological layer model and some spatial boundary conditions as well as temporal boundary conditions e.g. heat flow sediment water interface temperature and paleo water depth . In such an example the geological layer model and boundary conditions components may be a mix of spatial components and geotime components that can be inputs that carry various data used for the process such as a simulation see e.g. the example GUI of Make 1D Simulation . Upon performing the process generated results or simulation data may be represented by geotime components e.g. objects and properties to allow for rendering graphics to a display e.g. thermal history hydrocarbon generation history of source rock etc. . In an example embodiment output objects may serve as input for any of a variety of purposes for example a prospect evaluation module or any other geological interpretation tool.

The scenario can provide various options for a user to deal with geotime objects. For example a geotime object may be loaded saved and selected like any other object in a data structure provided by a modeling or other framework e.g. consider PETREL input tree where for example concepts of assigning properties and semantic schemes e.g. consider PETREL templates can be provided to geotime objects in a manner akin to spatial objects.

As shown in the example of the method can receive input from or provide output to a prospect evaluation a field interaction a workflow or other process . Such processes may be associated with a geologic environment which may include a communication network configured to communicate information from equipment such as a computing device or system to the environment . Accordingly the access block may access input from the environment and the output block may provide for output to the environment . Output to the environment may be in the form of issued control commands to control equipment such as resource exploration or recovery equipment and .

In an example embodiment one or more computer readable media may include computer executable instructions to instruct a computing system to output information for controlling a process. For example such instructions may provide for output to sensing process an injection process drilling process an extraction process etc.

In the example of the application can include a plug in manager an application configuration file one or more interfaces and entity instances . An entity instance may carry geometry of an entity object it represents where a property object carries property values associated with that entity. For example the project includes a data element for a well a data element for a reservoir and a data element for another feature . In such an example the data elements and represent entities that are characterized by corresponding properties such as log values porosity values and other values . These types of data e.g. entity and property may be exposed via domain object classes of the framework resources as implemented by the application .

In the example of the geotime component classes may be one or more geotime domain object classes and for a project a geotime data element may exist that is exposed via one or more of the geotime domain object classes . In such a scenario the project may further include properties associated with the geotime data element where the properties may be exposed via one or more of the geotime domain object classes . For example the data element may be a geotime backbone entity and the properties may be values that include time information e.g. heat flow values with associated times . The application may instantiate the geotime backbone entity to be one of the entity instances and render it as one of the interfaces .

In the example of geotime component classes may be provided via the geotime class library for example in the form of plug ins. As shown the library may include classes interfaces and value types . The application may allow for use of the library via the plug in manager that accesses the application configuration file . In such an arrangement the plug in manager may allow for registration and use of the library .

As shown in the method includes a construct block an initialize block and integrate block a use block and a disposal block . Such a method may provide for use of one or more plug ins for example as provided by the geotime class library .

In the example of the framework resources may include a module interface that defines procedures e.g. methods such as those of the method . For example such a module interface may include methods for construction initialization integration presentation integration disintegration and disposal of a plug in module. Consider the following scenario where during startup of an application a construction method may load a module as defined in the configuration file for an application and proceed to instantiate the module. Following construction an initialization method may register any services provided by the module which may allow for consumption of such services to one or more other modules. After initialization an integration method can involve consumption of registered services. Where appropriate an integrate presentation method makes user interface components menus toolbars context menus windows etc. available. Accordingly a user may interact with and use functionality provided by the module. After use for example at shut down a disintegration method can clean up any presentation elements installed by the module. Thereafter a disposal method can free any unmanaged resources and free any licenses acquired by the module.

In an example embodiment components may be distributed such as in the network system . The network system includes components . . . N. For example the components may include the processor s while the component s may include memory accessible by the processor s . Further the component s may include an I O device for display and optionally interaction with a method. The network may be or include the Internet an intranet a cellular network a satellite network etc.

Although various methods devices systems etc. have been described in language specific to structural features and or methodological acts it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described. Rather the specific features and acts are disclosed as examples of forms of implementing the claimed methods devices systems etc.
