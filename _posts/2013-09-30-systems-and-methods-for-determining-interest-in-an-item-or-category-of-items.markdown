title: Systems and methods for determining interest in an item or category of items
abstract: Systems and methods are provided for determining customer interest associated with an item or category of items. In some embodiments, one or more discussion forums associated with each of a plurality of items may be determined. For each item, interest criteria associated with the item may be determined based at least in part on the one or more discussion forums associated with the item. The interest criteria may include the number of user posts in the one or more discussion forums and/or the number of users who have participated in the one or more discussion forums. An interest score associated with each item may be determined based at least in part on the interest criteria. In some embodiments, interest ranking information for an item or category may be generated by comparing the interest score associated with an item or category and interest scores associated with other items or categories.

This application is a continuation of and claims benefit of priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 885 319 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DETERMINING INTEREST IN AN ITEM OR CATEGORY OF ITEMS filed Sep. 17 2010 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Retailers and merchants involved in electronic commerce continually strive to make it easier for customers to research products and receive information that may assist in purchasing decisions. One way to improve a customer s experience includes providing discussion forums or discussion boards that allow customers to exchange information with other people via dialogue in a discussion. The ever enlarging product catalog makes discussion forums helpful when a customer tries to distinguish between products seek out impartial advice learn more about a product or category share the customer s experience with or impressions of a product or obtain other information. A merchant with a large catalog of products may offer a large number of different discussion forums on a variety of topics which may range from very specific topics to general ones. Some forums may be more active and have a greater frequency of responses than other forums. While these forums are useful for customers to share information regarding an item or to make purchasing decisions within a category of items activity in such forums is not typically analyzed by a merchant or retailer to determine items or categories that are of interest to customers.

Generally described aspects of the present disclosure relate to determining customer interest in an item or category of items. In some embodiments a score module as disclosed herein may be used to determine one or more discussion forums associated with each of a plurality of items. For each item the score module may determine interest criteria associated with the item based at least in part on the one or more discussion forums associated with the item. The interest criteria may include for example the number of user posts in the one or more discussion forums and or the number of users who have participated in the one or more discussion forums in a given time period. The score module may then determine an interest score associated with each item based at least in part on the interest criteria. In some embodiments a ranking server as disclosed herein may then generate interest ranking information for an item or category of items such as by comparing the interest score associated with an item or category and interest scores associated with other items or categories.

In some embodiments a ranking server as disclosed herein may generally rank items or categories to reflect the relative level of interest that users have in the particular item or category relative to other items or categories. Interest in an item may be thought of in some embodiments as how much customer buzz exists regarding an item such as how much discussion occurs among customers regarding a product or other item. Interest rankings may generally be determined based on for example activity in discussion forums or user review activity. In some embodiments a ranking server as disclosed herein may additionally or alternatively generate overall popularity rankings of items or categories of items which may be determined based on both customer interest levels or buzz as well as actual sales data associated with items or categories of items. As will be discussed further below a given item may be associated with a relatively high level of customer interest yet not have a high number of sales for example an item that has not yet been released to the public and or which is not available for ordering . Conversely a given item that is frequently purchased and would have a high sales ranking relative to other items might not be associated with much discussion or buzz for example an everyday product that is not particularly unique .

The forums disclosed herein may be forums associated with one or more elements or categories. Elements may generally include products services sellable units user profiles user created content abstract subjects or anything else which may be organized in categories. Categories may be created and managed by an entity such as a retailer or merchant involved in electronic commerce or any other entity which may organize elements according to one or more categorical hierarchies. The elements may be grouped or otherwise associated with one or more categories in a hierarchical organization. For example an element may be an item available to be ordered by a customer such as a portable DVD player. The portable DVD player may be associated with a category DVD Players that is itself associated with a larger category Video. In addition the portable DVD player may also be associated with a category Portable Media Players under a parallel category Audio. It follows that elements and categories may be cross referenced to create a web of information in an electronic catalog.

Categorization may be used to enable a user to locate elements. Typically categorization of elements follows a logical top down organization that enables a user to quickly and intuitively locate a particular element by searching through a hierarchical catalog. For example a user may desire to find a MP3 player in a catalog of elements. The user may begin at the top of hierarchical organization of elements and click from electronics to audio and then to audio players and finally to MP3 players. Thus in four steps the user may be able to locate a category that contains MP3 players which enables the user to browse possible elements that may satisfy the user s preferences. Each category may include a category page or other user interface listing information about the category items included in the category and or other related information. As described herein the term category may include any collection of elements including without limitation categories sub categories classes sub classes stores departments groups product manufacturers communities product types etc.

A category may include or be associated with one or more category forums. In some embodiments an electronic discussion forum sometimes referred to herein as simply a forum is a discussion board hosted by a server where users utilizing computing devices in network communication with the server may exchange messages such as text based messages via posts or entries typically continued in a dialogue format on the discussion board. In some instances the forum may facilitate exchanging and viewing images e.g. videos icons or other graphical imagery or exchanging and or playing audio and or video clips. Users may either contribute to the discussion or they may read other users entries to gain insight on the discussion topic. The category forum may be presented with a category page to display the category forum with elements in the category and allow users to interact on the category forum. In some aspects users may exchange files or other data via a forum either using a message board or other response posting environment.

The category forum may include one or more discussions. Each discussion may be created in whole or in part based on a topic related to an element and or a particular category associated with the element. As a result the discussions may be related to aspects of the category including the elements associated with the category. Therefore in some embodiments the category forum may be a general forum for discussing a variety of elements each sharing a common category. In some embodiments individual elements or items such as individual products may be associated with their own discussion forum. Accordingly in some embodiments some or all of the items available to be ordered and or items that have not yet been released but for which item details are available may each be associated with a forum that is specific to the given item.

In some embodiments forums may be surfaced or presented on element pages tag pages search results pages or other pages associated with an electronic catalog. In a collaborative environment tags may be descriptors freely chosen by different users to characterize or otherwise describe attributes of an item or other element rather than having the description controlled by a centralized classification process. For example tags can specify properties of an element that may not otherwise be obvious from the element itself and or which may have special meaning to a user or a subset of users. In contrast to tags categories typically create a hierarchical organization of a catalog of elements and are often created and or managed by an entity such as but not limited to the operator of an electronic catalog. Thus a tag page may include information about elements categories or other aggregated information that has been associated with a given user generated tag.

For illustrative purposes forums are often described below in the context of an item catalog offered by a retailer. However it should be appreciated that the described systems and methods for determining user interest in an element or category may be implemented in other contexts. For example instead of items in an electronic catalog the elements could be social profiles news articles books photos abstract topics etc.

The illustrative operating environment shown in includes a system in which users may place orders for one or more items as well as view and or participate in discussions with other users. The system may include a ranking server that includes a score module for determining interest in and or popularity of items or categories of items. The environment also includes a retail server that facilitates electronic browsing and purchasing of goods and services using various user devices such as computing device . Those skilled in the art will recognize that the computing device may be any of a number of computing devices that are capable of communicating over a network including but not limited to a laptop personal computer personal digital assistant PDA hybrid PDA mobile phone mobile phone electronic book reader digital media player tablet and the like. The ranking server which will be described below in more detail may be connected to or in communication with a discussion data store that stores discussion information which may include text images video or other content corresponding to various forums. Each forum may include multiple discussions with each discussion including one or more user posts. As discussed above a forum may be associated with an item a category a tag a community etc. The ranking server may also be connected to or in communication with an item data store that stores information associated with items available for purchase through retail server and or items for which information is available to users but which are not currently available to be ordered. In some embodiments purchasing an item may include physically obtaining the item downloading an electronic version of the item renting or leasing a copy of the item and or providing streaming access to the item. Item data stored in item data store may include any information related to an item that may be of interest to a user or may be useful for classifying the item. For example item data may include but is not limited to price availability title item identifier item feedback e.g. user reviews ratings etc. item image item description item attributes tags associated with the item etc.

In different embodiments discussion data store and or item data store may be local to ranking server may be local to retail server maybe be remote from both ranking server and retail server and or may be a network based service itself. In the environment shown in a user of the system may utilize computing device to communicate with the retail server via a communication network such as the Internet or other communications link. The network may be any wired network wireless network or combination thereof. In addition the network may be a personal area network local area network wide area network cable network satellite network cellular telephone network etc. or combination thereof. Protocols and components for communicating via the Internet or any of the other aforementioned types of communication networks are well known to those skilled in the art of computer communications and thus need not be described in more detail herein.

The system is depicted in as operating in a distributed computer environment comprising several computer systems that are interconnected using one or more computer networks. The system could also operate within a computer system having a fewer or greater number of components than are illustrated in . Thus the depiction of system in should be taken as illustrative and not limiting to the present disclosure. For example the system could implement various Web services components and peer to peer network configurations to implement at least a portion of the processes.

In brief the retail server is generally responsible for providing front end communication with various user devices such as computing device via network . The front end communication provided by the retail server may include generating text and or graphics possibly organized as a user interface using hypertext transfer or other protocols in response to information inquiries received from the various user devices. The retail server may obtain information on available goods and services referred to herein as items from one or more data stores not illustrated as is done in conventional electronic commerce systems. In certain embodiments the retail server may also access item data from other data sources either internal or external to system .

The memory contains computer program instructions that the processing unit executes in order to implement one or more embodiments. The memory generally includes RAM ROM and or other persistent or non transitory memory. The memory may store an operating system that provides computer program instructions for use by the processing unit in the general administration and operation of the ranking server . The memory may further include computer program instructions and other information for implementing aspects of the present disclosure. For example in one embodiment the memory includes a user interface module that generates user interfaces and or instructions therefor for display upon a computing device e.g. via a navigation interface such as a web browser installed on the computing device. In addition memory may include or communicate with one or more auxiliary data stores such as discussion data store and item data store .

In addition to the user interface module the memory may include a score module that may be executed by the processing unit . In one embodiment the score module implements various aspects of the present disclosure e.g. determining interest criteria and interest scores for an item or category as described further below. While the score module is shown in as part of the ranking server in other embodiments all or a portion of a score module may be a part of the retail server . For example in certain embodiments of the present disclosure the retail server may include several components that operate similarly to the components illustrated as part of the ranking server including a user interface module score module processing unit computer readable medium drive etc. In such embodiments the retail server may communicate with a discussion data store and item data store such as discussion data store and item data store and the ranking server may not be needed in certain embodiments. Further although certain examples are illustrated herein in the context of a retail server this is not a limitation on the systems and methods described herein. For example various embodiments of the systems and methods for generating interest ranking information for an item or category of items can be used outside of the retail context.

As illustrated in the method begins at block and then proceeds to block where the score module determines one or more forums associated with the item or category. The forums may be retrieved from a data store such as discussion data store . In some embodiments forums may additionally be retrieved from a third party source such as a discussion forum accessible from a server operated by another retailer. In some embodiments the score module may receive an indication of a particular item or category for which the score module should determine an interest score. In other embodiments the score module may determine interest scores for all items and or categories stored in item data store or a subset of the stored items or categories on a regular basis such as hourly daily weekly etc. or in response to predetermined triggering events. As discussed above an item may be associated with one or more discussion forums specific to the item. For example a video game system may have a discussion forum dedicated to the subject of the actual system itself as well as a general forum related to the subject of games available to be played on that system. Similarly a category may be associated with one or more discussion forums specific to the category. For example a Televisions category may be associated with a category forum in which users can discuss televisions generally. In addition the Televisions category may include a variety of sub categories such as Plasma Televisions which may each be associated with one or more forums. In some embodiments each forum associated with a sub category may be determined to be a forum associated with the category at block . In other embodiments only forums specifically associated with the category to be scored are determined to be associated forums at block . In some embodiments forums associated with sub categories and or related items or categories may be considered during score aggregation discussed below in reference to block .

At block the score module determines interest criteria associated with the item or category based at least in part on posts in the one or more associated or related forums that were determined at block . The interest criteria may broadly include for example the number of posts in the one or more related forums the number of users posting in the one or more related forums and or other criteria. Determining interest criteria is discussed in more detail below in reference to .

Once the score module has determined interest criteria for the given item or category discussed below in reference to the score module determines at block an initial interest score based on the interest criteria. In some embodiments the initial interest score may be determined based on one or more of the interest criteria discussed below in reference to such as by applying weights to one or more of the interest criteria. For example in an embodiment in which the interest criteria includes the number of posts in related forums and the number of unique users that have posted in related forums the score module may determine an initial interest score by multiplying both the number of posts in related forums and the number of unique users that have posted in related forums by predefined weights then adding the resulting totals. As discussed below in reference to one or more of the interest criteria may be decayed over time and or be constrained to user activity that occurs in a certain period of time for example the past week .

Once an initial interest score has been determined the score module may normalize the initial interest score at block . For example the score module may normalize the interest score to reflect the relative interest level in the given item or category based on the interest levels associated with other similar or related items or categories. In some embodiments the score module may determine a baseline user activity level in a category of items associated with the given item and normalize the initial interest score determined at block based on this baseline activity level. Normalization in this regard may be desirable for example if a given item that is associated with a relatively large amount of customer buzz as compared to other similar items happens to be associated with a relatively small audience. In this manner normalization may allow for a more accurate comparison of interest scores of items associated with different categories rather than having items in the most popular categories with a wide customer base dominate overall item interest rankings.

In other embodiments the score module may normalize the initial interest score without regard to interest scores or activity levels associated with related items or categories. For example the score module may normalize the initial interest score based on the number of users that have viewed information related to the item such as may be displayed on an item detail page e.g. a page that includes information associated with an item such as price description a photo etc. . The score module may for example normalize the initial interest score by dividing the initial interest score by the number of times that users have viewed a page associated with the item or category the number of unique users that have viewed such a page the number of users that have viewed discussions in the related forums determined at block etc.

At block the score module may aggregate interest scores for related items or categories. For example once the score module determines the interest score for a given item the score module may aggregate interest scores of all or a subset of items in the same category and or otherwise associated with or similar to the item. Similarly once the score module determines the interest score for a given category such as a category that is a subset of a larger category the score module may aggregate interest scores of all or a subset of other related categories or subcategories. For example when the score module generates an interest score for a given book the score module may aggregate that interest score with interest scores associated with other books by the same author other books in the same series other books in the same genre and or other items or categories. In this manner an interest score associated with the given book may also affect an interest score associated with the author of the book for example. In other embodiments an item s interest score may be combined or aggregated with items that are different versions of the same underlying work such as the hardcover and paperback versions of the same book. As another example when the score module generates an interest score for a category of ABC Company s Plasma Televisions the score module may aggregate that interest score with interest scores associated with other companies plasma televisions other television categories other items associated with the given company and or other items or categories. Depending on the embodiment an interest score may be determined for a given category such as a given company s products based on either or both of an interest score generated for the company itself such as by determining interest criteria based on forums associated with the company and or an aggregated interest score based on a plurality of interest scores determined for items associated with the company such as products manufactured by the company .

In some embodiments one or more filters may be applied based on how many items are associated with a given category prior to aggregating items within that category. For example it may be determined that aggregation should not be performed in a category with a relatively large number of items as this may indicate that the items are not as closely related as items in a more narrowly focused category. In some embodiments the score module may separately store in one or more data stores the interest score for the individual item or category as well as the aggregated interest score determined at block . In yet other embodiments the individual item s interest score may be compared with the various aggregated interest scores in order to determine for example the extent to which interest or buzz associated with a category may be attributed to interest or buzz associated with that particular item within the category. Once the score module optionally aggregates the interest scores the illustrated method ends at block .

At block the score module may determine the average number of replies to a post in the one or more forums related to the item or category. A reply may generally be considered any post responsive to an earlier post in a forum. A relatively high average number of replies per post may be indicative of interest in the item or category for example because it indicates that users are actively engaging in discussion regarding the item or category. At block the score module may determine the number of unique users who have posted in the one or more forums related to the item or category. For example a forum with a high number of unique users posting in the forum may be more indicative of a high general user interest level in the item or category than a forum with the same number of total posts but with fewer users posting which could occur for example if two users engage in a lengthy multi post discussion with each other .

At block the score module may analyze user feedback regarding posts in the one or more forums related to the item or category. For example in some embodiments users presented with posts in a forum may be presented with selectable options to vote or otherwise indicate whether a given post or response added to the discussion e.g. whether the post was helpful such as illustrated in discussed below.

At block the score module may analyze the sentiment of posts in the one or more forums related to the item or category. Sentiment analysis may include a broad range of natural language processing computational linguistics and or text mining techniques that generally aim to determine the attitude of the posting user. For example an excited sentiment in a post may indicate the user s interest in the associated item or category. In some embodiments however a generally negative sentiment in a relatively high percentage of posts in a forum may still indicate a high interest or buzz in an associated item. For example if the item is a political book a lively discussion may occur that includes many posts that disagree with the book s content but that nonetheless reflect general interest or buzz related to the book.

At block the score module may determine the number of item reviews of the given item or items within the given category received from users. For example in some embodiments user reviews may be stored separately from discussion forum data. An example user review is discussed below in reference to . In some embodiments a large number of reviews for a given item may be indicative of user interest in the item.

At block the score module may determine the number of times that the given item or category has been selected by a user. For example the score module may determine the number of times that a user has selected to view item information associated with the item such as the number of times that an item detail page associated with the item has been requested by or shown to a user.

At block the score module may apply a decay factor to one or more of the interest criteria discussed above with reference to blocks . For example one or more of the interest criteria may be decayed over time and or be constrained to user activity that occurs in a certain period of time for example the past day week month etc. . In some embodiments for example a decay factor may be applied when determining one or more of the interest criteria such that the relative weight of a given post reply or review is effectively lowered over time. In some embodiments the decay may occur at a rate similar to a half life such that after a certain amount of time a post is effectively accorded half of its original value and then a quarter of the original value after twice that amount of time. In yet other embodiments a simple rate of posts responses or reviews may be determined such as by dividing the total number of posts by the amount of time over which the posts occurred rather than applying a decay factor. Moreover multiple rankings may be determined using different decay rates such as one ranking of items that have a high level of interest in recent days and another ranking for items with a sustained interest or buzz over a longer period. Once the interest criteria have been determined and any decay factors have optionally been applied to the interest criteria the illustrated method ends at block .

The method begins at block then proceeds to block where the ranking server determines an interest score for each item or category to be ranked such as may be determined based on the methods discussed above in reference to . If the ranking server is ranking items the items to be ranked may be for example the items in a certain category such as all televisions or all electronics. If the ranking server is ranking categories the categories to be ranked may be for example all categories that belong to the same larger category e.g. all subcategories within a category may be ranked in order to determine the most popular subcategories within the given category .

At block the ranking server may determine a sales score for each item or category to be ranked. The sales score for an item may be retrieved from a data store or may be determined by the ranking server based on item purchase data retrieved from a data store. The sales score may generally represent depending on the embodiment the quantity of items sold and or the total revenue generated from sales of the item. In some embodiments sales data may be decayed over time in a manner similar to the decay that may be applied to interest criteria discussed above. In the case of categories the sales score may represent a combined total or combined average of sales of items that belong to the category.

At block the ranking server may apply weights to the interest scores and sales scores of the items or categories to be ranked. For example a predefined weight may be applied to each score such as weighting the sales score as 80 of the popularity score for a given item or category and the interest score as 20 of the popularity score. In some embodiments the weights applied may depend on the category being ranked. As mentioned above in other embodiments the popularity ranking may be determined based on only one of the popularity score or the interest score. In some embodiments separate rankings may be determined for interest sales and or popularity where the popularity ranking may be a combination of the interest and sales rankings .

At block the ranking server may sort the items or categories to be ranked based on the determined scores. For example the ranking server may sort the items or categories to be ranked in descending order of popularity score thereby creating an ordered list of the most popular items or categories among those ranked. The ranking server may then generate for display information identifying the highest scoring items or categories such as the top X items or categories where X may be predetermined by the ranking server or specified by a user. An example user interface displaying ranking information is discussed below in reference to . Once the ranking server has sorted the items or categories and generated for display information identifying the highest scoring items or categories the illustrated method ends at block .

While ranking information is shown in as presented for display as a ranked list in some embodiments ranking information may have a variety of other applications. For example the retail server may recommend popular items to users such as via a user interface or electronic mail. As another example the retail server may notify users that a popular item has been released in a category in which the user has expressed interest in or previously purchased items.
