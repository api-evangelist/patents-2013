The United States Patent Office USPTO has published a notice to the effect that the USPTO s computer programs require that patent applicants reference both a serial number and indicate whether an application is a continuation continuation in part or divisional of a parent application. Stephen G. Kunin Benefit of Prior Filed Application USPTO Official Gazette Mar. 18 2003. The USPTO further has provided forms for the Application Data Sheet which allow automatic loading of bibliographic data but which require identification of each application as a continuation continuation in part or divisional of a parent application. The present Applicant Entity hereinafter Applicant has provided above a specific reference to the application s from which priority is being claimed as recited by statute. Applicant understands that the statute is unambiguous in its specific reference language and does not require either a serial number or any characterization such as continuation or continuation in part for claiming priority to U.S. patent applications. Notwithstanding the foregoing Applicant understands that the USPTO s computer programs have certain data entry requirements and hence Applicant has provided designation s of a relationship between the present application and its parent application s as set forth above and in any ADS filed in this application but expressly points out that such designation s are not to be construed in any way as any type of commentary and or admission as to whether or not the present application contains any new matter in addition to the matter of its parent application s .

If the listings of applications provided above are inconsistent with the listings provided via an ADS it is the intent of the Applicant to claim priority to each application that appears in the Priority Applications section of the ADS and to each application that appears in the Priority Applications section of this application.

All subject matter of the Priority Applications and the Related Applications and of any and all parent grandparent great grandparent etc. applications of the Priority Applications and the Related Applications including any priority claims is incorporated herein by reference to the extent such subject matter is not inconsistent herewith.

If an Application Data Sheet ADS has been filed on the filing date of this application it is incorporated by reference herein. Any applications claimed on the ADS for priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 120 121 or 365 c and any and all parent grandparent great grandparent etc. applications of such applications are also incorporated by reference including any priority claims made in those applications and any material incorporated by reference to the extent such subject matter is not inconsistent herewith.

Under the auspices of various alleged rules implementing the America Invents Act AIA the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO is purporting to require that an Attorney for a Client make various legal and or factual statements commentaries admissions e.g. Concerning any Statement under 37 CFR 1.55 or 1.78 for AIA First Inventor to File Transition Application related to written description new matter and or advise his Client to make such legal and or factual statements commentaries admissions. Attorney expressly points out that the burden of both alleging that an application contains new matter with respect to its parent s and establishing a prima facie case of lack of written description under 35 U.S.C. 112 first paragraph lies firmly on the USPTO. Accordingly and expressly in view of duties owed his client Attorney further points out that the AIA legislation while referencing the first to file does not appear to constitute enabling legislation that would empower the USPTO to compel an Attorney to either make advise such legal and or factual statements commentaries admissions. Notwithstanding the foregoing Attorney Applicant understand that the USPTO s computer programs personnel have certain data entry requirements and hence Attorney Applicant have provided a designation s of a relationship between the present application and its parent application s as set forth herein and in any ADS filed in this application but expressly points out that such designation s are not to be construed in any way as any type of commentary and or admission as to whether or not a claim in the present application is supported by a parent application or whether or not the present application contains any new matter in addition to the matter of its parent application s in general and or especially as such might relate to an effective filing date before on or after 16 Mar. 2013.

Insofar that the Attorney Applicant may have made certain statements in view of practical data entry requirements of the USPTO should NOT be taken as an admission of any sort. Attorney Applicant hereby reserves any and all rights to contest contradict confirm such statements at a later time. Furthermore no waiver legal factual or otherwise implicit or explicit is hereby intended e.g. with respect to any statements admissions made by the Attorney Applicant in response to the purported requirements of the USPTO related to the relationship between the present application and parent application s and or regarding new matter or alleged new matter relative to the parent application s . For example although not expressly stated and possibly despite a designation of the present application as a continuation in part of a parent application Attorney Applicant may later assert that the present application or one or more of its claims do not contain any new matter in addition to the matter of its parent application s or vice versa.

In addition to the foregoing various other method and or system and or program product aspects are set forth and described in the teachings such as text e.g. claims and or detailed description and or drawings of the present disclosure. The foregoing is a summary and thus may contain simplifications generalizations inclusions and or omissions of detail consequently those skilled in the art will appreciate that the summary is illustrative only and is NOT intended to be in any way limiting. Other aspects features and advantages of the devices and or processes and or other subject matter described herein will become apparent in the teachings set forth below.

In the following detailed description reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof. In the drawings similar symbols typically identify similar or identical components or items unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description drawings and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here.

The present application uses formal outline headings for clarity of presentation. However it is to be understood that the outline headings are for presentation purposes and that different types of subject matter may be discussed throughout the application e.g. device s structure s may be described under process es operations heading s and or process es operations may be discussed under structure s process es headings and or descriptions of single topics may span two or more topic headings . Hence the use of the formal outline headings is not intended to be in any way limiting.

Throughout this application examples and lists are given with parentheses the abbreviation e.g. or both. Unless explicitly otherwise stated these examples and lists are merely exemplary and are non exhaustive. In most cases it would be prohibitive to list every example and every combination. Thus smaller illustrative lists and examples are used with focus on imparting understanding of the claim terms rather than limiting the scope of such terms.

With respect to the use of substantially any plural and or singular terms herein those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and or application. The various singular plural permutations are not expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity.

One skilled in the art will recognize that the herein described components e.g. operations devices objects and the discussion accompanying them are used as examples for the sake of conceptual clarity and that various configuration modifications are contemplated. Consequently as used herein the specific exemplars set forth and the accompanying discussion are intended to be representative of their more general classes. In general use of any specific exemplar is intended to be representative of its class and the non inclusion of specific components e.g. operations devices and objects should not be taken limiting.

Those having skill in the art will recognize that the state of the art has progressed to the point where there is little distinction left between hardware software and or firmware implementations of aspects of systems the use of hardware software and or firmware is generally but not always in that in certain contexts the choice between hardware and software can become significant a design choice representing cost vs. efficiency tradeoffs. Those having skill in the art will appreciate that there are various vehicles by which processes and or systems and or other technologies described herein can be effected e.g. hardware software and or firmware and that the preferred vehicle will vary with the context in which the processes and or systems and or other technologies are deployed. For example if an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount the implementer may opt for a mainly hardware and or firmware vehicle alternatively if flexibility is paramount the implementer may opt for a mainly software implementation or yet again alternatively the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware software and or firmware in one or more machines compositions of matter and articles of manufacture limited to patentable subject matter under 35 USC 101. Hence there are several possible vehicles by which the processes and or devices and or other technologies described herein may be effected none of which is inherently superior to the other in that any vehicle to be utilized is a choice dependent upon the context in which the vehicle will be deployed and the specific concerns e.g. speed flexibility or predictability of the implementer any of which may vary. Those skilled in the art will recognize that optical aspects of implementations will typically employ optically oriented hardware software and or firmware.

In some implementations described herein logic and similar implementations may include software or other control structures. Electronic circuitry for example may have one or more paths of electrical current constructed and arranged to implement various functions as described herein. In some implementations one or more media may be configured to bear a device detectable implementation when such media hold or transmit device detectable instructions operable to perform as described herein. In some variants for example implementations may include an update or modification of existing software or firmware or of gate arrays or programmable hardware such as by performing a reception of or a transmission of one or more instructions in relation to one or more operations described herein. Alternatively or additionally in some variants an implementation may include special purpose hardware software firmware components and or general purpose components executing or otherwise invoking special purpose components. Specifications or other implementations may be transmitted by one or more instances of tangible transmission media as described herein optionally by packet transmission or otherwise by passing through distributed media at various times.

Alternatively or additionally implementations may include executing a special purpose instruction sequence or invoking circuitry for enabling triggering coordinating requesting or otherwise causing one or more occurrences of virtually any functional operation described herein. In some variants operational or other logical descriptions herein may be expressed as source code and compiled or otherwise invoked as an executable instruction sequence. In some contexts for example implementations may be provided in whole or in part by source code such as C or other code sequences. In other implementations source or other code implementation using commercially available and or techniques in the art may be compiled implemented translated converted into a high level descriptor language e.g. initially implementing described technologies in C or C programming language and thereafter converting the programming language implementation into a logic synthesizable language implementation a hardware description language implementation a hardware design simulation implementation and or other such similar mode s of expression . For example some or all of a logical expression e.g. computer programming language implementation may be manifested as a Verilog type hardware description e.g. via Hardware Description Language HDL and or Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Descriptor Language VHDL or other circuitry model which may then be used to create a physical implementation having hardware e.g. an Application Specific Integrated Circuit . Those skilled in the art will recognize how to obtain configure and optimize suitable transmission or computational elements material supplies actuators or other structures in light of these teachings.

The claims description and drawings of this application may describe one or more of the instant technologies in operational functional language for example as a set of operations to be performed by a computer. Such operational functional description in most instances would be understood by one skilled the art as specifically configured hardware e.g. because a general purpose computer in effect becomes a special purpose computer once it is programmed to perform particular functions pursuant to instructions from program software .

Importantly although the operational functional descriptions described herein are understandable by the human mind they are not abstract ideas of the operations functions divorced from computational implementation of those operations functions. Rather the operations functions represent a specification for massively complex computational machines or other means. As discussed in detail below the operational functional language must be read in its proper technological context i.e. as concrete specifications for physical implementations.

The logical operations functions described herein are a distillation of machine specifications or other physical mechanisms specified by the operations functions such that the otherwise inscrutable machine specifications may be comprehensible to a human reader. The distillation also allows one of skill in the art to adapt the operational functional description of the technology across many different specific vendors hardware configurations or platforms without being limited to specific vendors hardware configurations or platforms.

Some of the present technical description e.g. detailed description drawings claims etc. may be set forth in terms of logical operations functions. As described in more detail herein these logical operations functions are not representations of abstract ideas but rather are representative of static or sequenced specifications of various hardware elements. Differently stated unless context dictates otherwise the logical operations functions will be understood by those of skill in the art to be representative of static or sequenced specifications of various hardware elements. This is true because tools available to one of skill in the art to implement technical disclosures set forth in operational functional formats tools in the form of a high level programming language e.g. C java visual basic etc. or tools in the form of Very high speed Hardware Description Language VHDL which is a language that uses text to describe logic circuits are generators of static or sequenced specifications of various hardware configurations. This fact is sometimes obscured by the broad term software but as shown by the following explanation those skilled in the art understand that what is termed software is a shorthand for a massively complex interchaining specification of ordered matter elements. The term ordered matter elements may refer to physical components of computation such as assemblies of electronic logic gates molecular computing logic constituents quantum computing mechanisms etc.

For example a high level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction e.g. multiple levels of abstraction from the details of the sequential organizations states inputs outputs etc. of the machines that a high level programming language actually specifies. See e.g. Wikipedia High level programming language http en.wikipedia.org wiki High level programming language as of Jun. 5 2012 21 00 GMT . In order to facilitate human comprehension in many instances high level programming languages resemble or even share symbols with natural languages. See e.g. Wikipedia Natural language http en.wikipedia.org wiki Natural language as of Jun. 5 2012 21 00 GMT .

It has been argued that because high level programming languages use strong abstraction e.g. that they may resemble or share symbols with natural languages they are therefore a purely mental construct e.g. that software a computer program or computer programming is somehow an ineffable mental construct because at a high level of abstraction it can be conceived and understood by a human reader . This argument has been used to characterize technical description in the form of functions operations as somehow abstract ideas. In fact in technological arts e.g. the information and communication technologies this is not true.

The fact that high level programming languages use strong abstraction to facilitate human understanding should not be taken as an indication that what is expressed is an abstract idea. In fact those skilled in the art understand that just the opposite is true. If a high level programming language is the tool used to implement a technical disclosure in the form of functions operations those skilled in the art will recognize that far from being abstract imprecise fuzzy or mental in any significant semantic sense such a tool is instead a near incomprehensibly precise sequential specification of specific computational machines the parts of which are built up by activating selecting such parts from typically more general computational machines over time e.g. clocked time . This fact is sometimes obscured by the superficial similarities between high level programming languages and natural languages. These superficial similarities also may cause a glossing over of the fact that high level programming language implementations ultimately perform valuable work by creating controlling many different computational machines.

The many different computational machines that a high level programming language specifies are almost unimaginably complex. At base the hardware used in the computational machines typically consists of some type of ordered matter e.g. traditional electronic devices e.g. transistors deoxyribonucleic acid DNA quantum devices mechanical switches optics fluidics pneumatics optical devices e.g. optical interference devices molecules etc. that are arranged to form logic gates. Logic gates are typically physical devices that may be electrically mechanically chemically or otherwise driven to change physical state in order to create a physical reality of logic such as Boolean logic.

Logic gates may be arranged to form logic circuits which are typically physical devices that may be electrically mechanically chemically or otherwise driven to create a physical reality of certain logical functions. Types of logic circuits include such devices as multiplexers registers arithmetic logic units ALUs computer memory etc. each type of which may be combined to form yet other types of physical devices such as a central processing unit CPU the best known of which is the microprocessor. A modern microprocessor will often contain more than one hundred million logic gates in its many logic circuits and often more than a billion transistors . See e.g. Wikipedia Logic gates http en.wikipedia.org wiki Logic gates as of Jun. 5 2012 21 03 GMT .

The logic circuits forming the microprocessor are arranged to provide a microarchitecture that will carry out the instructions defined by that microprocessor s defined Instruction Set Architecture. The Instruction Set Architecture is the part of the microprocessor architecture related to programming including the native data types instructions registers addressing modes memory architecture interrupt and exception handling and external Input Output. See e.g. Wikipedia Computer architecture http en.wikipedia.org wiki Computer architecture as of Jun. 5 2012 21 03 GMT .

The Instruction Set Architecture includes a specification of the machine language that can be used by programmers to use control the microprocessor. Since the machine language instructions are such that they may be executed directly by the microprocessor typically they consist of strings of binary digits or bits. For example a typical machine language instruction might be many bits long e.g. 32 64 or 128 bit strings are currently common . A typical machine language instruction might take the form 11110000101011110000111100111111 a 32 bit instruction .

It is significant here that although the machine language instructions are written as sequences of binary digits in actuality those binary digits specify physical reality. For example if certain semiconductors are used to make the operations of Boolean logic a physical reality the apparently mathematical bits 1 and 0 in a machine language instruction actually constitute a shorthand that specifies the application of specific voltages to specific wires. For example in some semiconductor technologies the binary number 1 e.g. logical 1 in a machine language instruction specifies around 5 volts applied to a specific wire e.g. metallic traces on a printed circuit board and the binary number 0 e.g. logical 0 in a machine language instruction specifies around 5 volts applied to a specific wire. In addition to specifying voltages of the machines configurations such machine language instructions also select out and activate specific groupings of logic gates from the millions of logic gates of the more general machine. Thus far from abstract mathematical expressions machine language instruction programs even though written as a string of zeros and ones specify many many constructed physical machines or physical machine states.

Machine language is typically incomprehensible by most humans e.g. the above example was just ONE instruction and some personal computers execute more than two billion instructions every second . See e.g. Wikipedia Instructions per second http en.wikipedia.org wiki Instructions per second as of Jun. 5 2012 21 04 GMT . Thus programs written in machine language which may be tens of millions of machine language instructions long are incomprehensible to most humans. In view of this early assembly languages were developed that used mnemonic codes to refer to machine language instructions rather than using the machine language instructions numeric values directly e.g. for performing a multiplication operation programmers coded the abbreviation mult which represents the binary number 011000 in MIPS machine code . While assembly languages were initially a great aid to humans controlling the microprocessors to perform work in time the complexity of the work that needed to be done by the humans outstripped the ability of humans to control the microprocessors using merely assembly languages.

At this point it was noted that the same tasks needed to be done over and over and the machine language necessary to do those repetitive tasks was the same. In view of this compilers were created. A compiler is a device that takes a statement that is more comprehensible to a human than either machine or assembly language such as add 2 2 and output the result and translates that human understandable statement into a complicated tedious and immense machine language code e.g. millions of 32 64 or 4128 bit length strings . Compilers thus translate high level programming language into machine language.

This compiled machine language as described above is then used as the technical specification which sequentially constructs and causes the interoperation of many different computational machines such that useful tangible and concrete work is done. For example as indicated above such machine language the compiled version of the higher level language functions as a technical specification which selects out hardware logic gates specifies voltage levels voltage transition timings etc. such that the useful work is accomplished by the hardware.

Thus a functional operational technical description when viewed by one of skill in the art is far from an abstract idea. Rather such a functional operational technical description when understood through the tools available in the art such as those just described is instead understood to be a humanly understandable representation of a hardware specification the complexity and specificity of which far exceeds the comprehension of most any one human. With this in mind those skilled in the art will understand that any such operational functional technical descriptions in view of the disclosures herein and the knowledge of those skilled in the art may be understood as operations made into physical reality by a one or more interchained physical machines b interchained logic gates configured to create one or more physical machine s representative of sequential combinatorial logic s c interchained ordered matter making up logic gates e.g. interchained electronic devices e.g. transistors DNA quantum devices mechanical switches optics fluidics pneumatics molecules etc. that create physical reality of logic s or d virtually any combination of the foregoing. Indeed any physical object which has a stable measurable and changeable state may be used to construct a machine based on the above technical description. Charles Babbage for example constructed the first mechanized computational apparatus out of wood with the apparatus powered by cranking a handle.

Thus far from being understood as an abstract idea those skilled in the art will recognize a functional operational technical description as a humanly understandable representation of one or more almost unimaginably complex and time sequenced hardware instantiations. The fact that functional operational technical descriptions might lend themselves readily to high level computing languages or high level block diagrams for that matter that share some words structures phrases etc. with natural language should not be taken as an indication that such functional operational technical descriptions are abstract ideas or mere expressions of abstract ideas. In fact as outlined herein in the technological arts this is simply not true. When viewed through the tools available to those of skill in the art such functional operational technical descriptions are seen as specifying hardware configurations of almost unimaginable complexity.

As outlined above the reason for the use of functional operational technical descriptions is at least twofold. First the use of functional operational technical descriptions allows near infinitely complex machines and machine operations arising from interchained hardware elements to be described in a manner that the human mind can process e.g. by mimicking natural language and logical narrative flow . Second the use of functional operational technical descriptions assists the person of skill in the art in understanding the described subject matter by providing a description that is more or less independent of any specific vendor s piece s of hardware.

The use of functional operational technical descriptions assists the person of skill in the art in understanding the described subject matter since as is evident from the above discussion one could easily although not quickly transcribe the technical descriptions set forth in this document as trillions of ones and zeroes billions of single lines of assembly level machine code millions of logic gates thousands of gate arrays or any number of intermediate levels of abstractions. However if any such low level technical descriptions were to replace the present technical description a person of skill in the art could encounter undue difficulty in implementing the disclosure because such a low level technical description would likely add complexity without a corresponding benefit e.g. by describing the subject matter utilizing the conventions of one or more vendor specific pieces of hardware . Thus the use of functional operational technical descriptions assists those of skill in the art by separating the technical descriptions from the conventions of any vendor specific piece of hardware.

In view of the foregoing the logical operations functions set forth in the present technical description are representative of static or sequenced specifications of various ordered matter elements in order that such specifications may be comprehensible to the human mind and adaptable to create many various hardware configurations. The logical operations functions disclosed herein should be treated as such and should not be disparagingly characterized as abstract ideas merely because the specifications they represent are presented in a manner that one of skill in the art can readily understand and apply in a manner independent of a specific vendor s hardware implementation.

Those skilled in the art will recognize that it is common within the art to implement devices and or processes and or systems and thereafter use engineering and or other practices to integrate such implemented devices and or processes and or systems into more comprehensive devices and or processes and or systems.

In certain cases use of a system or method may occur in a territory even if components are located outside the territory. For example in a distributed computing context use of a distributed computing system may occur in a territory even though parts of the system may be located outside of the territory e.g. relay server processor signal bearing medium transmitting computer receiving computer etc. located outside the territory .

A sale of a system or method may likewise occur in a territory even if components of the system or method are located and or used outside the territory. Further implementation of at least part of a system for performing a method in one territory does not preclude use of the system in another territory

The proliferation of automation in many transactions is apparent. For example Automated Teller Machines ATMs dispense money and receive deposits. Airline ticket counter machines check passengers in dispense tickets and allow passengers to change or upgrade flights. Train and subway ticket counter machines allow passengers to purchase a ticket to a particular destination without invoking a human interaction at all. Many groceries and pharmacies have self service checkout machines which allow a consumer to pay for goods purchased by interacting only with a machine. Large companies now staff telephone answering systems with machines that interact with customers and invoke a human in the transaction only if there is a problem with the machine facilitated transaction.

Nevertheless as such automation increases convenience and accessibility may decrease. Self checkout machines at grocery stores may be difficult to operate. ATMs and ticket counter machines may be mostly inaccessible to disabled persons or persons requiring special access. Where before the interaction with a human would allow disabled persons to complete transactions with relative ease if a disabled person is unable to push the buttons on an ATM there is little the machine can do to facilitate the transaction to completion. While some of these public terminals allow speech operations they are configured to the most generic forms of speech which may be less useful in recognizing particular speakers thereby leading to frustration for users attempting to speak to the machine. This problem may be especially challenging for the disabled who already may face significant challenges in completing transactions with automated machines.

In addition smartphones and tablet devices also now are configured to receive speech commands. Speech and voice controlled automobile systems now appear regularly in motor vehicles even in economical mass produced vehicles. Home entertainment devices e.g. disc players televisions radios stereos and the like may respond to speech commands. Additionally home security systems may respond to speech commands. In an office setting a worker s computer may respond to speech from that worker allowing faster more efficient work flows. Such systems and machines may be trained to operate with particular users either through explicit training or through repeated interactions. Nevertheless when that system is upgraded or replaced e.g. a new television is purchased that training may be lost with the device. Thus in some embodiments described herein adaptation data for speech recognition systems may be separated from the device which recognizes the speech and may be more closely associated with a user e.g. through a device carried by the user or through a network location associated with the user.

Further in some environments there may be more than one device that transmits and receives data within a range of interacting with a user. For example merely sitting on a couch watching television may involve five or more devices e.g. a television a cable box an audio visual receiver a remote control and a smartphone device. Some of these devices may transmit or receive speech data. Some of these devices may transmit receive or store adaptation data as will be described in more detail herein. Thus in some embodiments which will be described in more detail herein there may be methods systems and devices for determining which devices in a system should perform actions that allow a user to efficiently interact with an intended device through that user s speech.

With reference now to there is shown a system comprising an apparatus in which one or more technologies may be implemented. Apparatus may include one or more instances of account update modules each configured to allocate or otherwise handle cost components of service configuration modules configured to establish or update one or more routes a bidirectional interpersonal communication or other signal path via which one or more messages or other communication services are implemented e.g. of account configuration modules of cohort identification modules of service request handling modules of initiation modules of response modules of allocation modules of detection modules of input modules of interface modules of notification modules of registration modules or aggregation modules as described below.

With reference now to there is shown a system in or across which one or more instances of apparatus or its components may be instantiated in subsystems or mobile devices described below e.g. and in which one or more technologies may be implemented. comprises a grid of 4 sheets by 6 sheets the grid being summarized in a legend in . shows a partially schematic diagram of an environment s and or an implementation s of technologies described herein. It is noted that is a high level environment diagram. As such some elements of the system of are expressed through the function they carry out. In such circumstances these elements should be considered to include any combination of one or more program microprocessor configuration state machine transistor based event sequencing structure firmware field programmable gate array FPGA configuration application programming interface API function class data structure dynamically loaded library DLL database e.g. SQL database or other such special purpose modules implemented in a structure or method eligible for patent protection under 35 U.S.C. 101.

U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 317 989 Context sensitive query enrichment describes search protocols that are useful in a context of smartphones or similar mobile devices implementing wireless communication. As described with reference to thereof and also to herein handheld interface device permits a user to carry or otherwise support the device as shown while extending one or more of his fingers or arms into a space where such limb can be detected optically e.g. by the device . Moreover the user can effectively use one or more such limbs to indicate a three dimensional region containing one or more elements of interest to the user on a poster within sight of the user s facial region e.g. . In some implementations device also includes one or more microphones or other sensors operable to capture one or more expressions in sounds in region e.g. . Alternatively or additionally one or more networks are operably coupled with device via access point and network interface e.g. so that a face character sequence or other search pattern expressed digitally e.g. can be downloaded or recognized e.g. in optical data from one or more sensors . In some contexts as described below this permits one or more modules described herein implementing one or more instances of a dialog manager in device or network e.g. to estimate a location of one or more regions limbs visible elements or other such entities relative to one or more reference positions .

With reference now to FIG. 18 of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 317 989 shown there is a high level logic flow that includes recognizing a position of a first limb of a person in relation to a facial region of the person and to a three dimensional region indicated by the first limb of the person the three dimensional region including a first informational element e.g. an estimation module assigning two or more coordinates signaling a location of the person s finger hand or arm in relation to a stationary or other frame of reference that can also signal respective locations of a facial region of the person and a 3D region that includes one or more informational elements . This can occur for example in a context in which the 3D region is farther than the arm in relation to the facial region of the person and in which the estimation module uses standard positioning coordinates GPS with altitude e.g. or some other frame of reference in relation to which facial region and 3D region can be mathematically expressed. In some variants for example a handheld device may include a first optical sensor configured to capture first optical data an image e.g. positionally related to one or more reference positions located in device or facial region or some other frame of reference e.g. and a second optical sensor configured to capture second optical data another image e.g. positionally related to the same reference position s contemporaneously therewith within a few seconds e.g. . This can occur for example in a context in which first optical data indicates an approximate position of the facial region of the person in relation to device e.g. and in which second optical data indicates an approximate position of one or more elements in a 3D region toward which the person gestures with a finger or arm e.g. . In some variants such an estimation module can perform this function using optical data obtained from only a single optical sensor . This can occur for example in a context in which device is configured to be worn or held in facial region establishing a reference position in the facial region. More generally a limb position is known in relation to another entity an item or region e.g. if each is assigned a specific location expressed in coordinates or a natural language expression e.g. in a frame of reference common to both.

The logic flow also includes transmitting a search result relating to the first informational element and partly based on first auditory data from a vicinity of the person and partly based on the position of the first limb of the person in relation to the facial region of the person and to the three dimensional region indicated by the first limb of the person e.g. a statement module transmitting a result of a search task resulting from a search pattern that includes a face or character sequence obtained from visible elements of the user s environment in response to auditory data from the same environment and to the region indicated by the finger hand or arm . This can occur for example in a context in which the user s vicinity region e.g. defines the environment in which the auditory data and one or more visible elements are both captured respectively via microphone and optical sensor e.g. in the same device in which the indicated region or auditory data may each trigger an exclusion or inclusion of one or more candidate elements and in which search pattern would otherwise have to be constructed by a more laborious process. In some contexts for example the auditory data may include a corroboratory expression relating to one element e.g. an utterance of face or Smith or guy or who . Alternatively or additionally in some contexts the auditory data may include timing data signaling that an audible event was detected while the user apparently looked at the first informational element. When implemented in conjunction with a cost shifting or other mobile connectivity facilitation protocol as described herein the flow in FIG. 18 of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 317 989 permits a cellular subscriber and another device user with a mobile device that does not have an established cellular communications subscription account associated therewith e.g. to establish or maintain modes of communication service phone connections e.g. that permit collaborative investigation that would not otherwise exist. This can occur for example in a context in which device participates in a delivery of messages search task descriptions or results e.g. or other communication services as a cellular subscriber s device e.g. as described below.

With reference now to there is shown a user straddling a zone boundary separating a wireless local area network WLAN zone including a smartphone or similar device able to use Wi Fi e.g. from a cell only zone including a handheld device that cannot presently access any Wi Fi hotspot but can communicate via a cellular network e.g. . Device includes several externally visible features speakers and cameras e.g. and several internal features an integrated circuit having one or more memories and one or more special purpose modules manufactured or otherwise configured to provide features described herein. In the interest of concision and according to standard usage in communication technologies such features are set forth in natural language expressions. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that such expressions functions or acts recited in English e.g. adequately describe structures identified below so that no undue experimentation will be required for their implementation. For example any records or other informational data identified herein may easily be represented digitally as a voltage configuration on one or more electrical nodes pads e.g. of an event sequencing structure transistor based circuitry on an integrated circuit e.g. without any undue experimentation.

With reference now to there is shown a base transceiver station BTS wirelessly coupled to device and also to device . Device a handheld device or passenger vehicle or communication satellite e.g. includes one or more subscriber identity modules SIMs frequency hopping modules transmitter receiver modules channel management modules signal processing modules user interfaces encoders and decoders . Except as noted mobile wireless communication devices and subsystems depicted herein each include most or all of these components. In some cases such components SIMs e.g. may be readily removable or reconfigurable as described herein.

With reference now to there is shown a base station controller BSC operably coupled through a fiberoptic conduit e.g. with BTS . To facilitate control of one or more BTS s as shown BSC may include one or more channel allocation modules signal timing modules and handover modules . BTS and BSC may typically be subsystems of a network operated by a cellular service provider Verizon e.g. .

With reference now to there are shown a plurality of access points operably coupled via a wireless linkage e.g. with and controlled by a switch . Each such access point may be implemented as a wireless router for example through which mobile devices may access a network the Internet e.g. .

With reference now to there is shown another user also operating a handheld device . In some contexts as described below device may initiate a communication service telephone call e.g. or may indicate its location via access point . Also as described below device may likewise initiate a communication service or may indicate its present location via a cellular network including BTS e.g. . In either case or both many such users may continually report indications of changes in service availability to one or more access map servers that aggregate such status data into regional service maps segments of which may then be provided selectively to devices in locations corresponding thereto.

With reference now to there is shown a base station controller BSC configured to control BTS . It comprises one or more instances of channel allocation modules signal timing modules and handover modules configured to facilitate operations described herein.

With reference now to there is shown a mobile switching center MSC including one or more instances of authentication centers equipment identity registers home location registers and visitor location registers . Such components of MSC are each configured to interact with one or more instances of BSC to facilitate operations as described herein.

With reference now to there is shown a subscriber database implemented within or otherwise operably coupled with MSC . Subscriber database includes numerous records for example associating each device identified as a field labeled Cust ID e.g. with a monthly allocation of minutes corresponding to a plan that the subscriber pays for with a balance of remaining minutes available to that customer or device and with an indicator of a remaining duration in days e.g. until a replenishment of the balance will be applied.

With reference now to there is shown a network having one or more instance of channel establishment subsystems channel adaptation subsystems public switched packet data network PSPDN subsystems public switched telephone network PSTN subsystems or communication satellites . Those skilled in the art will understand a variety of configurations of such networks and devices satellite phones or radios e.g. served by them.

With reference now to there are shown one or more instances of network interfaces suitable for facilitating an interaction between network and WLAN access points via switch e.g. . In some instances such network interfaces include one or more instances of firewalls or high speed modems .

With reference now to users in a free ride zone accessible by a cellular network including BTS e.g. are shown using mobile devices . These users are not subscribers in any cellular network in contractual privity with the entity that owns BTS and so do not pay for cellular service. Nevertheless under conditions described herein one or more limited service as described herein may be provided to them. In response to a subscribing user attempting to establish a communication service to a non subscribing user for example the cellular network may transmit a map segment or other indications of nearby WLAN service availability depicting WLAN zone e.g. . In some variants such information may be a real time response to a service request from user . In others such information may be provided on a frequent basis daily or more often e.g. in response to cohort identification module receiving an indication that a subscribing user has identified one or more devices used by the non subscribing user s . In some contexts for example cohort identification module may accept a limited number of such device designations for each subscribing user. Alternatively or additionally such indications of nearby WLAN service availability may be contingent on the one or more non subscriber devices being configured to provide a service in return to function as a hotspot for example or to report indications of changes in service availability deviations from that indicated by map e.g. .

With reference now to there are shown a plurality of access points connected with network interface via switch . Also there is shown a BTS operably coupled with network via BSC and MSC .

In some variants moreover devices in WLAN zone 1 may be advised of an estimated position of or imminent crossing of a zone boundary or 2 may otherwise interact with an access map server via base transceiver station or via access point e.g. in any of the modes described above. One or more instances of access map server or other apparatuses described herein for supervisory or supplemental functions may be implemented in any of several subsystems described herein in or around network . In some variants one or more access points may also be constructed and arranged to provide a fixed wireless linkage from a power meter to a network.

With reference now to there is shown a more magnified view of user showing a subsequent position east and south of WLAN zone e.g. using a headset operably coupled to interact via BTS e.g. with network as shown. Likewise with reference to there is shown a user having wearable articles eyewear or a clip unit or wristwear e.g. of which one or more may be configured without a transmit antenna but able to receive an RF signal. In respective embodiments each such item may be configured to receive a signal 1 from a WLAN access point or 2 from a base transceiver station or 3 from either when the respective wearable article is in a position to receive such signals.

Referring again to with regard to the system of account configuration module comprises special purpose circuitry a transistor based event sequencing structure e.g. that associates or otherwise obtains an indication of an account a quantification of remaining minutes or other available assets represented digitally e.g. associated with device . User a cellular subscriber e.g. owns an account identified as 507779 7267 that has been linked to device a smartphone e.g. as shown in subscriber status database . Account configuration module interacts with subscriber status database that indicates a monthly allocation of 500 minutes 134 of which are currently available for use within the next 5 days as shown. User will incur an excess use penalty if more than 134 minutes are used within 5 days but will receive 500 additional minutes at that time in a conventional manner.

Account update module is likewise implemented as special purpose circuitry that can under some circumstances debit the minute balance or otherwise allocate a cost component against the 134 minute balance or otherwise as an amount of currency e.g. of a communication service video call e.g. between device and one or more other devices that depends upon whether such other device is within WLAN service space in WLAN zone or some other suitable hotspot e.g. or not. This can occur for example in a context in which such other device is not associated with any conventional wireless carrier Verizon e.g. such as in which one or more users of such devices have cancelled their subscription. If two communication service participant devices are both within WLAN service space service configuration module establishes the communication service between them along a non cellular route such as via access points switches and network interfaces . If user is operating a device outside WLAN service space in cell only zone e.g. service configuration module establishes communication service along a route that is part cellular from network to user e.g. and part non cellular from network to device e.g. . In this configuration user incurs a cost component that does not depend upon user s presence in or absence from WLAN service space consuming his minutes at his normal usage rate during premium anytime minute hours defined by his wireless carrier e.g. . If users at both ends of a communication service are outside WLAN service space such as when using devices however account update module will charge user at a higher rate 1.5 or 2.5 minute currency units per minute of call duration e.g. so that the non subscribing user using device e.g. can participate in the communication service without charge. This can occur for example in a context in which route could otherwise not be established via BTS e.g. and in which user would otherwise have to wait for user to re enter WLAN service space even to get a unidirectional message through to user .

If user is inside WLAN service space and user is not service configuration module will establish communication service as a part cellular route via BSC MSC switch and access point e.g. . This can occur for example in a context in which communication service will only include a unidirectional message a ping or SMS text string e.g. . In some variants for example a wireless carrier will only pass such messages toward the subscriber in others only messages from the subscriber will be passed in still others the charge for respective directions of message travel may be different.

In some variants service configuration module may decide based on one or more indications of low network loading at the time of a user interaction to permit user to establish a voice call or even a video call as the communication service . At other times service configuration module may present to user a grayed touchscreen button or other indication that such resource intensive service is currently unavailable for interacting with non subscribers through the cellular networks.

In some instances account update module may debit the account linked to device identified as 507779 7267 e.g. for a communication service established even with a user who is in WLAN service space. This can occur for example in a context in which the device being operated by user is a passenger vehicle or when user has provided an indication as a menu selection on his device e.g. that a premium for cellular access to user is desirable whether user is using his device within WLAN service space or using his device outside WLAN service space.

With reference now to there is shown a high level logic flow disclosed in FIG. 32 of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 731 907. Flow describes an operation of establishing both a wireless communication channel via a first device and from a second device and a wireless communication channel from the second device and via a third device e.g. initiation modules respectively creating parallel communication channels from device each including at least one wireless linkage . This can occur for example in a context in which base transceiver station is the first device in which device is the second device in which access point is an instance of the third device and in which at least two such parallel channels exist simultaneously at some time during the communication service. In a telephonic implementation for example both or all such channels may bear digitized auditory data simultaneously optionally including a particular component of user data passing simultaneously through a primary channel through another channel.

Flow also describes an operation of signaling a decision of how much user data to transmit via the wireless communication channel from the second device and via the third device responsive to an indication that a data block delivery failure rate of the wireless communication channel via the first device and from the second device exceeds a threshold e.g. allocation module causing one or more transmission modules to increase a fraction of digitized auditory data transmitted the third device as an incremental response to an indication that a data block delivery failure rate via the first device exceeds a threshold . This can occur for example in a context in which the incremental response causes a partial reduction in a volume of data block delivery failure events and in which such wireless communication channel allocations would otherwise be made in a crude or unduly computation intensive fashion by conventional signal strength or load balancing or bit error rate indicia e.g. . In some contexts for example allocation module may be configured to close a channel when a traffic volume through it becomes low enough after several iterations of reduction e.g. . When implemented in conjunction with a cost shifting or other mobile connectivity facilitation protocol as described herein flow permits a cellular subscriber and another device user with a wearable article or other mobile device that does not have an established cellular communications subscription account associated therewith e.g. to establish or maintain routes of communication service phone connections or message delivery e.g. that would not otherwise exist.

With reference again to there is shown a high level logic flow disclosed in FIG. 33 of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 731 907. Flow describes an operation of obtaining at a first device an identifier of a second device e.g. registration module maintaining a local instance of a contact list within device including a phone number or similar identification associated with user . This can occur for example in a context in which device is the first device in which device is the second device and in which a telephone switch or server a mobile switching center or similar subsystem in network e.g. associates the phone number with one or more mobile devices operated by user .

Flow also describes an operation of causing the first device to display a Boolean indication whether or not the second device is within a wireless local area network communication range of a third device without a bidirectional interpersonal communication existing between the first device and the second device e.g. notification module triggering device to display a positive status indication signifying that device is within WLAN zone without first establishing a telephone call or similar bidirectional interpersonal communication between device and mobile device . This can occur for example in a context in which WLAN zone is established as an operating range of access point e.g. in which a user of device can initiate a telephone call or similar interpersonal communication to user via device in response to one or more such indications and in which user would otherwise be unable to participate in such communication. When implemented in conjunction with a cost shifting or other mobile connectivity facilitation protocol as described herein flow permits a cellular subscriber and another device user with a wearable article or other mobile device that does not have an established cellular communications subscription account associated therewith e.g. to implement a basic communication service a page or Boolean notification via an LED or earpiece speaker e.g. that would not otherwise exist.

With reference again to there is shown a high level logic flow disclosed in FIG. 34 of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 731 907. Flow describes an operation of obtaining a Boolean indication of whether or not a first device exceeded a wireless service boundary crossing rate threshold within a recent time interval the recent time interval being less than an hour e.g. detection module generating a comparison result as a direct or indirect Boolean indication that a maximum crossing rate threshold was greater than an average rate at which a device had apparently crossed wireless service zone boundaries in a region during a particular time interval . This can occur for example in a context in which an aggregation module has received a series of several indications of crossing events in which one or more of such indications was not qualifying because it did not pertain to an event within the time interval e.g. in which the time interval is on the order of a second or of a minute and in which detection module comprising a comparator e.g. compares a count of such other indications with a threshold. In an implementation of detection module in which the threshold is four for example a count of three crossings will result in a negative indication signifying infrequent crossings e.g. . In another context in which only service region departures are qualifying e.g. detection module may generate a positive indication signifying frequent crossings e.g. by applying a nominal threshold of two against a count of three signifying a registration module detecting departure events e.g. . Other variants of detection module may perform operation using a variety of protocols. A crossing rate threshold may be effectively adapted by applying one or more offsets or multipliers to the count for example or by including other quantitative modifiers as described herein. Alternatively or additionally detection module may implement conjunctive determinants disjunctive determinants or other such modes of implementing comparisons as indicated in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 731 907.

Flow also describes an operation of signaling an availability to participate in a bidirectional interpersonal communication conditionally partly based on the Boolean indication whether or not the first device exceeded the wireless service boundary crossing rate threshold within the recent time interval and partly based on a Boolean indication of the first device being within a wireless communication range of a second device e.g. notification module causing a headset or display to provide a user with an automatic and conditional decision as to whether or not device is currently available to participate in a bidirectional interpersonal communication as communication service . This can occur for example in a context in which device is the first device in which access point is the second device in which the decision will be positive signaling availability e.g. if device remains continuously within the wireless service zone for longer than the time interval in which the time interval is on the order of a second or of a minute and in which much more resource intensive modeling requiring frequent monitoring of satellite by a GPS module e.g. would otherwise be required to determine whether the first device is currently viable for such a communication. In some variants moreover determining availability by another mode purely by a ground speed of device being low enough e.g. might generate false negatives unduly. The decision may optionally be signaled by a sound a chord e.g. or by a word ready e.g. or other displayed symbol a light emitting diode coming on e.g. for example or by other such expressions played or displayed in a vicinity of one or more users via eyewear a clip unit wristwear a headset or other wearable or other device described herein e.g. . Some such devices may be configured for downlink only or may be associated with a smartphone or similar device via a personal area network technology in the ISM band from 2400 2480 MHz such as Bluetooth e.g. having a trackable location by GPS e.g. . Moreover in some embodiments a notification module may signal a positive decision by establishing the bidirectional interpersonal communication comprising a video chat session or similar dialog e.g. moreover or may signal a negative decision by doing nothing. When implemented in conjunction with a cost shifting or other mobile connectivity facilitation protocol as described herein flow permits a cellular subscriber and another device user with a wearable article or other mobile device that does not have an established cellular communications subscription account associated therewith e.g. to implement various communication services a teleconference or portion thereof e.g. describe above.

With reference now to there is shown a high level logic flow disclosed in FIG. 35 of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 731 907. Flow describes an operation of obtaining via a first device configuration data establishing a first security protocol e.g. input module receiving via one or more linkages a secure access code effectively deeming one or more data patterns to be acceptable . This can occur for example in a context in which such linkages include a signal bearing conduit an antenna or optical cable e.g. as the first device via which a configuration unit transmits an access code to a supervisor unit and in which the access code includes a current password provided by a password generation module. In some contexts for example a secondary device remote from the supervisor unit may be configured to perform such transmissions regularly daily e.g. . Alternatively or additionally one or more instances of a configuration unit may implement an initial security protocol implementing data pattern during manufacture of the supervisor unit e.g. for limiting access to one or more services network resources e.g. prior to any reconfiguration of the supervisor unit.

Flow also describes an operation of obtaining via a second device a wireless signal containing access request data e.g. interface module receiving a wireless signal containing access request data . This can occur for example in a context in which the second device is an antenna and in which device in transmits a wireless signal as a response to input key press events or voice commands e.g. from user initiating a telephone call e.g. . Alternatively or additionally device may transmit access request data requesting to establish an open channel e.g. as an automatic response to device entering WLAN zone comprising a wireless operating range of access point e.g. .

Flow also describes an operation of signaling a decision whether or not to provide a first network access service via a third device responsive to whether or not the access request data in the wireless signal matches the first security protocol e.g. registration module signaling a decision to provide device with a service that includes access to network via control module in as an automatic and conditional response to an application module determining that access request data a password e.g. matches a security protocol implementing data pattern .

Flow also describes an operation of signaling a decision whether or not to provide a second network access service via the third device responsive to whether or not the access request data matches a second security protocol the third device implementing a firewall between the first network access service and the second network access service e.g. allocation module signaling a conditional decision not to provide an entity that transmits access request data with a service communication service that includes access to network as an automatic and conditional response to an application module determining that access request data does not match security protocol implementing data pattern . This can occur for example in a context in which NAC unit is the third device in which control module provides the second device with access to network as the first network access service e.g. in which control module would simultaneously provide a fourth device with access to network as the second network access service e.g. if the fourth device had transmitted suitable access request data and in which the first network access service would otherwise need to be provided by a fifth device base transceiver station e.g. . In some contexts for example control module may implement the firewall between the first and second network access services. Alternatively or additionally control module may be remotely configurable implemented in an FPGA or non volatile memory e.g. to permit an adjustment of the location of the firewall or otherwise control an allocation of resources in NAC unit . When implemented in conjunction with a cost shifting or other mobile connectivity facilitation protocol as described herein flow permits a cellular subscriber and another device user with a wearable article or other mobile device that does not have an established cellular communications subscription account associated therewith e.g. to implement various communication services a phone call or portion thereof e.g. that would not otherwise exist.

With reference again to there is shown a high level logic flow disclosed in FIG. 36 of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 731 907. Flow describes an operation of obtaining an indication of a first wireless communication service having been provided within a first service region by a first device at an earlier time e.g. aggregation module receiving a notification that mobile device was at particular GPS coordinates three weeks ago at which time a wireless service had been established between device and network via access point . This can occur for example in a context in which access point is the first device in which a notification arrived at aggregation module almost three weeks ago in which aggregation module maintains status data about the availability of wireless services within a region depicted by map and in which the status data includes an estimated position of access point determined by a detection module using GPS or other triangulation protocols e.g. at the earlier time three weeks ago e.g. . In some contexts for example timing data derived from a signal from an instance of device traveling across WLAN zones and maintained in status data e.g. may indicate where Wi Fi was operative as of three weeks ago. Alternatively or additionally status data may include indications of latest wireless service status in several zones near the most recent estimated position of access point .

Flow also describes an operation of signaling a decision whether or not to indicate the first wireless communication service being operative within the first service region as an automatic and conditional response to an indication from a second device of the first wireless communication service having been operative within the first service region or not at a later time e.g. response module communicating to user a decision that is responsive to a recent indication from device about one or more WLAN services being operative or inoperative within a vicinity of user . This can occur for example in a context in which mobile device is the second device and has transmitted service availability information at the later time yesterday e.g. of which some is maintained in status data e.g. in which the decision is negative if it results in device displaying a map version indicating that service is unavailable within part of a region in which the decision is positive if it results in device displaying a map version indicating that WLAN service is available throughout the region and in which user would otherwise have to traverse the first service region personally to discover whether or not WLAN service is still available there. Alternatively or additionally such signals from various devices traversing the region may be used 1 by a response module configured to determine an indication of an approximate range of each access point 2 by a response module configured to determine an indication of what times of the day or week a WLAN access point goes offline 3 by a response module configured to determine a Boolean indication whether or not one of the access points appears to be stationary 4 by a response module configured to determine a Boolean indication of whether or not one of the access points is substantially isotropic 5 by a response module configured to display via a map of a user interface a cost indicative service boundary relating to a prospective interpersonal communication or 6 to perform such functions upon other devices described herein. When implemented in conjunction with a cost shifting or other mobile connectivity facilitation protocol as described herein flow permits a cellular subscriber and another device user with a wearable article or other mobile device that does not have an established cellular communications subscription account associated therewith e.g. to implement various communication services a phone call or portion thereof e.g. as described above.

In many contexts a widespread implementation of one or more such flows into a wireless communications marketplace will entice cellular carriers to provide limited support for communications with anonymous devices wearable articles operable to receive user data but not to send any user data e.g. or with devices belonging to non subscribers as described herein. Part cellular calls as described above can facilitate offloading of a congested cellular network for example. Interpersonal communications between users via alternatively technologies direct interaction between a satellite and a satellite radio or mobile device may also achieve more widespread adoption. Moreover alternative wireless communication service providers having much lower monthly subscription fees e.g. may enter the mobile marketplace on a larger scale.

Alternatively or additionally in some variants a cellular carrier subscriber a telemarketer or other user e.g. may be able to configure his account to provide an additional enticement in minutes or other currency e.g. for a user of another device to accept a communication. In some variants a recipient of a call or message may require such enticement or may set a threshold specifying a quantification a threshold of 1 per call e.g. below which no communication service can be established.

An identifier phone number e.g. of a remote mobile device or its user are available listed e.g. at computer . When mobile device is within a wireless local area network WLAN communication range of one or more WLAN routers instantiated in one or more devices of network e.g. an interpersonal communication a video chat via displays or telephone call e.g. can occur via computer and mobile device and via linkages with network as shown. In some contexts moreover status information concerning mobile device is available at computer even before such communication is initiated.

With reference now to shown is a high level logic flow of an operational process. Operation describes obtaining at a first device an identifier of a second device e.g. registration module maintaining a local instance of contact list within computer including a phone number or similar identification associated with user . This can occur for example in a context in which computer is the first device instantiated in one or more devices of network e.g. in which mobile device is the second device and in which a telephone switch or server associates phone number with one or more mobile devices owned by user instantiated in one or more devices of network e.g. .

Operation describes causing the first device to display a Boolean indication whether or not the second device is within a wireless local area network communication range of a third device without a bidirectional interpersonal communication existing between the first device and the second device e.g. notification module triggering computer to display a positive status indication signifying that mobile device is within a wireless LAN communication range without first establishing a telephone call or similar bidirectional interpersonal communication between computer and mobile device . This can occur for example in a context in which wireless LAN communication range is established as an operating range of one or more WLAN devices wireless LAN router e.g. in which display presents such an indication in conjunction with other information about user in record e.g. in which a user of computer can initiate a telephone call or similar interpersonal communication to user via computer in response to one or more such indications in which such telephone calls are cost effective free of charge to user e.g. and in which user would otherwise be unable or displeased to participate in such communication incurring a significant roaming charge e.g. .

With reference now to shown is an example of a system in which one or more technologies may be implemented. A mobile device a communication enabled vehicle or handheld device e.g. meanders along a path through a series of positions at each of which there is an apparent wireless service boundary . Even if the devices that provide the wireless service zones in a region are unknown or unavailable or transient by hot spot movements or intermittencies e.g. a rate at which some such crossings occur constitutes a useful availability determinant as described below.

With reference now to shown is a high level logic flow of an operational process. Operation describes obtaining a Boolean indication of whether or not a first device exceeded a wireless service boundary crossing rate threshold within a recent time interval the recent time interval being less than an hour e.g. detection module generating a comparison result as a direct or indirect Boolean indication that a maximum crossing rate threshold was greater than an average rate at which device had apparently crossed wireless service zone boundaries in a region during a particular time interval . This can occur for example in a context in which aggregation module has received a series of several indications of crossing events in which one or more of such indications was not qualifying because it did not pertain to an event within time interval e.g. in which time interval is on the order of a second or of a minute and in which detection module comprising comparator e.g. compares a count of such other indications with threshold . In an implementation of detection module in which threshold is four for example a count of three crossings e.g. at positions will result in a negative indication signifying infrequent crossings e.g. . In another context in which only service region departures are qualifying e.g. detection module may generate a positive indication signifying frequent crossings e.g. by applying a nominal threshold of two against a count of three signifying registration module detecting departure events at position from zone and at position from zone and at position from zone e.g. . Other variants of detection module may perform operation using a variety of protocols. A crossing rate threshold may be effectively adapted by applying one or more offsets or multipliers to count for example or by including other quantitative modifiers as described herein. Alternatively or additionally detection module may implement conjunctive determinants a Boolean value configured to enable indication conditionally e.g. disjunctive determinants a Boolean value configured to override indication conditionally e.g. or other such modes of implementing comparisons as indicated herein.

Operation describes signaling an availability to participate in a bidirectional interpersonal communication conditionally partly based on the Boolean indication whether or not the first device exceeded the wireless service boundary crossing rate threshold within the recent time interval and partly based on a Boolean indication of the first device being within a wireless communication range of a second device e.g. notification module causing a headset or display to provide a user with an automatic and conditional decision as to whether or not device is currently available to participate in a bidirectional interpersonal communication . This can occur for example in a context in which device is the first device in which device is the second device in which wireless service zone comprises a wireless communication range of device in which decision will be positive signaling availability e.g. if device remains continuously within wireless service zone for longer than time interval in which time interval is on the order of a second or of a minute and in which much more resource intensive modeling requiring frequent monitoring of satellite by GPS module e.g. would otherwise be required to determine whether the first device is currently viable for such a communication. In some variants moreover determining availability by another mode purely by a ground speed of device being low enough e.g. might generate false negatives unduly failing to recognize viable ongoing availability in a context of traveling within region and alongside device for an extended period e.g. . Decision may optionally be signaled by a sound a chord e.g. or by a word ready e.g. or other displayed symbol a light emitting diode coming on e.g. for example or by other such expressions played or displayed at user interface instantiated in one or more devices of network e.g. . In some embodiments notification module may signal a positive decision by establishing the bidirectional interpersonal communication comprising a video chat session or similar dialog e.g. moreover or may signal a negative decision by doing nothing.

Two networks are each operably coupled with a communications tower instantiated in one or more devices of network e.g. and with a network access control NAC unit implementing a wireless router e.g. comprising several control modules . One such control module interacts with device and conditionally provides a first network access service to network e.g. . One or more other devices computer e.g. are likewise conditionally provided by one or more other corresponding control modules e.g. with network access service s as described below.

With reference now to shown is a high level logic flow of an operational process. Operation describes obtaining via a first device configuration data establishing a first security protocol e.g. input module receiving via one or more linkages a secure access code effectively deeming one or more data patterns to be acceptable . This can occur for example in a context in which secondary device includes data storage medium non volatile memory e.g. in which such linkages include a signal bearing conduit an antenna or optical cable e.g. as the first device via which configuration unit transmits access code to supervisor unit and in which access code includes a current password provided by password generation module . In some contexts for example a secondary device remote from supervisor unit may be configured to perform such transmissions regularly daily e.g. . Alternatively or additionally one or more instances of configuration unit may implement an initial security protocol implementing data pattern during manufacture of supervisor unit e.g. for limiting access to one or more services network resources e.g. prior to any reconfiguration of supervisor unit .

Operation describes obtaining via a second device a wireless signal containing access request data e.g. interface module receiving a wireless signal containing access request data . This can occur for example in a context in which primary device includes event sequencing logic instantiated in one or more devices of network e.g. in which the second device is an antenna operably coupled to device or to NAC unit instantiated in one or more devices of network e.g. and in which device transmits wireless signal as a response to input key press events or voice commands e.g. from user initiating a telephone call e.g. . Alternatively or additionally device may transmit access request data requesting to establish an open channel e.g. as an automatic response to device entering a zone comprising a wireless operating range of device e.g. .

Operation describes signaling a decision whether or not to provide a first network access service via a third device responsive to whether or not the access request data in the wireless signal satisfies the first security protocol e.g. registration module signaling a decision to provide device with a service that includes access to network via control module as an automatic and conditional response to application module determining that access request data matches security protocol implementing data pattern .

Operation describes signaling a decision whether or not to provide a second network access service via the third device responsive to whether or not the access request data satisfies a second security protocol the third device implementing a firewall between the first network access service and the second network access service e.g. allocation module signaling a conditional decision not to provide an entity that transmits access request data with a service that includes access to network as an automatic and conditional response to application module determining that access request data does not match security protocol implementing data pattern . This can occur for example in a context in which device is the second device in which NAC unit is the third device in which control module provides the second device with access to network as the first network access service e.g. in which control module would simultaneously provide a fourth device computer e.g. with access to network as the second network access service e.g. if the fourth device had transmitted access request data matching data pattern in which NAC unit implements event sequencing logic instantiated in one or more devices of network e.g. and media and in which the first network access service would otherwise need to be provided by a fifth device tower e.g. . In some contexts for example control module may implement the firewall between the first and second network access services access to networks respectively e.g. . Alternatively or additionally control module may be remotely configurable implemented in an FPGA or non volatile memory e.g. to permit an adjustment of the location of the firewall or otherwise control an allocation of resources in NAC unit .

With reference now to shown is a high level logic flow of an operational process. Operation describes obtaining an indication of a first wireless communication service having been provided within a first service region by a first device at an earlier time e.g. aggregation module receiving a notification that mobile device was at coordinates three weeks ago at which time a wireless service had been established between device and network via router . This can occur for example in a context in which generally depicts the earlier time in which the first service region comprises either zone or a subset of it that excludes zone in which router is the first device instantiated in one or more devices of network e.g. in which notification arrived at aggregation module almost three weeks ago in which aggregation module maintains status data about the availability of wireless services within a region depicted by map and in which status data includes an estimated position of router determined by a detection module using GPS or other triangulation protocols e.g. at the earlier time three weeks ago e.g. . In some contexts for example timing data derived from a signal from an instance of device traveling across zones and maintained in status data e.g. may indicate that as of three weeks ago service was operative in zones and service was operative in zone . Alternatively or additionally status data may optionally include indications of latest wireless service status in several zones near the most recent estimated position of router .

Operation describes signaling a decision whether or not to indicate the first wireless communication service being operative within the first service region as an automatic and conditional response to an indication from a second device of the first wireless communication service having been operative within the first service region or not at a later time e.g. response module communicating to user a decision that is responsive to a recent indication from device about one or more wireless services being operative or inoperative within zone . This can occur for example in a context in which mobile device is the second device and has transmitted a signal at the later time yesterday e.g. from within zones corresponding roughly to map position e.g. of which some is maintained in status data e.g. in which the decision is negative if it results in device displaying status version indicating that service is unavailable within part of zone e.g. in which the decision is positive manifested as an instance of a voltage level above a voltage threshold e.g. if it results in device displaying status version indicating that service is available throughout zone e.g. and in which user would otherwise have to traverse the first service region personally to discover whether or not service is still available there. In some contexts for example such a decision will dictate whether device will display image version negatively indicative of service at position e.g. or image version positively indicative of service at position e.g. . Alternatively or additionally such signals from various devices traversing region may be used 1 by a response module configured to determine an indication of an approximate range of each router 2 by a response module configured to determine an indication of what times of the day or week one of the routers goes offline 3 by a response module configured to determine a Boolean indication whether or not one of the routers appears to be stationary 4 by a response module configured to determine a Boolean indication of whether or not one of the routers instantiated in one or more devices of network e.g. is substantially isotropic 5 by a response module configured to display via a map of a user interface a cost indicative service boundary relating to a prospective interpersonal communication via the user interface or 6 to perform such functions upon other devices described herein.

Line of sight or other passive wireless linkages operably couple each of such devices with network a hybrid network that includes network of e.g. as shown. Alternatively or additionally device may be operably coupled via a radio frequency linkage Bluetooth e.g. with node .

With reference now to shown is a high level logic flow of an operational process. Operation describes obtaining an identification of a first formerly subscribed mobile device e.g. tagging module receiving a phone number serial number or other identification of one or more mobile communication devices that were previously associated with a customer identifier but are no longer . This can occur for example in a context in which device was originally configured by a first cellular service provider Verizon e.g. who maintains a subscriber database from which customer identifier has now been removed and in which secondary unit resides in network or in device . This can be accomplished for example by associating device with a second cellular service provider by enabling device to accept an off brand subscriber identification module or other substitute network access component e.g. after an original wireless service subscription has ended. Alternatively in some contexts tagging module may be configured to identify a device that has been temporarily dissociated from its subscription such as by user implementing one or more unlocking protocols to adapt device to be usable overseas or otherwise without the first cellular service provider via WLAN service e.g. .

Operation describes obtaining an indication of an account associated with a first currently subscribed mobile device e.g. validation module generating an indication that an account associated with device is currently available .

This can occur for example in a context in which device gets a free ride at the expense of user when necessary for the communication in which user authorized both the ordinary cost component and the as needed premium cost component described above to be charged to account in which the premium cost component can be avoided by waiting for device to re enter WLAN service space and in which user could not otherwise eliminate the need for device to remain within or re enter WLAN service space WLAN zone e.g. . In some contexts for example user can configure decision module to perform operation by authorizing a cost component to be posted to account conditionally for a particular communication conference call e.g. or duration week e.g. so that such posting will occur if necessary 1 to establish the communication with or from device while it is in free ride zone or 2 to continue the communication with unlocked device as it passes out of WLAN service across a zone boundary from a WLAN zone into a cell only or other free ride zone e.g. but usually will not occur otherwise.

As used herein a mobile device is affiliation dependent if and only if it comprises at least one of an unsubscribed mobile device or a formerly subscribed mobile device or a formerly charged mobile device.

As used herein a credential does not comprise mere signal routing data a telephone number or address e.g. but instead establishes authority permission e.g. relating to one or more accounts or other resources of a third party e.g. .

As used herein a third party is not used in its common contractual or conversational sense but instead implies first and second parties to a wireless linkage between respective devices e.g. such as a first party needing assistance by a second party in communicating to the third party.

Operation describes responding to a communication from an affiliation dependent mobile device by authorizing a charge to an account of the third party automatically and conditionally partly based on the affiliation dependent mobile device using a wireless linkage and partly based on an evaluation protocol accepting a credential relating to the communication e.g. response module transmitting a charge authorization as a real time response to a determination that signal was relayed by tower and a determination that the signal included an acceptable policy number digital certificate password account identifier or other credential . This can occur for example in a context in which evaluation protocol is applied by determining whether or not credential meets one or more mathematical criteria a password confirmation or biometric identity verification function e.g. or is included in a current credential list in which filter module comprises an implementation comprising software executable by processor e.g. of evaluation protocol that generates one or more positive determinations of acceptability at a server or other facility of third party e.g. in which charge authorization specifies or triggers a quantity of minutes or currency or some other resource e.g. to be charged to an account of the third party as an incentive to the second party e.g. in which the first party is not a subscriber to any cellular carrier but instead just keeps a mobile device that is unsubscribed lacking a cellular service subscription e.g. on hand in which the third party has a relationship with the first party as a service provider or relative e.g. and in which the second party would not otherwise have a suitable motivation to facilitate such communications.

Operation describes responding to an interpersonal communication via the second mobile device by authorizing a communication service charge automatically and conditionally partly based on a hotspot network access being inadequate in a vicinity of the second mobile device and partly based on the network access authorization temporarily associating the second mobile device with the account associated with the first mobile device from the user of the first mobile device e.g. response module responding to an indication of one or more interpersonal communications including device by authorizing a cost component to be charged to account if one or more account specific criteria are met . This can occur for example in a context in which such authorizations are conditional in that they generally would not occur otherwise in which response module takes such action as a real time response to the interpersonal communication s in which a device described herein comprising secondary unit e.g. implements event sequencing logic and in which response module associates account with one or more criteria indicative of inadequate hotspot availability or performance as described herein. Alternatively or additionally in some variants an instance of device implementing device e.g. may encounter inadequate hotspot network access for a telephonic call of typical duration e.g. by virtue of crossing out of wireless service space too frequently or by being in a region a cell of a cellular network defining a vicinity of device e.g. in which only a minority of the region e.g. zones comprise WLAN access space. This may be implemented for example as the response module s having been configured to respond to one or more of 1 an indication of an excessive data block delivery failure rate 2 an indication that the first mobile device exceeded a wireless service boundary crossing rate threshold within a recent time interval or 3 other such conditional indications of hotspot network access being inadequate specified by a user or a device manufacturer e.g. .

With reference now to shown is a high level logic flow of an operational process. Operation describes obtaining a first charge authorization status relating to an affiliation dependent mobile device and to a first account associated with a first currently subscribed mobile device e.g. lookup module retrieving a Boolean value manifesting a negative charge authorization status from a data table the negative status indicating that mobile device is not authorized to post any charges to an account associated with a mobile device of a first cellular subscriber . This can occur for example in a context in which mobile device is affiliation dependent an unsubscribed or formerly subscribed mobile device e.g. in which account is owned by user the first cellular subscriber in which device incurs one or more charges by accessing a cellular service participating in one or more communications e.g. while in free ride zone in which data table comprises a contact list in which one or more instances of data handling media reside in event sequencing logic as described herein and in which the negative status prevents mobile device from posting any such charges to account . In some contexts for example the negative status is a default value that exists until user toggles the Boolean value by granting a request for an account management module to accept one or more such charges against account e.g. . Alternatively or additionally in a context in which Boolean value signals a positive charge authorization status a menu presented via mobile device e.g. may permit user to specify what kinds of charges account management module will accept from which affiliation dependent devices and with which corresponding terms conditions e.g. in relation to account .

Operation describes obtaining a second charge authorization status relating to the affiliation dependent mobile device and to a second account associated with a second currently subscribed mobile device e.g. lookup module retrieving a Boolean value signaling a positive charge authorization status from a data table the positive status specifically indicating that mobile device is authorized to post a charge to an account associated with a mobile device of a second cellular subscriber . This can occur for example in a context in which one or more instances of event sequencing logic reside within or otherwise interact with a network described herein in which account is owned by user the second cellular subscriber in which a cellular service provider regularly charges account for telephone calls or other communications in which mobile device participates and in which the positive status permits mobile device to post one or more such charges to account resulting from mobile device participating in one or more communications while in free ride zone e.g. . In some contexts for example one or more such statuses may be implemented as a voltage configuration on an instance of a node set . Alternatively or additionally operation may be performed by an instances of a node set resident in supervisor unit and configured to receive the second charge authorization status from user via input module or device e.g. .

Operation describes causing the affiliation dependent mobile device to indicate at least one of the first account associated with the first currently subscribed mobile device or the second account associated with the second currently subscribed mobile device partly based on the first charge authorization status relating to the affiliation dependent mobile device and to the first account associated with the first currently subscribed mobile device and partly based on the second charge authorization status relating to the affiliation dependent mobile device and to the second account associated with the second currently subscribed mobile device e.g. response module triggering mobile device to present a menu indicating one or more accounts at least partly based on charge authorization statuses as described above . This can occur for example in a context in which such indication comprises presenting menu to user by a speaker or display aboard device in which device implements device see in which at least a portion of such communication while outside WLAN zone e.g. incurs a cost component that user is unprepared to bear because mobile device has exhausted its account or otherwise lacks a suitable cellular subscription e.g. and in which an affiliation dependent user would not otherwise know his sponsorship options which other users have manifested a willingness to sponsor his participation in such communications e.g. . In some contexts for example menu may permit user choose which or to specify a sponsor ranking or cost division establishing which one or more accounts will be charged for whatever cost components his communication causes. Alternatively or additionally response module may automatically select the second account responsive to the second charge authorization status going positive before one or other statuses going positive e.g. and then automatically cause mobile device to indicate account when joining or handing off such communication from WLAN zone to free ride zone e.g. or otherwise configuring an inter device sponsorship as described herein.

With reference now to shown is a high level logic flow of an operational process. Operation describes obtaining from a user of a first mobile device a network access authorization temporarily associating a second mobile device with an account associated with the first mobile device e.g. validation module receiving from user an authorization for device to access network for a single occasion or a specific duration . See . This can occur for example in a context in which a device belonging to user is the first mobile device in which user subscribes to a cellular service provided by Verizon e.g. by which one or more accounts are maintained by a monthly replenishment and billing e.g. in which the single occasion comprises a telephone call initiated by user and in which the one or more media depicted in e.g. reside in network . Alternatively or additionally one or more such validation modules may be configured to request such authorization via device e.g. when one or more account specific criteria defined by the cellular service are met. In some contexts for example validation module may offer user a menu including one or more voice prompts e.g. that can accept an authorization duration specified by user .

One or more of operations may be performed in preparation for or in response to or otherwise in conjunction with operation . Operation describes establishing a conference call among several devices as the communication the several devices including the first mobile device and the second mobile device e.g. configuration module implementing a telephone call among a group of several user devices that includes at least two mobile devices . This can occur for example in a context in which the call is initiated by several users each calling a third device a hub apparatus e.g. . Alternatively or additionally the call may include one or more participants including user or user or user e.g. who are called by the third device implementing service request handling module e.g. in response to a request from another participant.

Operation describes establishing the communication via at least the first mobile device and the second mobile device responsive to receiving a charge authorization from a user of a third device e.g. configuration module establishing one or more sessions or other interpersonal communications via mobile devices responsive to receiving one or more authorizations from a user of apparatus . This can occur for example in a context in which event sequencing logic resides in one or more switches or in network and in which user is a subscriber or employee of a wireless carrier. In some contexts for example such authorization may apply to any such communications that mobile device initiates pursuant to user subscribing to a map service provider or cellular provider e.g. . Alternatively or additionally such authorization may apply only to a single interpersonal communication that includes a subscriber s device a call from a non subscriber s device to the subscriber s device e.g. .

Operation describes assigning a cost component of the communication to an account associated with a third mobile device conditionally in response to receiving a charge authorization from the third mobile device before receiving any charge authorization from the first mobile device e.g. response module causing a value of a non subscriber s device participating in the communication to be deducted from an account associated with a device that belongs to a user whose customer identifier is 429053 4101 rather than from another account . This can occur for example in a context in which the communication an interpersonal communication described above e.g. includes a first mobile device and a second mobile device as well as the third mobile device in which user and user are both subscribers of a wireless carrier who maintains subscriber status database and in which response module would ordinarily have requested such authorizations from respective users in response to the communication but in which such request was unnecessary this time because user provided an authorization for such cost component assignments in advance pre authorized before anyone initiated the communication e.g. .

In some variants a value of cost component may be fifteen minutes even when the communication only lasted five minutes. This can occur for example either as a per communication cost fifteen minutes consumed per instance of a non subscribing guest participation e.g. or as a premium usage rate three account minutes consumed per minute of non subscribing guest participation e.g. . In either case such a cost component may result directly in a negative balance exceeding the usage limit by charging minutes to an account having a current balance of 13 minutes e.g. for this month for user even if his own participation in the communication did not incur any cost because it was not during peak hours or because he was in WLAN zone during the call e.g. . This can occur for example where the account associated with the third mobile device indicates that an 800 minute monthly allocation with only 13 minutes left will be replenished in 23 days see .

Operation describes manifesting the communication by establishing a direct wireless linkage between a cell tower and the second mobile device partly based on receiving a charge authorization and partly based on the second mobile device not having WLAN service e.g. decision module implementing a decision to establish one or more wireless linkages directly between mobile device and a cell tower partly based on receiving one or more such authorizations and partly based on an indication of mobile device being in cell only zone . This can occur for example in a context in which mobile device is the second mobile device in which wireless linkage is direct by virtue of spanning a free space medium air e.g. of several meters or more without active components repeaters e.g. that extend the span by receiving and relaying wireless signals in which such a linkage usually would not occur without such assistance from cell tower and in which such implementation occurs as a real time response within a few seconds e.g. to someone a third party e.g. entering such authorization s . Alternatively or additionally decision module may perform operation by establishing the direct wireless linkage between cell tower and the second mobile device partly based on having received the authorization earlier and partly based on one or more users of mobile device requesting to establish the communication while in free ride zone .

With reference now to flow of and to other flows described above in some variants one or more of operations may be performed in preparation for or in response to or otherwise in conjunction with any of operations or described above.

Operation describes causing a data component of a wireless signal to be processed by a special purpose module in a handheld device as an automatic and conditional response to a thermal state of a temperature sensor in the handheld device e.g. response module routing some or all of wireless signal to a special purpose video data processing module unless and until an indication is received that temperature sensor exceeds a threshold . This can occur for example in a context in which a handheld device implements control logic and other event sequencing logic in which comparator is configured to determine whether a temperature indicative signal therefrom exceeds threshold and to transmit a Boolean result of the comparison to response module in which threshold is calibrated so that the effective temperature threshold is 47 C. and in which an extended use of processing module would otherwise make it uncomfortable for user to hold device . In some contexts for example device may implement one or more other devices described herein. Alternatively or additionally an instance of application module may be implemented in a server remote from handheld device and configured to perform operation remotely by controlling how much data to include in a wireless signal as a function of the state of a temperature sensor residing in handheld device e.g. . By postponing or refraining from transmitting some of the data for example such an application module can effectively cause handheld device to cool down remotely by deactivating or slowing operations in one or more processing modules aboard handheld device e.g. without wasting transmission bandwidth. In another variant moreover operation may be performed by a special purpose response module implemented as or operably coupled with circuitry having an event sequencing structure an instance of numerous transistors and voltage levels in one or more integrated circuits e.g. configured to cause a data component of a wireless signal to be processed by a special purpose module in a handheld device as an automatic and conditional response to a thermal state of a temperature sensor in the handheld device .

Operation describes causing a data component of a wireless signal to be processed by a special purpose module in a portable device as an automatic and conditional response to a charging state of a battery in the portable device e.g. response module causing one or more segments of a wireless signal to be handled by a special purpose processing module in a portable detection unit as an automatic and conditional response to a sufficient charging state of a battery . This can occur for example in a context in which detection unit comprises a portable device in which at least some segments include coordinates in a virtual reality space game data e.g. in which processing module comprises an FFT module or other such special purpose components implemented in FPGA and in which real time rendering in response to coordinates or other such processing intensive functions would not otherwise be feasible in a production grade portable device . In another variant moreover operation may be performed by a special purpose response module implemented as or operably coupled with circuitry having an event sequencing structure configured to cause a data component of a wireless signal to be processed by a special purpose module in a portable secondary device instantiated in one or more devices of network e.g. as an automatic and conditional response to a charging state of a battery . This can occur for example in a context in which special purpose module comprises an FFT module sorting module or detection module formed directly on integrated circuit implementing ASIC e.g. .

Operation describes causing a data component of a wireless signal to be processed by a special purpose module in a mobile device as an automatic and conditional response to a control component of the wireless signal e.g. interface module directing one or more data segments of a wireless signal from device to be processed by a special purpose decryption module within device as a conditional response to a control parameter in the wireless signal being 10 . This can occur for example in a context in which interface module would direct data segments to be decrypted conventionally by a general purpose central processing unit executing decryption code resident in internal cache e.g. in response to control parameter being 00 or 01 or 11 and in which the algorithm embodied in such decryption code would be more readily susceptible to reverse engineering decompilation e.g. than special purpose decryption module . In some contexts for example such a data segment may optionally include telephonic or other encrypted audio data blocks . Alternatively or additionally in some embodiments an initiation module in device may perform operation by configuring control parameter to have a value 10 or 11 e.g. that causes interface module to route unencrypted data blocks to a special purpose digital to analog converter . This can occur for example in a context in which interface module would direct data segments to be converted conventionally by DAC e.g. in response to control parameter being 00 or 01 . Alternatively or additionally in some embodiments a response module may be configured to perform an instance of operation by enabling one or more other response modules conditionally based upon a control parameter in a received wireless signal . In another variant moreover operation may be performed by a special purpose interface module implemented as or operably coupled with circuitry having an event sequencing structure configured to cause a data segment of a wireless signal to be processed by a special purpose module FFT module or sorting module or other detection module e.g. in one or more mobile devices as an automatic and conditional response to a control parameter access code e.g. of the wireless signal .

Operation describes causing first content of a wireless signal to pass either through a first memory of a particular device or through a second memory of the particular device selected as an automatic and conditional response to whether or not second content of the wireless signal satisfies a first criterion e.g. interface module routing data blocks in a wireless signal to pass through queue if they comprise auditory data and otherwise generally to pass through queue . This can occur for example in a context in which wireless signal also includes a Boolean indication of whether or not the data blocks comprise auditory data in which queue resides in cache or other volatile memory in which queue resides in phase change memory or other non volatile memory and in which primary device instantiated in one or more devices of network e.g. would otherwise need either to provide an ongoing bias current to volatile memory or to incur performance degradation resulting from excessive interaction with non volatile memory e.g. . Alternatively or additionally interface module may be configured to route the data blocks in wireless signal to pass through queue conditionally in response to a positive Boolean indication signifying that they comprise encrypted data e.g. . In another variant moreover operation may be performed by a special purpose interface module implemented as or operably coupled with circuitry having an event sequencing structure configured to cause a data component of a wireless signal to pass through a less accessible non volatile memory of an integrated circuit primary device e.g. if a configuration component of wireless signal satisfies a first criterion and otherwise to cause the data component to pass through more accessible memory of the integrated circuit.

With reference now to flow of and to other flows described above in some variants several modes are presented. A first provides operation and operation . A second provides operation and operation . A third provides operation and operation . One or more of these modes may be performed in preparation for or in response to or otherwise in conjunction with any of the operations described above.

Operation describes causing a configurable core in a first core operating mode to draw from a first data queue of a particular device e.g. response module triggering a dual mode core to draw from data queue . This can occur for example in a context in which event sequencing logic instantiated ASIC or in one or more devices of network e.g. implements the first core operating mode as a positive Boolean value as a nominal voltage level less than one volt at electrical node e.g. and in which dual mode core is operating in a low voltage core operating mode manifesting Boolean value e.g. . Alternatively or additionally such triggering may invoke special purpose circuitry having an event sequencing structure an arrangement of transistors and voltage levels in one or more integrated circuits e.g. configured to cause a multimodal core or other configurable core to draw from data queue .

Operation describes signaling a decision whether or not to cause the configurable core to draw from the first data queue of the particular device in a second core operating mode as an automatic and conditional response to an indication of a data volume of the first data queue crossing a volume threshold e.g. configuration module manifesting a decision whether or not to cause the dual mode core or other configurable core to draw from data queue in another core operating mode as an automatic and conditional response to an indication of a volume of data queue crossing volume threshold . This can occur for example in a context in which the other core operating mode is a higher voltage mode implementing a negative Boolean value as a nominal voltage level greater than one volt at electrical node e.g. and in which maintaining effective processing throughput would otherwise require one or more additional cores drawing from data queue .

In some contexts for example operation causes a contingent cost component posted to a subscriber account for providing cellular service to a nonsubscriber e.g. at a minimum. This can occur for example in a context in which the earlier portion of the communication s before device crossed zone boundary resulted in the subscriber incurring a premium or other contingent cost component as described herein providing a free ride to user at the expense of user e.g. for communicating with a nonsubscriber. Alternatively or additionally event sequencing logic may be implemented in a node having a wireless linkage to a first or second device .

Operation describes authorizing a cost component to be posted to a user account conditionally at least partly based on a portion of a wireless communication using WLAN access e.g. validation module providing an authorization for cost components to be posted to one or more subscriber accounts conditionally at least partly based on some of a wireless interpersonal communication being routed through a base transceiver station rather than through switch . This can occur for example in a context in which the interpersonal communication comprises a call that began with device in free ride zone and ended with device in WLAN zone in which a handoff occurred pursuant to operation in which a latter portion of the interpersonal communication did not incur a charge to any participant thereof because the one or more other participants were in WLAN zone e.g. in which an earlier portion of the interpersonal communication incurred a charge to a subscribing user who participated and in which BTS would not otherwise have supported that communication without an authorization from validation module e.g. . Alternatively or additionally another instance of such authorization may trigger BTS to accept a handover via operation e.g. in response to device crossing from free ride zone into WLAN zone .

Operation describes handing off an interpersonal communication from a WLAN access point to a cellular base station e.g. configuration module routing one or more teleconferences or other interpersonal communications from a configuration in which one or more devices communicate with network via WLAN access point to a configuration in which such communication is routed via cellular base transceiver station . This can occur for example in a context in which user walks toward or across zone boundary into free ride zone e.g. during the interpersonal communication in which configuration module has an accurate current model estimating a current position of zone boundary accurately and in which configuration module responds to a succession of position estimates indicative of such movement predictive of a crossing e.g. by initiating such a handoff. Alternatively or additionally configuration module may trigger such a handoff responsive to an indication that user is driving toward free ride zone approaching zone boundary e.g. .

Operation describes causing a particular device to indicate some of a wireless connectivity map that includes automatically curated map data e.g. map update module causing one or more devices to indicate a segment of map after updating model as an automatic response to having received one or more position estimates with corresponding service status data from mobile device and with provenance data indicating an adequate suitability . This can occur for example in a context in which model comprises an instance of map resident in network in which access map server implements control unit in which technician has defined one or more device implemented adequacy criteria relating to precision or accuracy or relevance e.g. and in which map thereby includes wireless connectivity map data that is automatically curated.

Also in such variants operation may be performed by a special purpose notification module implemented as circuitry having an event sequencing structure an arrangement of numerous transistors and electrical nodes at decision indicative voltage levels e.g. configured to cause a primary device to indicate whether or not device is within zone . This can occur for example in a context in which the third device comprises a vehicle or mounted device providing wireless service in which the WLAN communication range comprises region or zone in which primary device is not currently engaged in a bidirectional interpersonal communication via device and in which primary device includes a light emitting diode or other suitable display configured to display the Boolean indication. Alternatively or additionally in some variants the third device may comprise a moving vehicle instantiated in one or more devices of network e.g. or parked vehicle comprising device e.g. providing Wi Fi service.

Referring again to the flow variants of described above and in particular to flow operation may be performed by a special purpose detection module implemented as or operably coupled with circuitry having an event sequencing structure configured to detect an availability to participate in one or more modes of telephonic dialog as a conditionally response to an indirect Boolean indication whether or not a device instantiated in one or more devices of network e.g. crossed boundaries too rapidly as a determination of whether an average or other interval between events exceeded a threshold said determination being an inverse of Boolean indication e.g. within time interval . Also in such variants operation may be performed by a special purpose notification module implemented as circuitry having an event sequencing structure an arrangement of numerous transistors and electrical nodes at decision indicative voltage levels operably coupled to detection the module e.g. configured to signal the availability to participate in telephonic dialog in response to a successful communication via router . This can occur for example in a context in which device is at position and in which router is online providing wireless service in zone e.g. .

In some variants one or more wireless communication parameters may be adopted by a first or second mobile device implementing one or more devices described above or as a wearable assembly e.g. based at least partially on a physical state of the mobile device to strengthen enhance or improve a communication channel between the mobile device and another wireless device such as a base transceiver station.

Additionally or alternatively with regard to power a wireless node may use relatively higher power for communication such as transmitting signals while using relatively lower power for investigation of appropriate wireless communication parameters such as sniffing signals . However claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments implementations examples etc.

In some variants with respect to mobile device experimentation the mobile device may employ a group of wireless communication parameters that have been determined via experimentation. Additionally or alternatively the mobile device may store a group of such as one or more suitable combinations of wireless communication parameters for a given physical state of the mobile device in an antenna configuration data structure implemented in FPGA e.g. or send a group of wireless communication parameters for a given physical state of the mobile device to a network side orchestrator of a data structure.

In some variants with respect to mobile device experimentation the mobile device may schedule or initiate at least one experimentation round based at least partially on any of the following a in the background while other automations progress b at timed intervals or if a certain amount of time elapses c if signal quality drops below a certain level d if a certain amount of movement such as translational rotational or a combination thereof etc. is detected such as using an inertial measurement unit IMU or GPS unit e at a known or determinable boundary for a physical state entry of an antenna configuration data structure such as which may include a parameter to physical state data structure f if the mobile device is approaching a known or determinable boundary for a physical state entry of an antenna configuration data structure g predictively such as based at least partly on i predicting a certain amount of movement is soon to occur ii predicting that a boundary crossing into a physical state that corresponds to a different physical state entry of an antenna configuration data structure or a combination thereof etc. or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these. However claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments implementations examples etc.

In some variants with respect to mobile device experimentation experimentation may be constrained responsive to one or more conditional parameters. By way of example only parameter options possibilities to be tested may be constrained based at least partially on power usage. For instance the mobile device may intend to enable wireless communication with at least one bases station but limit power output for such wireless communication to a particular power level such as 100 mW . A battery may set limits or establish specified guidelines that constrain power usage including but not limited to constraining power usage charge drain over time. Accordingly an experimentation module may trade i a selection of wireless standard being used or ii frequency or bandwidth of searching for example instead of or in addition to transmit power with power drain. Moreover as another example a power constraint may be selectively applied based at least partly on time of day or predicted time until a battery will next be charged. For instance whether or to what stringency a power constraint is applied may depend on a time of day. Accordingly there may be a greater concern on battery drain earlier in a day as compared to later when recharging typically occurs a typical temporal pattern of charging such as around noon in a car as well as starting at around midnight with a wall outlet may also or alternatively be considered . From an alternative perspective a battery level may be considered as a condition for ascertaining at least one associated antenna assembly configuration parameter such as if selecting a wireless communication mode or a group of wireless communication parameters . However claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments implementations examples etc.

In some variants an antenna configuration data structure may have separate entries for or otherwise denote a difference between uplink versus downlink. Appropriate uplink and downlink communication parameters may differ because multipath may affect the mobile device more than a base transceiver station because different frequencies may be assigned to uplink versus downlink communications or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these. However claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments implementations examples etc.

In some variants with respect to receiving commands or data at the mobile device from a base transceiver station the mobile device may cooperate with the base transceiver station to obtain one or more wireless communication parameters. First the base transceiver station may send to the mobile device or the mobile device may receive from the base transceiver station one or more wireless communication parameters that the mobile device may adopt. Second the base transceiver station may send to the mobile device or the mobile device may receive from the base transceiver station at least some reception data from a perspective of the base transceiver station for the mobile device to incorporate into an automation process ascertaining what wireless communication parameters are to be implemented. Third the mobile device and the base transceiver station may negotiate to determine a direction of a wireless signal that enables a reflection of a wireless signal off of an object between the mobile device and the base transceiver station such as a bank shot may be planned and implemented to facilitate signal propagation between the mobile device and the base transceiver station. Conducting a signal bank shot may be facilitated by using for example a 3D map depicting walls furniture terrain vehicles people etc. and one or more reflection coefficients for proximate objects that indicate how or to what extent signals of particular frequencies can be expected to reflect off of an object. Cooperation between two wireless nodes may encompass for example any one or more of the above. However claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments implementations examples etc.

In some variants a data structure may link one or more wireless communication parameters with a given physical state of the mobile device. Thus if the mobile device knows its spatial location such as in terms of GPS coordinates or placement within a 3D map of a building a group of wireless communication parameters such as a set of antenna elements and respective phase delays to be adopted to communicate with a particular base transceiver station may be ascertained from data structure. For certain example implementations an orientation of the mobile device may be part of an input physical state to ascertain associated wireless communication parameters such as if an orientation is expected to be user determined autonomously . Alternatively an orientation of the mobile device may be part of a group of wireless communication parameters that are output based on an e.g. spatial location of the mobile device such as if the mobile device is expected to indicate to a user a particular mobile device orientation offering enhanced communication which may be especially pertinent for instance if the mobile device is not being held during use such as when a user has a wired or wireless headset or if a user is sitting in a chair that swivels .

However claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments implementations examples etc.

In some variants a wireless node may develop an antenna configuration data structure. By way of example only a wireless node may store or record a physical state along with a corresponding signal quality in association with each other in a data structure. A physical state may correspond to a currently existing physical state a recently tested physical state or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these. For certain example implementations an updated association may be stored if there are certain amounts of change to i a physical state or ii signal quality or if a certain amount of iii time has elapsed or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these. Additionally or alternatively for certain example implementations a wireless node may replace or add to an existing entry if a new group of wireless communication parameters are discovered for a given physical state that provides superior signal quality. For certain example implementations an entry of an antenna configuration data structure may include a time stamp representing when a value was determining the mobile device or device type identifier of the mobile device that determined or was a source of a value or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these. However claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments implementations examples etc.

In some variants new values for entries may be determined via interpolation or extrapolation from values associated with other physical states. For example if data is available such as from experimentation in transmit or receive postures with respect to multiple tested orientations it may be predicted how well antenna elements or other wireless communication parameters will work at other orientations. Additionally or alternatively if data is available with respect to multiple tested spatial locations including if a 3D map of a room is accessible or if know directional capabilities of an antenna it may be predicted how well antenna elements or other wireless communication parameters will perform at other spatial locations. Even without a 3D map if there are a sufficient number of measurements then values for other untested spatial locations may be predicted. For instance if data values are available from several different paths taken by the mobile device around a room then the mobile device can predict data values for other points in the room. For certain example implementations one or more entries an antenna configuration data structure may have an indicator that a value is predicted an indicator that a value has a particular level of reliability or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these.

Additionally or alternatively for certain example implementations the following data may be received from the mobile device physical state and wireless communication parameters that were employed during the existence of the physical state and the following data may be received from a counterpart wireless node such as the base transceiver station signal quality based on a network side reception.

In some variants a network side actor may send to the mobile device or the mobile device may receive from a network side actor one or more portions of an antenna configuration data structure so as to download a cacheable part thereof. For certain example implementations a part may be downloaded or offered for download based at least partially on any one or more of the following a current spatial location b physical state c predicted spatial location d predicted physical state e device type make model specifications or combination thereof etc. such as memory capability at least one user setting or a specific physical antenna array traits or a combination thereof etc. f a proximity to a boundary of current cached part such as including but not limited to a consideration of predicted movement toward a boundary thereof some combination thereof or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these.

In some variants a portable wireless node may account for or address environmental factors or concerns pertinent to wireless communication at e.g. EHF. For certain example implementations to avoid transmission through a human body human tissue such as hand head or a combination thereof e.g. may be detected using one or more of the following a test beam emanation such as analyze reflections from test beams b a capacitive sensor such as of a touchscreen c a proximity detector such as a light sensor d a pressure sensor such as determine where finger tips are placed e a sound sensor such as determine where a user s mouth is located or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these.

In some embodiments a handheld device or other portable wireless node may interact with another portable wireless node configured as an auxiliary relay item in a shoe or hat or other wearable article e.g. via a local linkage Bluetooth e.g. . For certain example implementations such auxiliary relay items may be engaged or utilized for any one or more of the following reasons a a clearer path to another wireless node such as to avoid a head or other human tissue or another blocking object b more power availability c more or differently arranged antenna elements on the auxiliary relay item d a different available frequency or wireless communication standard or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these. By way of example only a portable wireless node may roll over to an auxiliary relay item to relocate transmission power away from a head or if throughput drops where a user is currently holding a portable wireless node. For certain example implementations 1 a portable wireless node may select between or among one or more auxiliary relay items such as may determine when it is advisable to fallback to an auxiliary relay item using a protocol for communication between the mobile device and an auxiliary relay item 2 an auxiliary relay item may be creating using updating an antenna configuration data structure in conjunction with or independent of a portable wireless node 3 a spatial location of a wearable auxiliary relay item may be determine based at least partly on an attachment site to a body part 4 a system may automatically determine presence absence or location of wearable auxiliary relay items 5 searches for suitable antenna configuration parameters by an auxiliary relay item may be constrained by battery power such as power battery related technology described herein with respect to a portable wireless node may be applied to an auxiliary relay item unless context dictates otherwise 6 if multiple items are linked so as to enable or merely enhance communication or user functions if they are working together then one or more of the multiple items may alert such as visually audibly haptically or a combination thereof e.g. if they are separated from each other beyond a threshold distance such as beyond a range which enables using them together such as if a user is driving away from a house with one of two interacting components or some combination thereof.

In some variants technologies described herein may be directly apparent to a user in one or more ways. For certain example implementations a portable wireless node may offer a user one or more settings a a size of a data structure being cached b a slider or other mechanism to indicate between battery consumption versus signal acquisition or enhancement c a slider or other mechanism to indicate between an acceptable energy radiation level such as exposure to a body or head portion thereof versus signal quality or bandwidth throughput d ability to activate sync configure an auxiliary relay item such as input a type or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these. For certain example implementations a user may indicate a desire to be notified of such as via at least one setting a a position or orientation option for a portable wireless node that offers improved communication such as more bandwidth less power less interference lower cost or a combination thereof e.g. b an impending signal loss such as if movement continues along a current direction based on signal degradation or entries in an antenna configuration data structure or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these. For certain example implementations notifications may be delivered by a portable wireless node to a user audibly haptically visually or a combination thereof e.g. for indicating a different position orientation impending signal loss or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these.

In some variants an extremely high frequency EHF communication such as at 30 300 GHz such as at 60 GHz in accordance with IEEE 802.1 lad may be conducted by wireless node that is also capable of utilizing other frequency bands or other wireless communication standards. To facilitate such interoperability a wireless node may determine i whether or when to switch to another frequency band or another wireless communication standard or ii whether or when to share bandwidth demands with another frequency band or another wireless communication standard. For certain example implementations other frequency bands may include but are not limited to a 2.4 GHz 3.6 GHz 5 GHz or a combination thereof e.g. b 700 800 MHz 900 MHz 1800 MHZ 1700 1900 MHz 2500 MHz 2600 MHz or a combination thereof e.g. or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these. For certain example implementations other wireless communication standards may include but are not limited to a IEEE 802.11b 802.11g 802.11a 802.11n 802.11ac or a combination thereof e.g. b GSM EDGE CDMA UMTS HSPA LTE WiMAX or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these. However claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments implementations examples e.g.

In some variants a wireless node may choose to switch frequency or wireless standard or may choose to share communication across two or more frequencies or wireless standards. For certain example implementations one or more of a number of factors may be considered for switching versus sharing decisions. First a wireless node may switch if another frequency band or standard can handle current bandwidth demands while a current one cannot. Second a wireless node may switch if another frequency band or standard has a lower or at least no higher cost. Third a wireless node may switch if a current frequency is experiencing attenuation but another frequency is likely not to experience the same attenuation such as if body tissue is currently attenuating a 60 GHz signal but the mobile device can switch to a lower frequency signal below 10 GHz . Fourth a wireless node may share bandwidth demands if a current frequency or standard is not providing a sufficiently fast or strong connection but another frequency or standard has a higher cost or insufficient bandwidth capability to meet current bandwidth demands. Additional or alternative factors for deciding between switching and sharing may be considered. For certain example implementations one or more of a number of factors may prompt a wireless node to consider sharing or switching. First a signal quality may drop below a threshold using a current frequency or standard. Second no group of wireless communication parameters offering superior performance may be determinable by a wireless node via experimentation. Third no entry in a wireless communication configuration data structure for a current or impending physical state or set of conditions generally may be ascertained. Additional or alternative factors for deciding whether to consider switching versus sharing may be incorporated into a wireless node s automation. However claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments implementations examples e.g.

In some variants a coordinated management system may be implemented where multiple wireless nodes occupy a given physical region with the management system coordinating various signal strengths antenna directions polarizations features or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these. Coordination may enable a greater number of nodes within or a more efficient use of available spectrum within a given physical region. However claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments implementations examples e.g.

In some variants a coordinated management system may be constituted in a centralized or a distributed manner. For a centralized coordinated management system in accordance with certain example implementations an access point the base transceiver station a mobile switching center a fixed wireless node an internet node a telecom node or a combination thereof e.g. may coordinate a number of portable wireless nodes across a single cell or multiple cells. For a distributed coordinated management system in accordance with certain example implementations two or more portable wireless nodes separately from or in conjunction with at least one network infrastructure based node such as a fixed wireless node or a telecom node or an internet node may coordinate their own individual wireless signals. Coordination may be based at least partially on their own sensor readings including but not limited to received signals or based at least partially on using coordination specific data received from or exchanged with other portable wireless nodes or with a fixed wireless nodes such as the base transceiver station. For a hybrid coordinated management system in accordance with certain example implementations there may be some decentralized efforts by portable wireless nodes with overarching efforts by one or more network infrastructure based nodes for centralized oversight. However claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments implementations examples etc.

In some variants one or more factors may be separately or jointly considered in conjunction with or as part of an analysis to facilitate coordination. First available frequency bands in a given region or to a particular portable wireless node may be considered. Different bands have different amounts or levels of absorption or other loss dispersion scattering reflection or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these. By way of example only 60 GHz typically has more attenuation than 5 GHz. Thus although 60 GHz generally propagates a relatively shorter distance it can correspondingly be reused in smaller spaces. At 60 GHz reflections may enable bank shots off of proximate objects. Two devices may determine to perform a bank shot via negotiation or a centralized coordinator may order them to perform one. Furthermore devices transmitting at higher frequencies may utilize smaller antenna elements that accommodate their smaller shorter wavelengths. A physical size of a particular wavelength aperture may generally be smaller at higher frequencies. Relatively smaller devices can therefore implement beamforming at 60 GHz for example even if they would be unable to do so at 1800 MHz or even 5 GHz. Second governmental restrictions may be considered. In some contexts statutes or regulations may stipulate or require certain transmission maximums or reception capabilities. By way of example only a signal strength may be limited at particular frequencies. Third licensing constraints such as with regard to available frequencies or particular uses thereof may be considered. Licensing constraints may flow from a governmental entity from a corporation to the mobile device or mobile device user such as contractual obligations or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these. Fourth different or particular device types in a given physical region that are trying to share spectrum may be considered. For example permanent characteristics may be considered a antenna features such as beam pattern capabilities polarization sensitivity frequency response impedance or a combination thereof e.g. b processing capability or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these. As another example current settings of a device such as user established settings OS specified settings app determined settings or a combination thereof e.g. may be considered a frequency selection from among multiple possible frequencies b signal encoding selection from among multiple possible encoding schemes c user imposed restraints such as based on cost power battery life or a combination thereof e.g. or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these. As yet another example current status levels or conditions of a device may be considered a signal to noise ratio SNR b signal strength c power constraints or battery status d available processing bandwidth e location f expected radio activity level such as whether an activity is anticipated to be data intensive e.g. media streaming g orientation h operating state such as connected to a Wi Fi network or not access through near field communication NFC or a combination thereof e.g. or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these. Fifth environmental characteristics may be considered. For example physical barriers such as walls trees billboards etc. those obtainable from one or more Google Earth or crowd sourced 3D building data or other maps or a combination thereof etc. may be considered. Other environmental characteristics may include but are not limited to other approaching devices such as their locations or transmitting characteristics humidity temperature or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these. However claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments implementations examples etc.

In some variants coordination opportunities may include but are not limited to bank shots or beamforming. First bank shots may be planned or implemented between at least two wireless nodes to avoid a wall or other obstacle if a vehicle is detected to be approaching and will be temporarily block a line of sight transmission path or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these. Second beamforming may be achieved with by way of example but not limitation an antenna with multiple elements a phased array a meta material antenna or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these. An aimed beam may reach a target with less relative power such as in comparison to an omnidirectional transmission a beam may reach a further distance with a narrower footprint using a same power level . Further with respect to coordination an omnidirectional transmission may be used if a target or counterpart wireless node is moving or if a transmitting node is moving but beamforming may be used if a target is stationary or slowly moving or if a transmitting node is not moving . Aiming a beam may be accomplished through trial and error . As a first example multiple beams may be sent out such as fully or partially simultaneously or over time with different indicators and an intended recipient may be asked for an indicator that they received strongest to determine a good beam pattern for that recipient. As a second example two nodes may send out beams until they connect. As a third example a wireless node may sweep beams circularly until a directional angle such as azimuth angle is discovered that makes contact with an intended wireless target and a wireless node may then slice up or down until it hones in to find an elevation or a zenith angle. However claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular described embodiments implementations examples etc.

In some variants at least one sensor may sense produce or otherwise provide one or more sensor values as a series of estimates or other digital signal e.g. . Sensors may include by way of example only a camera a microphone an accelerometer a thermometer a satellite positioning system SPS sensor a barometer a humidity sensor a compass an altimeter a gyroscope a magnetometer a pressure sensor an oscillation detector a light sensor an inertial measurement unit IMU a tactile sensor a touch sensor a flexibility sensor a microelectromechanical system MEMS or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these. Values provided by at least one sensor may include by way of example but not limitation an image video a sound recording an acceleration value a temperature one or more SPS coordinates a barometric pressure a humidity level a compass direction an altitude a gyroscopic value a magnetic reading a pressure value an oscillation value an ambient light reading inertial readings touch detections finger placements flex detections or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these.

In some variants a user interface may enable one or more users to interact with portable wireless node . Interactions between a user and a portable wireless node may relate by way of example but not limitation to touch tactile feeling haptic sensory such as a user may shake rotate decline incline bend twist squeeze or move a portable wireless node which may be detected by a gyroscope an accelerometer a compass a MEMS or a combination thereof etc. a user may press a button slide a switch rotate a knob etc. a user may touch a touch sensitive screen a device may vibrate or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these to sound hearing speech sensory such as a user may speak into a microphone a device may generate sounds via a speaker or a combination thereof e.g. to sights vision sensory such as a device may activate one or more lights modify an image presented on a display screen track a user s head eye hand movements or a combination thereof e.g. or a hybrid that includes any one or more of these.
