title: Converting structured data into database entries
abstract: Systems and methods for converting structured data into database entries include receiving data values and metadata elements that form a data structure for the data values. The data values are converted into entries in database tables that are related according to the data structure formed by the metadata elements. The database table entries may be used to generate a webpage configured to report a metric of the data values.
