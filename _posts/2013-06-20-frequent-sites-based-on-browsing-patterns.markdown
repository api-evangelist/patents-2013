Some web browsers may present a user with a list of websites that have been previously browsed to by the user to enable future browsing. The websites presented to the user however may not be representative of the websites that are most relevant to the user based on the user s browsing patterns.

Various embodiments provide a frequent sites module which is designed to generate frequent sites for a user that include websites that are relevant to the user based on browsing patterns of the user. In one or more embodiments the frequent sites are generated from user engagement data that indicates engagement by the user with websites identified in the user s browsing history. A web platform e.g. a web browser can display the frequent sites for the user in a frequent sites user interface container to enable the user to efficiently navigate to the websites that are relevant to the user by selection of websites from the frequent sites user interface container.

Various embodiments describe other aspects of frequent sites based on browsing patterns including multiple device frequent sites device specific frequent sites domain specific frequent sites URL specific frequent sites decaying of frequent sites recent frequent sites and contextual frequent sites.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Frequent sites may be used by a web platform to display a representation of websites that are frequently navigated to by a user. Conventional approaches utilized to display frequent sites may not be representative of the amount of time or the user s interaction with the websites in the frequent sites. Other problems of previous solutions to frequent sites include failing to take device specific browsing patterns of a user into account selecting a wrong subdomain of a frequented domain and failing to take recent changes in a user s browsing patterns into account to name just a few.

Embodiments are described herein however that provide a user with frequent sites that include websites that are relevant to the user based on browsing patterns of the user. For example the frequent sites can be generated from user engagement data that indicates engagement by the user with websites identified in the user s browsing history and or engagement by the user with a web platform such as a web browser.

Various embodiments describe other aspects of frequent sites based on browsing patterns including multiple device frequent sites device specific frequent sites domain specific frequent sites URL specific frequent sites decaying of frequent sites recent frequent sites and contextual frequent sites.

A web platform e.g. a web browser can display the frequent sites for the user in a frequent sites user interface container to enable the user to efficiently navigate to the websites that are relevant to the user by selection of websites from the frequent sites user interface container. A web platform is a platform that works in connection with content of the web e.g. public content. A web platform can include and make use of many different types of technologies such as by way of example and not limitation URLs HTTP REST HTML CSS JavaScript DOM as well as other technologies. The web platform can also work with a variety of data formats such as XML JSON and the like. Web platforms can include web browsers local applications such as Windows Store applications that can be executed on a user s local computing device and the like.

Computing device also includes a web platform . As noted above the web platform works in connection with content of the web e.g. public content such as web pages and the like. A web platform can include and make use of many different types of technologies such as by way of example and not limitation URLs HTTP REST HTML CSS JavaScript DOM and the like. The web platform can also work with a variety of data formats such as XML JSON and the like. Web platforms can include web browsers local applications such as a Windows Store application and the like. In the examples described below a web platform in the form of a web browser that navigates to various websites is utilized. It is to be appreciated and understood however that the inventive principles can be employed by web platforms other than web browsers.

Computing device may also include a frequent sites module . Frequent sites module is configured to generate frequent sites for a user that includes websites that are relevant to the user based on browsing patterns of the user. In some cases frequent sites module generates the frequent sites based on user engagement data that indicates engagement by the user with websites identified in the user s browsing history. As described in more detail below frequent sites module may also be implemented to generate multiple device frequent sites device specific frequent sites domain specific frequent sites URL specific frequent sites recent frequent sites and contextual frequent sites and to decay frequent sites. While frequent sites module is illustrated as residing at computing device it is to be appreciated that frequent sites module may also be implemented in whole or in part at a platform which is described below with regards to . Frequent sites module will be described in more detail below.

Computing device also includes a gesture module that recognizes input pointer gestures that can be performed by one or more fingers and causes operations or actions to be performed that correspond to the gestures. The gestures may be recognized by module in a variety of different ways. For example gesture module may be configured to recognize a touch input such as a finger of a user s hand as proximal to display device of computing device using touchscreen functionality or functionality that senses proximity of a user s finger that may not necessarily be physically touching the display device e.g. using near field technology. Module can be utilized to recognize single finger gestures and bezel gestures multiple finger same hand gestures and bezel gestures and or multiple finger different hand gestures and bezel gestures.

Computing device may also be configured to detect and differentiate between a touch input e.g. provided by one or more fingers of the user s hand and a stylus input e.g. provided by a stylus . The differentiation may be performed in a variety of ways such as by detecting an amount of the display device that is contacted by the finger of the user s hand versus an amount of the display device that is contacted by stylus .

Thus gesture module may support a variety of different gesture techniques through recognition and leverage of a division between stylus and touch inputs as well as different types of touch inputs and non touch inputs.

In the example system multiple devices are interconnected through a central computing device. The central computing device may be local to the multiple devices or may be located remotely from the multiple devices. In one embodiment the central computing device may be a cloud of one or more server computers. These computers can be connected to the multiple devices through a network the Internet or other data communication link. In one embodiment this interconnection architecture enables functionality to be delivered across multiple devices to provide a common and seamless experience to a user of the multiple devices. Each of the multiple devices may have different physical requirements and capabilities and the central computing device uses a platform to enable the delivery of an experience to the device that is both tailored to the device and yet common to all devices. In one embodiment a class of target devices is created and experiences are tailored to the generic class of devices. A class of devices may be defined by physical features types of usage or other common characteristics of the devices.

In various implementations computing device may assume a variety of different configurations such as for computer mobile and television uses. Each of these configurations includes devices that may have generally different constructs and capabilities and thus the computing device may be configured according to one or more of the different device classes. For instance computing device may be implemented as the computer class of a device that includes a personal computer desktop computer a multi screen computer laptop computer netbook and so on. Each of these different configurations may employ a web platform e.g. a web browser as described above and below.

Computing device may also be implemented as the mobile class of device that includes mobile devices such as a mobile phone portable music player portable gaming device a tablet computer a multi screen computer and so on. The computing device may also be implemented as the television class of device that includes devices having or connected to generally larger screens in casual viewing environments. These devices include televisions set top boxes gaming consoles and so on. The techniques described herein may be supported by these various configurations of the computing device and are not limited to the specific examples the techniques described herein.

Cloud includes and or is representative of a platform that can include frequent sites module . Platform abstracts underlying functionality of hardware e.g. servers and software resources of cloud . Frequent sites module may include applications and or data that can be utilized while computer processing is executed on servers that are remote from the computing device . Frequent sites module can be provided as a service over the Internet and or through a subscriber network such as a cellular or Wi Fi network.

Frequent sites module is configured to generate frequent sites for a user that includes websites that are relevant to the user based on browsing patterns of the user. In some cases frequent sites module generates the frequent sites based on user engagement data that indicates engagement by the user with websites identified in the user s browsing history. As described in more detail below frequent sites module may also be implemented to generate multiple device frequent sites device specific frequent sites domain specific frequent sites URL specific frequent sites recent frequent sites and contextual frequent sites and to decay frequent sites. While frequent sites module is illustrated in as residing at platform it is to be appreciated that frequent sites module may also be implemented in whole or in part at computing device as described above. Frequent sites module will be described in more detail below.

Platform may abstract resources and functions to connect computing device with other computing devices. Platform may also serve to abstract scaling of resources to provide a corresponding level of scale to encountered demand for frequent sites module that are implemented via platform . Accordingly in an interconnected device embodiment implementation of functionality described herein may be distributed throughout system . For example the functionality may be implemented in part on computing device as well as via platform that abstracts the functionality of cloud .

Generally any of the functions described herein can be implemented using software firmware hardware e.g. fixed logic circuitry manual processing or a combination of these implementations. The terms module functionality and logic as used herein generally represent software firmware hardware or a combination thereof. In the case of a software implementation the module functionality or logic represents program code that performs specified tasks when executed on or by a processor e.g. CPU or CPUs . The program code can be stored in one or more computer readable memory devices. The features of the gesture techniques described below are platform independent meaning that the techniques may be implemented on a variety of commercial computing platforms having a variety of processors.

Having described example operating environments in which the inventive principles can be employed consider now a discussion of various embodiments.

In one or more embodiments frequent sites module is configured to generate frequent sites for a user that includes websites that are relevant to the user based on browsing patterns of the user. As described herein the term website is used to refer to websites or web pages that can be navigated to via a web platform using a web address of the website. Examples of web addresses include uniform resource locators URLs uniform resource identifiers URIs internationalized resource identifiers IRIs and internationalized domain names IDNs .

Web platform is configured to monitor a user s browsing history as the user navigates to various websites. Frequent sites module receives the user s browsing history from web platform and uses the browsing history to generate the frequent sites. In some cases frequent sites module can be executed locally at a computing device. For example both web platform and frequent sites module can be implemented locally at computing device . Alternately at least part of frequent sites module can be implemented remote from computing device such as at one or more server computers.

In one or more embodiments a user s browsing history includes user engagement data for each website identified in the browsing history. The user engagement data may include user interactions with each website identified in the browsing history such as clicking on links on websites typing into data entry fields on websites scrolling on websites watching videos on websites listening to audio on the websites and the like. In some cases frequent sites module measures the specific user interaction with a website such as the number of clicks on the website or the number of letters typed into text boxes on the website. Different values may be assigned to different interaction items. For example typing into a data entry field of a website may be assigned a higher user interaction value than scrolling the website.

The user engagement data may also include a time value indicating an amount of time that the user was engaged with the website. For example the time value may correspond to an amount of time that a user watched a video on a website or an amount of time that the user read an article on the website which may be identified by the user scrolling a page of the website. In some cases the time value may correspond to the amount of time the website is displayed as an active tab within a web browser.

Frequent sites module can be configured to generate and order the frequent sites based on the user engagement data. For example frequent sites module may arrange websites with higher user engagement data values ahead of websites with lower user engagement data values. The user engagement data values may be a weighted aggregate of the user engagement with a website for multiple navigations by the user to the website.

In one or more embodiments frequent sites module calculates a navigation value for each navigation to a website by a user and a navigation count is calculated as the sum of the navigation values of each navigation to the website. The frequent sites are then determined and ordered based on the navigation count corresponding to each website. For example websites with higher navigation counts are ordered ahead of websites with lower navigation counts in the frequent sites.

In some cases the navigation count for a website is incremented by one for each navigation to a website by a user. Thus a user that has navigated to the website Facebook.com six times and to the website Mashable.com three times may see Facebook.com arranged ahead of Mashable.com in the user s frequent sites.

In one or more embodiments however frequent sites module calculates a navigation value for each instance of navigation to a website based on user engagement with the website during the navigation. The navigation value may be normalized between 1 and 0 such that if the user has a high level of engagement with a website during a navigation the navigation value is closer to 1. Conversely if the user has a low level of engagement with the website during the navigation the navigation value is closer to 0. Frequent sites module then generates the frequent sites using the navigation count for each website.

As an example consider the following. Sarah habitually navigates to Facebook.com and bounces off within a couple of seconds several times every day but visits Mashble.com and reads articles for several hours every day. In previous approaches Sarah s frequent sites may position Facebook.com ahead of Mashable.com because Sarah navigated to Facebook.com more frequently and thus Facebook.com would have a higher navigation count. However this may not be representative of the amount of time or the level of engagement that Sarah has with each website.

Now frequent sites module generates the frequent sites based on user engagement with each website. Continuing with the example above frequent sites module now calculates a high navigation count for Mashable.com based on Sarah s engagement with Mashable.com. For example Sarah may interact with Mashable.com by scrolling articles on Mashable.com and clicking links to different articles which causes frequent sites module to calculate a high navigation value each time Sarah navigates to Mashable.com. Conversely frequent sites module now calculates a low navigation count for Facebook.com based on Sarah s engagement with Facebook.com. For example while Sarah frequently visits Facebook.com the low amount of time Sarah spends during each visit causes frequent sites module to calculate a low navigation value each time Sarah navigates to Facebook.com. Thus by accounting for Sarah s engagement with Mashable.com and Facebook.com frequent sites module may now arrange Mashable.com ahead of Facebook.com in Sarah s frequent sites.

In one or more embodiments frequent sites module is configured to generate the frequent sites based on both user engagement data with each website as well as average user engagement data. The average user engagement data can include the average level of user interaction with a website as well as an average time value corresponding to an amount of time of the average user interaction during a typical navigation. The average engagement data may be aggregated over a period of time and may be updated each time that a user navigates to a website. Frequent sites module may normalize the user engagement data for a specific navigation with the average user engagement data to generate a navigation value for the specific navigation.

In one or more embodiments frequent sites module is configured to determine whether a navigation to a website corresponds to a page bounce. As described herein a page bounce occurs when a user navigates to a website and then navigates away to another website in a short period of time e.g. less than 5 seconds . A page bounce may also be defined to include script or markup induced navigations by a website. In some cases a navigation value is not assigned for a navigation to a website if the navigation to the website is determined to correspond to a page bounce. Alternately frequent sites module may assign a low navigation value if the navigation is determined to correspond to a page bounce.

Web platform is configured to render the frequent sites in a frequent sites user interface container by displaying a representation of websites e.g. icon tile and so on that are frequently navigated to by the user. As an example consider . There a web browser user interface is shown generally at in accordance with one or more embodiments. In this particular example web browser user interface includes a frequent sites user interface container that is displayed on a new tab page of web browser user interface . Frequent sites user interface container displays multiple tiles that each correspond to a website in the frequent sites. In this particular example frequent sites user interface container display ten different websites. It is to be appreciated however that any number of websites can be displayed in frequent sites user interface container .

Tiles are arranged based on the navigation count of each website corresponding to each tile. In for example the arrangement of tile ahead of tile in frequent sites user interface container indicates that the website CNN.com has a higher navigation count than the website Amazon.com and so on. As described throughout the navigation count may be calculated using user engagement data. By clicking on one of tiles the browser can be navigated to the corresponding website. Thus frequent sites user interface container greatly facilitates and enhances a user s experience navigating to websites that are relevant to the user.

In one or more embodiments frequent sites module enables a user s browsing history to roam across multiple devices. For example a user may own or use multiple different computing devices such as a desktop computer the user uses at work a laptop computer a tablet computer and a mobile phone. The user may use each of these devices to navigate to different websites via web platform executed on each device. Frequent sites module can be configured to receive the user s browsing history from each device and aggregate the user s browsing history for all of the user s devices to generate multiple device frequent sites for the user.

In some cases frequent sites module can display the multiple device frequent sites on a new device of the user. For example if the user buys a new laptop frequent sites module can display the multiple frequent sites the first time that the user users web platform on the new laptop.

As an example consider which illustrates an example of multiple device frequent sites . As illustrated in multiple device frequent sites are generated using browsing history data from a desktop computer and a tablet computer . illustrates multiple device frequent sites as being generated by frequent sites module at platform . Alternately however frequent sites module can be implemented at each of device and device . Frequent sites module at each of devices and can receive a roamed browsing history from platform and generate the multiple device frequent sites at each of devices and based on the roamed browsing history.

In this example consider that a user Matt owns both desktop computer and tablet computer and uses these devices to navigate to various websites via web platform installed on each device. Web platform installed on Matt s desktop computer maintains a local browsing history that indicates that Amazon.com USBank.com and Seahawks.com have navigation counts of 90 60 and 30 respectively. Similarly web platform installed on Matt s tablet computer maintains a local browsing history that indicates that MSNBC.com Facebook.com and Seahawks.com have navigation counts of 100 50 and 40 respectively. As described above the navigation count may be generated from user engagement data that identifies engagement by Matt with each website identified in Matt s browsing history.

Web platform implemented at Matt s desktop computer and Matt s tablet computer are each configured to send these local browsing histories to frequent sites module which may be located remote from each of these devices. In this example frequent sites module is implemented at platform . Frequent sites module receives the local browsing history from each of Matt s devices and aggregates local browsing history from Matt s desktop computer with local browsing history from Matt s tablet computer to generate Matt s multiple device frequent sites . In this example frequent sites module lists MSNBC.com first on multiple device frequent sites because MSNBC.com has the highest navigation count of any of the websites identified in Matt s browsing history.

Frequent sites module lists Amazon.com second on multiple device frequent sites because Amazon.com has the second highest navigation count. Note therefore that Matt s multiple device frequent sites reflect navigation by Matt via both Matt s desktop computer Amazon.com and Matt s tablet computer MSNBC.com .

Next on multiple device frequent sites is Seahawks.com. Frequent sites module lists Seahawks.com third on multiple device frequent sites by combining the navigation count of Seahawks.com on Matt s desktop computer with the navigation count to Seahawks.com on Matt s tablet computer. Thus the navigation count for Seahawks.com via both devices is 70. The combined navigation count to Seahawks.com places Seahawks.com ahead of both USBank.com and Facebook.com which have navigation counts of 60 and 50 respectively.

While multiple device frequent sites may be beneficial to the user for a variety of different reasons some users may establish device specific browsing patterns and want their frequent sites to be customized for each of their devices.

In one or more embodiments web platform is configured to modify multiple device frequent sites for a computing device based at least in part on a local browsing history at the computing device. As the user navigates to various websites on a computing device web platform can store a local browsing history at the computing device. Web platform can also send the local browsing history to frequent sites module to aggregate with the user s browsing history from one or more additional devices to generate the multiple device frequent sites. Subsequently web platform can modify the multiple device frequent sites using the local browsing history to generate device specific frequent sites at the computing device. Generally the device specific frequent sites lists websites that have been navigated to on the local computing device ahead of websites that have not been navigated to on the local computing device. The device specific frequent sites may include at least one website that is not included in the multiple device frequent sites.

In some cases to modify the multiple device frequent sites a weight is applied to websites that have been navigated to on the computing device to cause the websites that have been navigated to on the computing device to be listed higher in the device specific frequent sites than websites that have not been navigated to on the local computing device.

In one or more embodiments websites with a local navigation count at a computing device above a certain threshold are listed ahead of websites that have not been navigated to using the computing device in the device specific frequent sites. For example if the local browsing history indicates that five different websites have a local navigation count above a certain threshold then these five websites will be listed ahead of any websites that have not been navigated to via the computing device in the device specific frequent sites. The threshold for example may be one or more navigations to a website via the local computing device. Alternately the threshold may be a specific local navigation count that is based on user engagement data. In some cases the websites that have been navigated to locally may be arranged based on the local navigation count. Any remaining spots in the device specific frequent sites may then be filled in with websites from the multiple device frequent sites that were navigated to by the user via different devices.

Returning to example note that Matt has shown a preference to use his tablet computer to browse the web for news such as at MSNBC.com and to stay in touch with social network sites such as at Facebook.com. However Matt rarely uses his tablet computer to visit shopping sites such as Amazon.com. Therefore Matt may prefer to not have Amazon.com be placed in his frequent sites when Matt is using his tablet computer. Conversely Matt has shown a preference to use his desktop computer to shop online for products such as at Amazon.com and to manage finances such as at USBank.com. Matt rarely uses his desktop computer to visit social network sites however such as Facebook.com. Therefore Matt may prefer to not have Facebook.com be placed in his frequent sites when Matt is using his desktop computer.

In this particular example web platform has modified multiple device frequent sites at desktop computer based on the local browsing history at the desktop computer to generate device specific frequent sites . Device specific frequent sites lists websites that have been navigated to on Matt s desktop computer ahead of websites that have not been navigated to at his desktop computer. In this example Amazon.com has the highest navigation count of websites that have been navigated to at Matt s desktop computer and thus is placed first in device specific frequent sites .

Device specific frequent sites lists Seahawks.com next followed by USBank.com because while both Seahawks.com and USBank.com have been navigated to on Matt s desktop computer Seahawks.com has a higher navigation count of 70.

In some embodiments web platform lists websites in the device specific frequent sites that have not been navigated to on the local computing device if there are available spaces. In device specific frequent sites for example MSNBC.com and Facebook.com are listed fourth and fifth respectively even though these websites have not been navigated to by Matt using his desktop computer because there are open spots in the device specific frequent sites. In addition note that MSNBC.com has the highest navigation count but is listed fourth in device specific frequent sites because it has not been navigated to at desktop computer .

Similarly web platform has modified multiple device frequent sites at tablet computer based on the local browsing history at the tablet computer to generate device specific frequent sites . Device specific frequent sites lists websites that have been navigated to on Matt s tablet computer ahead of websites that have not been navigated to on his tablet computer. In this example MSNBC.com has the highest navigation count of websites that have been navigated to at Matt s tablet computer and thus is placed first in device specific frequent sites .

Device specific frequent sites lists Seahawks.com next followed by Facebook.com because while both Seahawks.com and Facebook.com have been navigated to on Matt s desktop computer Seahawks.com has a higher navigation count. Amazon.com and USBank.com are listed fourth and fifth respectively in device specific frequent sites even though these websites have not been navigated to by Matt using his tablet computer because there are open spots in device specific frequent sites .

In one or more embodiments the frequent sites are generated to contain a maximum of one website per domain. Websites can be grouped into top level websites associated with a domain and sub level websites or pages within the domain. For example ESPN.com is a top level website associated with the URL ESPN.com as well as the domain ESPN. In contrast ESPN.com NFL is also associated with the domain ESPN but is a sub level website or page associated with the URL ESPN.com NFL.

Frequent sites module generates the frequent sites based on a domain specific navigation count that is defined as the sum of the URL specific navigation count for each URL within the domain. In other words each domain receives a domain specific navigation count that is the sum of the navigation count of each page within the domain. In this way the domain receives a single navigation value that is used to qualify the domain for the frequent sites. The URL specific navigation count can be determined based on user engagement data as described above.

In one or more embodiments a URL within a domain that is qualified for the frequent sites is selected to represent the domain. In some cases the URL with the highest URL specific navigation count of all URLs within a domain is selected to represent the domain in the frequent sites.

As an example consider which illustrates an example of domain specific frequent sites that are generated based on browsing history data from a desktop computer . In this example consider that a user Chad owns desktop computer and uses his desktop computer to navigate to Facebook.com which provides Chad with updates from his friends. Additionally Chad spends a good amount of time on other pages within the Facebook domain such as his personal page on Facebook that is associated with the URL Facebook.com Chad his girlfriend Stephanie s page on Facebook which is associated with the URL Facebook.com Stephanie and the official Facebook page of the Portland Trailblazer which is associated with the URL Facebook.com Blazers.

Frequent sites module maintains a URL specific navigation count for each of the URLs within the Facebook domain. In this example the URL specific navigation counts for the URLs Facebook.com Facebook.com Chad Facebook.com Stephanie and Facebook.com Blazers are 60 40 35 and 5 respectively. Frequent sites module also maintains URL specific navigation counts for Chipotle.com of 70 ESPN.com of 20 ESPN.com Blazers of 30 ESPN.com NBA of 25 and ESPN.com NFL of 10. It is to be understood that frequent sites module may generate these URL specific navigation counts based on user engagement data as described throughout.

Previous solutions might list each URL separately in Chad s frequent sites. For example conventional frequent sites might include the URLs Facebook.com Facebook.com Chad Facebook.com Stephanie Facebook.com Seahawks Chiptole.com ESPN.com ESPN.com Blazers ESPN.com NBA and ESPN.com NFL in Chad s frequent sites. This conventional approach causes Chad s frequent sites to be cluttered and prevents other frequent sites from being displayed. Furthermore Chad may usually navigate initially to Facebook.com and then navigate further to additional pages within Facebook.com. Therefore Chad does not need his frequent sites to include Facebook.com Stephanie for example because he always navigates to Facebook.com and then navigates from within the domain Facebook.com to the page Facebook.com Stephanie.

Additionally by listing each URL within a domain separately previous solutions may not account for the actual level of engagement that the user has with a domain. For example while Chad may spend a lot of time within the Facebook domain Chad s URL specific navigation count for the URL Facebook.com is not greater than the URL specific navigation count for the URL Chipotle.com. Thus previous solutions may generate Chad s frequent sites in the following order Chipotle.com Facebook.com Facebook.com Chad Facebook.com Stephanie ESPN.com Blazers ESPN.com NBA ESPN.com ESPN.com NFL and Facebook.com Blazers.

Now frequent sites module generates the frequent sites based on the domain specific navigation count. In this example the domain specific navigation count for the Facebook domain is 140 which is the sum of the URL specific navigation counts for Facebook.com Facebook.com Chad Facebook.com Stephanie and Facebook.com Blazers. Similarly the domain specific navigation count for the domain ESPN is 85 which is the sum of the URL specific navigation counts for ESPN.com ESPN.com Blazers ESPN.com NBA and ESPN.com NFL. The domain specific navigation count for the Chipotle domain is 70 because the only URL within the Chipotle domain that Chad has navigated to is Chipotle.com.

Note in this example ESPN.com Blazers is listed in domain specific frequent sites instead of ESPN.com. This is because frequent sites module selects the URL with the highest URL specific navigation count of all URLs within a domain to represent the domain in the frequent sites. Thus in this example the domain specific navigation count of 85 places the domain ESPN second in domain specific frequent sites and the URL specific navigation count of ESPN.com Blazers places the URL ESPN.com Blazers in domain specific frequent sites to represent the ESPN domain.

In one or more embodiments frequent sites module is configured to decay websites from the frequent sites based on a recent browsing history of a user. If the user has not navigated to a website listed in the frequent sites during a threshold browsing period the navigation count of the website may be decayed. Decaying the navigation count of the website may cause the position of the website in the frequent sites to be modified or removed completely from the user s frequent sites. The threshold browsing period may be defined in terms of browsing days . As described herein a browsing day corresponds to a day in which the user navigates to one or more websites via web platform . By determining the threshold browsing period using browsing days instead of just regular days the user s frequent sites are not modified if the user does use web platform for a period of time. For example if the user goes on vacation for 7 days and does not use web platform during that time then the user s frequent sites may not be modified by frequent sites module .

In one or more embodiments frequent sites module is configured to decay a navigation count of a website to modify a position of the website in the frequent sites if the user does not navigate to the website via web platform during a first threshold browsing period. The first threshold browsing period for example may correspond to 1 browsing day. Thus this change can be quickly noticed by the user. For example if a website is listed first in the frequent sites and the user does not navigate to the website during a browsing day frequent sites module may modify the frequent sites so that the website is now listed second in the frequent sites. This provides the user with immediate feedback and helps the user understand how the frequent sites are generated.

Previous approaches were slow to decay websites from the frequent sites. For example in some cases if a user did not visit a website for over a week the website might still be displayed in the user s frequent sites. Consider for example that a user John navigates to Yahoo.com to check e mail twice per day. Last week however John switched his primary email account to Hotmail.com. Now John still performs his regular habit of checking email twice per day but navigates to Hotmail.com to check email instead of Yahoo.com. Because John switched email providers Yahoo.com is no longer relevant to John. Previous solutions however would take a long time to move Yahoo.com out of John s frequent sites.

Now frequent sites module quickly decays Yahoo.com from John s frequent sites. For example in some embodiments a position of Yahoo.com in John s frequent sites will be modified if John does not browse to Yahoo.com during a single browsing day.

In one or more embodiments frequent sites module is configured to remove a website from the frequent sites if the user does not navigate to the website via web platform during a second threshold browsing period. The second threshold browsing period may be greater than the first threshold browsing period. For example the second threshold browsing period may be 7 browsing days 14 browsing days or 30 browsing days. Thus continuing with the example above if John does not browse to Yahoo.com within 7 browsing days Yahoo.com may be removed completely from John s frequent sites.

In some embodiments frequent sites module is configured to implement device specific decaying of frequent sites. Thus if John has stopped browsing to Facebook.com on his desktop computer but still navigates to Facebook.com on his tablet computer frequent sites module can begin to decay Yahoo.com from the frequent sites on John s desktop computer but not from the frequent sites on John s tablet computer.

In one or more embodiments frequent sites module is configured to generate the frequent sites based on a recency value that measures trends in the user s browsing history in the recent past. For example the recent past may include the last three days of browsing. This is the converse approach to decaying websites from the frequent sites and accounts for websites which have recently made their way into the user s browsing history. If frequent sites module detects that a user has a level of engagement with a website that is above a threshold in a recent time period the frequent sites module may cause the website to be included in the user s frequents sites. For instance weightage may be added to the website s navigation count to cause the website to be included in the frequent sites.

As an example consider a user Kim who recently discovered the website Pinterest.com and is immediately engaged with the website. Even though three days ago Kim had never visited Pinterest.com before for the last three days Kim is repeatedly navigating back to Pinterest.com to check for new content every few hours. In this scenario frequent sites module can modify the position of Pinterest.com in Kim s frequent sites by applying weightage to Pinterest.com to move Pinterest.com up Kim s frequent sites.

In some cases frequent sites module may include an indicator that can be displayed with the website in the frequent sites user interface container in web platform that indicates that the website is a trending or recently popular site. Alternately frequent sites module can include a separate section within the frequent sites user interface container that includes recent or trending sites. For example web platform can display two or three recent frequent sites or trending frequent sites in the frequent sites user interface container in a separate section from the frequent sites.

In one or more embodiments frequent sites module generates contextual frequent sites that include at least one additional website that is not generally included in the frequent sites based on a current context of a user. The current context of a user may be based on detected browsing patterns of the user that correspond to a time of day or a time of week. For example frequent sites module may detect that the user navigates to banking websites on the weekend and navigates to social media sites after work hours. Frequent sites module then generates the contextual frequent sites for the user based on the time of day or the time of week. Continuing with the example above the frequent sites may be modified to include one or more banking websites on Saturday and Sunday and may be modified to include one or more social media websites after 5 pm Monday through Friday.

Alternately or additionally the current context of a user may be based on detected browsing patterns of the user that correspond to an established navigation pattern. To determine an established navigation pattern frequent sites module may identify companion websites that are frequently navigated to within a threshold period of time. For example frequent sites module may determine that Twitter.com Facebook.com and Instagram.com are companion websites if these websites are frequently navigated to within a 20 minute time period. Then when a user navigates to a companion website the frequent sites can be modified to include the other companion websites.

In some cases frequent sites module may include an indicator that can be displayed with the website in the frequent sites user interface container in web platform that indicates that the website is a contextual frequent site. Alternately frequent sites module can include a separate section within the frequent sites user interface container that includes contextual frequent sites.

Step calculates a navigation count for each of the multiple websites based on the user engagement data. In some cases frequent sites module calculates for each navigation to a particular one of the multiple websites a navigation value for the navigation based on user engagement with the website during the navigation. In some cases the navigation value may be normalized between 1 and 0 such that if the user has a high level of engagement with a website during a navigation the navigation value is closer to 1. Conversely if the user has a low level of engagement with the website during the navigation the navigation value is closer to 0. The navigation count can then be calculated as a sum of the navigation values for each of the navigations to a particular website.

Step generates frequent sites based on the navigation counts of the multiple websites. The frequent sites include a list of one or more of the multiple websites that is ordered based on the navigation counts of the multiple websites. In some cases websites with higher navigation counts are ordered ahead of websites with lower navigation counts in the frequent sites.

Step renders the frequent sites in a frequent sites user interface container of the web platform. The frequent sites can be rendered in the frequent sites user interface container of web platform in any suitable way. For example in some cases the frequent sites are rendered in a frequent sites user interface container in a new tab page of a web browser user interface as illustrated in . Alternately the frequent sites can be rendered in a frequent sites user interface container in a quick access sites container of a web browser user interface as illustrated in .

Step modifies the multiple device frequent sites using a local browsing history of the computing device to generate device specific frequent sites corresponding to the user. In some cases to modify the multiple device frequent sites a weightage is applied to websites that have been navigated to on the computing device to cause the websites that have been navigated to on the computing device to be listed higher in the device specific frequent sites than websites that have not been navigated to on the local computing device. In one or more embodiments websites that have a local navigation count above a certain threshold are listed ahead of websites that have not been navigated to using the computing device in the device specific frequent sites. Any remaining spots in the device specific frequent sites may then be filled in with websites from the multiple device frequent sites that were navigated to using different devices.

Step causes the device specific frequent sites to be rendered in a frequent sites user interface container of the web platform. The device specific frequent sites can be rendered in the frequent sites user interface container of web platform in any suitable way. For example in some cases the device specific frequent sites are rendered in a frequent sites user interface container in a new tab page of a web browser user interface as illustrated in . Alternately the device specific frequent sites can be rendered in a frequent sites user interface container in a quick access sites container of a web browser user interface as illustrated in .

Step determines a URL specific navigation count for each URL identified in the browsing history data. In some cases the URL specific navigation count can be determined using user engagement data that indicates engagement by the user with URLs identified in the browsing history data.

Step calculates a domain specific navigation count for each domain identified in the browsing history data as a sum of the URL specific navigation count for each URL within the domain and step generates frequent sites based on the domain specific navigation counts.

Step selects the URL with the highest URL specific navigation count of each domain in the frequent sites for display in the frequent sites. For example the URL with the highest URL specific navigation count of all URLs within a domain is selected to represent the domain in the frequent sites.

Step modifies a position of the website in the frequent sites responsive to determining that the website was not navigated to during the first threshold browsing period. For example if the website was listed first in the frequent sites the frequent sites may be modified so that the website is now listed second in the frequent sites. To modify the position of the website in the frequent sites frequent sites module may decay a navigation count of the website. Steps and may be repeated during multiple first threshold browsing periods. For example frequent sites module may move the website down a position in the frequent sites for each browsing day during which the website is not navigated to by the user using web platform .

Step determines that the website in the frequent sites was not navigated to using the web platform during a second threshold browsing period. The second threshold browsing period may be greater than the first threshold browsing period. For example the second threshold browsing period may correspond to 7 browsing days or 14 browsing days. In some cases both the first threshold browsing period and the second threshold browsing period may be user customizable.

Step removes the website from the frequent sites responsive to determining that the website in the frequent sites was not navigated to using the web platform during the second threshold browsing period.
