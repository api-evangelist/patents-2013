Unless otherwise indicated herein the materials described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.

Advances in computing networking and related technologies have led to proliferation in the availability of multimedia content and the manners in which the content is consumed. Today multimedia content may be made available from fixed media e.g. Digital Versatile Disc or DVD broadcast cable operators satellite channels the Internet and so forth. Users may consume content with a television set a laptop or desktop computer a tablet a smartphone or other devices of the like. In general content may be consumed in a distributed manner for example retrieved from a server at multiple distributed locations. In certain instances it may be desirable for access to the content to be controlled for example to enforce viewing restrictions on sporting events.

Apparatuses methods and storage media associated with content distribution and or consumption are disclosed herein. In embodiments media content may be encoded as multiple segments of content which are retrieved by a content consumption device from a centralized server. The segments may include segment data boxes SDBs containing data for the segments. One or more of the SDBs may contain an identifier referred to herein as a rule identifier rule ID . In embodiments the rule ID may refer the content consumption device to a blackout rule contained on a server such as a content server or a rule server which the content consumption device may then access. In some embodiments the content consumption device may also authenticate that the blackout rule is valid before downloading the blackout rule from the server. The blackout rule may in various embodiments contain information related to a blackout period for the content that may define whether and or under what conditions the content may be displayed by the content consumption device. For example in some embodiments the blackout rule may include one or more limitations to access to the content based on variables such as time date geographical area and or consumer identity. The content consumption device may then follow the blackout rule and either allow access to or limit access to the media content indicated by the blackout rule.

Content aggregator distributor servers may be configured to aggregate and distribute content to content consumption device s for consumption via one or more networks .

In embodiments as shown content aggregator distributor servers may include encoder storage and content provisioning which may be coupled to each other as shown. Encoder may be configured to encode content from various content providers and storage may be configured to store encoded content. Content provisioning may be configured to selectively retrieve and provide encoded content to the various content consumption device s in response to requests from the various content consumption device s . Content may be multimedia content of various types having one or more of video audio and or closed captions from a variety of content creators and or providers. Examples of content may include but are not limited to movies. TV programming user created content such as YouTube video iReporter video music albums titles pieces and so forth. Examples of content creators and or providers may include but are not limited to movie studios distributors television programmers television broadcasters satellite programming broadcasters cable operators online users and so forth.

In embodiments for efficiency of operation encoder may be configured to encode the various content typically in different encoding formats into a subset of one or more common encoding formats. However encoder may be configured to nonetheless maintain indices or cross references to the corresponding content in their original encoding formats. Similarly for flexibility of operation encoder may encode or otherwise process each or selected ones of content into multiple versions of different quality of service QoS levels. The different versions or levels may provide different resolutions different bitrates and or different frame rates for transmission and or playing collectively generally referred to as QoS parameters. In various embodiments the encoder may publish or otherwise make available information on the available different resolutions different bitrates and or different frame rates. For example the encoder may publish bitrates at which it may provide video or audio content to the content consumption device s . Encoding of audio data may be performed in accordance with e.g. but are not limited to the MP3 standard promulgated by the Moving Picture Experts Group MPEG . Encoding of video data may be performed in accordance with e.g. but are not limited to the H264 standard promulgated by the International Telecommunication Unit ITU Video Coding Experts Group VCEG . Encoder may include one or more computing devices configured to perform content portioning encoding and or transcoding such as described herein.

Volatile memory may include but are not limited to static and or dynamic random access memory. Non volatile memory may include but are not limited to electrically erasable programmable read only memory phase change memory resistive memory and so forth.

Content provisioning may in various embodiments be configured to provide encoded content as discrete files and or as continuous streams of encoded content. Content provisioning may be configured to transmit the encoded audio video data and closed captions if provided in accordance with any one of a number of streaming and or transmission protocols. Streaming protocols may include the MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over Hypertext Transfer Protocol MPEG DASH protocol defined ins ISO IEC 23009 1 04 01 2012 and or some other streaming protocol such as hypertext transfer protocol live streaming HLS . Transmission protocols may include but are not limited to the transmission control protocol TCP user datagram protocol UDP and so forth. Networks may be any combinations of private and or public wired and or wireless local and or wide area networks. Private networks may include e.g. but are not limited to enterprise networks. Public networks may include e.g. but is not limited to the Internet. Wired networks may include e.g. but are not limited to Ethernet networks. Wireless networks may include e.g. but are not limited to Wi Fi or 3G 4G networks. It would be appreciated that at the content distribution end networks may include one or more local area networks with gateways and firewalls through which content aggregator distributor servers go through to communicate with content consumption device s . Similarly at the content consumption end networks may include base stations and or access points through which content consumption device s communicate with content aggregator distributor servers . In between the two ends may be any number of network routers switches and other networking equipment of the like. However for ease of understanding these gateways firewalls routers switches base stations access points and the like are not shown.

In embodiments as shown a content consumption device may include player display and user input device . Player may be configured to receive streamed content decode and recover the content from the content stream and present the recovered content on display in response to user selections inputs from user input device .

In embodiments player may include decoder presentation engine and user interface engine . Decoder may be configured to receive streamed content decode and recover the content from the content stream. Presentation engine may be configured to present the recovered content on display in response to user selections inputs. In various embodiments decoder and or presentation engine may be configured to present audio and or video content to a user that has been encoded using varying encoding control variable settings in a substantially seamless manner. Thus in various embodiments the decoder and or presentation engine may be configured to present two portions of content that vary in resolution frame rate and or compression settings without interrupting presentation of the content. User interface engine may be configured to receive the user selections inputs from a user.

While shown as part of a content consumption device display and or user input device s may be standalone devices or integrated for different embodiments of content consumption device s . For example for a television arrangement display may be a stand alone television set Liquid Crystal Display LCD Plasma and the like while player may be part of a separate set top set and other user input device may be a separate remote control or keyboard. Similarly for a desktop computer arrangement player display and other user input device s may all be separate stand alone units. On the other hand for a laptop ultrabook tablet or smartphone arrangement player display and other input devices may be integrated together into a single form factor. Further for tablet or smartphone arrangement a touch sensitive display screen may also server as one of the other user input device s and player may be a computing platform with a soft keyboard that also include one of the user input device s .

In some embodiments and as will be described in more detail below content aggregator distributor server s may further include blackout rules relating to the display of the content at the content consumption device s . Additionally or alternatively the content aggregator distributor server s and or the content consumption device s may be coupled with a blackout rule server via network s . The blackout rule server may be configured to provide a blackout rule to one or both of the content aggregator distributor server s and content consumption device s .

A potential benefit of the content being encoded into different versions according to multiple different QoS parameters and QoS levels may be realized when content consumption device detects that a lower QoS level is necessary or a higher QoS level is permissible then the content consumption device may simply request a segment at a different QoS level. Similarly the content consumption device may request different segments if a viewer of the content requests additional features such as different audio streams close captioning or the like. The content aggregator distributor server may respond by supplying the segment at the different QoS level rather than having to supply and re buffer the entire content . This allows the viewing of the content to take place in a more dynamic fashion without lengthy buffering or re buffering periods.

Returning to the encoded media may include a media presentation description MPD document. The MPD may describe a one or more periods where each period may represent a media content period during which a consistent set of encoded versions of the media content may be available. In other words the set of available bitrates languages captions subtitles or other QoS parameters or QoS levels may remain unchanged during the period . Although only a single period is depicted in other embodiments may have an MPD with multiple periods each having different available bitrates languages captions subtitles or other QoS parameters or QoS levels.

Within a period the media may be arranged into adaptation sets . The adaptation set may represent a set of interchangeable encoded versions of one or more media content components such as a video component an audio component etc. Other components such as captions or audio descriptions may likewise have a separate adaptation set . Although only a single adaptation set is shown in in other embodiments each period may comprise a plurality of adaptation sets .

Each adaptation set may comprise one or more representations . A representation may describe the deliverable encoded versions of one or several media content components of the content . For example a representation may include one or more media streams for each media content component such as audio components video components captions or audio descriptions. In general any single representation within an adaptation set may be sufficient to render the contained media content components. In embodiments each adaptation set may include a plurality of representations .

Each representation may be divided into one or more segments and . In general a segment and may be considered to be a largest unit of the encoded media that may be retrieved by a single HTTP request. In embodiments the segment may have a different length or duration than segment . In some embodiments the segment length may vary between representations such that the length of segment and in representation may be on the order of a few seconds while in another representation the length of a segment may be as long as the length of the representation or some value in between.

In embodiments each segment such as segment or segment may be encoded according to an ISO base media file format such as that defined in ISO IEC 14496 12 2012 in other embodiments other encoding schemes and or formats may be used to encode the segments and or . Specifically each segment such as segment or segment may comprise a plurality of SDBs such as SDBs and in the example of segment or SDBs and in the example of segment . In some embodiments the SDBs for example SDB may comprise a rule ID as described more fully with respect to .

As shown in as segment may comprise a plurality of SDBs such as SDB and SDB . In some embodiments a segment may include additional segment data . The SDBs for example SDB may comprise a segment data box identifier SDB ID which represents the type of SDB data the SDB includes. For example SDB data may include data such as for example one or more of segment index data scheme type data a protection system specific header media data movie fragments or other types of SDB data defined in the ISO base media file format the MPEG DASH specification or other segment specifications.

In some embodiments the SDB ID of a SDB such as SDB may identify the SDB as including a rule ID . In embodiments the rule ID may contain an identifier such as an Internet uniform resource locator URL or some other type of identifier that allows the content consumption device to access a blackout rule stored at a remote location. In various embodiments blackout rules may be stored at remote locations such as a content aggregator distributor server and or the blackout rule server .

In some embodiments the rule ID may contain information such as a blackout rule number and or a blackout rule version. In embodiments the blackout rule number may simply be an incrementing integer that identifies a unique blackout rule. The blackout rule version may include a version number that serves to differentiate between two different versions of the same blackout rule as described in further detail below. As an example if a blackout rule is the first blackout rule in a set of possible blackout rules and the version is the first version of the blackout rule then the rule ID may simply be 1 1 however different syntaxes may be used in different embodiments.

The SDB may be referred to as a universally unique identifier uuid SDB type and have a container format of a movie fragment SDB moof or user data SDB udta In some embodiments the SDB may include SDB data . In various embodiments the SDB data may include one or more of the following elements 

In some embodiment the segment timestamp and channel ID elements may be included in the SDB to prevent spoofing of the entire stream of encoded media . In other words the segment timestamp and channel ID elements may prevent a hacker from playing a stream of content from a first channel using the URL for a second channel or play a previous stream of content from a channel as current segments of the channel. In embodiments the content consumption device may already have the channel ID and the segment timestamp elements previously stored.

The SDB data may additionally or alternatively include authentication data such as a signature element that allows authentication of the SDB . For example when the content is encoded into encoded media the SDB may be signed by the encoder using a private key. This signature may be appended to the end of the SDB as SDB data or included elsewhere in the encoded media . In some embodiments the signature may additionally or alternatively include a segment timestamp or a channel ID in the SDB data . When the decoder of the content consumption device decodes the segment then the same private key or a corresponding public key may be used to verify the signature appended by the encoder . In this manner the rule ID contained within the SDB may be verified. By using this type of authentication and verification process it may be significantly harder for a third party to remove the rule ID and possibly replace it with an alternative rule ID pointing to a different blackout rule as described above. In embodiments if the content consumption device can not verify one or more of the signature the segment timestamp and the channel ID then the content consumption device may treat the segment as suspect and apply a default blackout rule to the segment or the encoded media .

In embodiments the blackout rule retrieved by the rule ID may contain information that provides for a blackout of the content . For example in certain cases content related to sporting events may be subject to a blackout period where the sporting event should not be shown in a certain geographical area or to a certain audience. As an example games of a sports team may be shown when the team is playing an away game but those same games may not be locally broadcast during a home game in order to maximize the number of people that go to the home games. Other content may likewise be subject to blackout periods for various reasons including religious ethical and or contractual obligations relating to the content .

As described above the blackout rule referred to by the rule ID may serve to enforce these blackout periods. In some embodiments the blackout rule itself may be written in JavaScript Object Notation JSON or some other programming language. In embodiments the blackout rule itself may have one or more of the following described elements 

The above described blackout rule elements provide several advantages. For example if the content relates to a live sporting event then the end time of the sporting event may be unknown for a variety of reasons such as overtime awards ceremonies and the like. Therefore a blackout rule may be initially published for example using the rule ID 1 1 which does not contain an end time or an expiration time. However as the sporting event nears its end the end time may be predicted more accurately. Therefore the rule ID may be updated to refer to a new version of the blackout rule e.g. 1 2 which includes an end time and or an expiration time for the blackout rule. If the content is divided into a plurality of segments each containing the rule ID then as segments are requested and retrieved the initial blackout rule 1 1 may be used to enforce the blackout of the content . When the blackout rule is updated with the end time and or expiration time then the content consumption device may receive a segment with an updated rule ID e.g. 1 2 which points to the updated blackout rule. In this manner the content consumption device may be able to dynamically determine when the blackout period should end.

In an alternative embodiment a blackout rule may be initially published for example using the rule ID 1 1 which does not contain an end time or an expiration time. In certain content for example sporting events the end of the content may occur too quickly to publish a new rule. Therefore a new rule ID could be inserted into segments that did not contain blackout information. In some embodiments this may be considered a null rule ID and serve as only a place holder in the segments for use for example with the signature and authentication process discussed above.

In other embodiments segments that are transmitted to the content consumption device may not carry a rule ID . In these embodiments the blackout rule would then be implicitly terminated because the content consumption device would not retrieve or enforce a blackout rule as directed by a rule ID . In some embodiments the implicit expiration of the blackout rule could provide the advantage of not requiring the creation and enforcement of an extra rule that directed the end of a blackout period thereby reducing time and or resources associated with the blackout. In some embodiments updated blackout rule 1 2 may contain different channel IDs or other elements that differ from blackout rule 1 1. 

In some embodiments by providing the region new channel ID JPEG URL and zip action elements the same blackout rule may perform different actions for different sets of viewers for example viewers in different regions or different zip codes. For example the same blackout rule may direct content consumption devices in one area to show a specific JPEG according to the region and JPEG URL elements while content consumption devices in another area may be identified by zip code and be directed to show a different channel according to new channel ID. As further examples a first set of viewers may be identified and shown a first JPEG URL as described above and a second set of viewers may be identified and shown a second JPEG URL. In other embodiments the blackout period may start for the different sets of viewers so a first set of viewers may receive a preview period at the beginning of the content while a second set of viewers does not receive the preview period. Other embodiments may have different combinations of the above described elements and action elements and provide additional advantages.

In some embodiments these different actions or elements may be the result of different rule IDs in the same segment which refer to different blackout rules. For example even though several embodiments described above are described as only having a single rule ID per segment in some embodiments a segment may contain a plurality of rule IDs which may be the same or different from one another. As an example a segment may have a first rule ID that indicates a first blackout rule for a first set of viewers and a second rule ID that indicates a second blackout rule for a second set of viewers. In these embodiments the rule IDs may indicate different blackout rules that provide different blackout experiences to different sets of users as described above.

In some embodiments when the new channel ID element is used to redirect a content consumption device from a first channel to a second channel then segments of the content in the second channel may carry a rule ID referring to the same blackout rule as the first channel. By using the same blackout rule the content consumption device may remain tuned to the second channel. In some embodiments the content consumption device may retain knowledge of the fact that it was originally tuned to the first channel. Therefore when the blackout rule is ended either by the end time element described above a null rule ID a missing rule ID or some other method then the content consumption device may retune back to the first channel.

The content consumption device may authenticate a rule ID in the segment at . In various embodiments the authentication may be performed for example using one or more of the signature the channel ID and the timestamp included in the SDB data of the SDB of the segment .

After the rule ID has been authenticated then the content consumption device may retrieve the blackout rule identified by the rule ID at . As described above the blackout rule may be retrieved in various embodiments from the content aggregator distributor server and or a blackout rule server .

After the blackout rule has been retrieved the content consumption device may determine whether the blackout rule indicates that access to the encoded media e.g. the segment including the rule ID should be limited at . In other words the content consumption device may determine whether the blackout rule describes a blackout period for the encoded media .

If the blackout rule does not indicate that the encoded media should be blacked out then the content consumption device may display the content at for example by decoding it using decoder and displaying it on display . However if the blackout rule does indicate that the content should be blacked out then the content consumption device may perform an access limiting or blackout function at such as showing a different channel retrieving a URL or one of the other actions indicated by an element of the blackout rule as described above.

In some embodiments one or more application programming interfaces APIs may be utilized to implement process of . In other embodiments other interfaces and or operations may be utilized for implementing the processes and techniques described herein. For example a server such as a content aggregator distributor server and or a separate blackout rule server may utilize the following APIs 

Although certain elements sub elements SDB data and APIs are described above in other embodiments similar elements may have different names for one or more of the elements sub elements SDB data and or APIs. Additionally other embodiments may have more or less elements sub elements SDB data and or APIs while in some embodiments one or more of the elements sub elements SDB data and or APIs may be divided into separate pieces or combined. For example the start time and end time blackout rule elements may be combined in one embodiment. In other embodiments the zips sub element may be divided into sub elements such as partial zips and complete zips. The specific names and descriptions above are examples of one embodiment and should not be construed as complete or total.

The elements may be coupled to each other via system bus which may represent one or more buses. In the case of multiple buses they may be bridged by one or more bus bridges not shown .

Each of these elements may perform its conventional functions known in the art. In particular system memory and mass storage devices may be employed to store a working copy and a permanent copy of the programming instructions implementing the operations associated with content aggregator distributor server the blackout rule server or the content consumption device . The various elements may be implemented by assembler instructions supported by processor s or high level languages such as for example C that can be compiled into such instructions.

That is one or more distribution media having an implementation of the agent program may be employed to distribute the agent and program various computing devices.

The number capability and or capacity of these elements may vary depending on whether computer is used as a content aggregator distributor server a blackout rule server or a content consumption device whether the content consumption device is a stationary or mobile device like a smartphone computing tablet ultrabook or laptop. Their constitutions are otherwise known and accordingly will not be further described.
