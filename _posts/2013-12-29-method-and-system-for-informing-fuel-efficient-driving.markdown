This application claims priority to and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10 2013 0099150 filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Aug. 21 2013 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to a method and a system for informing fuel efficient driving and more particularly to a method and a system for informing fuel efficient driving which analyze a driving propensity of a driver and display a fuel efficiency analysis result.

Drivers today are interested in fuel efficiency due to the rapid increase in oil prices. As the interest in the fuel efficiency increases various technologies for improving the fuel efficiency are being developed. For example an idle stop and go ISG device which stops an engine when a vehicle stops and starts the engine when the vehicle begins to run has been developed. However even though a technology of improving fuel efficiency is applied to a vehicle an effect of improving fuel efficiency may not be sufficient when a significant between a driving propensity of the driver and fuel efficient driving exists.

In general drivers tend to have different driving propensities. Therefore even though the vehicle types may be the same fuel efficiency of the vehicles may be differ based on the driving propensity of the driver. For example when a driver frequently performs rapid acceleration and rapid deceleration fuel consumption increases. In addition since the driving propensity of the driver is not always uniform but may be based on changes such as the mood of the driver sudden changes in the driving intention or a road condition fuel efficiency also changes. Therefore it may be difficult to modify the driving propensity of the driver to improve the fuel efficiency by simply informing the driver of the present fuel efficiency.

The above information disclosed in this section is merely for enhancement of understanding of the background of the invention and therefore it may contain information that does not form the prior art that is already known in this country to a person of ordinary skill in the art.

The driver terminal may be a wireless communication device such as a telematics terminal a smart phone a tablet personal computer PC or a personal digital assistant PDA . The driver terminal may include a data collector a vehicle context data manager a memory a communicator an input interface an output display and a terminal controller configured to execute the other elements of the driver terminal .

In particular the data collector may be configured to collect vehicle context data from an electronic control unit ECU a body control module BCM a cluster a navigation system a power train and the like which may be installed within a vehicle. The vehicle context data collected by the data collector may be transmitted to the vehicle context data manager . The vehicle context data may include fuel consumption per second a current vehicle speed a shift speed currently engaged acceleration of the vehicle an accelerator pedal position a brake pedal position a current vehicle position an engine speed and the like. The vehicle speed may be directly detected by a vehicle speed sensor installed separately or may be calculated based on a global positioning system GPS signal received by the navigation system. The acceleration of the vehicle may be directly detected by an acceleration sensor installed separately from the vehicle speed sensor or may be calculated by differentiating the vehicle speed.

The vehicle context data manager may include a data buffer and a data filter and may be configured to selectively collect data by which the driving propensity of a driver is able to be determined among the vehicle context data collected by the data collector . In addition the vehicle context data manager may be configured to provide an abstraction hierarchy and convert the vehicle context data into a form defined by an application programming interface API to allow the management server to recognize the vehicle context data. The vehicle context data manager may be configured to calculate a fuel efficiency influencing factor based on the vehicle context data. The fuel efficiency influencing factor may be a factor that influences fuel efficiency and may include a driving time after starting an engine an idling time a preheating time a rapid acceleration time a rapid deceleration time a driving distance after starting the engine and the like.

The vehicle context data manager may further be configured to divide the driving time after starting the engine into n pieces based on the fuel consumption per second. For example the vehicle context data manager may be configured to divide the driving time after starting the engine into a first time a second time and a third time based on the fuel consumption per second. For example the first time may be a driving time calculated when the fuel consumption per second is lower than a first threshold value e.g. when fuel efficiency is substantially high . The second time may be a driving time calculated when the fuel consumption per second is between the first threshold value and a second threshold value e.g. a normal case . The third time may be a driving time calculated when the fuel consumption per second is greater than the second threshold value e.g. when fuel efficiency is substantially low .

The first threshold value and the second threshold value may be set as values that those skilled in the art may determine in consideration of vehicle types. Furthermore the driving time after starting the engine may be further subdivided if necessary. Accordingly the vehicle context data manager may be implemented as at least one microprocessor operated by a predetermined program and the predetermined program may include a series of commands for performing a method of managing the vehicle context data.

The memory may be configured to store a vehicle type a driver identification ID and the like. In addition the memory may be configured to store the data collected by the data collector and or the vehicle context data manager . The communicator may be configured to transmit the fuel efficiency influencing factor calculated by the vehicle context data manager to the management server via a wired or wireless communication network. In addition the communicator may be configured to receive the fuel efficiency analysis data from the management server .

The input interface may be configured to receive a command for informing fuel efficient driving from the driver and transmit the command to the terminal controller . The input interface may be implemented as a touch screen a keypad or the like. As the output display a liquid crystal display LCD or the like may be used and the output display may be configured to visually display a fuel efficiency analysis result to the driver.

The terminal controller may be configured to operate the driver terminal . The terminal controller may be configured to operate the output display to inform the driver of the fuel efficient driving. Accordingly the terminal controller may be implemented as at least one microprocessor operated by a predetermined program and the predetermined program may include a series of commands for performing each step included in a method for informing the fuel efficient driving.

The management server may include a communication unit an authentication unit a driving propensity analyzing unit a driving propensity comparing unit a database and a controller . In particular the communication unit may be configured to receive the fuel efficiency influencing factor from the driver terminal via a wired or wireless communication network. The received fuel efficiency influencing factor may be stored and classified in the database . In other words as the data received from a plurality of driver terminals increases the data accumulated in the database increases. The authentication unit may be configured to perform driver authentication in response to an authentication request of the driver terminal . The authentication unit may be configured to perform an authentication procedure based on driver authentication information registered in advance and the received driver ID. After performing the authentication procedure the fuel efficiency influencing factor for each driver and or for each vehicle type may be stored in the database .

The driving propensity analyzing unit may be configured to analyze a driving propensity of the driver based on the data accumulated in the database and produce fuel efficiency analysis data. The fuel efficiency analysis data may be stored in the database . The driving propensity analyzing unit may be configured to convert the fuel efficiency analysis data into a form of an API for a fuel efficiency related service. The fuel efficiency analysis data may include a fuel efficient driving index a first time ratio a second time ratio a third time ratio an idling time ratio a preheating time ratio a rapid acceleration time ratio a rapid deceleration time ratio and the like. The driving propensity analyzing unit may be configured to calculate the fuel efficient driving index the first time ratio the second time ratio the third time ratio the idling time ratio the preheating time ratio the rapid acceleration time ratio and the rapid deceleration time ratio for each predetermined period e.g. daily weekly monthly or yearly .

An example in which the driving propensity analyzing unit calculates the fuel efficient driving index is shown in Table 1 but the present invention is not necessarily limited thereto. The examples shows that the first time is about 200 sec the second time is about 100 sec the third time is about 40 sec a total driving time is about 340 sec and the idling time is about 60 sec will be described below.

The driving propensity analyzing unit may be configured to calculate the first time ratio 71.42857143 the second time ratio 14.28571429 and the third time ratio 14.28571429 based on the total driving time. In particular the driving propensity analyzing unit may be configured to consider the idling time when the second time ratio is calculated. Therefore as the idling time increases a low fuel efficient driving index may be calculated.

Further the driving propensity analyzing unit may be configured to calculate the fuel efficient driving indexes by applying indexation reference coefficients set differently based on the first time the second time and the third time. For example an indexation reference coefficient set to the first time may be about 1.1 an indexation reference coefficient set to the second time may be about 0.8 and an indexation reference coefficient set to the third time may be about 0.2. Particularly the indexation reference coefficient may be set as a value that those skilled in the art may determine.

In addition the driving propensity analyzing unit may be configured to set a maximum value and a minimum value of the fuel efficient driving index. For example the maximum value of the fuel efficient driving index may be about 100 and the minimum value of the fuel efficient driving index may be about 60. Therefore the fuel efficient driving index may be calculated as about 100 when the fuel efficient driving index is greater than about 100 and as about 60 when the fuel efficient driving index is less than about 60. The driver may modify the driver s driving propensity to increase the driver s fuel efficient driving index. Accordingly the driving propensity analyzing unit may be implemented as at least one microprocessor operated by a predetermined program and the predetermined program may include a series of commands for performing a method of analyzing the driving propensity of the driver.

The driving propensity comparing unit may be configured to compare the fuel efficiency analysis data of an individual driver and the fuel efficiency analysis data of drivers having the same vehicle types and produce first comparison data. In addition the driving propensity comparing unit may be configured to compare the fuel efficiency analysis data of the individual driver and the fuel efficiency analysis data of a plurality of the drivers and produce second comparison data. In other words by grouping the drivers base on a predetermined reference the driving propensity comparing unit may be configured to produce data obtained by comparing the driving propensity of the individual driver and the driving propensities of the plurality of the drivers.

For example the driving propensity comparing unit may be configured to set rankings of the plurality of the drivers based on the first time ratio and the individual driver may confirm the driver s ranking to determine whether to perform the fuel efficient driving. In addition the driving propensity comparing unit may be configured to produce data obtained by comparing the fuel efficient driving index of the individual driver and an average fuel efficient driving index of the drivers having the same vehicle types. Accordingly the driving propensity comparing unit may be implemented as at least one microprocessor operated by a predetermined program and the predetermined program may include a series of commands for performing a method of comparing the driving propensity of the driver.

The controller e.g. a first controller or a management controller may be configured to operate the management server . The controller may be configured to provide the fuel efficiency analysis data to the driver terminal via the communication unit . In addition the controller may be configured to provide the fuel efficiency analysis data via a web page. Accordingly the controller may be implemented as at least one microprocessor operated by a predetermined program and the predetermined program may include a series of commands for performing each step included in a method for informing the fuel efficient driving.

Based on the vehicle context data collected by the data collector the vehicle context data manager may be configured to calculate a fuel efficiency influencing factor that includes a driving time after starting the engine S . The fuel efficiency influencing factor may further include a first driving time a second driving time a third driving time an idling time a preheating time a rapid acceleration time a rapid deceleration time a driving distance after starting the engine and the like. The communicator may be configured to transmit the fuel efficiency influencing factor in conjunction with the communication unit S . Additionally the controller may be configured to store the fuel efficiency influencing factor in the database S .

The driving propensity analyzing unit may be configured to analyze a driving propensity of the driver based on the data accumulated in the database and produce fuel efficiency analysis data S . The fuel efficiency analysis data may include the fuel efficient driving index the first time ratio the second time ratio the third time ratio the idling time ratio the preheating time ratio the rapid acceleration time ratio the rapid deceleration time ratio and the like. The driving propensity analyzing unit may also be configured to calculate the fuel efficient driving index based on a total driving time a first driving time a second driving time a third driving time an idling time and a predetermined indexation reference coefficient.

Further the driving propensity comparing unit may be configured to compare the fuel efficiency analysis data of the individual driver and the fuel efficiency analysis data of a plurality of the drivers S . In addition the driving propensity comparing unit may be configured to compare the fuel efficiency analysis data of the individual driver and the fuel efficiency analysis data of the drivers have the same vehicle type. In other words by grouping the drivers based on a predetermined reference the driving propensity comparing unit may be configured to produce data obtained by comparing the driving propensity of the individual driver and the driving propensities of a plurality of the drivers.

The communication unit may be configured to transmit the fuel efficiency analysis data in conjunction with the communicator S . In addition the communication unit may be configured to transmit the first comparison data and or the second comparison data in conjunction with the communicator . The output display may be configured to display a fuel efficiency analysis result based on an operate of the terminal controller S . In addition the management controller may be configured to provide the fuel efficiency analysis result via a web page. In particular based on the fuel efficiency analysis data the terminal controller may be configured to display a warning to the driver by operating the output display when a driving state of the driver is not a fuel efficient driving state. In other words reference values which may be references for determining the fuel efficient driving state may be set with respect to the fuel efficient driving index the first time ratio the second time ratio the third time ratio the idling time ratio the preheating time ratio the rapid acceleration time ratio and the rapid deceleration time ratio respectively. The reference values which may be references for determining the fuel efficient driving state may be set as values that those skilled in the art may determine.

For example the terminal controller may be configured to display a warning to the driver by operating the output display when the fuel efficient driving index is less than a predetermined first reference value. In addition the terminal controller may be configured to display a warning to the driver by operating the output display when the idling time ratio is greater than a predetermined second reference value. Therefore the driver may recognize a reason that affects current fuel efficiency e.g. may determine what influencing factor is affecting the fuel efficiency . The terminal controller may be configured to release the warning display based on an input of the driver via the input interface .

As described above according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention the driver may be provided with the past record and the present record of the driver or a result obtained by comparing the driver with other drivers and may have an active fuel efficient driving habit by determining whether the driver s driving propensity is advantageous to perform the fuel efficient driving regarding fuel efficiency. In addition the driver may be informed of information regarding factors that influence fuel efficiency such as the idling time the rapid acceleration time and the rapid deceleration time and may be guided to perform the fuel efficient driving based on those factors.
