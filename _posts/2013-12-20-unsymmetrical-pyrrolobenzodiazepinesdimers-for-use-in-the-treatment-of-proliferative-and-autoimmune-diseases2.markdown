The present invention relates to pyrrolobenzodiazepines PBDs and their inclusion in targeted conjugates. The PBDs of the present invention are in a mixed dimer where one PBD moiety comprises an imine or equivalent group and the other moiety comprises either an amine or amido group. The PBDs are linked to a cell binding agent via a substituent on the C2 position.

Some pyrrolobenzodiazepines PBDs have the ability to recognise and bond to specific sequences of DNA the preferred sequence is PuGPu. The first PBD antitumour antibiotic anthramycin was discovered in 1965 Leimgruber et al. 87 5793 5795 1965 Leimgruber et al. 87 5791 5793 1965 . Since then a number of naturally occurring PBDs have been reported and numerous synthetic routes have been developed to a variety of analogues Thurston et al. 1994 433 465 1994 Antonow D. and Thurston D. E. 2011 111 4 2815 2864 . Family members include abbeymycin Hochlowski et al. 40 145 148 1987 chicamycin Konishi et al. 37 200 206 1984 DC 81 Japanese Patent 58 180 487 Thurston et al. 26 767 772 1990 Bose et al. 48 751 758 1992 mazethramycin Kuminoto et al. 33 665 667 1980 neothramycins A and B Takeuchi et al. 29 93 96 1976 porothramycin Tsunakawa et al. 41 1366 1373 1988 prothracarcin Shimizu et al 29 2492 2503 1982 Langley and Thurston 52 91 97 1987 sibanomicin DC 102 Hara et al. 41 702 704 1988 Itoh et al. 41 1281 1284 1988 sibiromycin Leber et al. 110 2992 2993 1988 and tomamycin Arima et al. 25 437 444 1972 . PBDs are of the general structure 

They differ in the number type and position of substituents in both their aromatic A rings and pyrrolo C rings and in the degree of saturation of the C ring. In the B ring there is either an imine N C a carbinolamine NH CH OH or a carbinolamine methyl ether NH CH OMe at the N10 C11 position which is the electrophilic centre responsible for alkylating DNA. All of the known natural products have an S configuration at the chiral C11a position which provides them with a right handed twist when viewed from the C ring towards the A ring. This gives them the appropriate three dimensional shape for isohelicity with the minor groove of B form DNA leading to a snug fit at the binding site Kohn In . Springer Verlag New York pp. 3 11 1975 Hurley and Needham VanDeventer 19 230 237 1986 . Their ability to form an adduct in the minor groove enables them to interfere with DNA processing hence their use as antitumour agents.

It has been previously disclosed that the biological activity of these molecules can be potentiated by joining two PBD units together through their C8 C hydroxyl functionalities via a flexible alkylene linker Bose D. S. et al. 114 4939 4941 1992 Thurston D. E. et al. 61 8141 8147 1996 . The PBD dimers are thought to form sequence selective DNA lesions such as the palindromic 5 Pu GATC Py 3 interstrand cross link Smellie M. et al. 42 8232 8239 2003 Martin C. et al. 44 4135 4147 which is thought to be mainly responsible for their biological activity.

The present invention provides Conjugates comprising a PBD dimer connected to a Ligand unit via a Linker unit. In one embodiment the Linker unit includes a Stretcher unit A a Specificity unit L and a Spacer unit L . The Linker unit is connected at one end to the Ligand unit L and at the other end to the PBD dimer compound D .

The following preferences may apply to all aspects of the invention as described above or may relate to a single aspect. The preferences may be combined together in any combination.

The present invention is suitable for use in providing a PBD compound to a preferred site in a subject. In the preferred embodiments the conjugate allows the release of an active PBD compound that does not retain any part of the linker. There is no stub present that could affect the reactivity of the PBD compound.

In certain embodiments the invention provides conjugates comprising a PBD dimer group having a linker connected to a cell binding agent. The present inventors describe herein methods of synthesis that enable such dimer conjugates to be prepared.

The linker attaches the Ligand Unit L e.g. antibody to the PBD drug moiety D through covalent bond s . The linker is a bifunctional or multifunctional moiety which can be used to link one or more drug moiety D and an antibody unit Ab to form antibody drug conjugates ADC . The linker may be stable outside a cell i.e. extracellular or it may be cleavable by enzymatic activity hydrolysis or other metabolic conditions. Antibody drug conjugates ADC can be conveniently prepared using a linker having reactive functionality for binding to the drug moiety and to the antibody. A cysteine thiol or an amine e.g. N terminus or amino acid side chain such as lysine of the antibody Ab can form a bond with a functional group of a linker or spacer reagent PBD drug moiety D or drug linker reagent D R .

The linkers of the ADC preferably prevent aggregation of ADC molecules and keep the ADC freely soluble in aqueous media and in a monomeric state.

The linkers of the ADC are preferably stable extracellularly. Before transport or delivery into a cell the antibody drug conjugate ADC is preferably stable and remains intact i.e. the antibody remains linked to the drug moiety. The linkers are stable outside the target cell and may be cleaved at some efficacious rate inside the cell. An effective linker will i maintain the specific binding properties of the antibody ii allow intracellular delivery of the conjugate or drug moiety iii remain stable and intact i.e. not cleaved until the conjugate has been delivered or transported to its targetted site and iv maintain a cytotoxic cell killing effect or a cytostatic effect of the PBD drug moiety. Stability of the ADC may be measured by standard analytical techniques such as mass spectroscopy HPLC and the separation analysis technique LC MS.

Covalent attachment of the antibody and the drug moiety requires the linker to have two reactive functional groups i.e. bivalency in a reactive sense. Bivalent linker reagents which are useful to attach two or more functional or biologically active moieties such as peptides nucleic acids drugs toxins antibodies haptens and reporter groups are known and methods have been described their resulting conjugates Hermanson G. T. 1996 Bioconjugate Techniques Academic Press New York p 234 242 .

In another embodiment the linker may be substituted with groups which modulate aggregation solubility or reactivity. For example a sulfonate substituent may increase water solubility of the reagent and facilitate the coupling reaction of the linker reagent with the antibody or the drug moiety or facilitate the coupling reaction of Ab L with D or D L with Ab depending on the synthetic route employed to prepare the ADC.

The dipeptide then is a recognition site for cathepsin.

Other dipeptide combinations may be used including those described by Dubowchik et al. which is incorporated herein by reference.

In one embodiment the amino acid side chain is chemically protected where appropriate. The side chain protecting group may be a group as discussed below.

In one embodiment the side chain protecting groups are removable with other protecting groups in the compound where present. In other embodiments the protecting groups may be orthogonal to other protecting groups in the molecule where present.

Suitable protecting groups for amino acid side chains include those groups described in the Novabiochem Catalog 2006 2007. Protecting groups for use in a cathepsin labile linker are also discussed in Dubowchik et al.

In certain embodiments of the invention the group Lincludes a Lys amino acid residue. The side chain of this amino acid may be protected with a Boc or Alloc protected group. A Boc protecting group is most preferred.

The Ligand Unit may be of any kind and include a protein polypeptide peptide and a non peptidic agent that specifically binds to a target molecule. In some embodiments the Ligand unit may be a protein polypeptide or peptide. In some embodiments the Ligand unit may be a cyclic polypeptide. These Ligand units can include antibodies or a fragment of an antibody that contains at least one target molecule binding site lymphokines hormones growth factors or any other cell binding molecule or substance that can specifically bind to a target. The ligand Unit is also referred to herein as a binding agent or targeting agent .

The terms specifically binds and specific binding refer to the binding of an antibody or other protein polypeptide or peptide to a predetermined molecule e.g. an antigen . Typically the antibody or other molecule binds with an affinity of at least about 1 10M and binds to the predetermined molecule with an affinity that is at least two fold greater than its affinity for binding to a non specific molecule e.g. BSA casein other than the predetermined molecule or a closely related molecule.

Examples of Ligand units include those agents described for use in WO 2007 085930 which is incorporated herein.

In some embodiments the Ligand unit is a Cell Binding Agent that binds to an extracellular target on a cell. Such a Cell Binding Agent can be a protein polypeptide peptide or a non peptidic agent. In some embodiments the Cell Binding Agent may be a protein polypeptide or peptide. In some embodiments the Cell Binding Agent may be a cyclic polypeptide. The Cell Binding Agent also may be antibody or an antigen binding fragment of an antibody. Thus in one embodiment the present invention provides an antibody drug conjugate ADC .

In one embodiment the cell binding agent is a linear or cyclic peptide comprising 4 30 preferably 6 20 contiguous amino acid residues. In this embodiment it is preferred that one cell binding agent is linked to one monomer or dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine compound.

In one embodiment the cell binding agent comprises a peptide that binds integrin . The peptide may be selective for over XYS.

In one embodiment the cell binding agent comprises the A20FMDV Cys polypeptide. The A20FMDV Cys has the sequence NAVPNLRGDLQVLAQKVARTC. Alternatively a variant of the A20FMDV Cys sequence may be used wherein one two three four five six seven eight nine or ten amino acid residues are substituted with another amino acid residue. Furthermore the polypeptide may have the sequence NAVXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXRTC.

The term antibody herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies dimers multimers multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific antibodies and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity Miller et al 2003 170 4854 4861 . Antibodies may be murine human humanized chimeric or derived from other species. An antibody is a protein generated by the immune system that is capable of recognizing and binding to a specific antigen. Janeway C. Travers P. Walport M. Shlomchik 2001 5th Ed. Garland Publishing New York . A target antigen generally has numerous binding sites also called epitopes recognized by CDRs on multiple antibodies. Each antibody that specifically binds to a different epitope has a different structure. Thus one antigen may have more than one corresponding antibody. An antibody includes a full length immunoglobulin molecule or an immunologically active portion of a full length immunoglobulin molecule i.e. a molecule that contains an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen of a target of interest or part thereof such targets including but not limited to cancer cell or cells that produce autoimmune antibodies associated with an autoimmune disease. The immunoglobulin can be of any type e.g. IgG IgE IgM IgD and IgA class e.g. IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA1 and IgA2 or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. The immunoglobulins can be derived from any species including human murine or rabbit origin.

 Antibody fragments comprise a portion of a full length antibody generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab and scFv fragments diabodies linear antibodies fragments produced by a Fab expression library anti idiotypic anti Id antibodies CDR complementary determining region and epitope binding fragments of any of the above which immunospecifically bind to cancer cell antigens viral antigens or microbial antigens single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al 1975 256 495 or may be made by recombinant DNA methods see U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 . The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al 1991 Nature 352 624 628 Marks et al 1991 J. Mol. Biol. 222 581 597 or from transgenic mice carrying a fully human immunoglobulin system Lonberg 2008 Curr. Opinion 20 4 450 459 .

The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include chimeric antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al 1984 81 6851 6855 . Chimeric antibodies include primatized antibodies comprising variable domain antigen binding sequences derived from a non human primate e.g. Old World Monkey or Ape and human constant region sequences.

An intact antibody herein is one comprising a VL and VH domains as well as a light chain constant domain CL and heavy chain constant domains CH1 CH2 and CH3. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains e.g. human native sequence constant domains or amino acid sequence variant thereof. The intact antibody may have one or more effector functions which refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding complement dependent cytotoxicity Fc receptor binding antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC phagocytosis and down regulation of cell surface receptors such as B cell receptor and BCR.

Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains intact antibodies can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of intact antibodies IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM and several of these may be further divided into subclasses isotypes e.g. IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA and IgA2. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called and respectively. The subunit structures and three dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.

Techniques to reduce the in vivo immunogenicity of a non human antibody or antibody fragment include those termed humanization .

A humanized antibody refers to a polypeptide comprising at least a portion of a modified variable region of a human antibody wherein a portion of the variable region preferably a portion substantially less than the intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species and wherein the modified variable region is linked to at least another part of another protein preferably the constant region of a human antibody. The expression humanized antibodies includes human antibodies in which one or more complementarity determining region CDR amino acid residues and or one or more framework region FW or FR amino acid residues are substituted by amino acid residues from analogous sites in rodent or other non human antibodies. The expression humanized antibody also includes an immunoglobulin amino acid sequence variant or fragment thereof that comprises an FR having substantially the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and a CDR having substantially the amino acid sequence of a non human immunoglobulin.

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. Or looked at another way a humanized antibody is a human antibody that also contains selected sequences from non human e.g. murine antibodies in place of the human sequences. A humanized antibody can include conservative amino acid substitutions or non natural residues from the same or different species that do not significantly alter its binding and or biologic activity. Such antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulins.

There are a range of humanization techniques including CDR grafting guided selection deimmunization resurfacing also known as Veneering composite antibodies Human String Content Optimisation and framework shuffling.

In this technique the humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a complementary determining region CDR of the recipient antibody are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat camel bovine goat or rabbit having the desired properties in effect the non human CDRs are grafted onto the human framework . In some instances framework region FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues this may happen when for example a particular FR residue has significant effect on antigen binding .

Furthermore humanized antibodies can comprise residues that are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications are made to further refine and maximize antibody performance. Thus in general a humanized antibody will comprise all of at least one and in one aspect two variable domains in which all or all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc or that of a human immunoglobulin.

The method consists of combining the Vor Vdomain of a given non human antibody specific for a particular epitope with a human Vor Vlibrary and specific human V domains are selected against the antigen of interest. This selected human VH is then combined with a VL library to generate a completely human VH VL combination. The method is described in Nature Biotechnology N.Y. 12 1994 899 903.

In this method two or more segments of amino acid sequence from a human antibody are combined within the final antibody molecule. They are constructed by combining multiple human VH and VL sequence segments in combinations which limit or avoid human T cell epitopes in the final composite antibody V regions. Where required T cell epitopes are limited or avoided by exchanging V region segments contributing to or encoding a T cell epitope with alternative segments which avoid T cell epitopes. This method is described in US 2008 0206239 A1.

This method involves the removal of human or other second species T cell epitopes from the V regions of the therapeutic antibody or other molecule . The therapeutic antibodies V region sequence is analysed for the presence of MHC class II binding motifs by for example comparison with databases of MHC binding motifs such as the motifs database hosted at www.wehi.edu.au . Alternatively MHC class II binding motifs may be identified using computational threading methods such as those devised by Altuvia et al. J. Mol. Biol. 249 244 250 1995 in these methods consecutive overlapping peptides from the V region sequences are testing for their binding energies to MHC class II proteins. This data can then be combined with information on other sequence features which relate to successfully presented peptides such as amphipathicity Rothbard motifs and cleavage sites for cathepsin B and other processing enzymes.

Once potential second species e.g. human T cell epitopes have been identified they are eliminated by the alteration of one or more amino acids. The modified amino acids are usually within the T cell epitope itself but may also be adjacent to the epitope in terms of the primary or secondary structure of the protein and therefore may not be adjacent in the primary structure . Most typically the alteration is by way of substitution but in some circumstances amino acid addition or deletion will be more appropriate.

All alterations can be accomplished by recombinant DNA technology so that the final molecule may be prepared by expression from a recombinant host using well established methods such as Site Directed Mutagenesis. However the use of protein chemistry or any other means of molecular alteration is also possible.

The method compares the non human sequence with the functional human germline gene repertoire. Those human genes encoding canonical structures identical or closely related to the non human sequences are selected. Those selected human genes with highest homology within the CDRs are chosen as FR donors. Finally the non human CDRs are grafted onto these human FRs. This method is described in patent WO 2005 079479 A2.

This method compares the non human e.g. mouse sequence with the repertoire of human germline genes and the differences are scored as Human String Content HSC that quantifies a sequence at the level of potential MHC T cell epitopes. The target sequence is then humanized by maximizing its HSC rather than using a global identity measure to generate multiple diverse humanized variants described in Molecular Immunology 44 2007 1986 1998 .

The CDRs of the non human antibody are fused in frame to cDNA pools encompassing all known heavy and light chain human germline gene frameworks. Humanised antibodies are then selected by e.g. panning of the phage displayed antibody library. This is described in 36 43 60 2005 .

The parent antibody may also be a fusion protein comprising an albumin binding peptide ABP sequence Dennis et al. 2002 Albumin Binding As A General Strategy For Improving The Pharmacokinetics Of Proteins 277 35035 35043 WO 01 45746 . Antibodies of the invention include fusion proteins with ABP sequences taught by i Dennis et al 2002 277 35035 35043 at Tables III and IV page 35038 ii US 2004 0001827 at 0076 and iii WO 01 45746 at pages 12 13 and all of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The cell binding agent may be labelled for example to aid detection or purification of the agent either prior to incorporation as a conjugate or as part of the conjugate. The label may be a biotin label. In another embodiment the cell binding agent may be labelled with a radioisotope.

The cell binding agent is connected to the linker. In one embodiment the cell binding agent is connected to A where present of the linker.

In one embodiment the connection between the cell binding agent and the linker is through a thioether bond.

In one embodiment the connection between the cell binding agent and the linker is through a disulfide bond.

In one embodiment the connection between the cell binding agent and the linker is through an amide bond.

In one embodiment the connection between the cell binding agent and the linker is through an ester bond.

In one embodiment the connection between the cell binding agent and the linker is formed between a thiol group of a cysteine residue of the cell binding agent and a maleimide group of the linker.

The cysteine residues of the cell binding agent may be available for reaction with the functional group of Rto form a connection. In other embodiments for example where the cell binding agent is an antibody the thiol groups of the antibody may participate in interchain disulfide bonds. These interchain bonds may be converted to free thiol groups by e.g. treatment of the antibody with DTT prior to reaction with the functional group of R.

The cell binding agent may be labelled for example to aid detection or purification of the agent either prior to incorporation as a conjugate or as part of the conjugate. The label may be a biotin label. In another embodiment the cell binding agent may be labelled with a radioisotope.

The drug loading is the average number of PBD drugs per cell binding agent e.g. antibody. Where the compounds of the invention are bound to cysteines drug loading may range from 1 to 8 drugs D per cell binding agent i.e. where 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 drug moieties are covalently attached to the cell binding agent. Compositions of conjugates include collections of cell binding agents e.g. antibodies conjugated with a range of drugs from 1 to 8. Where the compounds of the invention are bound to lysines drug loading may range from 1 to 80 drugs D per cell binding agent although an upper limit of 40 20 10 or 8 may be preferred. Compositions of conjugates include collections of cell binding agents e.g. antibodies conjugated with a range of drugs from 1 to 80 1 to 40 1 to 20 1 to 10 or 1 to 8.

The average number of drugs per antibody in preparations of ADC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as UV reverse phase HPLC HIC mass spectroscopy ELISA assay and electrophoresis. The quantitative distribution of ADC in terms of p may also be determined. By ELISA the averaged value of p in a particular preparation of ADC may be determined Hamblett et al 2004 Clin. Cancer Res. 10 7063 7070 Sanderson et al 2005 Clin. Cancer Res. 11 843 852 . However the distribution of p drug values is not discernible by the antibody antigen binding and detection limitation of ELISA. Also ELISA assay for detection of antibody drug conjugates does not determine where the drug moieties are attached to the antibody such as the heavy chain or light chain fragments or the particular amino acid residues. In some instances separation purification and characterization of homogeneous ADC where p is a certain value from ADC with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis. Such techniques are also applicable to other types of conjugates.

For some antibody drug conjugates p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. Higher drug loading e.g. p 5 may cause aggregation insolubility toxicity or loss of cellular permeability of certain antibody drug conjugates.

Typically fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain for example many lysine residues that do not react with the drug linker intermediate D L or linker reagent. Only the most reactive lysine groups may react with an amine reactive linker reagent. Also only the most reactive cysteine thiol groups may react with a thiol reactive linker reagent. Generally antibodies do not contain many if any free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety. Most cysteine thiol residues in the antibodies of the compounds exist as disulfide bridges and must be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol DTT or TCEP under partial or total reducing conditions. The loading drug antibody ratio of an ADC may be controlled in several different manners including i limiting the molar excess of drug linker intermediate D L or linker reagent relative to antibody ii limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature and iii partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification.

Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT dithiothreitol . Each cysteine bridge will thus form theoretically two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody or fragment thereof by engineering one two three four or more cysteine residues e.g. preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non native cysteine amino acid residues . U.S. Pat. No. 7 521 541 teaches engineering antibodies by introduction of reactive cysteine amino acids.

Cysteine amino acids may be engineered at reactive sites in an antibody and which do not form intrachain or intermolecular disulfide linkages Junutula et al. 2008b Nature Biotech. 26 8 925 932 Dornan et al 2009 Blood 114 13 2721 2729 U.S. Pat. No. 7 521 541 U.S. Pat. No. 7 723 485 WO2009 052249 . The engineered cysteine thiols may react with linker reagents or the drug linker reagents of the present invention which have thiol reactive electrophilic groups such as maleimide or alpha halo amides to form ADC with cysteine engineered antibodies and the PBD drug moieties. The location of the drug moiety can thus be designed controlled and known. The drug loading can be controlled since the engineered cysteine thiol groups typically react with thiol reactive linker reagents or drug linker reagents in high yield. Engineering an IgG antibody to introduce a cysteine amino acid by substitution at a single site on the heavy or light chain gives two new cysteines on the symmetrical antibody. A drug loading near 2 can be achieved with near homogeneity of the conjugation product ADC.

Where more than one nucleophilic or electrophilic group of the antibody reacts with a drug linker intermediate or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent then the resulting product is a mixture of ADC compounds with a distribution of drug moieties attached to an antibody e.g. 1 2 3 etc. Liquid chromatography methods such as polymeric reverse phase PLRP and hydrophobic interaction HIC may separate compounds in the mixture by drug loading value. Preparations of ADC with a single drug loading value p may be isolated however these single loading value ADCs may still be heterogeneous mixtures because the drug moieties may be attached via the linker at different sites on the antibody.

Thus the antibody drug conjugate compositions of the invention include mixtures of antibody drug conjugate compounds where the antibody has one or more PBD drug moieties and where the drug moieties may be attached to the antibody at various amino acid residues.

In one embodiment the average number of dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine groups per cell binding agent is in the range 1 to 20. In some embodiments the range is selected from 1 to 8 2 to 8 2 to 6 2 to 4 and 4 to 8.

Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention and for use in accordance with the present invention may comprise in addition to the active ingredient i.e. a conjugate compound a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient carrier buffer stabiliser or other materials well known to those skilled in the art. Such materials should be non toxic and should not interfere with the efficacy of the active ingredient. The precise nature of the carrier or other material will depend on the route of administration which may be oral or by injection e.g. cutaneous subcutaneous or intravenous.

Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration may be in tablet capsule powder or liquid form. A tablet may comprise a solid carrier or an adjuvant. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions generally comprise a liquid carrier such as water petroleum animal or vegetable oils mineral oil or synthetic oil. Physiological saline solution dextrose or other saccharide solution or glycols such as ethylene glycol propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol may be included. A capsule may comprise a solid carrier such a gelatin.

For intravenous cutaneous or subcutaneous injection or injection at the site of affliction the active ingredient will be in the form of a parenterally acceptable aqueous solution which is pyrogen free and has suitable pH isotonicity and stability. Those of relevant skill in the art are well able to prepare suitable solutions using for example isotonic vehicles such as Sodium Chloride Injection Ringer s Injection Lactated Ringer s Injection. Preservatives stabilisers buffers antioxidants and or other additives may be included as required.

While it is possible for the conjugate compound to be used e.g. administered alone it is often preferable to present it as a composition or formulation.

In one embodiment the composition is a pharmaceutical composition e.g. formulation preparation medicament comprising a conjugate compound as described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier diluent or excipient.

In one embodiment the composition is a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one conjugate compound as described herein together with one or more other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients well known to those skilled in the art including but not limited to pharmaceutically acceptable carriers diluents excipients adjuvants fillers buffers preservatives anti oxidants lubricants stabilisers solubilisers surfactants e.g. wetting agents masking agents colouring agents flavouring agents and sweetening agents.

Another aspect of the present invention pertains to methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least one C radiolabelled conjugate or conjugate like compound as defined herein together with one or more other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients well known to those skilled in the art e.g. carriers diluents excipients etc. If formulated as discrete units e.g. tablets etc. each unit contains a predetermined amount dosage of the active compound.

The term pharmaceutically acceptable as used herein pertains to compounds ingredients materials compositions dosage forms etc. which are within the scope of sound medical judgment suitable for use in contact with the tissues of the subject in question e.g. human without excessive toxicity irritation allergic response or other problem or complication commensurate with a reasonable benefit risk ratio. Each carrier diluent excipient etc. must also be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation.

The formulations may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active compound with a carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active compound with carriers e.g. liquid carriers finely divided solid carrier etc. and then shaping the product if necessary.

The formulation may be prepared to provide for rapid or slow release immediate delayed timed or sustained release or a combination thereof.

Formulations suitable for parenteral administration e.g. by injection include aqueous or non aqueous isotonic pyrogen free sterile liquids e.g. solutions suspensions in which the active ingredient is dissolved suspended or otherwise provided e.g. in a liposome or other microparticulate . Such liquids may additional contain other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients such as anti oxidants buffers preservatives stabilisers bacteriostats suspending agents thickening agents and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood or other relevant bodily fluid of the intended recipient. Examples of excipients include for example water alcohols polyols glycerol vegetable oils and the like. Examples of suitable isotonic carriers for use in such formulations include Sodium Chloride Injection Ringer s Solution or Lactated Ringer s Injection. Typically the concentration of the active ingredient in the liquid is from about 1 ng ml to about 10 g ml for example from about 10 ng ml to about 1 g ml. The formulations may be presented in unit dose or multi dose sealed containers for example ampoules and vials and may be stored in a freeze dried lyophilised condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier for example water for injections immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders granules and tablets.

It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that appropriate dosages of the conjugate compound and compositions comprising the conjugate compound can vary from patient to patient. Determining the optimal dosage will generally involve the balancing of the level of therapeutic benefit against any risk or deleterious side effects. The selected dosage level will depend on a variety of factors including but not limited to the activity of the particular compound the route of administration the time of administration the rate of excretion of the compound the duration of the treatment other drugs compounds and or materials used in combination the severity of the condition and the species sex age weight condition general health and prior medical history of the patient. The amount of compound and route of administration will ultimately be at the discretion of the physician veterinarian or clinician although generally the dosage will be selected to achieve local concentrations at the site of action which achieve the desired effect without causing substantial harmful or deleterious side effects.

Administration can be effected in one dose continuously or intermittently e.g. in divided doses at appropriate intervals throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those of skill in the art and will vary with the formulation used for therapy the purpose of the therapy the target cell s being treated and the subject being treated. Single or multiple administrations can be carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected by the treating physician veterinarian or clinician.

In general a suitable dose of the active compound is in the range of about 100 ng to about 25 mg more typically about 1 g to about 10 mg per kilogram body weight of the subject per day. Where the active compound is a salt an ester an amide a prodrug or the like the amount administered is calculated on the basis of the parent compound and so the actual weight to be used is increased proportionately.

In one embodiment the active compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime about 100 mg 3 times daily.

In one embodiment the active compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime about 150 mg 2 times daily.

In one embodiment the active compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime about 200 mg 2 times daily.

However in one embodiment the conjugate compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime about 50 or about 75 mg 3 or 4 times daily.

In one embodiment the conjugate compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime about 100 or about 125 mg 2 times daily.

The dosage amounts described above may apply to the conjugate including the PBD moiety and the linker to the antibody or to the effective amount of PBD compound provided for example the amount of compound that is releasable after cleavage of the linker.

For the prevention or treatment of disease the appropriate dosage of an ADC of the invention will depend on the type of disease to be treated as defined above the severity and course of the disease whether the molecule is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the antibody and the discretion of the attending physician. The molecule is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to 15 mg kg e.g. 0.1 20 mg kg of molecule is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. An exemplary dosage of ADC to be administered to a patient is in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 mg kg of patient weight. For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises a course of administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg kg followed by additional doses every week two weeks or three weeks of an ADC. Other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.

The term treatment as used herein in the context of treating a condition pertains generally to treatment and therapy whether of a human or an animal e.g. in veterinary applications in which some desired therapeutic effect is achieved for example the inhibition of the progress of the condition and includes a reduction in the rate of progress a halt in the rate of progress regression of the condition amelioration of the condition and cure of the condition. Treatment as a prophylactic measure i.e. prophylaxis prevention is also included.

It may be convenient or desirable to prepare purify and or handle a corresponding solvate of the active compound. The term solvate is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to a complex of solute e.g. active compound salt of active compound and solvent. If the solvent is water the solvate may be conveniently referred to as a hydrate for example a mono hydrate a di hydrate a tri hydrate etc.

The invention includes compounds where a solvent adds across the imine bond of the PBD moiety which is illustrated below where the solvent is water or an alcohol ROH where Ris Calkyl 

These forms can be called the carbinolamine and carbinolamine ether forms of the PBD. The balance of these equilibria depend on the conditions in which the compounds are found as well as the nature of the moiety itself.

Certain compounds may exist in one or more particular geometric optical enantiomeric diasteriomeric epimeric atropic stereoisomeric tautomeric conformational or anomeric forms including but not limited to cis and trans forms E and Z forms c t and r forms endo and exo forms R S and meso forms D and L forms d and l forms and forms keto enol and enolate forms syn and anti forms synclinal and anticlinal forms and forms axial and equatorial forms boat chair twist envelope and halfchair forms and combinations thereof hereinafter collectively referred to as isomers or isomeric forms .

Note that except as discussed below for tautomeric forms specifically excluded from the term isomers as used herein are structural or constitutional isomers i.e. isomers which differ in the connections between atoms rather than merely by the position of atoms in space . For example a reference to a methoxy group OCH is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer a hydroxymethyl group CHOH. Similarly a reference to ortho chlorophenyl is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer meta chlorophenyl. However a reference to a class of structures may well include structurally isomeric forms falling within that class e.g. Calkyl includes n propyl and iso propyl butyl includes n iso sec and tert butyl methoxyphenyl includes ortho meta and para methoxyphenyl .

The above exclusion does not pertain to tautomeric forms for example keto enol and enolate forms as in for example the following tautomeric pairs keto enol illustrated below imine enamine amide imino alcohol amidine amidine nitroso oxime thioketone enethiol N nitroso hyroxyazo and nitro aci nitro.

Note that specifically included in the term isomer are compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions. For example H may be in any isotopic form including H H D and H T C may be in any isotopic form including C C C and C O may be in any isotopic form including O and O and the like.

Antibodies can be conjugated to Linker Drug compounds as described in Doronina et al. Nature Biotechnology 2003 21 778 784 . Briefly antibodies 4 5 mg mL in PBS containing 50 mM sodium borate at pH 7.4 are reduced with tris carboxyethyl phosphine hydrochloride TCEP at 37 C. The progress of the reaction which reduces interchain disulfides is monitored by reaction with 5 5 dithiobis 2 nitrobenzoic acid and allowed to proceed until the desired level of thiols mAb is achieved. The reduced antibody is then cooled to 0 C. and alkylated with 1.5 equivalents of maleimide drug linker per antibody thiol.

After 1 hour the reaction is quenched by the addition of 5 equivalents of N acetyl cysteine. Quenched drug linker is removed by gel filtration over a PD 10 column. The ADC is then sterile filtered through a 0.22 m syringe filter. Protein concentration can be determined by spectral analysis at 280 nm and 329 nm respectively with correction for the contribution of drug absorbance at 280 nm. Size exclusion chromatography can be used to determine the extent of antibody aggregation and RP HPLC can be used to determine the levels of remaining NAC quenched drug linker.

Antibodies with introduced cysteine residues can be conjugated to Linker Drug compounds as described in International Patent Publication WO2008 070593 which is incorporated herein or as follows. Antibodies containing an introduced cysteine residue in the heavy chain are fully reduced by adding 10 equivalents of TCEP and 1 mM EDTA and adjusting the pH to 7.4 with 1M Tris buffer pH 9.0 . Following a 1 hour incubation at 37 C. the reaction is cooled to 22 C. and 30 equivalents of dehydroascorbic acid is added to selectively reoxidize the native disulfides while leaving the introduced cysteine in the reduced state. The pH is adjusted to 6.5 with 1M Tris buffer pH 3.7 and the reaction is allowed to proceed for 1 hour at 22 C. The pH of the solution is then raised again to 7.4 by addition of 1 M Tris buffer pH 9.0 . 3.5 equivalents of the PBD drug linker in DMSO is placed in a suitable container for dilution with propylene glycol prior to addition to the reaction. To maintain solubility of the PBD drug linker the antibody itself is first diluted with propylene glycol to a final concentration of 33 e.g. if the antibody solution was in a 60 mL reaction volume 30 mL of propylene glycol was added . This same volume of propylene glycol 30 mL in this example is added to the PBD drug linker as a diluent. After mixing the solution of PBD drug linker in propylene glycol is added to the antibody solution to effect the conjugation the final concentration of propylene glycol is 50 . The reaction is allowed to proceed for 30 minutes and then quenched by addition of 5 equivalents of N acetyl cysteine. The ADC is purified by ultrafiltration through a 30 kD membrane. Note that the concentration of propylene glycol used in the reaction can be reduced for any particular PBD as its sole purpose is to maintain solubility of the drug linker in the aqueous media. 

For halo acetamide based Linker Drug compounds conjugation can be performed generally as follows. To a solution of reduced and reoxidized antibodies having introduced cysteines in the heavy chain in 10 mM Tris pH 7.4 50 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTPA is added 0.5 volumes of propylene glycol. A 10 mM solution of acetamide based Linker Drug compound in dimethylacetamide is prepared immediately prior to conjugation. An equivalent amount of propylene glycol as added to the antibody solution is added to a 6 fold molar excess of the Linker Drug compound. The dilute Linker Drug solution is added to the antibody solution and the pH is adjusted to 8 8.5 using 1 M Tris pH 9 . The conjugation reaction is allowed to proceed for 45 minutes at 37 C. The conjugation is verified by reducing and denaturing reversed phase PLRP S chromatography. Excess Linker Drug compound is removed with Quadrasil MP resin and the buffer is exchanged into 10 mM Tris pH 7.4 50 mM NaCl and 5 propylene glycol using a PD 10 desalting column.

The following schemes are illustrative of routes for synthesising drug linkers wherein PBD represents a compound of formula I of the present invention where X is NH which may be varied within the scope of the present invention.

The glucuronide linker intermediate S1 reference Jeffrey et al. 2006 17 831 840 can be treated with diphosgene in dichlroromethane at 78 C. to afford the glucuronide chloroformate which is then reacted with the PBD dimer S2 dissolved in CHClby dropwise addition. Warming the reaction to 0 C. over 2 hours followed by extraction will yield the compound S3. Treating a solution of S3 in an equal solvent mixture of MeOH tetrahydrofuran and water cooled to 0 C. with lithium hydroxide monohydrate for 4 hours followed by reaction with glacial acetic acid will yield the compound S4. Adding maleimidocaproyl NHS ester to a solution of S4 in DMF followed by diisopropylethylamine and stirring at room temperature under nitrogen for 2 hours will yield the desired drug linker S5.

The maleimide linker S6 which can be synthesised by reacting maleimidocaproyl N hydroxysuccinimide and H Val Ala OH can be linked to the exemplary compounds S2 in the presence of EEDQ in anhydrous dichloromethane.

The linker S8 can be linked to the exemplary compounds S2 in the presence of EEDQ in 5 methanol dichloromethane. The deprotection of S9 can be carried out with the use of PhP pyrollidine and tetrakis palladium in anhydrous dichloromethane. S10 can be converted to the desired products by adding maleimidocaproyl NHS ester in the presence of DIPEA in DMF.
