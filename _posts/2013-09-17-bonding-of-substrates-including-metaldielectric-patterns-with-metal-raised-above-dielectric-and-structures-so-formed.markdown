The invention generally relates to the integrated circuit fabrication and more specifically to bonding of substrates having metal dielectric patterns.

In the integrated circuit fabrication industry substrate bonding is used to join various parts of an integrated circuit IC together. Thermal compression bonding is one type of bonding that is advantageous because it allows the use of metals at the bonding interface rather than just dielectrics. The metallic surface serves as a good bonding medium and also provides additional functionality such as electrical signal propagation and thermal spreading. Unfortunately thermal compression bonding presents many challenges in order to achieve a good quality bond.

One challenge is optimizing process parameters. Process parameters may include for example surface preparation before bonding such as cleans and wetting treatments process conditions during bonding such as temperature pressure force time etc. and post bonding treatments such as thermal cycles.

Another challenge is addressing patterned metal dielectric mating surfaces that typically include topography which prevents a reliable bond. In particular metal dielectric patterning is conventionally formed using damascene processing. Damascene processing involves fabricating interconnect metal lines by forming and filling trenches in a dielectric and attempting to planarize the surface by chemical mechanical polishing CMP . Bonding of patterned surfaces takes place after the CMP step. CMP however leaves the metal surface non uniform e.g. the metal is typically concave and non planar relative to the dielectric. As a result the topographical differences between bonding metallic surfaces presents a challenge. Conventionally the heating process during the bonding which causes the reflow of the metallic pattern has been considered sufficient to cause bonding. Unfortunately the non uniformity and the difference in the distances between bonding metallic surfaces does not always allow for adequate bonding via reflow resulting in low yields.

The illustrative aspects of the present invention are designed to solve the problems herein described and or other problems not discussed.

It is noted that the drawings of the invention are not to scale. The drawings are intended to depict only typical aspects of the invention and therefore should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention. In the drawings like numbering represents like elements between the drawings.

Turning to the drawings show one embodiment of a method of bonding according to the invention. shows a substrate having a metal dielectric pattern on a surface thereof. As will be described herein two substrates having metal dielectric patterns will ultimately be provided and bonded together. Metal dielectric pattern includes a metal such as a wire or contact positioned within a dielectric . It is understood that the layout of metal within the different substrates may vary according to the functioning of the integrated circuit IC formed thereby. Metal may include any now known or later developed metallic material e.g. copper tungsten aluminum etc. or combination thereof. In addition metal may include an oxide layer thereover e.g. where it has been exposed to the environment. Dielectric may include any now known or later developed insulator material usable in bonded substrates e.g. silicon dioxide SiO silicon nitride SiN or low k dielectrics.

Substrate may be formed using any now known or later developed techniques such as damascene processing chemical mechanical polishing CMP etc. As shown in metal has a concave upper surface caused by CMP which may exist in oxide layer and or metallic material . Each substrate may be exposed to CMP. Other layers such as other interconnect layers a silicon substrate etc. may be provided under metal dielectric pattern .

Next a process is performed resulting in metal being raised above dielectric in at least one of substrates that will be bonded together. show one embodiment of this process in which dielectric is recessed. This embodiment may include one or more processes. shows one process in which dielectric is chemical mechanical polished CMP to recess dielectric . shows a graph illustrating a height of metal compared to dielectric according to one illustrative structure exposed to the CMP of alone. shows another process in which dielectric is exposed to a wet etch to recess dielectric . In one embodiment where dielectric includes silicon dioxide SiO wet etch may include a diluted hydrofluoric acid HF etch however other etch process are also considered within the scope of the invention. shows a graph illustrating a height of metal compared to dielectric according to one illustrative structure exposed to wet etch of alone. In another embodiment substrate is exposed to both CMP of and wet etch of . shows a graph illustrating a height of metal compared to dielectric according to one illustrative structure exposed to CMP of and wet etch of . show that metal is raised above dielectric and may include an upper surface having at least a portion thereof in a substantially convex form e.g. rounded off. Upper surface is labeled in also but the substantially convex form is not as recognizable due to limitations of the drawings. In some instances upper surface may have a substantially domed shape as shown best in . In either case any concave upper surface is removed in this process which fosters better metal to metal bonding.

Turning to in an alternative embodiment substrates A B may be processed as described above in an optimized manner such that when bonded metal with or without BTA layer and dielectric bond together i.e. gap is eliminated. That is the bonding includes bonding metal of first substrate A and second substrate B and dielectric of first substrate A and second substrate B. In this case metal is raised only high enough such that when bonded dielectrics bond also. Bonded structure exhibits enhanced bonding strength across the whole substrates A B compared to that of and prevents potential contamination in gap . shows bonded structure after an optional anneal i.e. without an interface . It is understood however that the annealing may not be necessary.

Referring to in an alternative embodiment the process resulting in metal being raised above dielectric in at least one of substrates may be provided by raising metal rather than recessing dielectric . In this case processing begins with substantially the same structure as shown in and as shown in metal is cleaned similar to cleaning e.g. by an etching of any oxide layer off of metal . The etching may include any now known or later developed etching technique for removing oxide layer from a metal e.g. a reactive ion etch a wet etch etc.

Returning to in another embodiment the invention may include a structure including substrate including dielectric having metal therein. As described above metal extends above surface of dielectric and include an upper surface having at least a portion thereof in a substantially convex form. As shown in upper surface may be substantially dome shaped .

The method as described above may be used in the fabrication of integrated circuit chips. In addition the method may be employed in bonding of mechanical components e.g. micro electrical mechanical systems MEMS or optical components such as a micro optical bench. In the case of IC chips the resulting integrated circuit chips can be distributed by the fabricator in raw wafer form that is as a single wafer that has multiple unpackaged chips as a bare die or in a packaged form. In the latter case the chip is mounted in a single chip package such as a plastic carrier with leads that are affixed to a motherboard or other higher level carrier or in a multichip package such as a ceramic carrier that has either or both surface interconnections or buried interconnections . Regardless of the method the chip is then integrated with other chips discrete circuit elements and or other signal processing devices as part of either a an intermediate product such as a motherboard or b an end product. The end product can be any product that includes integrated circuit chips ranging from toys and other low end applications to advanced computer products having a display a keyboard or other input device and a central processor.

It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed and obviously many modifications and variations are possible. Such modifications and variations that may be apparent to a person skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the invention as defined by the accompanying claims.
