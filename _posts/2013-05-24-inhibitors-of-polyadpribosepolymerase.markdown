This invention relates to inhibitors of poly ADP ribose polymerase ways to make them and methods of treating patients using them.

Poly ADP ribose polymerase PARP is essential for facilitating DNA repair controlling RNA transcription mediating cell death and regulating immune response. This activity makes PARP inhibitors targets for a number of disorders. PARP inhibitors have shown utility for treating diseases such as ischemia reperfusion injury inflammatory disease retroviral infections ischemia reperfusion injury myocardial infarction stroke and other neural trauma organ transplantation reperfusion of the eye kidney gut and skeletal muscle arthritis gout inflammatory bowel disease CNS inflammation such as MS and allergic encephalitis sepsis septic shock hemmorhagic shock pulmonary fibrosis and uveitis diabetes and Parkinsons disease liver toxicity following acetominophen overdose cardiac and kidney toxicities from doxorubicin and platinum based antineoplastic agents and skin damage secondary to sulfur mustards. PARP inhibitors have also been shown to potentiate radiation and chemotherapy by increasing cell death of cancer cells limiting tumor growth decreasing metastasis and prolonging the survival of tumor bearing animals.

US 2002 0183325 A1 describes phthalazinone derivatives as PARP inhibitors. US 2004 0023968 A1 describes phthalazinone derivatives as PARP inhibitors. US 2005 0085476 A1 describes fused pyridazine derivatives as PARP inhibitors. US 2005 0059663 A1 describes phthalazinone derivatives as PARP inhibitors. US 2006 0063767 A1 describes phthalazinone derivatives as PARP inhibitors. US 2006 0142293 A1 describes phthalazinone derivatives as PARP inhibitors. US 2006 0149059 A1 describes phthalazinone derivatives as PARP inhibitors. US 2007 0093489 A1 describes phthalazinone derivatives as PARP inhibitors.

There is therefore a need in the therapeutic arts for PARP inhibitors. Such compounds can be used to treat subjects suffering from cancer and can further expand the range of treatment options available for such subjects.

One embodiment of this invention therefore pertains to compounds that inhibit the activity of poly ADP ribose polymerase and have formula I

To a suspension of EXAMPLE 719 as the HCl salt 59 mg 0.134 mmol in a mixture of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran 2 mL and acetonitrile 2 mL was added triethylamine 0.056 mL 0.403 mmol and 2 5 dioxopyrrolidin 1 yl nicotinate 44 mg 0.201 mmol . This suspension was heated at 60 C. overnight and concentrated. The residue was purified by HPLC Zorbax C 18 250 2.54 column Mobile phase A 0.1 TFA in HO B 0.1 TFA in CHCN 0 100 gradient to provide the title compound as the TFA salt.
