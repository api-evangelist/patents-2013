The field of the invention relates generally to gaming and more particularly to providing incentives to players.

People enjoy playing games and often regard a prize won by playing a game to be more valuable than that of the prize itself. Just the chance to win a prize provides considerable entertainment. Games are often used to induce persons to visit a location in order to obtain a game entry check game outcomes and or redeem prizes won. The well known McDonalds restaurant for example provides scratch off game cards with prizes of cash and other awards as prizes. Such scratch off tickets are provided free of charge without a purchase requirement. To obtain a free game card people need only to visit a local McDonalds location.

The well known Publisher s Clearing House sweepstakes offers the chance to win large sums of money just by returning a form which is entered into a future sweepstakes drawing for the cash prizes. People receiving the offer could return the sweepstakes entry alone or may include an order for magazine subscriptions requiring payment along with the sweepstakes entry.

Games which require a purchase are also well known. For example to play slot machines or gaming tables in Las Vegas people are required to make a wager. Casinos sometimes issue free or reduced price wagers to entice people to visit a casino location. For example an enticement of 20 in free play might be included in a direct mail piece. A person that receives such a mailer can simply bring the mailer to a designated casino location within defined time limits and receive that amount in coins free credits on a gaming machine or promotional chips for play on table games. While such offers are enticing they often are not strong enough to overcome the effort of returning to the casino and often times people simply forget about the offer and do not return within the allotted time to collect their incentive.

Some casinos offer promotional games on the casino floor wherein players redeem their free credit entitlement in the form of a game which can randomly award one of several amounts of free credits for casino game play which are redeemable immediately or at a later time to encourage return visits. In some cases the person must return at a later time just to learn the award value. People are sometimes reluctant to revisit the casino to learn of a prize value or to collect a prize due to the passage of time disengagement from the game process or simple forgetfulness.

Player tracking systems such as International Game Technology s Advantage system and Bally Technology s Slot Management System and Table Management System are also well known. Player tracking systems are useful for automating some or all of the tasks required to provide additional incentives for frequent or loyal play. For example points may be awarded for every unit of wagers made and those points may be redeemed for prizes.

Player tracking systems utilize magnetic striped cards to hold a unique identifier which is associated with a specific person s account. Each gambling machine and or table game position is equipped with a compatible card reader. A person wishing to allow their gambling activities to be monitored inserts their card into the compatible card reader. Other identification techniques are also useful with player tracking systems and include but are not limited to biometric identification smart cards and Hollerith cards. In some cases additional identity authentication is required such as entering a PIN or password on a keypad or touchscreen.

Most player tracking systems include a display which provides acknowledgment that the card was accurately read and associated with an account. Typically for so long as the person s card remains inserted in the reader all gambling activity that occurs on the associated gambling game is recorded on the identified account.

All card readers and displays associated with the player tracking systems are connected via a network to one or more central servers where account records are kept. Player tracking systems are well known in the gambling industry. Example player tracking system architectures are found in U.S. Pat. No. 5 429 361 entitled Gaming machine information communication and display system and U.S. Pat. No. 5 655 961 entitled Method for operating networked gaming devices both of which are herein incorporated by reference.

Player tracking systems are also used to automatically provide awards to players as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 712 697 entitled Method for crediting a player of an electronic gaming device which is also incorporated by reference herein.

Although gambling is a popular activity a great percentage of the worldwide populations do not gamble. This is true even after excluding underage persons those with insufficient disposable income and those with a religious or other belief that prevents them from gambling as recreation. It is expensive for the casino to market to the general population because so many people are unqualified for gambling because of age restrictions or the biases of personal belief. And the burden of making a first ever visit to the casino are comparatively high in terms of comfort and convenience so incentives must be disproportionately large. As a result of these factors most gambling venues such as casinos find it prohibitively expensive to recruit new players to the extent desired.

There are many different types of games that can be provided for entertainment separate from the casino environment. For instance lottery tickets are sold through retailers using machines referred to as point of sale POS terminals to permit players to play such games. These tickets are generally printed at the POS terminal and are usually issued for some lottery drawing to be performed at a later time. Examples of these types of lottery games of chance include traditional state lottery drawings and multi state lottery drawings e.g. PowerBall . Another well known drawing based game includes the game of Keno. Further there are many online games that can be played using a computer system coupled to a communication network e.g. the Internet . These games may include traditional games of chance games of skill and casino type games among others some of which may involve online gambling.

Numerous organizations and companies have incentive programs for customers. For example airlines have frequent flyer programs that allow a member passenger to take free trips or provide other perks after the member has taken a minimum number of flights or has flown a minimum number of miles. Numerous other types of establishments including hotel chains chain stores and movie rental companies have similar programs used to incentivize a customer.

Casinos also often have similar frequent player programs that provide incentives for continued customer patronage. For instance the Foxwoods Casino Mashantucket Conn. offers a program referred to as Wampum Rewards. A player participating in the program receives a card which the player uses whenever he she comes to the casino. In one example implementation the player swipes the card at special kiosks located within the casino which permit that player to have a chance to win prizes. A Wampum Rewards member may also swipe his or her card whenever betting or spending money within the casino and in the associated hotel resort or shops. As the player bets or spends more money the player becomes eligible for free or reduced cost perks. Other examples of frequent player programs used in the casino environment include the well known Harrah s Total Rewards Wynn Casino s Red Card and Trump Casinos Trump Card programs.

As with frequent flyer programs and other types of incentive programs typical goals of the casino frequent player program include increasing player loyalty providing incentives to a player to visit the associated casinos as often as possible and encouraging the player to spend as much money in the associated establishments as possible. To further improve the effectiveness of player loyalty programs there is a present and recurring need for new methods to provide incentives to frequent player program members.

New and more interesting game formats are needed for lottery and casino type games that keep players interest and therefore result in continued and or return players. According to one aspect of the present invention a method is disclosed for providing additional incentives for a player to visit a gambling location e.g. a land based casino or other gaming establishment .

According to one aspect of the present invention it is appreciated that it may be desirable to create games that provide prizes that provide people the opportunity to play games for free a specific fee or at a discounted fee at locations away from the casino in order to win incentives that will encourage them to visit a casino or other gambling location. It is also desirable to invite qualified persons to either return to or initially visit a gambling location based upon their projected interest in gambling and their projected worth as a gambling customer. It is further desirable to automate some or all of the monitoring and fulfillment process using computer networks such as those found within the Internet infrastructure and the gambling location s player tracking infrastructure.

In one example game format consistent with principles of the present invention a player participating in a frequent player program is provided a prize to encourage the player to return to the casino or other establishment. The prize may be in the form of for example a non cashable credit for playing additional games a complimentary offer and or promotional prizes. In this way the casino or other establishment generally can increase revenue as the number of return players increases. In one example game format the player is presented the non cashable credit complimentary offer and or promotional prize in an interface of a computer system. For instance the player may be revealed the awarded prize s in a computer system coupled to the Internet that communicates with a website of an operator.

The player may be incentivized to visit the gambling location of the operator by receiving a coupon to redeem on the operator s property. The coupon may be associated with a frequent player program identifier e.g. an account number name etc. that is assigned to the player. In one embodiment the player may be permitted to reveal the prize associated with the coupon in the interface of the computer system. In one form the prize may be revealed during play of an online computer based game.

As discussed the prize may be redeemed on the operator s property thereby encouraging the player to return to the gambling location. In another example the prize is awarded after the player s experience on the operator s property increasing the likelihood that the player will return to the operator s property to redeem the prize. The prize in one embodiment may include a non cashable credit for playing additional games and thus the play of additional games may increase revenue for the gaming operator. Other prizes e.g. complimentary offers promotional prizes etc. separate from the casino may be provided which enhance the player s experience and encourage return.

In another aspect of the present invention a player s participation in the frequent player program coupled with continued play by the player may increase the player s chances of winning a prize thereby encouraging continued play. In one embodiment the prize may be an entry in a sweepstakes and increased play of the player on the operator property may increase the chances of the player to win the sweepstakes. Players may be awarded increased chances for particular types of behavior such as for example length of play on a particular device amount of money spent within a period of time or other parameter associated with types of game play that the operator wishes to encourage.

According to another aspect of the present invention a player is incentivized to return to a casino or other gambling location through the play of an online game. According to another aspect of the present invention the game may be an online game that provides one or more revealed outcomes to a player during play of the online game referred hereinafter as a reveal based game . To this end various aspects of the present invention may be facilitated using a reveal based game conducted over a communication network such as for example the Internet. According to one aspect of the present invention a player may be awarded a prize during play of the reveal based game wherein the player may be required to return to the casino or other gambling location to redeem the award. In this way the online game is used to incentivize players to return to the gambling location increasing the opportunity to increase revenues.

According to yet another aspect players may refer other players or potential players that should also receive prizes bonus play awards play incentives and other promotional material. A referral may be made by specifically providing another players contact information. A referral typically includes contact information for example e mail to permit delivery of an incentive invitation bonus play opportunity or other advertising and marketing material to the referred player. Referrals may also occur in the course of trying to achieve redeem multiparty bonus play offers multiparty incentives multiparty awards or multiparty prizes. It is realized that encouraging return play of groups not provides additional benefit the gambling and affiliated location operators but also increases the ability to provide larger incentives. In one example a player receives an invitation to participate in a multiparty bonus game. In order to qualify and or redeem the bonus required is another 10 players who also agree to participate. The referring player may forward the invitation to 10 or more people s he knows to meet the requirements of the offer. Referrals may be tracked and the referrals themselves may identify a group of potential actual players whom the referring players has some relationship e.g. friend peer family associate etc. Knowledge about a player tracked through player club membership for example can be coupled with knowledge about his her associates and relationships to identify candidates likely to share similar interests and in the example of a valued player candidates who are also likely to be become valued players.

According to another aspect it is appreciated that a high value player likely shares characteristics in common with her her associates friends family and peers that would make that player s associates friend family and peers good candidates for being high value players themselves. It is realized that any increase in the likelihood of actual redemption of bonus play offers represents value to gambling locations their affiliates and marketers of the same. It is realized that utilizing the relationship between an already identified valued players and potential new players and or players with the potential to become high value players many of the problems associated with marketing to the general population and even marketing to existing players are overcome. It is further realized that valued players may be analyzed to identify characteristics of valued players and then target other person potential players with similar characteristics for receipt of awards incentives and or other marketing material.

Moreover a player who visits gambling establishments regularly may serve as an additional incentive to players who would be unlikely to visit a gambling establishment on their own. In other words a regular player may be incented to organize less receptive players into performing actions at a gambling location. Having the regular player organize and sometimes manage a trip to a gambling location increases the likelihood that the reluctant player will redeem a bonus play award incentive because the reluctant new player is more likely to join the regular player in a visit to a gambling location rather than visit on his her own.

In yet another aspect a player is able to create and maintain a referral network. Additionally in another example an operator is responsible for maintaining a referral network based on referrals entered by a particular player. The operator may be a gambling location operator an operator of an affiliated location or an independent bonus operator. In one example the referral network includes identifying information for each referral that enables an operator to direct bonus play incentives awards not only to the player but also to the members of the referral network. Bonus play incentives and awards may be delivered directly to the referral network for example via e mail or other communication means. Additionally bonus play incentives awards may be delivered indirectly.

According to one aspect a bonus provider insures that a player receives incentives to establish and maintain a referral network. In one example a player s standing determines the type of awards frequency of award and even increased chance of receiving award with respect to provided win opportunities. Player standing may be linked to the quality of referrals submitted by a particular player. Moreover the size and associated player value of a referral network may likewise impact a player s standing. Many criteria can be used in valuing a referral network including basing network value on the projected value of its constituents and may include premiums for referrals of new players. Additionally disincentives may be provided for bad referrals in that value of the network is decreased by referring players who do not redeem and or participate in a referral offer. Conversely a player who redeems only offers and does nothing else may also be deemed a bad referral.

According to one aspect existing players generate referrals of other players and potential players. Each referral may be automatically tracked to generate a referral network without player involvement. Additionally referrals may by generated by affiliated locations affiliate networks or other non human i.e. automated referrals. Each source of referrals may be tracked and a value associated with the associated network of referrals.

According to another aspect an interface may be provided to allow an individual player and or other source of referrals to access review track and or download information on referrals. In one example the interface is used to determined redemption completion of referrals. Additionally the interface may serve a vehicle to provide information on the individual referred. In one embodiment a referral network comprises friends and associates of a particular referring player. The referrer who can be thought of as the hub of the referral network may wish to determine if his her friends and associates are also at a gambling location. The interface provides status information that may indicate on site or off site . For on site players a location may be displayed through the interface. In some embodiments an automated message may convey to a player that members of his referral network are on site and may also include a location. In one aspect the interface for the referral network facilitates interaction amongst members of the referral network. One should appreciate that the services provided need not be limited to the hub of a network but rather can notify other members of a network of respective status information.

According to another aspect incentive offers to referrals may be made directly to the members of a referral network but also incentive offers may be made indirectly. For direct offers the offer itself may reference the referring player his her identity or provide some indication that the incentive offer is being provided as part of participation in a referral network. Incentive offers may be delivered to the referral network hub and all the members of his her referral network. Additionally certain offers may be tailored to subsets of referral networks. For example members of a referral network who consistently played table games may receive incentive offers directed to table type games.

Indirect offers may include for example extending an invitation to a referrer to incent the referrer to pass along the offer to another party. In one example an incentive offer is extended to the hub of a referral network the offer requires participation of at least 10 other players in order to qualify and redeem the offer. The incentive offer may be for free play bonus play credit points prizes or other merchandize for example. Group prizes can be commensurately larger and thus the incentive on the referrer and potential players he she passes the offer along to may be increased.

According to another aspect indirect referrals capture the goodwill of the relationship between the referrer and the indirect referee. Moreover by providing incentives to the referrer typically a frequent and or consistent visitor to a gambling location the indirect referral capitalizes on the fact that the referrer was likely going to the gambling location anyway so he she has a greater incentive to encourage the indirect referees to attend and or participate in the incentive. Thus not only can an incentive offer capitalize on the relationship but also on the self interest of the referrer not to mention the self interest of the indirect referral who also receives the incentive offer . It is realized that coupling the effects of the relationship and or the self interest of players serves to reduce any player s or potential player s reluctance to visit a gambling establishment.

According to another aspect a referral network may be used to qualify members of the referral network for participation in bonus play games. In one example when the hub of the network qualifies for bonus play as discussed herein the entire referral network may also be qualified for bonus play. In one embodiment the referral network may be used to define a friend play group. Friend play groups may actually emphasize the relationship between the members of the referral network and or require a particular relationship. In one embodiment the information entered with respect to referral requests a designation of the relationship between the referrer and the referee. Although one should appreciate that such information is not required. A bonus operator may use existing friend play groups to target offers and awards to groups associated with valued players. It is realized that players who engage in bonus play and visit casinos are likely to associate with others who share the same or similar interests. Making those associates friends more likely to participate in bonus games and visit casinos. Various criteria may be identified as indicative of a propensity to play game and gamble. Recognition of those criteria allows an operator to extend and target marketing and promotional material into segments of similar character. Segments of people who are associated with a valued player are likely to share characteristics that make them receptive to similar offers and incentives as the referrer.

According to another aspect the friend play networks and more generally referral networks can be used as a feedback mechanism to hone in on characteristics that correlate with receptiveness to incentive offers and awards. In one example incentive offers may be used to target a particular characteristic within a referral network. Tracking the rate of participation across referral networks yields information on the strength of the correlation between that characteristic and redemption participation rates. Additional information may be derived across multiple networks having similar characteristic s . Not only can specific characteristics be identified and tested but information collected on referrals and the referrers themselves can provide insight into the profile of an ideal player. The ideal player profile allows for identification of characteristics in common of the players who make up the 5 50 group of players. These profiles can be used to identify potential players who are more likely to game gamble or participate in incentive offers. In order to facilitate collection of information each referral may be required to contain at least some identifying information about the referral for example relationship to referrer. Additional incentives may be provide for any additional information provided. Additional information may include for example information on activities hobbies work information etc.

According to another aspect an incentive is provided to each referee. The incentive comes in the form of the incentive offer or invitation to participate in an incentive offer. The referral offer may be delivered directly or indirectly. Referees may also receive awards and bonuses through participation in a referral network. As has been discussed there often exists a reluctance to visit a gambling location to redeem or participate in an incentive offer or invitation. Providing something of sufficient value is one element used in overcoming the reluctance. Providing incentives to bring friends along further erodes the barrier to visiting a gambling location. In one example additional incentives are provided to referees in a referral network. In one embodiment the additional incentives take the form of credits to the referred player with the same level or status of the referring player. In an example where the referring player has a valued status with a gambling location and or an affiliated location the referred player may be treated as having the same level or status. This may entitle the referred player to greater rewards higher valued incentive offers and or better odds at receiving awards.

According to another aspect an online interface to a referral network system enables a player to access and review offers and or potential invitations that are available for qualification redemption. The offers may be available across a number of gambling locations affiliated locations and the like. Some offers and or invitations may have associated qualifications for viewing. In one example only a hub of a referral network of sufficient value may view a particular offer. In another example an invitation is open to anyone even one who has not yet established a referral network. Typically such an invitation would include establishing a referral network as a qualifying event.

In one embodiment the system requires loyalty player club membership numbers as part of inputting a valid registration. Once registered the player is provided a listing of available bonuses. Bonus listing may be further constrained. Such constraints may include value of the player value of the player s referral network value of a network the player is a member of among others options. In one example the player must request that a particular bonus be unlocked that is indicate an intention to attempt to qualify for a particular bonus. For bonuses that require multiple participants the player may be required to enter e mail address and or player club numbers for each of the referral s he wishes to qualify with. Although one should appreciate other communication methods may be employed. Invited player may also be required to responds to an invitation. A response may include confirming identity information entered by the referring player entity. For example a referred player may respond by registering an online group gaming site. Additional information may be required for example gambling gaming club membership numbers.

According to yet another embodiment of the present invention it is appreciated there is a great deal of effort and expense to introduce additional games especially in the casino area. In particular as each game is introduced its features are scrutinized by regulators prior to introduction. It therefore would be beneficial to be able to reduce the regulatory effort in introducing new games that are exciting to players to play. To this end according to one aspect of the present invention a system is provided having two games one of which is already approved by regulators whose outcomes are used to drive outcomes of another game. Because the outcome determination and odds of winning the other game are driven by a previously approved game the regulatory hurdles associated with releasing the other game are reduced.

In one aspect of the present invention the player is permitted to play a computer based game referred to hereinafter as a primary game during which the game playing system reveals results of another game referred to hereinafter as a secondary game such as a reveal based game in an online game experience as discussed above. Also as discussed the primary game may be used to reveal one or more awards to the player. Such awards may be predetermined based on selection criteria of an award to the player e.g. based on action s of the player information about the player or any other player related criteria . However in some cases the player may be entered in a sweepstakes or drawing which may be determined at a later time as a result of a secondary game.

This secondary game may be a casino or lottery based game and according to one embodiment this secondary game is already approved by regulators. One such game is the well known game of Keno. However it should be appreciated that the secondary game may be any other type of game e.g. a lottery game . The primary game may be any type of computer based game including games of skill and or chance such as card games casino games video games or any other type of game through which a result from another game may be revealed. In one aspect of the present invention the play of the primary game that the player plays does not affect the outcome of the secondary game. In another aspect of the present invention the secondary game result does not affect the outcome of the primary game played by the player.

In one example the primary game involves some level of influence by the player on the outcome of the primary game. For instance the primary game may be a game of skill. However it should be appreciated that the primary game be a game based on chance or combination of skill and chance and that any type of game can be used to reveal an award to the player. In one example the primary game may be similar to the well known game of COLLAPSE COLLAPSE is a trademark of GameHouse Inc. Seattle Wash. and its variations. As is known COLLAPSE is a game of skill that allows the player to earn points by removing elements from a game grid. COLLAPSE and similar games involve a window having a grid having colored elements where new lines of the grid are fed into the bottom of the grid periodically. A player removes groups of three or more similarly colored elements by selecting them within the grid. The player may be permitted to play the game of COLLAPSE or similar game during which the result of the primary game is revealed over one or more instances of the COLLAPSE type game. However it should be appreciated that the result or any other indication may be revealed to the player during before or after play of any instance of an online game.

According to one aspect of the present invention the COLLAPSE type game is combined with a second level game. Play of the second level game may proceed after some achievement level in the COLLAPSE type game. For instance points may be awarded in the COLLAPSE type game and in one embodiment the second level may proceed after the player achieves a particular point total as further discussed below. Alternatively the player may play the COLLAPSE type game until completion and at the end of the COLLAPSE type game the player begins playing the second level game.

According to one aspect of the present invention the result of the primary game is stored on a server coupled to a computer system upon which the game is played. In one example the result is downloaded to the computer system prior to game play. The result may be in the form of intermediate results of each game instance that are displayed to the player at various points during game play. For instance intermediate results may be displayed to a user during an instance of a COLLAPSE type game.

In one embodiment of the present invention the traditional game of COLLAPSE or similar game is coupled with a second level game. Further during the play of the COLLAPSE type game one or more items are awarded to the player for use in the second level game. For instance items are awarded when particular one s of the elements are removed from the grid. In the example of the COLLAPSE type game there may be an indication that one or more of the elements of the grid contains an item e.g. one that may be used with a second level game . This indication may be for example a graphical textual or other symbolic indication that the element contains an item. In one example this indication may be the same or similar element used to indicate that there is a hidden item associated with the element. The type of hidden item may not according to one embodiment be known by the user until the hidden item is revealed during game play. In one example when the element having the hidden item is selected or removed from the grid the game program displays the item to the player.

In another example the grid may contain more than one hidden item and these items may be collected by the player as hidden items are revealed. When the game has ended the player may use the one or more collected items in the second level game. In one example game the items revealed during the game of COLLAPSE are used to open hidden items in a second level game. For instance the second level game includes a series of safes or other element type which are opened and their hidden items revealed with items collected during the play of the COLLAPSE type game. In one example the items are representations of sticks of dynamite that are used by the user to open the safe. However it should be appreciated that the items may be any type of item that can be used in a second level game.

Hidden items revealed during the second level of play may be for example a cash prize awarded for a particular game. It should be appreciated however that other prizes may be awarded e.g. merchandise credit free play etc. and that the invention is not limited to any particular prize type.

According to one aspect of the present invention prizes revealed during the second level game may be stored in a database of the server and downloaded to the client prior to play. In this example the player may be allowed when an invitation is received e.g. when a ticket is purchased at a POS the player receives an e mail invitation etc. the ability to play a number of instances of the game. Prizes may be awarded for example at each instance of the second level of the online game. To this end the result of each prize may be stored in the database of the server and may be indexed by an identifier of the invitation e.g. a ticket identifier . For example the identifier may be a serial number or other identifying information.

According to one aspect of the present invention prizes are only awarded in the second level game. In another example after a prize is revealed or not in the second level game the player is permitted to play any remaining instances of the primary game e.g. a slot machine type game or COLLAPSE type game . According to another embodiment the player may not be permitted to replay game instances after they have been played. To this end a game playing system may maintain a status of the game instances played by the player. The game playing system may maintain other information such as game play information how prizes are revealed to the player and other information that may be useful for assessing or auditing game play and playing experiences of the player.

Each instance of the game may include an associated prize or not and these prizes may be combined for an overall prize associated with the ticket. In one example the prize associated with the first instance of the COLLAPSE type game and its second level is 10.

Each instance of the game may include an associated prize or not and these prizes may be combined for an overall prize associated with the ticket. In one example the prize associated with the first instance of the COLLAPSE type game and its second level is 10. A prize associated with a second instance of the COLLAPSE type game and its second level is 15. The prizes associated with each instance of the COLLAPSE type game and its second level may be stored as an entry in the database of the server.

Alternatively the result of each prize for each instance of the game may be determined dynamically by the client computer. For example if the overall prize e.g. 25 for the ticket is known the client can determine e.g. randomly a distribution of winnings of the overall prize among game instances. In the example above a play of the ticket on one computer could award a 25 prize among two game instances as follows 5 prize for the first game instance and 20 for the second game instance. Another play of the ticket on the same or different computer may award a 25 prize differently among the two game instances e.g. 10 for the first game instance 15 for the second game instance etc. . It should be appreciated however that the game may include any number of game instances and the prize associated with each game instance may be stored in any storage location e.g. at the client computer at the server etc. .

In another example system prizes may be awarded in association with each item collected in the game e.g. a stick of dynamite in a COLLAPSE type game . Therefore prizes may be distributed among hidden items in the game grid as well as being distributed among game instances. As discussed prize distribution may be stored in a database of the server may be determined by the client e.g. randomly or may be stored at any location or be determined by any manner by the client.

According to another aspect of the present invention an improved game experience is provided for revealing the result of an online game. As discussed above a player purchases a ticket or other game piece at a POS or other location. On the ticket multiple plays of an associated online game are provided with each ticket or other game piece. The player can play those multiple plays across a set of games. For instance the set of games may include for example games of skill and or chance as discussed above. Certain games may include one or more attempts or opportunities for winning prizes. These opportunities for winning may be associated with one or more prizes. For example a player playing a slot machine may be awarded a certain number of opportunities to play a game e.g. a game instance or game play or other opportunity to win a prize when playing a particular game instance . In the case of a slot machine game the player may be given a particular number of spins of the slot machine game and as a result of each spin the player may be awarded or not a prize. In one embodiment the result of the overall game is predetermined and a game experience is determined for each opportunity e.g. spin that results in a contribution to the result of the overall game.

According to one embodiment of the present invention the type of game that is played is immaterial to the outcome revealed to the player. More particularly the same outcomes associated with a particular ticket may be used to drive multiple types of games. This allows for example the gaming operator to offer multiple types of games with a single ticket and allows the player to select which game s to play to reveal the outcomes associated with the particular ticket. For instance the player may elect to play a slot machine game for a first game instance of a ticket and for a second instance play a COLLAPSE type game. Of course it should be appreciated that any type of game and other combinations of games are possible. In this manner the player may be provided the flexibility to play particular games in which the player is interested thereby increasing his her interest and participation in the game. Further the game operator is provided additional flexibility as new games may be introduced substituted that are associated with the same ticket or other game piece.

According to one embodiment of the present invention the outcome of the game is predetermined at the time of ticket printing issuance or purchase or shortly thereafter. That is the game outcome associated with a particular ticket is available prior to at the same time or shortly thereafter the ticket is provided to the player after which time the player is permitted to play any games to reveal the predetermined outcome. In another embodiment outcomes associated with tickets issued to the player are determined some time after the ticket issuance i.e. outcomes are post determined . Such is the case with Keno or other drawing based games wherein game outcomes are determined after ticket issuance. In such a game players are permitted to obtain the outcome at a predetermined time usually after the player has purchased the ticket. In one aspect of the invention it may be beneficial to have a later activation of tickets especially in the case of a ticket based game where tickets are issued in some other gaming environment e.g. a casino . It may be desirable to only permit the player to play such a game outside the gaming environment so as not to compete with other games. Additionally it may be desirable to require the player to revisit the gaming environment to redeem the ticket and increase the chances that the player will purchase additional tickets or play other types of games offered in the gaming environment.

Also according to another aspect of the present invention a first game may be used to reveal the result of a second game. As discussed above this second game may be one which is already approved by regulators. Such a system may be for example a game whose results are driven by a random number generator or RNG as referred to in the art . One such game is the well known game of Keno. Another game that may be used is the well known game of bingo. Other games may be used to drive the result of an online game.

In one example a Keno game and its associated system are used to generate reveal results which are revealed to a player during play of an online game. To this end a Keno based system may be used in conjunction with an online gaming system to present new and interesting online games whose outcomes are driven by results provided by the Keno system. In one particular example a Keno system provides a correlation of a ticket identifier to a Keno game which is held at some predetermined time. As the Keno numbers are drawn an outcome is produced associated with the particular ticket identifier and provided to an online gaming system. The online gaming system uses the produced outcome to render a new and interesting gaming experience within an online gaming environment. As discussed such an environment may include online play of one or more online games of skill chance or combination thereof.

According to one embodiment of the present invention wins are optimized across game instances associated with a ticket. For instance a ticket may have a predetermined outcome for example awarding a prize of 50 that may be allocated across the game instances associated with that ticket. For example in the case of winning 50 on a 5 play 5 game instances ticket it may be desired to allocate the wins across game instances to provide a particular game experience. For instance the game experience of winning 50 may be distributed across five game instances e.g. five separate games respectively winning 5 0 0 5 40 to provide the player an early indication of winning. Also the remaining game play of the game instances may be scripted to build the drama of the game experience while still retaining player interest. Such a scripted outcome is more interesting according to one embodiment as the player is presented an outcome in a way such that retains interest in the game. This is beneficial as an overall result includes extending scratch type games or other type of game experience beyond the point of sale and beyond the instant but fleeting gratification associated with scratch type or other instant ticket game experiences.

According to one embodiment a player is permitted to wager and redeem bets at authorized locations e.g. legal jurisdictions such as lottery retail establishments casinos and the like while the online portion of the game may be played in any locale or jurisdiction. In such a case the casino or lottery experience is extended to locations where otherwise lottery and or casino games are not available. Thereafter players return to the lottery or casino establishment to redeem their tickets thereby providing yet another opportunity to entertain the player. According to one embodiment the player is required to return to the lottery or casino location to redeem their award.

According to yet another aspect of the present invention winning results may be split across opportunities to win. One embodiment of the present invention relates generally to how wins are shown to the player across win opportunities. In one specific example one embodiment relates to a method for revealing wins to a player across a play of multiple game instances that build excitement for the player and which holds the interest of the player in continuing to play the game. It is appreciated that the game experience may be made more compelling if wins are distributed among win opportunities in an interesting way.

Another method for maintaining the interest of players includes awarding additional opportunities to win with each ticket. For instance one of the prizes awarded with a particular opportunity to win e.g. during the play of the game instance may be one or more additional opportunities to win. For instance in a slot machine game an issued ticket may be associated with five 5 spins. One of the prizes awarded with the ticket may include additional spins. At the time of initial ticket activation it may be predetermined that the ticket is associated with these additional opportunities to win and these additional opportunities may be associated with the issued ticket. The player when playing the game will obtain additional satisfaction in playing because the number of game instances to be played by the player are increased and therefore their opportunity to win is also increased. This may be beneficial to create a more realistic gaming experience such as in casino slots where additional spins may be awarded during casino play. However unlike casino play wherein slot play can be continued from an online account or by placing additional bets to create a more continuous game experience the additional spins are awarded to a single ticket.

In the case where an online game system is a Keno based or other drawing based system wherein results are not predetermined additional opportunities to win may be associated with the ticket in the form of additional numbers selected by a computer system and associated with the ticket at the time of a drawing. This may be performed for example by assigning one or more additional drawing entries as a prize itself in the pay table associated with the Keno or other drawing based game. More particularly the drawing entries may be awarded as prizes which themselves are indexes into other entries in the same pay table. Such additional entries may correspond to one or more prizes. For example when the drawing occurs the additional plays are awarded to the drawing numbers associated with the ticket. These drawing numbers may be associated with a particular game instance of which there may be many associated with one ticket. At the point when the ticket is activated by the result of the drawing and play of the online game is permitted the player upon the beginning of play of the ticket or a particular game instance the player is awarded the additional plays and therefore any prizes associated with these additional plays. The additional plays may be played as additional game instances which themselves have additional reveal opportunities. Alternatively additional reveal opportunities may be added to one or more other game instances to make game play more exciting.

According to another aspect of the present invention a method is presented for providing players an enhanced gaming experience. According to one embodiment it is appreciated that it is beneficial to enhance players interest in playing games particularly losing ones. In one embodiment an illusion is presented to players to provide the illusion of being very close to winning a particular game. For instance in the case of a slot machine the slot machine result may indicate in a three wheel slot machine that the player received a winning combination of two of the first wheels and only with the revealing of the last wheel does the player realize that he she has lost the game. According to one aspect it is realized that the losing game experience should compel the player to continue playing the game.

In another example system prizes may be awarded in association with each item collected in the game e.g. number of points in a slot machine type game . Therefore prizes may be distributed among elements or levels during play as well as being distributed among game instances. As discussed prize distribution may be stored in a database of the server may be determined by the client e.g. randomly or may be stored at any location or be determined by any manner by the client.

According to another aspect of the invention it is appreciated that conventional methods for playing online games of chance are not secure. In particular because the result or outcome of the game or predetermined sequence of game states may be encoded on a ticket the lottery game may be compromised if the winning codes are deciphered. Such a deciphering could occur for example by hacking a computer system associated with the online lottery and obtaining a list of winning tickets or reverse engineering software e.g. on a PC where the winning codes or sequence of game states may be stored. Further it is realized that in such conventional systems the lottery ticket or the online game software and its data are single points of security failures in the system.

One aspect of the present invention relates to a method for conducting a game of chance. According to one embodiment a more secure method is provided by which an online game may be played. Instead of placing a game seed that determines a sequence of game states on a ticket e.g. an instant scratch or lottery ticket the game states or outcomes may not be placed on the ticket. Rather the outcomes may be stored in an online database. To this end a code may be stored on the ticket the code being used as a decryption key used to find the outcome stored in the database. In particular there may be a mapping between an outcome code and a corresponding decryption key that is printed on the ticket.

Because the decryption key is placed on the ticket unauthorized access to the online game is not permitted without the physical ticket. In another embodiment a portion of the decryption key is placed on the ticket and another portion is stored in a database associated with the online game. In this manner security cannot be breached without having both portions of the key either having the issued ticket portion or the online portion . Thus a hacker may not compromise a lottery ticket database without the ticket and by virtue of having a winning ticket other winning ticket numbers may not be determined. Access to the online portion of the key may be obtained for example by providing some other information e.g. a serial number printed on the ticket . However it should be appreciated that the information used to gain access to the online portion of the key need not be printed on the ticket the information may be provided on some other medium or by another method.

The ticket may be for example a scratch type lottery or instant ticket pull tab or type of pre printed ticket type. Alternatively the ticket may be a printed lottery ticket as is known in the art which is a ticket printed at a Point of Sale POS usually in the form of a lottery drawing ticket e.g. PowerBall or other type lottery drawing game . Also the ticket may be an electronic ticket issued by a computer system. It should be appreciated that the ticket may be any type of ticket issued in any form and the invention is not limited to any particular ticket type method of issuing a ticket.

Qualification is important because a relatively few people are responsible for a disproportionately large amount of play. This concept is sometimes referred to as the 5 50 rule because in approximation 5 of players of casino games for example are typically responsible for 50 of total revenues. According to one aspect of the present invention a system and method is provided for qualifying people according to their perceived worth. For example such qualification may be based upon criteria such as player performance history current play levels or even projected play levels based upon the details of a potential player s occupation income level age gender background personal preferences location of residence employment history and or other such criteria including personal information such as birthday or anniversary either alone or in combination.

Further qualification may be based upon taking an action attending an event or visiting a location on a particular date. For example a verbal invitation could be extended to each person that purchases a Cadillac. A printed invitation is given to all people over the age of 21 that attended a concert or an invitation could be extended to anyone that visits a particular website or physical location. These qualifications may be made based solely upon the individual or based in whole or in part on criteria applied to the spouse family member friend or peer group. In one embodiment qualification may require referral of the spouse family member friend or peer group.

According to one aspect players may refer other players or potential players to receive invitations both for themselves and for the referred player. Invitations may relate to bonus play awards play incentives and other advertising and marketing material. In one example a player provides contact information for another person. The other person may receive the same invitation that the referring player received or the other person may receive an invitation tailored to that particular player. In addition to contact information a referring player may be permitted to input personal information about a referee that enables more specific tailoring of incentive offers invitations. Incentive offers invitation may also be determined for a player based on their location information as determined by one or more location based services.

A referral typically includes contact information for example e mail to permit delivery of an incentive invitation bonus play opportunity or other advertising and marketing material to the referred player. Referrals may also occur in the course of trying to qualify for or as part of performing a required action in order to redeem a multiparty bonus play offer multiparty incentive or multiparty award. In one example a player receives an invitation to participate in a multiparty bonus game. In order to qualify and or redeem the bonus at least 10 players must agree to participate. The referring player may forward the invitation to 10 or more people s he knows to meet the requirements of the offer. One should appreciate that the number of additional participants can vary across a number of embodiments. In some embodiments the number of additional players may exceed 100 1000 or other options and in another may be as few as one additional player. The specific examples provided e.g. 10 players should not be read as limiting the invention to the example disclosed.

In another example referrals may be automatically generated by operators of gambling establishments affiliated locations redemptions locations or other locations. For example play of an online game may trigger an invitation to the online player the invitation may include incentives to provide additional information and or information on other people who may be interested in participating in the invitation. In another example a qualified player playing an online game may be associated with other players of the online game. An invitation may be directed to the online player with the option of forwarding the invitation to that players associates.

According to another aspect of the present invention the qualification may depend at least in part on a player taking an action within a gambling location e.g. in a casino or within an online gaming environment e.g. over the Internet . In at least one instance the action may involve the player using an identifier of a frequent player program. In one case for example the player may swipe his or her frequent player program card at a casino location which causes the player to become qualified to play the electronic game. In another example the player may swipe or otherwise enter their frequent player identifier in an online environment causing him her to become qualified. To this end various aspect of the invention may be facilitated using a frequent player tracking system.

In yet another example a player may receive an invitation to play an electronic game during a new player promotion that may be conducted at the gambling location e.g. at the casino . In one instance a player may receive as part of a new player promotion an invitation to play an electronic game when the player leaves the gambling location. For example the player may receive a brochure which includes a ticket that allows the player to access the electronic game via an access code. The access code when entered by the player may permit the player to play a number of plays or credits with the electronic game and play of the game by the player may earn points credits or other award types that can be redeemed at the gambling location thus encouraging the return of the player to the gambling location. In this manner a single visit by a player is converted into two or more visits by the player by extending one or more invitations which in themselves may earn the player awards that are required to be redeemed at one or more gambling locations. Such invitations lead to a ping pong effect whereby the player plays games at the gambling location receives invitations to play one or more electronic games and is awarded prizes that need to be redeemed at the gambling location or affiliated location.

Another action that may cause a player to receive an invitation may include a player referring a friend who should receive an invitation. Such a program may be beneficial in identifying potential gamblers as a personal reference of who is likely to be receptive to an invitation may be more likely to accept the invitation rather than a mass mailing to a particular group of people. In this way an action by a current player may cause an invitation to be extended to another player. This invitation may or may not include any additional qualifications of the new player including a qualification based on the demographic of the new player or play of the player in one or more online games historical play at casinos or other gambling locations or any other qualifications that may be performed for the new player. An existing player may refer a new player by providing for example information about the new player including but not limited to his e mail address residence address phone number name or other identifying information of the new player.

According to one aspect it is appreciated that the projection or estimation of future worth of a person is especially important to identifying valued players and all such methods of worth projection or estimation may be used herein. Persons may be valued by any number of criteria such as for example demographic information historical performance of other related activities that show a propensity towards gambling or otherwise indicate persons with disposable income among other information that may be correlated to the person s potential worth as a gambler. Additional worth calculations may be based on the quality and or amount of a player s referrals. In one example a player s worth calculation is based at least in part on the respective values of players referred.

According to one embodiment persons may not be considered qualified if they are explicitly barred from gambling by government regulation gambling location policy or self exclusion. Governments sometimes ban a specific person or group of persons if their presence in a gambling location causes harm. Nevada for example maintains a black book listing persons which are not allowed by law to visit a gambling location within that state. Individual casinos sometimes ban persons caught cheating or engaging in undesirable activity. Sometimes individuals ban themselves from visiting a gambling location in order to prevent themselves from engaging in excessive gambling. There may be many reasons why and methods for barring or banishing a person or groups of persons from a gambling location and all such reasons and methods can be used as criteria for whether a person is qualified for a particular category as used herein.

The term identifier as used herein indicates a device code or technique used to recognize a particular person. The identifier may simply be a number or code associated with the person such as a magnetic stripe card or a smart card which contains electronic or other circuitry. The identifier may also be biometric such as voice print handwriting recognition fingerprint hand shape recognition or eye pattern recognition. It should be appreciated that there are many different ways to identify a person uniquely or as a member of a group and all such techniques are anticipated as being useful for implementing various aspects of the present invention.

The term invitation as used herein refers to a request extended to a qualifying person to participate. Examples range from a printed invitation to a website offering a place to play a game or take some other action. Invitations may be communicated by any means including but not limited to electronic written and verbal means.

The term specified time period as used herein indicates a period before or after a specific time and date or a period within a beginning and ending time and date. A specified time period may be unbounded as in any time or may be more limited. The term may for example include a recurring time period such as every Wednesday every Tuesday afternoon between the hours of 2 and 5 PM the last Monday of each month every Fourth of July this coming Fourth of July amongst others. The term may also be construed as any type of time period that can be specified by one or more parameters. It should be appreciated that there are many other permutations and combinations of one time and recurring time restrictions that can be useful in various embodiments and representation of all such permutations and combinations is intended by the term specified time period and its variants.

The term gambling location as used herein refers to any location where free or fee based gambling is allowed. Examples of gambling locations include but are not limited to casinos racinos dog racing tracks horse racing tracks sports books lottery point of sale locations clubs or pubs where gambling is conducted amongst others Gambling locations may be at physical locations such as the Mirage casino in Las Vegas a range of locations such as any MGM owned casino in the United States or a virtual location such as an Internet based gambling site. It should be appreciated that there are many possible types of gambling location and all such locations are contemplated for use in various embodiments.

The term affiliated location as used herein refers to any location that is not a gambling location. Affiliated locations are places identified by gambling locations or their representatives at which a person may receive an invitation qualify to receive an invitation or accomplish all or part of a redemption element when invitation qualification or redemption does not involve any element of gambling.

The term general location as used herein refers to any location that is either a gambling location or an affiliated location.

The term redemption location as used herein refers to the location which may be either a gambling location or an affiliated location where the awards gained by playing an electronic game are redeemed or acted upon.

The term game as used herein is meant to encompass all types of games including those of physical or mental skill chance or games with outcomes that are already known before play begins such as those disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 001 775 filed Nov. 30 2004 entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONDUCTING A GAME OF CHANCE and includes games which require a wager of a financial value and a wager of consideration as well as games which do not require wagers of any value to play. Games may be played against another player or players such as in a sweepstakes or tournament. Games may also be played against the house i.e. the game host and the house may be represented by a person or a device such as a computer gaming machine or other device. It should be appreciated that there are a vast number of games and more are created with each passing day. Various aspects of the invention are contemplated for use with any type of game.

The term electronic game as used herein refers to any game which is at least partially implemented on an electronic device. For example all or part of a game may be conducted on a personal computer a computer terminal a cell phone such as the well known Palm Treo 700W or 700P a music player such as the well known Apple iPod a personal data assistant such as a Palm Pilot or a home video game such as the well known Nintendo Wii game console or the well known Microsoft Xbox 360. It should be appreciated that there is a wide array of electronic devices which could be adapted for convenient game play with more being developed every day and all such devices are contemplated for use with various embodiments of the present invention.

An electronic game could also be conducted on a purpose built electronic device such as a slot machine a video poker machine or other electronic gaming or lottery machine including such devices as electronic bingo minders and other devices.

Within this specification the phrase electronic game is referred to herein to allow inclusion of game play elements or stages which are not electronic. For example an electronic game is used for a portion of game play but each person is also provided a printed scratch off ticket that provides clues or elements of information which are entered into the electronic game to further play. Conversely results of electronic play may provide guidance as to which elements of a scratch off ticket are to be removed for the highest likelihood of winning or to win the most valuable prize.

Other non electronic elements that could be used in part to conduct electronic game play include manually tracked bingo cards pull tabs game boards card games and crossword puzzles. One of skill in the art recognizes there are many desirable ways to combine manual game elements with electronic game play and we include all such manual game elements within the scope of the meaning of electronic game . Moreover optical and biological computing devices are in development that perform the equivalent work of today s electronic devices. It should be appreciated that aspects of the present invention are useful with such technologies and it is our intention to include them within the definition of electronic game .

The term redeem indicates the redemption of an outcome which may result in the award of prizes. Some outcomes may result in opportunity to play additional games which have at least one outcome that awards a prize or enhances the value of an initial prize. It should be appreciated that there are a wide variety of ways both manual and automated by which persons may be allowed to redeem outcomes and more are being created with each passing day. All such methods are contemplated for use with various embodiments of the invention.

Prizes may include for example cash merchandise points free or reduced cost of games non cashable credits credits which may be wagered in a game but not converted to cash cashable credits credits which may be wagered in a game or converted to cash coupons including physical such as paper and electronic gift certificates entry into other games qualification for other games entry into tournaments qualification for tournament entry or other such methods. It should be appreciated that there are a wide variety of prizes and more are created with each passing day. All such forms of prizes are contemplated for use with various embodiments of the invention.

Also in one embodiment in which credits are non cashable credits may be limited to a specific denomination of play may be limited to games of a specific type or in a specific location. Also in which credits are given on existing player club account credits are given on machine readable paper coupon credits are given in cash credits are given in electronics credits transferred directly to a game credits are given as table game chips amongst others It should be appreciated that prizes such as cashable credits may be provided to or redeemed by the person in any manner.

Further a person may be awarded a prize that is a multiplier and not an actual prize amount. For instance the person could be awarded a multiplier prize which has the effect of multiplying the value of some yet unearned jackpot. For example a player wins a 2.times. multiplier prize by playing an Internet based game. If the player visits a gambling location and strikes a jackpot of at least X and or at most Y the prize may be doubled. According to one embodiment the gambling location visit and win must occur within a specified time and or wager amount. It should be appreciated that any form of providing a prize which is real or relative to another prize or purchase may be used according to various aspects of the present invention.

One embodiment of the invention is implemented as a process including acts of invitation identification qualification play and action as represented in . Step is invitation wherein a person is invited to participate.

Step is identification where the person s identity is ascertained. Step is a test of qualification wherein the person is measured against predefined criteria to determine if they are eligible to participate. If the person is unqualified she is excluded from play .

Qualified persons are presented an opportunity to play all or portions of an electronic game which includes a plurality of outcomes at least one of which is a winning outcome. When electronic game play concludes depending on outcome the person may be offered an opportunity to take an action . Awards earned by taking the action are then redeemed . In one embodiment of the invention the steps of action and redemption may be combined into a single step.

While shows at least one example of the present invention which represents the steps of invitation identification qualification play action and redemption as occurring in a specific order it should be appreciated that the order of these steps may be altered and remain within the scope and spirit of the present invention. illustrates another sequence of steps in which the first step of invitation is immediately followed by play of at least a portion of an electronic game or games . The steps of identification and qualification occur only if at least one outcome with award occurs during game play and is then followed by action step . This revised sequence is useful in cases where people may not feel motivated to perform the chores of identification just to play a game e.g. on the Internet as an unidentified user or where a player chooses to remain anonymous or when the invitation is extended to a group amongst others . In people can play the game and then undergo the steps of identification and qualification only if a winning outcome occurs which provides the person with additional motivation.

Other embodiments of the present invention may place the steps of invitation identification qualification play and action in any order. In some embodiments the person may have to complete a step multiple times. For example a person might have to accomplish identification before being allowed to play an electronic game on the Internet and must again submit to the identification process before being allowed to take an action or redemption. In another embodiment one or more of the steps may be eliminated or combined with other steps. For example the steps of action and redemption may be combined redemption may be allowed without an action or an action may be required without a redemption possibility. Embodiments of the invention include all orders permutations and combinations of the steps of invitation identification qualification play and action including the repetition of one or more of those steps and the division of one or more of the steps into partial accomplishment.

In addition each step may include restrictions based upon one or more of the following criteria specified time period gambling location affiliated location location of games within the gambling location upon which an action is to be taken games within the gambling location upon which an action is to be taken perception of worth amongst others.

Further various aspects of the present invention as described herein may be used in association with those described in U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 60 838 234 entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONDUCTING A GAME OF CHANCE filed Aug. 17 2006 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 704 144 entitled METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR REMOTE ENTRY IN FREQUENT PLAYER PROGRAMS filed Feb. 8 2007 each of which applications are incorporated by reference herein.

According to various embodiments an Internet based system may be provided to facilitate various aspects of the present invention. As discussed various aspects of the invention may be implemented on an Internet based system generally involving a website infrastructure. As is known in the art a basic website infrastructure logically contains web server s application server s and database server s . All servers may be located on the same computer hardware or may be separated onto different computer hardware at various locations depending on processing or security requirements. Networking equipment is also required to connect the servers to the Internet and to interconnect servers when they are implemented on separate computer hardware.

A web server is used to handle requests and delivery of content from and to the browsers of website visitors. The web server also dispatches requests and data to the application servers.

The application server is used to control the website processes and to supply dynamic content back to the web servers. The application server performs all data dependent procedures at the website.

The database server manages the storage of all data required by the website. It responds to requests storage and retrieval for data from the application server. Various embodiments of the present invention may be implemented in a gaming system as described for example in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 001 775 filed Nov. 30 2004 entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONDUCTING A GAME OF CHANCE to which priority is claimed and is incorporated herein by reference. However it should be appreciated that other gaming system infrastructures may be used. For example the infrastructures as described below with reference to may be used either alone or in combination with other infrastructures or elements thereof. Also infrastructures referred to in may be used either alone or in combination to implement various aspects of the present invention.

According to one embodiment of the invention parameters are established by which persons are invited to play an electronic game at a website. Parameters may include but are not limited to terms of invitation qualification game play type quantity and outcome schedule required actions time periods and redemptions. All invited persons may be grouped into a single category with shared parameters or various classes of persons may be created with each category given a specific set of parameters which may be different from parameters assigned to other categories.

According to one embodiment invited persons that visit the website during a specified time period are allowed to play electronic games where awards may be earned and then redeemed at a gaming location within a specified time period.

For example qualified persons are selected from a general list e.g. white pages third party email lists direct mail lists targeted lists based on demographic geographic or economic criteria or from the gambling location s frequent player database and invited to play an electronic game.

Each invited person is assigned a quantity of game plays in which the outcome is predetermined either for each individual game play or for a collective of multiple game plays before that person is actually invited to play. Records indicating the quantity of games and their outcome are stored in a database along annotated to indicate the games are yet unplayed. Each record is linked to an identifier unique to the player to whom the games are assigned. In this example the identifier is the person s player tracking identifier. Next the invitation is sent to the player in this example via email or regular mail.

When the invited person visits the website she identifies herself by entering her player tracking identifier which links the website game chosen by the person to her pre assigned outcomes and those outcomes are revealed to the person as each game play concludes. The database record for that person is annotated to indicate each game that has been played.

The person then visits a designated gambling location and redeems associated awards. If the award is game play credit she may redeem at a gambling machine by inserting her player tracking card into the machine s card reader after which the award is transferred to the gambling machine s credit meter after which the person may use the credits to gamble.

If the award can not be redeemed as game credits at the machine directly the person may visit a player club center and present identification after which the award is manually or otherwise given. In other redemption alternatives the person may visit a redemption kiosk a restaurant a gift shop a hotel representative or other place where the award may be redeemed.

Regardless of which manner of redemption is used the database is annotated to indicate that the redemption was fulfilled so as to prevent multiple redemptions for one award.

In another embodiment of the invention qualified persons are separated into categories wherein each category may offer at least one parameter which is different in value from a parameter offered to persons in another category.

As an example a universe of players is divided based upon historical play levels of each individual persons into five categories. The highest tier Tier 1 contains persons with an average daily theoretical loss also known as Average Daily Theoretical or ADT of at least 2 000. Tier 2 includes persons with an ADT of at least 1 200 while Tier 5 contains those persons with an ADT of at least 200. Tiers are not populated equally in this example because far more persons reach the 200 ADT level than the number that reaches an ADT of 2 000.

The electronic games for all 5 tiers have possible outcomes of 100 50 25 and 0 but the likelihood of winning each specific award is different for each tier. Table 1 below indicates each award amount and its likelihood of occurrence for each tier. Of course this is but one example of such a structure. It should be appreciated that according to one aspect of the present invention any number of tiers and any number of persons per tier and assignment of any number of outcome amounts with a probability of occurrence set to any desired value from 0 to 100 to each tier may be used. Further other parameters may be included within such a table of category parameters and in any combination.

In this example each game outcome is determined by a random number generator as is well known to those of skill in the art which is selected as each game is played in accordance with the probabilities specified in parameters for the player s assigned category.

The awards of 100 50 and 25 are paid as non cashable credits which are amounts of credit which may be gambled in a gambling location but may not be converted directly to cash. Awards won by wagering the non cashable credits may be converted to cash or replayed in additional wagers.

Qualified persons are then invited to play electronic games on the Internet. The invitation may be extended through mail email personal invitation or other method.

A small application program is downloaded to the person s computer cell phone or other Internet enabled device. This application randomly determines each electronic game s outcome according to the database parameters for that person. Award amounts from each outcome are stored in database along with annotations showing that an electronic game was completed. The person continues electronic game play until she exhausts her supply of electronic games again according to parameters stored in database .

To redeem the awards won the player visits a designated gambling location and inserts her player tracking card into the card reader of any connected gambling device . The gambling location s player tracking server reads the identity code from the inserted card and requests the identified person s award record from database . The player tracking server then transfers the appropriate amount of non cashable credit to the gambling device which makes said noncashable credits available for play. As each non cashable credit is wagered it is deducted from the award balance maintained on database . According to one embodiment when all non cashable credits are exhausted or time period parameters are exceeded no additional non cashable credit play is allowed.

As discussed above various aspects of the present invention may be implemented within various environments. For example instead of downloading an application to the person s computer the game could be entirely resident on a server based network. Further the game could be accessed by the player through an interface such as the interface of the well known Internet Explorer browser program or the well known Firefox browser program available from Mozilla.

According to one embodiment the player may receive an invitation to play the electronic game and may play the electronic game on a computer e.g. a personal computer PC . However it should be appreciated that the user may access the electronic game on other types of computing systems and the invention is not limited thereto.

As discussed the user may play a game over a distributed network such as the Internet item . As discussed above with reference to the game may be a web based game that implements one or more server systems such as web application server and or database server . However it should be appreciated that other types of Internet architectures may be used.

Further according to one embodiment the user that is provided the invitation may be identified in a player tracking system or another casino system. For instance the user may be identified in a casino player tracking system as shown in . Although player tracking systems are implemented in casinos it should be appreciated that various aspects of the invention may be applied to player tracking systems implemented in other environments e.g. slot parlors racinos amongst others .

The promotion may be extended for example to players identified in a frequent player database or other list or data source. For instance as shown in a patron list may be maintained which include an account number for the player e.g. a frequent player identifier the name of the player information about the player e.g. date of birth DoB email address and any other information related to the player or determined by the casino about the player e.g. the player rating ranking historical performance etc. .

Based on the information maintained in patron list and or any other information e.g. action s taken by the player a promotion e.g. a bonus play promotion may be conducted that reviews the list and determines based on the information relating to the players a resulting promotion with associated prizes. As shown in prize data may be determined which associates the determined prize with the player. This could be accomplished for example by associating an identifier of the player e.g. a player ID frequent player account number etc. with a determined prize or class of prizes to be awarded to the player.

Prize data may include for example the account number of the player any award or winnings associated with the promotion that are determined for the player or class of prizes the player may win a coupon or other code associated with the promotion and expiration information if any associated with the promotion. Such data may be used to conduct a validation process by the gambling location e.g. a casino when such awards are redeemed by players.

Further such prize data may be provided to an online game provider in order to conduct an online gaming experience. To this end the casino may transmit or otherwise provide data to an Internet website system to be used to conduct the online experience. The website may store the data in a website database . Thereafter the player proceeds to play the online game.

As discussed the award may either be predetermined may be determined later through a sweepstakes or drawing may be determined when the online experience is conducted or at any time after the invitation is extended to the player. Actual revealed prize data may be maintained that tracks what prizes were awarded to which players. Such data may assist in the redemption and or validation processes. Data may include for example the account number of the player any actual awards or winnings determined for the player and any coupon and or expiration data associated with the promotion.

During or after the online game experience the award may be revealed to the player and the player is them required to return to the gambling location to redeem the award. At this point a redemption process may be conducted e.g. at the casino location . As a result of this process redemption data may be generated which tracks the players who have redeemed their awards. Such data may include for example the player account information the actual awards or winnings determined for the player and any coupon data and the redemption date and time.

As discussed above based on an event that occurs e.g. an action taken by the player an occurrence with the gambling location amongst others an invitation may be generated and delivered to the user. As discussed further below the invitation may be generated in response to an action.

According to another embodiment of the invention the person must first take an action or participate in an activity at a gambling location or affiliated location in order to receive an invitation to play the electronic game. The action or activity can include for example wagering a proscribed amount of money winning or losing a proscribed amount of money activating a player club or frequent player account reaching a bonus round on an electronic gaming machine being awarded a mystery bonus from an electronic gaming machine being present in the casino when another event occurs playing specific casino games or electronic gaming machines purchasing merchandise attending an event withdrawing money from a casino ATM redeeming winnings or any other action by a player. It should be appreciated that there is a wide range of ways that a person may take an action or participate in an activity at the gambling location or affiliated location and such actions are contemplated for use with various embodiments.

The achievement of a qualifying action may be recorded automatically by a system such as a player tracking system ATM machines or gaming machines or manually by casino personnel that observe the occurrence of the qualifying action or other method.

Invitations may be issued to qualifying persons by mail email personal invitation or other methods. Once a person receives an invitation he she may proceed to play electronic games and redeems any awards won in the manner described above.

For example a person wagering on a Wheel of Fortune slot machine may be provided an invitation when another person wagering at another Wheel of Fortune slot machine wins a spin of the wheel. In one example implementation each time a wheel spin is won all eligible Wheel of Fortune machines being actively played automatically issue an invitation for electronic game play. In this example tickets may be printed by a ticket printer associated with the Wheel of Fortune gambling device although it should be appreciated that the invitation may take other forms that may not be printed e.g. an electronic invitation . Each printed ticket may include a code unique to that ticket. Among other parameters the ticket code may directly or indirectly indicate the time date place gambling device identifier and winning event that triggered the award.

The person holding the ticket may then visit a designated website where after entering the invitation code he she is awarded a number of credits for electronic game play and presented with a list of electronic games on which she may spend the credits to play.

Each electronic game is associated with a pre assigned category containing an award schedule and outcome probability. In one embodiment some awards may be different for each category and these awards may be assigned to all players of the category. Alternatively each category could contain award values selected specifically for an individual person or a category of personal attributed. Other assignments e.g. random methods may be used that are alternative or used with the method discussed above. Credits are deducted for each game played and any awards won are accumulated in a record associated with the ticket or invitation identifier.

The person may be required to visit a designated gambling location and redeem the awards by presenting the same ticket or code used for electronic game play or a new ticket or code obtained after completion of electronic game play. As discussed the player may be required to redeem the award at the casino or other gambling location including any affiliated locations such as for example a restaurant gift shop hotel other gambling location or any other business affiliate of the gambling location. In one example the coupon or code may entitle the holder to an amount of credit in one or more of the restaurants associated with the gambling location and the ticket or code is given as full or partial payment for a restaurant purchase. Other award redemption combinations involving one or more gambling locations and affiliated locations are envisioned and are part of various aspects of the present invention.

In another embodiment of the invention a person may initiate play at a specific website and win an outcome that may only be redeemed at a different website or a virtual world such as within Linden Lab s Second Life virtual world. A winning outcome there may require a person to then visit a specific place of business which may be a gambling site to redeem the outcome.

According to an alternative embodiment player invitations may also be awarded based of off location based criteria. The location based criteria may be used with both web site award and gambling location activity as discussed herein. Location based criteria may be determined using location based services and in one example using GPS systems to determine a location relative to a gaming establishment.

In one embodiment LBS may be used to facilitate game play of an incentive game or other type of game. In one example an assassination game may be played where players use LBS to locate and assassinate other players. Such a game may be confined to gaming location or may take place over a larger area. Typically the last player alive wins.

According to some embodiments LBS may be integrated with casino management systems to facilitate for example a Russian roulette slot game. The casino management system may randomly select locations and eliminates players within a certain distance of or who are within the randomly selected location until only the winning player s remain.

In another embodiment of the invention qualified persons may purchase access to electronic games with outcomes that award prizes which may be redeemed in gambling locations including any affiliated locations. For example a person may pay 75 to access one or more electronic games where he can win awards of hotel stays gambling currency merchandise credit or other prize. In a preferred embodiment the player is guaranteed to win at least a minimum amount above the prize of entry. For example by paying a 75 entry fee a qualified person is guaranteed to win an award worth 125 though he could win even more.

Such prizes may be redeemed at a particular gambling location affiliated location or group of gambling locations or affiliated locations. Other prizes may be redeemed at any gambling location or affiliated location. As discussed above and as used herein the term gambling location should be construed generally to include any type of gambling location where wagering is permitted including but not limited to a land based or other type of casino a racetrack racino riverboat gambling Internet gambling or any other environment can be placed.

The qualified person may elect to or be required to choose a specific gambling location group of locations or affiliated location or groups of affiliated locations at which prizes will be redeemed before electronic game play begins. Alternately qualified person may elect to or be required to choose a specific gambling location group of locations affiliated location or groups of affiliated locations at which prizes will be redeemed during electronic game play or after electronic game play is completed. In another embodiment of the invention qualified persons may be allowed to begin electronic game play without cost but be required during or after game play to pay a fee.

One of skill in the art appreciates that collecting a fee from qualified persons makes a wider range of electronic game play economically feasible and realizes there are many possible permutations and combinations of when fees are paid the value of prizes awarded and the locations at which prizes may be redeemed. All such permutations and combinations are useful within the scope of the invention.

The process by which a person receives an invitation and or redeems an outcome may include multiple interim steps of invitations and redemptions. In this case the initial invitation process as described in the section above describing incentives awarded from website play may be initiated by the casino operator or as a result of an action taken at a gambling location or affiliated location as described in the section above describing incentives awarded based on specific gambling location activity . In both these cases the process continues as described above respectively. At the point where the electronic game is played the outcome may include the invitation to play another electronic game or to take an action at a gambling location or affiliated location. At the point where the person is taking the action at the gambling location or affiliated location the result may include the invitation to play another electronic game or to take another action including an action to redeem an outcome. It should be appreciated that the processes and steps described in the selections above describing incentives awarded from website play and incentives awarded based on specific gambling location activity may be incorporated into this method and in one example are incorporated. It should be appreciated that the iterations could continue in a back and forth manner multiple times.

One aspect of the present invention relates to encouraging the person to continue to participate in the multiple interim steps. In one example the possible outcomes increase in value with subsequent iterations. The person may also be allowed to redeem an outcome at a certain point or to parlay that outcome for the chance to win something of higher value. Similarly to encourage the person to continue to participate there may be interim outcomes of value for the person to redeem that are additive to the final outcome.

A player may also be qualified to receive an invitation based upon data provided or actions taken in response to a separate invitation. The player may first be invited to play games for entertainment only no redeemable outcomes . In order to play the games the player would be required to register and provide personal information name address date of birth etc . From that personal information the system would qualify the player for an invitation to play an electronic game which has a plurality of outcomes that could be redeemed at the gambling location or affiliated location.

The system could do this by comparing the personal information provided with a database of similar information. The database could include a correlation of demographic information with categories of player value to the gambling location. As an example the system could utilize a database of median income by address to determine the potential value of the player. The system could also utilize algorithms to analyze the personal information to determine categories of player value to the gambling location. As an example using an algorithm the system could determine the distance between the gambling location and the player s home address. Players living closer to the gambling location may have a higher likelihood to visit the gambling location.

The qualification of the player may also be based on actions taken while playing the games for entertainment only. As an example players choosing to play specific electronic games i.e. slot machines may be considered more valuable to the gambling location. For those players a different invitation with different possible outcomes may be provided. Qualifying actions could be based on games played game strategies employed or duration of play.

The first invitation is not limited to the play of electronic games for entertainment only. The invitation to take an action may be to sign up for a gambling location s frequent player card or any activity that solicits player personal information that could be used to estimate the player s value to the gambling location.

A qualification of the player may also be provided based upon gathered data without the need for a player action. For instance an invitation may be extended to the player based on player demographics without having the player play a game for pure entertainment. In one example the player may be presented to receive an award based on information collected about the player such as location or income level.

Introducing players with a propensity to enjoy the activity of gambling to gambling locations is a valuable action particularly if that person and the financial means and time to gamble in significant volume. One aspect of the invention relates generally to estimating the worth of an untested person or group of persons by comparing their personal attributes or historical conduct with those of persons known to gamble at a particular volume. If the comparison yields enough matching characteristics the untested person is considered to be qualified to receive inducements to gamble so that a relationship between that person and a gambling location can be initiated.

The offered inducement may be the chance to play a game or electronic game. Alternatively one embodiment of the invention includes an offer of inducement that does not involve playing a game or electronic game but that simply invites the person to visit the gambling location and is particularly valuable when the gambling location has no relationship or communication with the person outside of this invitation. Finding qualified persons especially those with a likelihood of enjoying the activity of gambling that have not visited phoned or contacted the gambling location is a valuable benefit and the invitation alone may be sufficient inducement or the person or persons may be offered an appearance fee free or reduced airfare to travel to the location free or reduced cost gambling at the location free or reduced cost food beverage room or other such inducements whether alone or in combination. It should be appreciated that there are many such inducements that may be offered and all such inducements are anticipated as useful within the scope of the invention.

In one example it is determined that persons with personally managed brokerage accounts often have an affinity for gambling. A list of persons with such brokerage accounts is obtained but it is too expensive to extend an attractive inducement to all members of that list because a significant portion of them do not have an affinity for gambling. However it is believed that persons that reside in certain zip codes tend to have a greater amount of disposable income than the average of all people with qualifying brokerage accounts. A new list is created including only of those persons with a qualifying brokerage account that also live within one of the qualifying zip code areas and only those so qualified persons are offered the inducement.

One embodiment of the invention begins with a list of people that might have an affinity for gambling and then compares the persons on that list to one or more additional lists that also contain persons that might have an affinity for gambling. If the same person appears on two or more lists their likelihood of enjoying a gambling relationship with a gambling location is higher than for those appearing on a single list and therefore are more worthy of a particular inducement than the general population or persons that are members of fewer lists.

In another embodiment a list of persons that currently do not play at a particular gambling location s is obtained. Invitations may be extended to them as a chance to play games on the Internet for prizes at least some of which will incite the person to visit a gambling location. In one example the games and prizes may be scaled according to a perceived value of player.

There are many other ways and methods by which to start with a list of people believed to have as a group a more likely affinity for gambling than the general population. There are many other ways to further qualify members of this initial list based upon other factors to create a new list of people that will on average have a higher likelihood of an affinity for gambling in sufficient volume as to make them attractive candidate customers for gambling locations and therefore worth the cost of providing an inducement in an effort to initiate a relationship between the person or persons and the gambling location.

In one embodiment those qualified persons are invited to play a game using the structures outlined in . Qualified persons of a given category may be provided different inducements than qualified persons of other categories. They may be offered a chance to participate in unique electronic games the outcomes of which determines the specific inducement offered. They may also or alternatively be offered a different set of game outcomes different outcome award structures different redemption opportunities or other differentiated offers in relationship to their category of qualification. It should be appreciated that there are many ways in which various aspects of the invention may be used to offer inducements based upon the category of qualification of a person or persons and the invention should not be limited to just the examples described herein.

According to one aspect lists of referrals made by players are tracked to generate groups of people believed to have as a group a more likely affinity for gambling than the general population. In one embodiment a player enters referrals into an interface for tracking and delivery of incentives to the referral list. These tracked referrals are referred to as a referral network. Typically a referral network describes a network of people with some tie to the referrer. It is realized that associates of a player likely share similar interests and thus the members of the referral network likely have characteristics in common with the referring player. The identifying of a player of value as discussed herein may be translated to the player s network. Making the members of the network more likely to become be player s of value as well.

Historical tracking and analysis of referrals of invitations may also be used to identify players of value within referral networks. In one example it is recognized that for a player who always or often refers other high value players their next referral will also likely be a high value player even if unknown. Moreover the referral of unknown players may be of particular value and in one example a premium is provided for such a referral. The premium may be provided both to the referring player and to the referred player.

According to one embodiment incentives are provided to player form referral networks by providing bonus game incentives as discussed herein for making referrals. In another embodiment the incentives themselves require participation of multiple parties. In one embodiment a referral network is required to qualify to receive a multiparty incentive. In another embodiment the action that must be performed includes multiple parties.

In another embodiment a player s referral s are used as a qualifying event to receive an invitation to a bonus play game. The referral may be tracked to determine if the referral resulted in play at a gambling location and or an affiliated location by the referred player. The referring player may receive additional awards invitations based on an actual completed referral. In one example a reward by a referring player may only be achieved if the referred player performs an act either at a gambling location and or an affiliated location. The tracking of referrals enables an operator to generate a referral network of all the referrals a particular player may have made. These referral networks define groups of players with some kind of affiliation at the least all of the referrals have been referred by a particular player . It is realized that friends or associates tend to share at least some interests or have commonality in their interests. Where the referring player is a consistent gambler gamer there is value to be found in having access to that player s contacts associates friends family and or peers who may have similar interests.

Additionally a player may be given access to an online interface for entering and or tracking their referrals. Each new referral entered into the online interface may qualify a player to receive an invitation. The entry of referrals may also qualify the player to receive awards and invitations that are conditioned on the actual redemption of the referred player. Historical tracking of a player s referral may reveal that a particular player consistently refers high value players that is player who actually play consistently. In one example a high value player may be thought of as one of the 5 50 group the 5 of players who generate 50 of the revenue for a gambling location although other criteria may be used for example plays consistently over a period of time average wager meets certain threshold etc. . A referrer who consistently refers high value players may received additional premiums and be accorded a higher valuation. In one example a player s valuation includes a value associated with the player s referral network.

In one embodiment a referral network includes historical tracking of a particular player s referrals. Additionally a referral network may also include an active network of referred players that may be maintained by the referrer through an interface. In one example an on line interface is provided to enter and track referrals. The value associated with the referral network may impact a player s standing with a gambling location and or affiliated location. In one example a player s standing may be tracked through a player s club membership and or loyalty club membership. In one example a loyalty program segregates its member by level gold platinum diamond etc. each level reflective of a particular value associated with the player. A player may advance through the levels of membership based at least in part on that player s referral network.

Referrals may be valued on volume that is a number of referrals however a quality metric is typically associated with a player s referral. The quality metric may identify a probability an actual redemption of the referral will occur based on historical analysis for example. Each referee may also be rated based on actual redemption execution of referrals. A player making the referral may receive points increased standing or other reward based on the number of referees that actually redeem execute referrals. Additionally a referring player may also be penalized for referrals that do not redeem execute. In this manner a particular referrer may be provided with both incentives and disincentives relating to quality referrals.

As part of maintaining a referral network a player may remove referrals from his her referral network. It is realized that in an example where a player is referring friends associates family members etc. that player is in the best position to evaluate whether or not the referral will actually act on the referral offer. By penalizing the referring player for bad referrals the player is incentivized to remove referees not likely to redeem and or act upon referrals. In one embodiment the act of dropping a bad referral may result in a net effect of improving the player s standing. For example removing a bad referral from the player s network increases the value of the referral network. In an example where a player s standing in a player s club is based on the value of a player s referral network the increase in value of the network translates into an increase in standing with respect to the player s club.

According to some embodiments incentives provided to refer other players may include points awards comps invites bonuses etc. These incentives may be delivered via e mail for example. However other communication vehicles may be used to deliver incentives e.g. mail text page voice mail picture file mail etc. . Additionally incentives may be provided to a the referring player for providing additional detail about him herself. Additional information may include information about interest social activity membership in organizations clubs teams work organizations social organizations etc. The additional information includes any demographic information about the player. According to one aspect if a player is willing to provide the information the system tracks the information. In one embodiment provided information is evaluated to determine if there is some correlation between information characteristic about a player and an affinity for gaming gambling and or receptivity to incentive offers.

Incentives offered to players to enter referrals may improve based on established criteria. In one example a player who consistently refers valuable players may receive enhanced incentive offers. In another example the established criteria relates to where you are playing whether online at a gambling location or at an affiliated location. What games a player is playing may also impact incentives provided as well other play based metrics e.g. rate of play amount wagered amount won amount lost etc. Biometric tracking may be used to associated members of a referral network including the referrer to games played volume of play rate of play amount of play and in some examples length of visit etc.

Established criteria may also be used to reduce provided incentives. A larger number of redemptions of incentives may be indicative of a player gaming the incentive system. A player who simply redeems incentives and does not engage in other play may represent wasted expenditure in the vernacular a jam stealer . In one example the established criteria accounts for a large volume of redemption without corresponding reduction in incentives as long as the number of redemptions corresponds with a large amount of actual play.

Players with established referral networks may receive reports on the value of their referral network. Often the valuation of the network is provided to operators of gambling locations affiliated locations and to the provider of the referral network system. Valuation reports may indicate members of the referral network that are reducing its value prompting players to police their own networks. According to one embodiment your referrals increase your value as a player. Additionally referrals referrals may impact a player s standing. In one example each subsequent level of referrals may have an impact on a player s valuation and or standing.

According to one embodiment a weighting factor is applied for each level of removal from the first referrer. Layered referral networks may be analyzed to identify relationship between players and or referral networks that may be passed along to individuals. It is realized that high value players typically share interest any may benefit from introduction. Moreover getting high value player to associate and game gamble as a group may be of significant value to a gambling location and or an affiliated location.

Referral codes need not be printed on a coupon. Referral codes may be generated completely electronically. Referral codes may be generated and forwarded directly by a referral to interested individuals and or groups. According to one aspect the ability to forward access codes directly incents active involvement of referring entities into the referral process. The referrer obtains a referral codes in one example through gambling activity and in one alternative from engaging in business from which referrals are made. Referral codes may be generated for gambling establishments to provide to new customers. In one example a player may sign up for a frequent rewards program and receive a package with bonus play incentives. It is realized that by providing referral codes that newly signed up player may choose to remain anonymous until he she has won an award in the bonus play in which case in order to redeem the player must identify him herself. Access codes may be delivered as part of a promotion as sporting events concert events for example only if a winning outcome is obtained will the group play cards be redeemed

In one embodiment the logic control may limit the number of times an invitation may be forwarded. A threshold may be defined in advance to limit the number of referrals the threshold may be defined dynamically and the maximum number of referrals may depend on a number of redemptions. In one embodiment the logic control executes a reference to account information for the player receiving the invitation. The account information may contain referral history number amount frequency of referrals for example and also may include historical redemption information. The account information may also define a limit on a number of referrals of a particular incentive invitation. In one embodiment the player receiving the invitation triggers the control logic by clicking on a button displayed in the invitation. In another embodiment the logic control performs a check on whether the invitation may be forwarded. In response to a positive check forwarding information may be entered by the player.

In one embodiment the player refers the invitation to another player at YES. Qualification of the players is determined at as discussed herein. Alternatively each player may be qualified separately. In one example a referral is required to satisfy the qualification step. In a multiparty example both players are qualified at YES both players then engage in game play at as discussed herein perform an action at and redeem their prize and or awards at . According to one embodiment an invitation may require a referral in order to qualify and or complete a required action associated with the invitation. In one example if no referral is made at NO the process ends. Similarly if the player s attempting to complete an incentive offer are not qualified at NO for example by not having all referred players attempt redemption not having enough referred players exceeded referral threshold among others the process ends. In one example the referral of an invitation to a player at YES may trigger another process for that player. In one example the referral triggers either process disclosed and discussed with respect to .

In another embodiment a potential referred player may prefer to remain anonymous as long as possible. It is also realized that the provision of identifying information may be disfavored although overcoming any reluctance is typically eased by a person realizing that they have earned an award. Thus in one embodiment an unidentified person may play games using codes without providing identifying information and only upon redemption of an award would personal information need be provided. The use of code also facilitates generation of members in clubs that is a unique code is provided to a person signing up rather than asking the person to enter identifying information

With reference to shown is an example process for providing incentives according to one embodiment. As shown a player tracking system may be used to conduct a promotion at a gambling location such as a casino. The promotion may be extended for example to players identified in a frequent player database or other list or data source. For instance a patron list may be maintained which includes an account number for the player e.g. a frequent player identifier the name of the player information about the player e.g. date of birth DoB email address and any other information related to the player or determined by the casino about the player e.g. the player rating ranking historical performance etc. . In another example a referral tracking system maintains a history of referrals made by particular players and a referral list may be used in conjunction with information maintained in a patron list.

Based on the information maintained in patron list and or any other information e.g. action s taken by the player a referral list among others a promotion e.g. a bonus play promotion may be conducted that reviews the lists and and determines based on the information relating to the players a resulting promotion with associated prizes. As shown in prize data may be determined which associates the determined prize with the player. This could be accomplished for example by associating an identifier of the player e.g. a player ID frequent player account number etc. with a determined prize or class of prizes to be awarded to the player.

Prize data may include for example the account number of the player any award or winnings associated with the promotion that are determined for the player or class of prizes the player may win a coupon or other code associated with the promotion and expiration information if any associated with the promotion. Such data may be used to conduct a validation process by for example the gambling location e.g. a casino when such awards are redeemed by players.

Further such prize data may be provided to an online game provider in order to conduct an online gaming experience. To this end the casino may transmit or otherwise provide data to an Internet website system to be used to conduct the online experience. The website may store the data in a website database . Thereafter the player proceeds to play the online game.

As discussed the award may either be predetermined may be determined later through a sweepstakes or drawing may be determined when the online experience is conducted or at any time after the invitation is extended to the player. Actual revealed prize data may be maintained that tracks what prizes were awarded to which players. Such data may assist in the redemption and or validation processes. Data may include for example the account number of the player any actual awards or winnings determined for the player and any coupon and or expiration data associated with the promotion.

During or after the online game experience the award may be revealed to the player and the player is then required to return to the gambling location to redeem the award. At this point a redemption process may be conducted e.g. at the casino location . As a result of this process redemption data may be generated which tracks the players who have redeemed their awards. Such data may include for example the player account information the actual awards or winnings determined for the player and any coupon data and the redemption date and time.

As discussed above based on an event that occurs e.g. an action taken by the player an occurrence with the gambling location amongst others an invitation may be generated and delivered to the user. As discussed further below the invitation may be generated in response to an action.

In one alternative a referral alone is required in other words a player is required to provide information on another player typically including contact information but the player need not receive an invitation in order to provide a referral of another person. The act of providing a referral may trigger an invitation being sent to the referring player and or to the referred person. Invitations may be redeemed acted upon for example as part of the processes discussed with respect to .

According to one embodiment referrals of invitations and or incentive offers are made by players referring other players by providing contact information. In other embodiments other entities may be the source of a referral of a player referred information and or forwarded invitations to play. For example an operator of an affiliated location may provide information on which to deliver an invitation. Other entities such as social groups and or networks may be the source of a referral. In one embodiment an entity may be provided with demographic information of intended recipients of incentive offers the entity may then refer incentive offers to players potential players meeting the criteria. Additionally an entity may refer person s to receive incentive offers and other promotional material. Criteria may be as simple as membership in a particular group or may require combinations of criteria discussed herein. Referring entities may earn points awards and compensation for referring players. In one embodiment earnings are contingent on actual redemptions.

According to one embodiment entities may track referrals of invitations redemption status redemption rates etc track referred players etc. An entity may be valued based on the quality of its referrals. In one example an entity e.g. an affiliated location consistently refers high value players thus the value of the entity is likewise high. Ratings of referring entities may be used to alter the scope and or value of incentives provided to the entity to refer. Where the entity is highly valued that entity may have more access to promotional material of greater value than a referring entity of lesser value. In one example an entity is an independent web site that provides for some gaming type activity. In another example the entity is a traditional brick and mortar establishment. The participants of the website may form a group of candidates more likely to gamble than the general population thus the website could be a valuable referrer. As discussed above the value of the entity may increase as the number of referrals increases however a quality metric will typically be associated with the referrals as well. Thus in one embodiment only completed referrals improve value.

Entities performing referrals are provided similar incentives as individual players. Although rewards may vary based on number of referrals and even on potential to refer players and invitation. Typically an entity should have access to a larger population of candidates however quality and consistency ratings may end up with an individual player being more valued than an associated entity. According to one embodiment referring entities are provided the same type of incentives as individuals with the notable exception that an entity will typically not be able to receive bonus play awards for later redemption at a gambling location and at the same time the entity is subject to the same restrictions as an individual ranking or performance for example .

As part of the referral process an entity may possess additional information about associates of a particular individual and may include generating predefined groups for participation in bonus play incentives for example. An entity may already possess association information as part of its normal operation. The entity may pass a referral on for an entire group. Junket operators may be entities and the operator may be able to provide referrals for a number of individuals singly or as a group. An entity may comprise a website a brick and mortar store even a restaurant or other service facility other entities may include sporting facilities corporations or the like and may also include virtual establishments.

According to one aspect it is realized that affiliated locations can cater to a number of people who may be more likely to gamble than a section of the general population. Additionally affiliated locations may provide a number of services to people that could be used to enhance a potential player s experience. It is realized that partnerships between an affiliated locations and a gambling location may represent a mutually beneficial relationship. In one particular example an affiliate may capture personal information about its members that can be used to enhance a gaming experience either before during or after the actual gaming occurs. In another embodiment information gathered by an affiliate can be used either on or offsite from a gambling location. It should be appreciated that information provided by a number of affiliates may be used to derive a better view of the player.

According to one aspect the information itself that is gathered and how it is used can impact the ability to appropriately target incentive offers rewards and to appropriately generate the scope and requirements in incentive offer rewards. In one example affiliates may earn or participate with incentive offers for referring players to a gambling location that match a particular personality profile. In another example an affiliate can gather information on players and or potential players to develop a profile indicative of a player of value e.g. a profile having attributes that are indicative of certain valuable player behavior . In one embodiment personality tests may be used by an affiliate or other entity to analyze the compatibility for various patrons. The affiliate may refer groups of compatible patrons for participation in incentive offers either individually or as groups. The affiliate may participate in incentive rewards based on the referral of its patrons. Additionally an affiliate as the originator may participate in additional incentive offers for the referral s submitted by their referred patrons. One should appreciate that affiliates may refer more than their patrons as the information gathering process can reveal potential players associated with their patrons who in turn may also be referred. For example the spouse of an affiliate patron may have submitted information not only about him herself but also about their spouse enabling the affiliate to determine not only that the patron meets a qualification criteria but also that the patron s spouse meets a qualification criteria. In such a fashion referrals may be extended out from patron to the patrons associates friends family etc.

In one embodiment affiliate patrons and or their associates who wish to participate are provided personality tests to identify compatibility. Groups of compatible players are referred to gambling locations to participate in incentive offers. In one example an incentive offer may require a certain percentage of the group actually visit the gambling location and perform some action in order to redeem the incentive offer. It is realized that visiting a casino as a first time or new player can be viewed as an intimidating event. By grouping compatible players a reluctance to visit a gambling establishment may be reduced as going in a group may foster confidence a sense of adventure in the participants in addition to any effect the incentive offer itself has on the player s .

In one embodiment grouping compatible players reduces the apprehension reluctance to visiting a gambling location. Compatibility may be determined from personality tests or from history and background information collected from participants. For example information collection may extend to a person s hobbies and interests place of work type of work recreational activity sporting associations among many others. Creating groupings based of off similar background and or histories may facilitate actual visits to a gambling establishment. Other information that may be collected can include birth date astrological sign for instance. Affiliate patrons may be grouped based on an interest in homeopathic remedies wine connoisseur as other examples. Personal preferences may form the basis of a determined compatibility.

Group creation may include an additional invitation step when the groups are created based off of a determined compatibility. Acceptances and rejections of invitations to meet other participants and or participate in a group may also be tracked and used to refine further compatibility determinations.

Collected information may also be directed to determining what events and features at a gambling location that a particular player find enjoyable. Questions may be asked of a player in order to participate in particular incentive offers or answering a certain number of questions could be used a qualification for increased incentive offers. These questions can be used to identify features of a comfortable gaming environment for a particular player and then be used to match the environment to other gambling locations. Compatibility with a particular gambling location may be determined for individual players and or groups and incentive offers targeted to get those individuals and or groups to visit a new gambling location.

Based off of collected information displays of incentive offers may be presented to affiliate patrons and or their associates electronically by mail or through other avenues. For example an incentive offer directed at incenting a player to visit a new casino may highlight the features of the new casino that the player s collected information indicated s he prefers. In one example a table game player may receive an incentive offer picturing and highlighting the availability of more table games at a casino different than one she he normally frequents. In another example a player may be integrated into a group of other players who frequent that player s normal gambling location s and the gambling location to which the incentive offer applies. The player may then learn about how other players feel about the new location before committing to a visit. Referral networks may also support participant feedback and ratings on various gambling locations so a player can evaluate an incentive offer not only against the potential value it represents but with some idea as to comfort level of a visit to a new location.

It is further realized that the problem of getting a new player to visit a casino or an existing player to visit another gambling location shares some features with the problems associated with social interaction that is dating. In one example a player who frequents one gambling location can be though of as being in a relationship with that particular gambling location. According to the analogy the first step in getting the player to visit another gambling location is convincing him her that its not cheating to visit another casino. In other words any attempt to bring that player to another location must overcome a reluctance to visit a new gambling location. This may be accomplished by increasing the perceived value of any incentive or by reducing the level of reluctance. In some embodiment the value of an incentive is calculated to overcome the reluctance and in some embodiments social factors are used to reduce reluctance. According to one embodiment a combination of sufficient perceived value and reducing reluctance is combined to generate an increased likelihood of an actual visit.

In one embodiment reducing reluctance is accomplished through identifying aspects of a player experience that make him her comfortable and finding locations that meet or exceed previous experience. Other options include using associates of a particular player to increase comfort level and in one embodiments compatibility analysis is used to find other players potential players that would likely increase comfort level. Incentive offers may provide reserved game sessions at a player s identified favorite game or reserved seats at the table game a player has indicated is his her preferred game. Information collected on a player may be used to identify a preferred game in one example the one played the most often and an incentive offer targeted towards play of that game at a new location. Such information may be provided through affiliates who provide their own additional incentives to patrons or directly by gambling locations or other entities. Specific offers may target different aspects of collected information and information associated with their redemption acceptance may be retained to help identify which aspects are more likely to influence a particular player.

According to one aspect referral networks may be generated by individual players and may also be generated by other entities among other options. Referral networks can be atomically generated by tracking individual referrals for example. Another example includes permitting a player to enter contact information for other players to create a referral network. In one embodiment a player enters information associated with a group of friends. These friends groups are able to earn rewards together in one embodiment in addition to any individual awards. In another embodiment once one member of a friends group qualifies for a particular incentive invitation the entire group may likewise receive the same offer. In another embodiment the qualifying player may be required to take an affirmative act to refer the invitation.

Friend play may comprise an act of entering a friend s contact information at the time a player qualifies for a particular invitation for bonus play. It is realized that people who engage in bonus gaming and visit gambling locations are likely to associate with other people who share the same interests making those people more likely to engage in bonus play and visit gambling locations. Moreover it is realized that by providing incentives to a player to identify good referrals the referring player acts as a filter that targets persons more likely to engage in bonus play and or gamble than segments of the general population.

Various criteria may be indicative of a propensity inclination to engage in bonus play and visit gambling locations. It is realized that an incentive system may more accurately recognize and target persons having those characteristics through a referrer properly incented to identify them. It is realized that promotions focused on segments having similar characteristics will likely return a greater number of redemptions per expenditure as opposed to the general population. Additionally relying on the relationship between friends serves to reduce the barrier of redemption of a particular incentive. It is realized that a person receiving an incentive is much more likely to act upon it or even to review it when the incentive comes from a person whom they have a relationship.

Friend play may include the establishment of parameters thresholds that govern friend play qualification for incentives and redemption of incentives. In one example a threshold for incentive value per incentive may be established based on a tiered ranking of players. For members of a player club for instance the player s club level may be associated with an upper threshold of incentive value. Likewise in another example a minimum incentive value may be set for players with sufficient standing.

In another example a threshold may be established to total incentive value across incentives. The total value may be associated with a time period week month quarter year for example . The threshold for total value may permit more opportunities for incentive awards increased incentive awards etc. based on player valuation which may include a determination of a player s referral network value.

In another example a player generates buddy bonus codes to deliver to other players. Buddy bonus codes are one example of a referral of an incentive offer. These buddy bonus referral may be associated with a threshold for the number of times a particular incentive may be referred. Additionally checks may be performed to insure that each referral represents an independent referral. In one embodiment each valid referral generated extends a limit on the number of referrals that may be made for each incentive.

According to one embodiment the referrals themselves may require specific actions in order to redeem any award or prize. For example registration for a loyalty program may be a prerequisite to referring incentives and may be a prerequisite to receiving a referred incentive. Alternatively registration may be required in order to qualify to participate after receiving a referred invitation also registration may be an action required to complete a redemption process among other options. In one embodiment entry of contact information is required to make referrals. In another embodiment information on players and or referrals may be tracked in an affiliated location and used to establish criteria associated with referred incentives. According to one aspect it is important to insure that players cannot generate referrers to him herself.

In one embodiment incentives comprise a printed bonus play coupon. In one alternative an image of a bonus play coupon may be delivered to a player rather than a physical coupon. In some embodiments referrer information is encoded on referred incentive offers for example the referring player s name and or player s club number may be printed on a bonus play coupon. Additional information may be included. In one example e mail addresses are printed and or displayed. A value of the bonus coupon may also be printed. In another alternative any of the above identified information as well as other information may be encoded in a bar code for scanning at a redemption location and in another alternative the information may be encrypted.

Friend play incentives may also be directed to associates that don t gamble. In one embodiment a player s spouse or significant other does not gamble and often objects to time money spent at a casino. Non gambling friends may receive incentive awards specifically targeted to nongaming activities e.g. spa visits restaurant rewards tickets to shows theaters etc. that would entertain the non gambling friend while a player was able to game and or gamble. One should appreciate that a player s associates do not need to be entered into a friend play list in order to receive incentive offers that target them with nongaming activities. For example as part of information entered in creating a referral network the player may be prompted to enter personal information about themselves and their associates family relationships etc. The personal information may be used to generate incentive offers that include provisions for nongaming activity. In one embodiment the incentive award may require that a player be gambling and or gaming in order to redeem the nongaming reward i.e. the free visit to the spa can only be redeemed when an associated player is gambling and or gaming. Additional time limits may be imposed on such incentive offers.

Various aspects and embodiments of the invention are directed to a system and methods for providing rewards promotions or benefits for groups or teams of players participating in a rewards program. Such methods may help to maintain or increase the interest of a frequent lottery or game player may provide a new or different incentive to attract new players may offer a means for a game operator to differentiate its player s club or rewards program from those of other operators and may offer a means to generate not only return visits to gambling locations but visits by new players to gambling locations.

Organizations that offer games of chance may include bingo hall operators such as churches senior centers and charitable organizations lottery agencies such as those of United States of America state governments multi state agencies like those for PowerBall and the Big Game and Native American nations and on line and or land based casinos. Virtually any game operator or organization that offers legal games of chance games of skill and non gambling games i.e. affiliated locations may employ the systems and methods discussed herein for providing incentives.

These and other game operators may have associated rewards programs and or players clubs herein collectively referred to as rewards programs . The rewards program may be open to a few some most or all individuals that may play the games of chance offered by an organization. In one example the rewards program may have no requirements to enter besides any legal requirements such as for example age name and address. In another example the rewards program may have other additional requirements such as for example credit card information credit rating and past play history with the gaming establishment. The rewards program may be free or may have an associated fee to join and or to continue to be a member.

In one example the rewards program may have requirements to continue to be a member such as playing a minimum number of games or betting a certain amount of money in a given period of time e.g. US 10 in an hour 10 games in a month or US 1 000 in a year. For example the rewards program may have a requirement that uses an average value to determine whether to continue the membership of an individual e.g. an average of 5 games per month for one year or US 25 per day for one week . The rules for joining and maintaining membership in a player club or reward program may be preferably readily available for review such as at the gaming establishment on a membership card or on an Internet website.

According to one embodiment an individual may sign up to join the rewards program through a cashier or through a remote means including telephone handheld device kiosk computer through the Internet or other network and mail. As discussed above an individual may need to pay for being a member which may be performed using for example money or loyalty points. In particular an individual may pay using money by debit card credit card check cash or from an account credit either with the gaming operator or an affiliated organization. Alternatively a game player may pay using loyalty points from an account held either by the gaming operator or by the affiliated organization. Loyalty points may be obtained from any type of organization but are generally associated with loyalty programs such as frequent flier programs for airlines frequent stay programs for hotels or frequent visitor programs for casinos. The game player may pay in person using a cashier or through other remote methods including telephone handheld device kiosk computer through the Internet or other network and mail.

According to one embodiment a reward program may provide a team of individuals or group of players an extra reward for accomplishing a particular goal and may require additional actions in order to redeem the extra reward. The team of individuals may be any of two or more people that identify themselves as members of the team. In one preferred embodiment the team may comprise three or more people. However it is to be appreciated that the team may comprise any number of individuals and may also be any combination of people that are already members of the reward program or are new members that join the reward program to specifically become members of the team. Some examples of establishing a team is described in co pending application Ser. No. 11 374 473 titled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR REWARDING GAME PLAYERS which is incorporated by reference herein.

Referring to there is illustrated a flow diagram of one example of a method for a team to be identified by a rewards program. In a first step an individual A signs up to join the reward program. In a next step A s information is sent to and stored by the rewards program operator. A may then identify other individuals with whom A may wish to form a team. In step A invites these individuals B and C to join the rewards program and A s team. It is to be appreciated that A may invite any number of other individuals to join and the invention is not limited to teams of three. One or more of these individuals may accept A s invitation and join the rewards program as members of A s team. For example referring to B may join the program step and the program operator may collect B s information step and C may also join the program step and have C s information collected by the program operator step . The program operator may then create a team comprising A B and C and store information that identifies each of A B and C as team members.

It is to be appreciated that while illustrates one example of a method of forming a team many other methods exist and may be used. For example an individual may join an existing team thereby increasing team membership. In another example two or more individuals may sign up to join the reward program and may identify other individuals who are already program members but not members of a team with whom they intend to form a team. Thus in any of these manners a team of two or more players may be created and identified to the rewards program. It should be appreciated that numerous other methods may be used for identifying a team to a reward program and that the methods given above are intended to be examples and not limiting as to the scope of the invention.

As discussed above a team rewards program may be offered by a number of game operators including land based and online casinos and may be offered through affiliated locations or outside locations. In one example the operator may be or may be affiliated with an online casino or gaming environment and players may join teams online. For example a first player using a terminal may join the rewards program and start a team. The player may then identify and invite others to join the team. Terminals may be any type of user interface coupled to a gaming environment including but not limited to personal computers that may be coupled to the gaming environment and to each other via a network connection such as for example the Internet. The terminals may also be computer terminals located at a land based casino and networked to each other and to a casino game server that provides access to one or more games. Each player who becomes a member of the team may view on their terminal a list of team members. The team members may also view a record of one another s participation in games and progress toward team goals.

According to one embodiment the members of the team may obtain team rewards by attaining certain accomplishments such as but not limited to playing a certain number of games in a given time period or achieving certain winnings. The opportunity to earn team rewards may be limited by providing rewards through invitation only. In one embodiment a team must qualify in order to receive an invitation to try to achieve a particular award. A few requirements or accomplishments may include for example any one team member or all team members being required to play a specific game a particular frequency e.g. twenty times in one month or that the whole team may be required to bet a particular aggregate amount in a certain time period e.g. 100 in one month in the gaming establishment. Other examples of possible required accomplishments may include for example playing a new game a specified number of times in a specified time period spending a specified amount of money using the affiliate credit card in the casino playing in a specific special event at the gaming establishment purchasing a specified amount of lottery tickets in a specified time period or betting a specific amount of money in a specified time period on a specific table game. It is to be appreciated that numerous other accomplishments may also be linked to awarding of team rewards points and the inventive principles are not limited to the examples given herein. The accomplishment required to obtain a team reward may be any action associated with the reward program. In addition the required accomplishment may remain constant be added to or may constantly or periodically change. In some examples accomplishments may be required to be performed by one some or all team members or by the team in total.

According to some embodiments benefits or rewards may be in any form including any legal monetary form an account credit loyalty points service or merchandise award. The team benefits or rewards may be stated as being a total team reward or benefit or as a reward or benefit given to each member of a team. The team benefit or reward may also be stated as being the total reward or benefit divided evenly or proportionately among all the teams that accomplish the stated goal. For example five teams may divide evenly a total reward of 3000 for a reward of 600 per team. In another example if a total team reward of 3000 were divided proportionately and one team out of five accomplished twice the stated goal then that one team would receive a 1000 team reward and the other teams would receive 500 each. In another example each team member may also be rewarded by having his or her status level in the membership club increased e.g. from basic to gold or from gold to platinum for being on a team that successfully accomplishes a stated team goal. Successful teams may also be rewarded by gaining better odds on all or specified games. In one example the level by which the odds are improved may be determined by the team size or activity.

In one example individuals may be paid a monetary award using cash or check or through a credit or debit card after achieving an award and taking any required action to redeem it. Individuals may also be given credit through the reward program membership card or through a credit account held with the gaming operator or an associated organization. Alternatively individuals may be paid using loyalty points from an account held either by the gaming operator or by an affiliated organization. Loyalty points may be obtained from any type of organization but are generally associated with loyalty programs such as frequent flier programs for airlines frequent stay programs for hotels or frequent visitor programs for casinos. Furthermore individuals may be paid in person using a cashier or electronically through any method known in the art. Individuals may be notified of attaining the team accomplishment and thus through other remote methods including telephone handheld device kiosk computer through the Internet or other network and mail.

According to one embodiment benefits or rewards for teams or groups may be provided to all members of the team with the team having responsibility for dividing the team benefit or reward. Alternatively the gaming operator may place the team reward or benefit in a team account to which some or all team members may have access. The gaming operator may also pay the team reward or benefit to one team member e.g. a team captain for that individual to divide the team reward among the team members.

According to one preferred embodiment the gaming operator may divide the team reward or benefit evenly among the team members and may credit each team player s account accordingly. As an alternative preferred method the gaming operator may divide the team reward or benefit proportionately according to each team member s contribution toward obtaining the team reward or benefit. For example for a team benefit of 5000 credits awarded to a team that plays 30 hands of a new poker game in one month wherein a first team player plays six hands and second and third team players play twelve hands each the team award may be divided among the three players awarding the first team player 1000 credits and each of the second and third team players 2000 credits thereby awarding each for their contribution. In another embodiment a referral network interface provides the functionality necessary to have the network creator divide group proceeds. In yet another embodiment voting by the group members may be used to divide group prizes.

The team benefit or reward may also have adjustments for a team s account type or status or may have adjustments for any individual team member s account type or status. Status may include location information as determined by one or more location based services. In another example the team benefit or reward may increase if the team includes one or more players with a top level account. The team reward or benefit may also be adjusted for numerous other criteria including frequent player or team credits. Of course all adjustments to a team reward or benefit must meet any legal requirements for the gaming jurisdiction in which the game is played. The team reward or benefit may also be supplemented by a higher level team reward or benefit that may accumulate over time if no team meets the supplemental goal in a given time period. For example a team goal of playing a specific table game ten times in one month may have a supplemental goal of playing a specific table game 100 times in one month. The first goal may be attained easily by many teams but it is possible that no team may meet the supplemental goal and thus the associated supplemental team reward of 5000 may roll over to the next posted supplemental team reward.

According to another embodiment individuals may also attain additional benefits from the gaming operator through actions associated with teams. The additional benefit s may be any of those stated above given out in any of the methods given above. The additional benefit for an individual on a team may be attained by any specified methods including for example putting a team together putting a specified number of teams together of a specific number of individuals signing up a specified number of individuals and having the above signed up individuals in turn sign up additional individuals.

The gaming operator may notify the team and or its members when a team goal has been met and what the team reward or benefit is. Additionally a member of the group may access group status including status of a team goal. The notification of a team or team member may occur for example by mail e mail computer web or network telephone television pager fax kiosk or any other possible method. When a particular team reaches a team goal the gaming operator may then notify all other teams of the team accomplishment. In another example the gaming operator may notify the members of a group of the accomplishment. And in one alternative the notification is directed only to the players of the group that contributed to meeting the team goal or achieving the benefit. Additionally all members of the reward program may be notified of a team s accomplishment and the team reward or benefit provided to the team or its members.

According to another aspect directing incentive offers to groups allows for the value of the incentive offer to be increased. Additionally the same incentive may be offered to larger groups as reduced per player costs. In one example an incentive offer requires that multiple players attempt to qualify and or redeem the offer. The requirement for multiple players allows a large award be leveraged over a large number of players. In another example a requirement includes having a specific number of players in a referral network and or that the network meet a threshold value. In one alternative the requirement may be based on a projected value of the participating players within a referral network. In one embodiment players with higher value generate higher referral network valuations. In another embodiment players within a referral network may contribute more significantly than others thus different scoring for each participant may be appropriate. In one example the top ten players in a referral network for example the top ten players who player the most may be sufficient to qualify for a group play bonus incentive whereas 15 lower ranked players may be required to qualify for the same bonus.

In one embodiment a system requires loyalty player club membership numbers as part of inputting a valid registration. Once registered the player is provided a listing of available bonuses. Bonus listing may be further constrained in terms of value of the player value of the referral network you are associated with among others. In one example the player must request that a particular bonus be unlocked that is indicate an intention to attempt to qualify for a particular bonus. For bonuses that require multiple participants the player may be required to enter e mail address and or player club numbers for each of the referral s he wishes to qualify with. Although one should appreciate other communication methods may be employed. Invited player may also be required to responds to an invitation. A response may include confirming identity information entered by the referring player entity. For example a referred player may respond by registering an online group gaming site. Additional information may be required for example gambling gaming club membership numbers.

According to one embodiment as part of establishing a group an on line interface may be provided. An individual may enter information on friends family groups activities etc that facilitate the creation of gaming groups. The interface may be configured to only allow the creator of the group to view and or edit information therein but in some embodiments any member of a group may likewise enter the group play interface to view status on other members of the group for example. In other examples a member can view status on particular incentive offers complete for example . In one embodiment a member of a group can access the interface to determine what each group member contributed to the redemption of a particular offer for example. Other track information may also be viewed.

According to another aspect a player may track and maintain a referral network through a referral network interface. The interface permits a player to generate groups of other players with whom the referrer has a relationship. Multiple groupings may be entered by a player. In one example a player may create a friends group by entering in information about other players considered friends.

In one example a player accesses the referral network interface to input contact information for referred players. In one example where the referral network is automatically generated the player may review the status of the referral network its impact on that player s value and or maintain the referral network by adding additional referrals deleting referred players from the network among other options.

In one embodiment the interface enables a player to enter and track their own referral networks. In another embodiment the interface may be used to monitor and maintain the referral network. For example a referring player may be able to delete people from his network who do not redeem or act on the referred invitation.

In one embodiment tracked referrals are used to identify a group of potential actual players to whom the referring players has some relationship e.g. friend peer family associate etc. Knowledge about a player tracked through player club membership for example can be coupled with knowledge about his her associates and relationships to identify candidates likely to share similar interests and in the example of a valued player candidates who are also likely to be become valued players.

A referral may be made by specifically referring another player. The referral typically including contact information for example e mail to permit delivery of an incentive invitation bonus play opportunity or other advertising and marketing material to the referred player. Referrals may also occur in the course of trying to achieve redeem multiparty bonus play offers multiparty incentives or multiparty awards. In one example a player receives an invitation to participate in a multiparty bonus game. In order to qualify and or redeem the bonus required is another 10 players who also agree to participate. For example the referring player may forward the invitation to 10 or more people s he knows to meet the requirements of the offer. Referrals may be tracked and the referrals themselves may identify a group of potential actual players whom the referring players has some relationship e.g. friend peer family associate etc. Knowledge about a player tracked through player club membership for example can be coupled with knowledge about his her associates and relationships to identify candidates likely to share similar interests and in the example of a valued player candidates who are also likely to be become valued players. One should appreciate that various requirements may be used to qualify for incentive offers also various criteria may be used in order to redeem incentive offers. The preceding example of 10 additional players should not be read as limiting and any number of additional players may be used as qualification and or redemption criteria.

According to another aspect the referral network interface enables a player to obtain status information on members of the referral network. Status information may include location information as determined by one or more location based services as discussed further below. The player may be the creator of the network and in some embodiments the member of the network themselves can access and view information on the referral network and other members. In one example the extent of information that can be vies by a member of the network as opposed to the creator is significantly reduced. In one example a member of the network can only view summary status information. Although in one alternative there no restriction on access to the group depending on whether you are the creator of the network or just a member.

The status information may pertain to the redemption of incentive offers but may also pertain to whether a particular player is at a gambling location an affiliated location or other locations. In one example status information includes information related to being on site. A player may receive a notification that his her friends are at the same location the player is current at. The interface may render a location finder to enable friends to gamble and or game with each other. In one example the location finder renders a map of the location and indicates the locations of members of the referral network within the map. Additionally the interface may provide a communication platform for delivering instant messages between members of a referral network. In one alternative a player may receive an e mail notification that a member of his her referral network is at the same location. The notification may be delivered by other means for example as a text message voice mail page among others.

At show is an interface for identifying friends playing at the same location that another member of a group is playing at. An individual may be able to access the location of other players playing at the same facility for example. By selecting locate in an individual may identity where at a gambling location members of the group are location.

In an alternative embodiment a gambling establishment or other location can identify player locations using location based services. Location based services may be used to locate players for example in response to a request of a referral network member seeking to locate other referral network members. Location based services may also be used to identify a particular player to a gaming location affiliated location or other locations. Players may be directed to particular games offers services etc. using location based services LBS . Typically LBS is provided through a cellular phone but other mobile devices may also be used.

According to one embodiment referred players valuation may be influenced by proximity to the location at which an action is expected required. Proximity may be determined using LBS services. According to one aspect the closer the player the more likely the redemption and consequently the higher the value for his her referral. In one embodiment the type size and scope of an incentive may be influenced by location information. Proximity may result in a lower barrier to redemption and thus permit smaller awards. Conversely proximity may indicate greater likelihood of redemption and increase a player s valuation and corresponding awards. In one example the referral value of a person located closer to the gaming facility may be higher than someone located farther away.

In another embodiment LBS is used to track players over the course of their activities within a gambling or affiliated location. In one example the tracking information is displayed as a GPS co ordinate indicating for example a time of an event where the event may indicate a wager a series of wagers a purchase or other events the operator may define. In another example the display is configured to provide a visual indication with respect to more recent events e.g. brighter display of the more recent activity different color schemes based on time among others .

According to another aspect incentive offers to referrals may be made directly to the members of a referral network but also incentive offers may be made indirectly. For direct offers the offer itself may reference the referring player his her identity or provide some indication that the incentive offer is being provided as part of participation in a referral network. Incentive offers may be delivered to the referral network hub and all the members of his her referral network. Additionally certain offers may be tailored to subsets of referral networks. For example members of a referral network who consistently played table games may receive incentive offers directed to table type games.

Indirect offers may include for example extending an invitation to a referrer to incent the referrer to pass along the offer to another party. In one example an incentive offer is extended to the hub of a referral network the offer requires participation of at least 10 other players in order to qualify and redeem the offer. The incentive offer may be for free play bonus play credit points prizes or other merchandise for example. Group prizes can be commensurately larger and thus the incentive on the referrer and potential players he she passes the offer along to may be increased.

It is realized that offers invitations may be extended to a particular player to get additional players to act. Indirect invitation may be specifically targeted to specific characteristics that are though to be common to players who are more likely to game and or gamble. The redemption rates of such indirect offers provide real time feedback as to whether the particular characteristic is in fact a good indicator of players who are more likely to redeem incentive offers. By targeting different characteristics of known high value players a generic profile of a high value player may be created and used to target future incentives.

According to another aspect indirect referrals capture the goodwill of the relationship between the referrer and the indirect referee. Moreover by providing incentives to the referrer typically a frequent and or consistent visitor to a gambling location the indirect referral capitalizes on the fact that the referrer was likely going to the gambling location anyway so he she has a greater incentive to encourage the indirect referees to attend and or participate in the incentive. Thus not only can an incentive offer capitalize on the relationship but also on the self interest of the referrer not to mention the self interest of the indirect referral who also receives the incentive offer . It is realized that coupling the effects of the relationship and or the self interest of players serves to reduce any player s or potential player s reluctance to visit a gambling establishment.

According to one aspect characteristics of a valuable player may be determined from existing valuable players their demographic information and the associations and or relationships the player maintains. It is realized that providing incentive to a player to provide information about him herself is of value. In addition players are often reluctant to provide too much information on themselves beyond name and contact information sufficient to participate in player clubs. Enabling a player to achieve additional and or increased awards by establishing and maintaining a referral network provides additional information with respect to the player his her associates and possibly activities outside gambling locations. It is realized that the more information that can be generated on a particular player the better the ability to direct incentive offers not only to that player but also to that player s associates and also to segments of the population that share or have similar characteristics. According one embodiment incentives may be tailored to require additional information in order to qualify and or redeem awards. In one example invitations for specific offers may be tailored to required information on other players. The value associated with particular offers may increase as the detail and or sensitivity of the information provided increases.

As discussed the barrier to achieving actual redemption of incentives is known thus the incentive needs to be sufficient to overcome the barrier or one must reduce the barrier to redemption. The present invention exploits the relationships social or otherwise between individuals to help overcome and or reduce the barrier of redemption.

For existing players who already visit gambling locations the barrier for redemption is typically insignificant. In one example the barrier to redemption becomes a matter of timing. That is players who already visit are going to visit regardless of the offer. Although it is appreciated that proper incentives may increase the frequency and length of visits by these players. It is realized that the lower barrier for redemption for existing players can be utilized as an encouragement for unknown or infrequent players. In one embodiment an incentive offer is provided to an existing player who is known to visit gambling locations. The offer requires a number of other players redeem the offer with the existing player. The existing player becomes in one embodiment an advocate to the referred players for the redemption of the incentive. Moreover the existing player s self interest directs him her to select people likely to participate so that the existing player may earn any award.

According to another aspect another way to overcome the barrier includes providing incentives to the referees themselves. In particular the referee may be credited with the referrer s status for the purpose of determining incentives and or awards for example the frequency and amount of awards . In one example the referrer has a status associated with a gambling location and or affiliated locations the referee may gain the benefit of that status and earn rewards at the same level and have the same amount and frequency of awards be available.

An increase in status may be associated with a time period week month quarter etc. In one example the referee may himself have to qualify for the particular level or status to continue earning incentives awards at the same rate level at the expiration of a predetermined time period. Once the time period has expired the referee will rely on his own qualifications. According to one embodiment a referred player may earn bonus or additional credit towards qualification by being a member of a referral network. In another embodiment the referred player may earn credits points etc by generating his her own referrals. According to another embodiment the first referring player may receive additional points awards increase in status for example from his her referral s referrals.

As discussed above various aspects of the present invention may be implemented using an Internet based computer system. One such system includes a reveal based gaming system that may be used according to various embodiments to provide additional incentive for a player to return to a gambling location. Such a system may be used to play one or more online games which may be then used to incentivize a player to return to a gambling location such as a casino . The game may be initiated by a player accessing a website by a gaming operator after which the game may be played.

As discussed the player may be invited to play the online game. Such an invitation may come from a direct mail invitation email website advertisement issued ticket coupon or other type of invitation. The invitation may for example include a code that permits the player to access the online game. The invitation may include any number of identifying information including codes that may be associated with the player to which the invitation was extended. In some cases there may not be a hard association of the invitation to the player e.g. when advertising to a group of people and the player when redeeming the invitation may be required to provide additional information identifying the player.

In the case where the player is issued a scratch type ticket the player may scratch a surface of the ticket to reveal one or more indications. These indications may include for example a serial number of the ticket an access code or other indication or combination thereof that may be used to access the online game. Alternatively the ticket may be a pull tab ticket or other ticket type suitable for presenting indications to a player. In other embodiments the player may be permitted to access a website to receive an invitation may receive an e mail or may receive an invitation in a non printed form as discussed above.

In the case where the ticket is printed the ticket may include other indications e.g. a decryption key or portion thereof as described above that may be used to decrypt game results . Also the ticket may indicate to a player the number of plays of a second game e.g. as played by the player on a computer system . For instance in the case of a slot machine game the ticket may indicate the number of spins that a player may be awarded by the ticket. In the case of a COLLAPSE type game the ticket may indicate the number of game instances or plays of the COLLAPSE type game that can be played by the player. Further as discussed above the player may be permitted to play any one of a number of offered games and the player may select different games to play to reveal results associated with game instances. For instance the player may be permitted to play a number of different games including but not limited to games of chance games of skill and chance games of skill casino games card games or any other type of game. In one embodiment the player may be awarded during the online experience an award which may be redeemed at the gambling or other redemption location e.g. a POS location .

In one embodiment of the invention where a physical ticket is printed ticket includes a code printed on a surface of the ticket that provides access to outcomes e.g. prizes stored on the server. As discussed code may also include as an optional feature to increase security a key that may be used to decrypt the outcome. This outcome may be stored in a database stored on a server system. Ticket may also include a ticket identifier used to identify the ticket and which may be used to identify the outcome associated with the ticket. Further ticket may include a game indication that relates information relevant to a game played on a computer system. For example there may also be stored on the ticket an identifier that indicates to the player the number of plays associated with an online game. In one example a player is provided a ticket e.g. for free or otherwise purchases a ticket at a retailer or other POS location e.g. in a casino . In the case where there is no physical ticket associated with the invitation the invitation may itself have an identifier associated with the invitation. The invitation identifier may be unique to a particular player or may be unique to a particular group of players to which the invitation is extended.

The player then proceeds to play a game on a computer system. shows an example system according to one embodiment of the invention upon which a game may be played. The user a player plays a game through an interface of a host computer system e.g. host . Host may be any type of computer system that is capable of playing a game. The host may be for example a general purpose computer system e.g. a personal computer PC that connects to a network e.g. the Internet . Other general purpose computer system types e.g. a PDA a cell phone set top box or other system type may be used to play the game.

The computer system may be coupled to a server system through one or more communication networks including but not limited to the Internet. The server may provide a game program that is executed by host for playing the game. More particularly game program when executed may provide an online game that can be played by a user through an interface associated with host . This online game may be for example a video slot machine blackjack or other online or casino type game.

The game program may be stored for example in a computer readable medium e.g. a memory storage or other media associated with server that provides game programs. For instance the game program may be stored on a web server and downloaded to a client computer over the Internet. Game program may be one of a number of game programs associated with an online game experience. Different game programs may be selectively downloaded to the client based on the type of game ticket issued the game selected for play by the user the type of client used or other criteria.

Server may also be a general purpose computer system or any other type of computer system capable of authenticating tickets providing game programs and performing other game related functions. Further it should be appreciated that various game functions may be performed by one or more server systems. Server generally includes a processor for executing server based game functions. Server may also include a memory for storing data associated with game programs. Server may also include one or more network interfaces that couple server to network which permit server to communicate with one or more hosts. Further server may include one or more storage entities including disks or other media for storing data. In one embodiment storage is adapted to store one or more game programs as discussed above. Server may have any number or type of processor that executes an operating system and one or more application programs. In one embodiment server provides web server content to one or more clients for the purpose of accessing and playing the game.

Server may also include a database that is adapted to store one or more outcomes associated with a ticket or other gaming piece. As discussed the outcome may be indexed using an identifier of the ticket.

At some later time and or location the player may play an online game on one or more computer systems e.g. a PC or other computer system capable of playing games . For instance at block a host computer system e.g. host executes a game program. The game program may be for example an online game that includes one or more components downloaded over a communication network e.g. the Internet .

As discussed the ticket may include a code which is used to access the outcome of a game. This code may be printed on a face of the ticket as discussed above with reference to . In one example system the player accesses a website that includes an interface in which the player may enter the code at block . In the case where no physical ticket is issued there may be other methods for associating an invitation to a particular player or group of players and an outcome of an award to be provided to the player and or group of players.

This interface may be for example used to access the game or may be any other interface e.g. an interface used to access a download website used for downloading game software e.g. game program . The interface may be programmed in one or more computer languages e.g. an HTML Java Macromedia Flash or other type interface and may include a text entry box in which the player can input the code. The interface may include other ways of entering a code or other parameter e.g. a glyph printed on a ticket that allows the user to gain access to the game. It should be appreciated that the invention is not limited to any particular method for entering the code or any format of the code and that any type of code or method of entry may be used.

The player enters the code and an outcome is determined at block based on the code. More particularly there may be a mapping between the code printed on the ticket and an outcome stored on the server. This code may be stored for example in a database structure stored in database of the server. Database may be for example a relational database object database flat file database or other organizational entities used to store and maintain data. Further a listing of winning codes may be furnished to an organization that provides the game such as for example a state run lottery commission casino operator etc. . The code may as discussed above include an optional decryption key that decrypts an entry stored on the server. This entry may indicate one or more outcomes of game instances.

The outcome of the game is then used by the online game to determine play of the game by the player at block . For instance if the stored outcome is Win 50 the online game may present an outcome to the player that indicates that the player won a 50 prize. This presentation may be in the form of one or more reveals presented to the player while playing the online game at block . The presentation may be progressive in that the ultimate outcome e.g. Win 50 is achieved through a set of reveals or progressions through the online game. For example in the case where a COLLAPSE type game is played wherein items are collected for playing in a second level game such reveal outcomes of each instance of the COLLAPSE type game may be stored on the server.

As discussed prizes may be distributed over game instances and or items or more generally win opportunities to maximize game interest and to entice the player to play each game instance associated with a particular ticket. For example one approach may include providing to the player an early relative in the series of game instances indication of winning to keep the player interested. As the player plays more game instances the magnitude of the prizes may be adjusted such that a level of game drama is increased. That is prize values are adjusted among later game instances to provide relatively higher prize values in later games. Other approaches distributions may be provided for increasing or maintaining game interest.

Once played the player may redeem the ticket at the point of sale or other redemption location e.g. a gambling location such as a casino at block . Alternatively the player may be permitted to redeem the ticket without playing the game. Redemption may be permitted for example after a predetermined time. For instance the player may be permitted to redeem a ticket after a set time e.g. 10 PM a particular time period after ticket purchase e.g. 24 hours or other absolute or relative time. This may be the case for a Keno or lottery based system where a Keno or lottery result is made available at a set time after the ticket or other type of invitation was provided to the player. Alternatively tickets may be redeemed immediately after they are provided to the player to entice the player to remain at the gambling location. According to one embodiment the player may be permitted to redeem the ticket and winning result any time after accessing the game. At block process ends.

Payouts may be determined by a pay table associated with the game. The number of tickets may be determined a priori and a pay table that determines payouts may be allocated to the tickets. This allocation may be determined for example by shuffling the pay table and allocating results to tickets. The following is an example of a pay table that may be used with a game according to one embodiment of the invention 

As shown in the example above a certain number of tickets may be allocated as winning tickets having a particular payout e.g. an outcome . Some tickets may have no payout associated with them and some may only have a nominal payout e.g. a small award amount free ticket etc. . A small number of tickets may include a large payout as compared to the magnitude of other payouts. It should be appreciated however that payouts are not limited to money but other types of prizes may be awarded including merchandise credit loyalty points or any other representation of value. As discussed above it is appreciated that it would be beneficial to provide a great enough reward to encourage the player to return to the gaming location. Thus according to one embodiment the player may be provided an appropriate award that properly incentivizes the player to redeem their award and return to the gambling location .

The odds of winning may be the type of odds experienced in actual rather than computer based games. Alternatively the odds of winning may not necessarily be natural odds of winning any particular type of game but rather the odds may be adjusted to obtain the outcome desired e.g. by the gaming operator . The odds of winning number of winning tickets amount of payout per ticket or other payout parameter may be any amount or number and the invention is not limited to any particular odds of winning number of winning tickets payout amount or type of payout. However according to one embodiment the overall odds of winning amount and type of payout etc. may be similar to a game previously approved by regulators e.g. scratch ticket games Keno bingo etc. so that the use of an additional game to display an outcome associated with the previously approved game is scrutinized much less by regulators and as a result the approval of the additional game is less burdensome. To this end a system associated with the previously approved game may provide ticket and outcome information to a system conducting an online game e.g. server .

The code stored on the server e.g. server may be used to determine game play as played on the computer system. For instance the game outcome may be Win 50. In the case of a slot machine type game the ticket may indicate that the player receives 10 spins of the slot machine. The outcome of each spin may be predetermined and the game may retrieve information from the server indicating a predetermined sequence of game play as discussed above. In the case of a slot machine type game the predetermined sequence may indicate the winnings associated with each of the spins. In the case of a COLLAPSE type game the outcome of each instance of the second level game may be stored on the server and retrieved prior to game play.

In another example only the overall outcome is predetermined e.g. the total winning associated with the ticket and the sequence of game play may be determined when the game is played. In the example above where the player is indicated as winning 50 over 10 spins the 50 winnings and any intermediate losses may be allocated to the player at any point over the 10 spins. In the case of the COLLAPSE type game winnings may be allocated across game instances. In a further example winnings may be allocated across items collected while playing the COLLAPSE type game. Because the number of items collected may vary depending on the skill of the player the distribution of prizes among collected items may be determined during game play by the game playing system. Thus according to one embodiment the player s skill or lack thereof does not affect the overall outcome of the game.

This allocation may be determined by the server the game software executing on the client or a combination thereof. Further the game play may be randomized in that a further play using the same ticket may yield a different sequence of game states leading to the same outcome. For example in the case of a slot machine game as described above a player may be indicated as winning 50 but the sequence by which the player attains the 50 winning outcome may be different depending on various factors. Such factors may include a randomization function that determines results of individual game plays e.g. in the case of a series of spins the result of each spin or some other function. The series of intermediate outcomes may be stored in a database associated with the server as discussed above with respect to game outcomes. Also the outcomes may be adjusted using a formula or rule based approach during execution of the game to increase the game drama and heighten the game playing experience.

According to another aspect of the present invention a player may purchase a ticket at a point of purchase e.g. a convenience store and the indication of a win no win condition of the ticket is revealed on a different medium. For instance a player purchases a scratch ticket in a convenience or other type of store. The prize that the player wins is not revealed on the scratch card itself but rather the prize is revealed through another medium e.g. on a home computer system PDA cell phone etc. .

For instance as discussed above the player may be presented another game e.g. a slot machine or COLLAPSE type game as described above that reveals at least a portion of the prize. The underlying prizes available via the reveals may be predetermined in that the outcome of the game may be stored in one or more systems. The scratch ticket may reveal different numbers of plays e.g. pulls in the case of a slot machine type game or game instances of a COLLAPSE type game the player receives. As discussed the game could be any type of game and the type and number of plays may be any number and may be selected according to the type of online game being played.

In one aspect of the present invention wherein a physical ticket is issued the ticket may include authentication information that is used to obtain the reveals. In one example the scratch ticket contains a secret key which is used to decrypt the results that are revealed to the player. That is according to one aspect it is impossible to determine if and what a particular ticket wins without having possession of the ticket and therefore the secret key . In another example the scratch ticket could contain only a portion of the secret key. The other portion of the key may be stored for example on a server and retrieved from a database e.g. file relational database etc. based on for example the serial number of the card. Mappings of serial numbers of tickets to encrypted results can be provided to the lottery casino or other provider for additional audit control.

A process for performing secure access to outcomes is shown in . At block process begins. A server e.g. server may store a number of outcomes in encrypted form each of which outcomes can be accessed by a respective code. These outcomes may be encrypted for example using any encryption method e.g. symmetric asymmetric encryption as is known in the art. At block a code is provided to the server e.g. server .

This code may be for example a secret code e.g. a symmetric key a private key printed on a ticket and provided to the server by a user through an interface of a computer system as discussed above. The received code may be transmitted between systems using a secure transmission method e.g. SSL as is known in the art. The received code is used at block to decrypt the outcome stored on the server. This code may be any decryption key type that may be used to decode data and may be of any format or length. The decrypted outcome may then be presented to a player at block . The outcome may be displayed using any method. For example as discussed above the outcome may be presented through one or more reveals presented to the player during play of an online game. At block process ends.

Another aspect of the present invention relates to a lottery based casino based or any other type of software game that can be played over a network such as the Internet. According to one embodiment the system includes a purchase of a scratch based or printed ticket by a player at a point of service POS . A POS may be for example a place at which lottery tickets may be sold including convenience stores or other locations where lottery products are provided. In an alternative system provided at a casino or other gaming establishment a ticket may be sold to a player at the casino for play at a later time. In yet another embodiment the ticket or other invitation type need not be purchased. Also as discussed the invitation need not be printed and according to another embodiment may be provided to the player with or without purchase.

The player receives the ticket or other form of invitation at the POS or other location e.g. a casino and proceeds to play a computer based game at another location to reveal a result or outcome of the game. The computer based game may be for example a casino type game e.g. slot machine video poker or other type of game including amusement games or games of chance. In the case of the scratch or printed ticket the result is not apparent to the player until the player plays the computer based game. This game may be for example a software program that is downloaded and played over the Internet. Alternatively other ways of accessing the online portion of the game may be used e.g. PDA cell phone or other method .

The ticket includes a code by which a player gains access to a result stored on a server that stores ticket information and results associated with each ticket. Such information may be predetermined at the time of ticket sale or the results may not be known until a later time after the ticket is issued to the player e.g. in the case of a Keno bingo or other drawing based system . The result may be determined by any number of factors including but not limited to data regarding the player e.g. income residence etc. the player s historical play at a gambling location the player s play performance in an online game or any other criteria that may be used to determine an award.

According to one embodiment the code is an access key or a portion thereof that is used to access the result stored on the server. Further the result stored in the server may be encrypted. For example the code may be a private key or a symmetric key. The key may be transmitted by a client computer system to the server for the purpose of decrypting the result using SSL or any other secure method.

Because the decryption key is stored on the ticket the gaming system is safer as a breach of security of either the tickets or the server does not provide access to result information. More particularly access to the lottery ticket database or other database type may not be accomplished without the ticket used to decrypt the result . Further the tickets may not be correlated to results without the lottery ticket database because the results are stored in the database not on the tickets .

In another example of the system a portion of the key used to decrypt results of the game is stored on the ticket and another portion is stored in the database of the server. In this manner it is assured that possession of either portion of the key may not compromise the results.

However it should be appreciated that the system does not require SSL or any other encryption decryption method a decryption key on the ticket or the stored result on the server to be encrypted. Rather the game can be implemented with or without these features. That is access to the outcome stored at the server may be performed using only the serial number or other ticket identifier provided on the ticket or with the invitation.

The scratch based or printed ticket may also include a second serial number or other identifier e.g. an access code in addition to the serial number or other identifier which is correlated to results on the server. A ticket may include both a serial number and a ticket identifier used by the system. According to one embodiment it is appreciated that there may be security issues with using the serial number of a printed ticket as printed on the ticket to correlate to win outcomes. That is in the case of a lottery based system the lottery provider may not allow any entity outside of the lottery system to have the ability to correlate outcomes to serial numbers. To this end another identifier e.g. a separate ticket identifier or access code may be provided on a ticket to allow the system to index into an outcome database.

In one example system that works in association with a lottery system outcomes for a game may be predetermined to comply with lottery rules. In this case outcomes are predetermined and stored in a database. In an alternative environment where results are not permitted to be predetermined e.g. in a casino but rather are determined at a later time e.g. by a drawing or other method a ticket issued by a system in such an environment may have an associated drawing time when a game may be played. It should be appreciated however that the award provided to a player may either be predetermined or not and if not predetermined may be the result of some later determination such as a drawing the result of a random number generator etc.

Also according to one embodiment the player may be entered into a sweepstake or any other later determined award based on an action that is performed in the gambling location. As discussed the player may swipe his her frequent player program number at a gambling location e.g. a casino and as a result be entered into a sweepstake or other type of later determined result. The result may be then later determined e.g. when the player participates in an online gaming environment is presented the result of the sweepstakes which includes an award that may be redeemed upon return of the player to the gambling location.

In the specific case where the online game system is driven by a Keno game result each ticket may be associated with a set of numbers in the Keno game and the result of the Keno game is provided as the result for the online game. In one example a computer system automatically picks numbers associated with the ticket at the point when the ticket is issued. Thereafter when the Keno game occurs the result of the Keno draw is provided to an online game system which translates the Keno result to a game experience within another game e.g. COLLAPSE slot machine etc. . It should be appreciated however that although the game of Keno may be used to drive an online game experience other games e.g. bingo may be used.

The server e.g. server may be capable of accepting from the user an input of the serial number and decryption key and in response providing the results associated with the particular ticket. The result or outcome of the game may be displayed to the player in an interface of the computer system e.g. a client computer system such as a personal computer PC used to play the computer based game. For example the outcome of a series of plays associated with the ticket may be stored in the server and provided to the client and the series of outcomes may be presented to the player during play of the computer based game.

In another embodiment of the system a payout of the ticket may be encoded on the ticket. For instance if the ticket is a 5 winner the amount of the win may be encoded on the ticket. In the case of the casino based version of the system the payout may not be stored on the ticket as the payout is not predetermined but rather the purchase price of the ticket may be stored on the ticket or some other identifier of the ticket.

As shown in a system may be provided having more than one server. For instance a server provided at the point of sale is primarily responsible with issuing tickets to a user player . To this end server may issue preprinted tickets or may issue tickets printed from an associated printer . Such tickets may include one or more identifiers as discussed above with reference to . As discussed another system such as a Keno or lottery based system may be used to provide results to an online game system.

In one version of system the win loss determination of a ticket may be driven by a later occurring drawing. For example a Keno based bingo based or other type lottery draw system may be used wherein the outcome of a particular game is not known until a future time e.g. when a drawing occurs . In this case the ticket identifier stored on the ticket may be an access code generated from ticket identifiers in the Keno based system e.g. by an intermediate system or the Keno server itself that can translate a Keno ticket identifier into another type of identifier .

Generation of an identifier separate from the Keno ticket identifier may be necessary for security reasons relating to the Keno system. More particularly access to the Keno ticket identifiers may not be permitted by the system e.g. the Keno server . In one example a Keno system translates Keno ticket identifiers into access codes and results that are stored on the game server e.g. server . Thereafter clients e.g. hosts A B access results stored on the server based on their respective access codes.

As discussed above one or more hosts A B e.g. general purpose computer systems may communicate with a server over a network for the purpose of conducting a game. In one example a host A renders a browser window by executing a browser program e.g. the Internet Explorer browser program available from the Microsoft Corporation . A user player enters a URL address specified by an issued ticket in a window of the browser interface and is directed to a website associated with server . This website may be rendered by for example a WWW server process e.g. server associated with server .

Player may be instructed to enter an access code and or any other required information to access one or more games in an interface presented through the browser. As discussed server may validate the received access code and provide any results stored in a database associated with server . Once validated by server the user may be permitted to play one or more games. These game may be for example be programmed using one or more programming languages e.g. Macromedia Flash and may be downloaded to host A and executed.

Also outcomes associated with any games may be downloaded prior to game play. As discussed examples of games include those that may be of the lottery type e.g. having a predetermined outcome and those that are casino based e.g. having an outcome that is not determined at the time of sale of the ticket . In the case where a later drawing affects an outcome a player may not be permitted to play the game until the drawing occurs and until results are available at server . In the case of a drawing that affects outcomes drawing results can be communicated from server to server . In addition server may maintain a mapping from a ticket identifier e.g. a serial number to an access code provided on the ticket and provide a mapping of outcome to access code when the drawing occurs. As discussed such outcome information may be maintained in a database associated with server and may be accessed through a database server process .

As discussed the payout of the award may be displayed to a player in a number of ways. For instance the payout of the ticket may be presented to the player through one or more reveals presented to a player during one or more plays of an online game.

For instance in the case of a slot machine game a player may be permitted with the issue of a single scratch or printed ticket a series of spins of the slot machine. The slot machine may as the result of each of the spins produce results that contribute to the overall payout to the player. For instance after a single spin a player may be presented an indication that he she has won 5. The payout to the player as provided from the server database may be for the series of spins 50 overall with particular outcomes for each spin. Additional spin results may provide the additional 45 that the player will receive. Additional spins may add subtract or have no affect on the contribution to the outcome of the game. These results of each spin of the slot machine game may be stored in the database of the server indexed by the ticket identifier or may be randomly determined by the game program that renders the game. Further as discussed above the results of each spin may be scripted such that the game experience is more exciting to the player.

For example in the case where the results of each spin are stored on the server the series of results may be downloaded to the client at the beginning of the game as a series of entries and the client may reveal each result as the player progresses through the series of spins. In the random method results for each individual spin are not predetermined but rather are determined by the client in a random manner. For instance the actual outcomes of each spin may be randomly chosen among the possible combination of outcomes that may produce the required payout. In either case the outcomes for each spin of the slot machine game is not stored on the ticket but rather is stored at the server and downloaded just prior or during game play or is determined randomly by the client. Alternatively the client may determine the game experience based on a predetermined set of rules or formulas that when an overall outcome is provided allows the client to determine intermediate outcomes in a dynamic way. Because the game play and outcome are scripted a player may also not play the game and possible secondary games to actually win. A player may purchase a ticket wait until the ticket may be redeemed and go to a POS to find out and if necessary receive his her winnings. A ticket may be allowed to be redeemed after a predetermined period of time after the drawing independent of whether the player has played the game. A ticket may be able to be redeemed after a predetermined period of time from almost immediately to seconds to days or any predetermined time. For tickets with results dependent upon results of a particular Keno game or other event the ticket may not be redeemed until after the event has passed.

In another alternative the game results achieved by the online portion of the game may be separate from the award that is redeemed in the gambling location. For instance the game may be a game for pure entertainment having a result that is not correlated with the award provided to the player. However the player may be required to play the online game to reveal the award.

Finally after play of the online game the player is permitted to validate the ticket or invitation at any gambling location e.g. POS for example a lottery agent casino or other gaming establishment to redeem his her winnings as indicated during the online portion of the game. According to one embodiment the player redeems an award of non cashable credits cash or other type of award that can only be redeemed at the redemption location encouraging the player to return to the redemption location.

According to one embodiment players are permitted to redeem their winnings only after playing the online portion of the game. The player by playing the online portion of the game sets status information at the server e.g. server . When the player attempts to redeem the ticket at the gambling location e.g. POS the status information may be checked and the player is permitted to redeem his her winnings. To this end server may communicate information back to server relating to game play.

For instance server may collect information that indicates the sequence of game play performed at the client and other player tracking information. In one example tickets may be associated with a particular player and the player may be awarded loyalty points or other credit for playing the game. Because the inventive game may award prizes such as for example a non cashable credit for playing additional games a complimentary offer and or promotional prizes the inventive game may be used as a method for providing additional player incentives to return to a gambling location or other gaming establishment.

As discussed various aspects of the present invention may be implemented in an electronic game. For instance a player may be invited to play one or more instances of an online game e.g. played over the Internet in which the player may be awarded one or more prizes which may be redeemed at the gambling location. Such games may include games of chance skill or combination thereof. In one example the game may include one or more instances of a COLLAPSE type game as discussed above however it should be appreciated that any other game type may be used.

Taking a COLLAPSE type game a player is issued a ticket at a POS to play one or more instances of the COLLAPSE type game. The ticket indicates an access code and the player uses this access code to gain access to the system e.g. from a host coupled to server through the Internet . The player enters the access code in a user interface and once validated is permitted to play the COLLAPSE type game. As discussed the COLLAPSE type game is a version of the well known game of COLLAPSE which is a game of skill based puzzle game. Optionally the player is permitted to play based on a single access code and ticket any one of a number of games available from server . Such an option may allow a player to play different games for each game instance associated with the ticket.

A player removes groups of similar elements by selecting them within the grid and the player is awarded points based on the number of elements removed. For example similar elements may be indicated by color and groups of similarly colored elements may be removed from the grid. In one example groups of three elements can be removed. Removal of larger groups of similarly indicated elements may provide more points than smaller groups. It should be appreciated however that elements may have one or more indications that represent that they are similar and the invention is not limited to any particular indication s . Further it should be appreciated that any number of elements may be removed as part of a group and the invention is not restricted to any minimum number of element that may be removed.

Lines are moved into a preview area associated with interface that permits the player to anticipate what element types are being placed into grid . Lines of elements may be moved into the grid at a predetermined rate and the rate may be adjusted from time to time during game play. In one example elements may be fed into the preview area from left to right and when a line of elements is complete the line of elements is pushed into grid . The COLLAPSE type game ends when the grid overflows with elements or a final line e.g. of a predetermined number of lines is fed into grid . As an additional option a player may bypass play of the COLLAPSE type game by selecting a Reveal All element within interface . Selection of element may cause the COLLAPSE type game to end and may allow the player to progress to a second level game.

As discussed above the second level of the game may be played with items collected during the COLLAPSE type game. Also as discussed these items may be hidden within elements of the grid e.g. grid and released as elements are removed. In one version of the game items such as spins of a wheel or sticks of dynamite a.k.a. hotsticks are located within elements in the grid. Items spins sticks etc. are accumulated and used in the second reveal type game to reveal a payout or other type of prize. As shown in interface there may be a prize window in which prizes are awarded.

Window may indicate a number of available prizes and may include an interface control e.g. spin control that allows the player to initiate the second level of the game. Window may be a part of or separate from a window that includes grid . After the player selects control window indicates what if any prize is won. Interface may also include an indication of the number of spins or other items remaining to be played by the player in the second level game.

In the example game discussed above having one or more elements containing hidden items e.g. safes sticks of dynamite or other items collected may be used to uncover the hidden prizes in the second level portion of the game. For instance winnings e.g. cash prizes revealed within opened safe elements are awarded to the player. In one example the reveal of the number of sticks awarded to a player may be randomized by the client computer with at least one stick awarded to the player to allow the player to open at least one safe.

After play of the second level game game play is returned to another instance of the first level game e.g. the COLLAPSE type game . The player may however choose to play a different game e.g. a card game or other game at the conclusion of any particular game instance. The player may be permitted to play further instances of the COLLAPSE type game with each level of the Collapse type game leading to a second level wherein prizes are revealed. These intermediate prize amounts that are revealed with each instance of the COLLAPSE type game as discussed above may be stored in a database of the server and provided to the client prior to or during game play. Alternatively intermediate prize amounts may be determined at the client in a random manner e.g. by randomly selecting a possible combination of intermediate prize amounts that total the overall prize awarded to the player . In another example a game may be determined dynamically by the game system or client based on one or more rules. These rules may be tailored so that the overall result is revealed by the game system in an interesting way.

For instance the ticket may have an overall prize value of 50 and the prize awarded at each instance of the COLLAPSE type game may accumulate to form the 50 prize. There may be a finite number of combinations based on the number of game instances to achieve a 50 prize and the actual game experience presented to the player may be a random selection of the finite outcomes. In any case the result of each game instance is either stored at the server or is determined randomly or dynamically by the client as discussed above.

According to one aspect of the present invention it is realized that the time at which a ticket or other invitation type is activated and therefore may be played is important. In the case of a casino based game where an invitation is provided at the casino e.g. in the form of a ticket or other invitation type it may be beneficial to include a delay between the time that the invitation is provided e.g. purchase of a ticket at the casino and a possible redemption of the ticket on a return visit of the player to the casino so that the game play associated with the ticket does not compete against other games offered by the casino e.g. floor games . For example in the case of a slot machine game it may be preferable that such a game be activated after the player leaves the casino or otherwise is not playable while in the casino so as not to compete with other types of slot machine games or other game types offered by the casino.

Further another benefit of introducing a delay between ticket issuance and activation includes increasing the likelihood that the player plays the game at another location e.g. at home requiring the return of the player to the ticket redemption location to redeem his her winnings. Because the player needs to return to the redemption location which may be a casino the possibility that the player will purchase additional tickets or play other types of games offered at the redemption location is increased.

According to one embodiment of the present invention a COLLAPSE type game is conducted that may include the following additional aspects either alone or in combination 

The game begins with a fixed number of lines of colored elements already positioned on the game grid e.g. grid and available to be selected by the user or player .

New elements fill the bottom and or the top of the screen from left to right one at a time but are not available to be selected. When a row is complete the line of elements is pushed onto the game grid and added to those elements in active play. Alternatively new elements may fill the game grid from any edge including from the right and or left side.

Selecting the preview area as lines are being formed causes the preview area to fill with elements and the elements to be added to the active play area.

The user can clear elements from the active area by selecting any three or more same colored elements that are touching.

When a user positions a selection device e.g. a mouse pointer over a group of elements that are eligible to be cleared the group of elements changes in appearance.

When elements are cleared the elements above fall downward and toward the center to fill any void created by removed elements.

When the user clears an element that contains a dynamite stick or other item in it that stick is placed to the right of the game board for use in the second level game e.g. a prize round .

When the stack of elements comes within a predetermined number e.g. three of rows of the top of the game area a warning area flashes.

If the elements reach the top of the game area the COLLAPSE type game ends and the user is taken to the second level game.

If the user collects a predetermined number e.g. six of dynamite sticks the COLLAPSE type game ends and the user is taken to the second level game.

The stick begins at the top left most safe and moves over each safe in turn from left to right top to bottom one at a time.

The safe that the stick stops at is blown open to reveal either a cash amount or other prize type or an indication that no prize is awarded.

If multiple sticks are available for use each subsequent stick starts at the safe immediately after the safe that was blown open.

At the conclusion of the game the user is presented an indication that the second level game is over and an indication of any prize s awarded.

The overall result e.g. payout for purchasing a ticket may be predetermined as in a scratch or other type of instant lottery game or may be determined by a later event such as a lottery Keno or bingo draw that occurs after ticket issuance.

As discussed above various aspects of the invention relate to providing incentives using a frequent player program. Frequent player programs for casinos generally involve players using frequent player program credits at the casino or affiliated establishment. Therefore the player must visit the casino or other gambling location in order to use the rewards or incentives that the individual may obtain. However there is no actual additional pull for getting the player to visit the gambling location.

Additionally it is appreciated that constantly visiting a casino at a physical location may be inconvenient for a bettor especially if the location is located far away from the bettor. However with the advent of Internet based betting sites and online casinos land based casinos and other gambling locations are at a disadvantage to obtaining bettors that can have other betting opportunities that are more readily available.

One aspect of the present invention relates to a method for providing additional incentives to a frequent player program member to visit a casino or other type of gambling location. One such method combines the ease of using the Internet or other remote communication technologies with the advantages of a frequent player program. In one embodiment of the present invention each frequent player program member has a unique identifier e.g. number or account name and a password or passcode. In another embodiment of the present invention the frequent player program member may be presented with special incentives for remotely swiping his or her frequent player program card or by remotely entering his or her unique identifier and password in a manner that the casino s frequent player program recognizes. A member may be able to remotely swipe their frequent player program card or enter his or her unique identifier and password using an audio enabled video enabled or card reader containing device. For instance a kiosk telephone having a display television computer or handheld device may be used. This additional incentive according to one embodiment may require the member to return to the casino to redeem the incentive. The incentive may for example be in the form of a prize credit or other incentive that has value to the member.

The special incentive may be any program that is targeted exclusively to members that remotely swipe or otherwise use their frequent player program cards. The special incentive program may include for example extra prizes or rewards that are awarded to frequent player program members when they remotely swipe or otherwise use their frequent player program card. In one embodiment of the invention the extra prizes or rewards are not provided to the member until he or she visits the gambling location. In another embodiment of the invention the member must visit the gambling location within a specified period of time to obtain the extra prizes or rewards. For instance the specified time period may be determined to be within a set time period of the membership card being swiped or within a set time period for the special incentive. For example a player may be required to visit a gambling location within one week or two months of having swiped his or her membership card. In another example the player may be required to visit the casino by a set date e.g. Feb. 28 2006 when the special incentive expires.

In another embodiment the player is encouraged to swipe or otherwise use their membership card remotely as frequently as possible. In one example implementation a system e.g. system may determine incentives periodically e.g. daily which are then displayed to the player. These incentives are displayed to the player as indication of a win in the display of a remote system. Because the incentives are determined in a periodic manner continued return by the player to the remote system interface is encouraged. For instance if the period for determining an incentive is once a day a player will be encouraged to use the remote system to see if they have won any incentive s . In this way both return to the casino and the remote interface is encouraged.

In one embodiment of the invention a bonusing message may be presented to the player when the player swipes his or her frequent player card at the kiosk and a paper or electronic coupon may be activated for the player . The bonusing message may indicate for instance that the player may be eligible to receive a prize e.g. to be revealed online . The player may then proceed to an operator s website either on site or off site from the casino. When the player logs in the coupon is activated to reveal the number of game credits a player has received.

Using the awarded game credits the player may then proceed to play the game. As the player plays the game s the player reveals a prize e.g. one or more non cashable credits complimentary offer s and or promotional prize s won by the player. When revealed the prizes may be printed onto a coupon. In another embodiment the prize may also have an expiration date before which the prize may need to be redeemed e.g. at a land based or other type of casino or gambling location . In this manner the player is incentivized to return to the gambling location to redeem the award or prize.

In one embodiment the prize may be predetermined. For instance the amount of non cashable credits may be a predetermined number stored in a database. In another example the prize may be limited within a predetermined range e.g. number of credits monetary value etc. and the actual awarded prize may be randomly selected from within the range. In this way the award may appear to the player to be randomly determined.

In the case where the prize includes non cashable credits the player may then proceed to the land based casino or other gambling location and use the non cashable credits in any manner acceptable to the operator. An acceptable manner of use may include allowing the player to play standard casino games slot machines or any other type of game. Generally non cashable credits may be used for playing casino based gaming machines.

In another embodiment of the invention a player may receive an offer for game play or any other invitation by direct mail e mail telephone pager fax or any other communication method rather than receiving a bonusing message by swiping a frequent player card. Such an offer for game play may for example direct the player to the operator s website and provide the appropriate information for logging into the website to play the game.

In yet another embodiment of the invention a player may enter a sweepstake to win game play s . The player may be informed whether they won or lost at the time of entry. Preferably the player is entered into a sweepstake with a specified time of drawing. In another example the player may be entered into only the next sweepstake drawing a specified number of sweepstakes drawings or all future sweepstakes drawings.

For instance the operator may determine a number of players that are to receive a number of invitations to play the game. In one embodiment players may be selected from a database e.g. as identified by a frequent player account and may be invited to play an online game. As discussed above the amount bonused or awarded to the player may be determined based on a player s historical performance information specific to the player e.g. income residence address position etc. . Further to encourage the player to return to the gambling location or gambling property an expiration date of the offer may be determined by an operator which encourages return to the property within a specific timeframe. Further redemption instructions may be determined based on the bonus or invitation provided to the player.

According to one embodiment various aspects of the invention are implemented on a casino management system or other type of gaming management system. According to one embodiment the casino management system associates the invitation or bonus with an identifier of the player such as for example a frequent player program identifier. The casino management system or CMS may store a number of elements related to the invitation such as for example a player card ID bonus amount expiration date a unique code associated with the offer e.g. a coupon code or other miscellaneous information related to the invitation extended to the player.

The CMS or other type of gambling management system may be coupled to other types of servers that are used to conduct the online gaming experience e.g. server as discussed above with reference to . According to one embodiment such servers may be operated by another entity referred to herein as the backroom operator or the backoffice operator. The backoffice operator may be for example a service provider to the casino or other gambling establishment that conducts the online game experience. In one embodiment the CMS communicates a set of information to the backoffice operator such that the online gaming experience may be conducted. The backoffice operator may have a number of systems e.g. backoffice operator BO servers that perform a number of functions associated with the online gaming experience. In one embodiment the backoffice operator and its systems receive information relating to the bonus offer or invitation that is sent to one or more players. Based on this information the BO system may tailor the online gaming experience accordingly. The BO system may perform functions associated with authenticating particular players obtaining additional information from the player such as for example email address revealing outcomes of the offer or any other game outcomes and displaying and or printing any coupons or other item that can be redeemed by the player upon return to the gambling property.

A player receiving the offer visits the operator s website or other facility for presenting the game to the player. In one embodiment the player logs into the bonus play game from the operator s website. Thereafter the player plays an online game. In one particular embodiment the player may receive bonus play game credits that may be used to play one or more online games. As discussed above the games presented during the online game experience may be any type of game including but not limited to games of skill games of skill and chance or pure games of chance. In one embodiment the games provided online similar to those offered on the casino property. In one particular case the offer extended to the player is based at least in part on the play of the player of the online game. At some point during the online gaming experience the player is provided a unique code e.g. a unique coupon code indicating the award provided to the player. Such an award may indicate for example the amount bonused to the player the expiration date of the bonus and any redemption instructions that are associated with the offer.

The player is incentivized by receipt of the offer to return to the gambling location e.g. a casino property so that the player can redeem the award. For instance the player may redeem the award at a rewards desk located in the casino or may be provided some other method for redeeming the award. For instance the award may be a complimentary offer which can be redeemed at a hotel located on the casino property the award may be non cashable credits which can be associated with a frequent player account which are then redeemed at a gambling device or any other appropriate method for redeeming the award at the gambling location. The operator may perform one or more actions associated with the redemption offer such as recording the redemption of the particular offer e.g. recording the provided coupon code voiding the coupon code for further redemption crediting a player account on a casino management system or any other function.

As discussed above the invitation to play an online game may be provided in any manner and in any location. For instance as shown in the player during a first visit of a gambling location receives an offer to play an online game. For instance the player may take one or more actions at the gambling location e.g. swiping a frequent player card at a kiosk that initiates the presentation of an invitation to play the online game. For instance a bonusing message may be displayed to the player and the player may be provided a coupon which is associated with the frequent player identifier of the player. According to one embodiment the bonus coupon is activated by the act of the player swiping his her frequent player card at the property. Additionally the player may play one or more games at the gambling location.

After the player leaves the gambling environment e.g. the player returns home leaves the gambling property etc. the player may be permitted to play the online game. Further as discussed above the player may be presented a bonus or other award that incentivizes the player to return to the gambling location. For instance as shown in the player during a second visit to the gambling location may be awarded credits to be used at the casino property during the second visit.

In yet another embodiment of the invention as shown in the player may receive an entry into a sweepstakes during a first visit to the gambling location. The sweepstakes entries may be initiated upon one or more actions during the first visit of the player. Such actions may include for example a swipe of a frequent player card one or more gambling activities performed by the player at the gambling location or other player action. In one embodiment the sweepstakes entries may be for a drawing that occurs at some later time. For instance there may be drawings daily nightly etc. that may encourage the player to either remain on the gambling location property or otherwise return to the gambling location after receiving the sweepstakes results.

In one embodiment a computer system may be used to perform one or more remote operations. A computer system may be a single computer that may include a minicomputer a mainframe a personal computer or combination thereof. The computer system may include any type of system capable of performing remote computing operations e.g. cell phone PDA set top box or other system . A computer system used to run the operation may also include any combination of computer system types that cooperate to accomplish system level tasks. Multiple computer systems may also be used to run the operation. The computer system also may include input or output devices displays or storage units. It should be appreciated that any computer system or systems may be used and the invention is not limited to any number type or configuration of computer systems.

A computer system that executes operations according to various embodiments of the invention may include for example one or more system components. For instance one system component may handle remote entry by frequent player program members. Another system component may handle the special incentives and a third system may handle payouts. Such a system may also be connected e.g. by direct line or network to other computer systems including systems for handling casino or hotel loyalty programs reservations in room television viewing gambling floor kiosks or other systems. Connections to other computer systems may be performed using one or more of the system components described below.

A remote entry component may include one or more of a number of well known systems. For example a bettor may be able to enter remotely through an off casino kiosk or other system that is connected to the remote entry computer system through an interface. In the computer data may be stored in a database that is stored in the memory of a computer system. As used herein a data structure is an arrangement of data defined by computer readable signals. These signals may be read by a computer system stored on a medium associated with a computer system e.g. in a memory on a disk etc. and may be transmitted to one or more other computer systems over a communications medium such as for example a network. Also as used herein a user interface or UI is an interface between a human user and a computer that enables communication between a user and a computer. Examples of UIs that may be implemented with various aspects of the invention include a graphical user interface GUI a display screen a mouse a keyboard a keypad a track ball a microphone e.g. to be used in conjunction with a voice recognition system a speaker a touch screen a game controller e.g. a joystick etc and any combinations thereof.

Frequent player program member information may also be entered into a remote entry system component. Member information that may be input may include for example member name address telephone number and age and payment information may include credit or debit card number or loyalty account information. Based upon the member information the call center representative may verify that the member information is accurate.

Various remote entry systems and one or more user interfaces may be located on computer systems coupled by a network with the computer system s storing data having member account and subscription information. As used herein a network or a communications network is a group of two or more devices interconnected by one or more segments of transmission media or active communications equipment on which communications may be exchanged between the devices.

One aspect of the present invention relates to a method for providing additional incentives to a frequent player program member to encourage them to visit a land based casino or other gambling location. One implementation combines the ease of using the Internet or other remote communication technologies with the advantages of a frequent player program. More particularly a frequent player program member may be provided an incentive to return to the casino or other gambling location in a more convenient location to the member e.g. at home on a cell phone PDA etc. .

In another embodiment of the invention extra prizes or rewards may be won through a sweepstake. In one example the frequent player program member may be informed whether they won or lost at the time of entry. Preferably the member is not informed of their winnings until he or she visits the gambling location to encourage more members even losing ones to visit the gambling location.

In one implementation a computer system of a casino may automatically determine when a remote frequent player program member is a winner. Such a result may be automatically authenticated and verified by the computer system. In this instance the computer system may then notify the member that he or she has won and what the winnings are. Notification of winning to a member may occur for example by mail e mail Internet or other network telephone television pager fax kiosk or any other method. In one implementation the player may be advised of their winning during play of an online game. For instance during play of an online game in which winnings are displayed to the player the game program may be configured to reveal an indication of a win of an incentive. Displaying of the indication may occur for example within the game or the display may occur within play of another game e.g. a secondary game to the online game .

After a winner is authenticated and verified the computer system may then notify other members of the win. Additionally the computer system may display the member s identity and or payout.

A member may be able to remotely swipe their frequent player program card or otherwise enter his or her unique identifier and password using an audio enabled video enabled or card reader containing device. For instance a kiosk telephone having a display television computer or handheld device may be used. However it should be appreciated that any other entry method may be used e.g. by entering a member identifier manually into a computer system .

In one embodiment a computer system may be used to operate most of this remote operation. A computer system may be a single computer that may be a supercomputer a minicomputer a mainframe or a personal computer. A computer system used to run the operation may also include any combination of computer system types that cooperate to accomplish system level tasks. Multiple computer systems may also be used to run the operation. The computer system also may include input or output devices displays or storage units. It should be appreciated that any computer system or systems may be used and the invention is not limited to any number type or configuration of computer systems.

A computer system e.g. system that executes game operations according to various embodiments of the invention may include for example one or more system components as shown in . One system component may handle remote entry by frequent player program members. Another system component may handle the special incentives and yet another system may handle payouts. Such a system may also be connected e.g. by direct line or network to other computer systems including systems for handling casino or hotel loyalty programs reservations in room television viewing gambling floor kiosks or other systems. Connections to other computer systems may be performed using one or more of the system components described below.

A remote entry component e.g. system may include one or more of a number of well known systems e.g. as shown in . For example a bettor may be able to enter remotely through an off casino kiosk or other method e.g. cell phone is connected to the remote entry computer system through an interface. In the computer data may be stored in a database that is stored in the memory of a computer system. As used herein a data structure is an arrangement of data defined by computer readable signals. These signals may be read by a computer system stored on a medium associated with a computer system e.g. in a memory on a disk etc. and may be transmitted to one or more other computer systems over a communications medium such as for example a network. Also as used herein a user interface or UI is an interface between a human user and a computer that enables communication between a user and a computer. Examples of UIs that may be implemented with various aspects of the invention include a graphical user interface GUI a display screen a mouse a keyboard a keypad a track ball a microphone e.g. to be used in conjunction with a voice recognition system a speaker a touch screen a game controller e.g. a joystick etc and any combinations thereof.

Frequent player program member information may also be entered into a remote entry system component e.g. system . Member information that may be input includes name address telephone number and age and payment information may include a credit or debit card number or loyalty account information. Based upon the member information the call center representative may verify that the member information is accurate.

Various remote entry systems and one or more user interfaces may be located on computer systems coupled by a network with the computer system s storing data having member account and subscription information. As used herein a network or a communications network is a group of two or more devices interconnected by one or more segments of transmission media or active communications equipment on which communications may be exchanged between the devices. One example of a network includes the Internet at least a portion of which may be used to remotely access incentive information.

The above examples are merely illustrative embodiments of a remote entry system component. It should be appreciated that an illustrative embodiment is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as any of numerous other implementations of the remote entry system for example variations for remote entry method are possible and are intended to fall within the scope of the invention. For example the remote entry system may include using pay per view systems associated with interactive television in an off site hotel or the remote entry engine may additionally deliver a receipt to the member by either e mail or mail. None of the claims set forth below are intended to be limited to any particular implementation of a remote entry system unless such claim includes a limitation explicitly reciting a particular implementation.

Payout systems are also well known. Any of a number of standard systems or payout engines for making payouts for winning may be used. For example a standard application programming interface such as Quicken available commercially from Intuit Inc. Mountain View Calif. USA may be used to write and mail checks or credit a debit card credit card if legal in the jurisdiction of play or loyalty account. Quicken may obtain the payout information by accessing a payout data structure across a network. As used herein an application programming interface or API is a set of one or more computer readable instructions that provide access to one or more other sets of computer readable instructions that define functions so that such functions can be configured to be executed on a computer in conjunction with an application program.

 Quicken is merely an illustrative embodiment of a payout system. Such an illustrative embodiment is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as any of numerous other implementations of the payout system for example variations of online payout are possible and are intended to fall within the scope of the invention. Additionally a cashier may also have access to payout information using a user interface to the payout data structure through a network the cashier then makes a payment to the winning player based upon the accessed information. None of the claims set forth below are intended to be limited to any particular implementation of a pay system unless such claim includes a limitation explicitly reciting a particular implementation.

A special incentives system e.g. system according to one embodiment of the invention may comprise of a number of components for performing specific functions as shown in . These components may include for example a storage component that stores data structures having information relating to special incentive programs and odds. For example such information may include program dates time and location member s betting and win history and program odds. A remote incentives system may also include components to access remote entry and payout data structures.

A special incentives system according to one embodiment may also include an incentives engine. An incentives engine may perform for example any or all functions required to administer the special incentives program s for remote entry frequent player program members. The frequent player program member s winnings of the incentives may be stored and tracked by a computer system of the casino.

In one example a management system e.g. a casino management system may generate incentives and assign them to players. Alternatively the incentives engine may assign incentive and communicate those assignments to the management system. However it should be appreciated that there may be many different systems that are capable of generating and or assigning incentives to a player.

The player s winnings may be displayed on one or more interfaces of one or more systems including but not limited to a game playing computer system on which the player is playing a player tracking system or casino management system that tracks player wins losses or other system e.g. a player kiosk that allows different people casino manager player teller etc. to view the status of the incentive awards. Such incentives may be tracked by the frequent player identifier or other unique identifier associated with the player.

According to another aspect the determination of amount rate volume distribution etc. of rewards earned is important in delivering incentives to player s . In some embodiments rewards provided may be based upon total play total time in a gambling location total time spent in a redemption location total time spent in an affiliated location total spend in a gambling location redemption location and or affiliated location including as an example property owned by a multi property management entity among other options. For example rewards provided may be based on whether or not the player stayed in the gambling location hotel and or a hotel associated with a redemption location and or an affiliated location.

According to another embodiment rewards may be based upon performance. In one example rewards are based upon total performance of a player or in a group play embodiment on the total performance of the group. Groups may be evaluated on total performance average performance of the group members highest performer worst performer etc. The evaluation may impact the amount frequency volume distribution of rewards both to the group and to individuals within the group. In one example the highest performer in a group may receive a higher percentage of any earned reward. According to another embodiment a reward may be based on a combination of performance indicators. In one example the highest player performance sets a potential reward that is adjusted based on the lowest player performance within a group.

According to one aspect it is realized coupling performance indicators to rewards provides additional opportunities to insure quality of referrals referral networks groups and group gaming options. In one example basing rewards on performance provides incentive to a player organizer and or to an entire group not to extend the group to include marginal players. According to some embodiments players may attempt to earn greater rewards simply by increasing the volume of their referral network. Linking rewards to actual performance may be used to provide a disincentive to artificially increasing the size of a network and may be used to provide incentives to only including quality players in one example players who are likely to have large spend at a casino .

In another embodiment group play may enable the group to participate in a win of any member of the group. In one example if a member of a group hits a 10 000 jackpot 10 000 in additional money is divided among the members of the group. In another embodiment the additional money is passed on to the player or entity who referred the winning player. One should appreciate that additional payouts may occur on any win and need not be constrained to payouts of 10 000. Additional payouts may occur at higher award levels lower award levels and in one embodiment an additional payout threshold may be linked to player and or group status including performance. According to one embodiment additional payouts may also be divided based on player performance within a group. In another embodiment additional payouts may be divided based on player status. In yet another embodiment additional payouts may be made based on a value determination of a player. Divisions of payout made also be based first on equal division and then have an adjustment factor applied based on player status player performance player value among others.

According to one aspect it is realized that rewarding a group of players based upon performance factors can amplify the positive increasing win and letting groups participate in them and reduce the negative by offsetting losses. During gambling often a hand or wager may appear to have a high likelihood of a winning result which triggers larger than average wagering but upon the final determination the good hand loses often times this is referred to as a bad beat that is a hand that should have been won. By providing some reward in response to a bad beat condition some of the sting of the loss can be mitigated. Directing rewards to a player who suffered such a bad beat in greater proportion than the remainder of the group may also offset negative feeling. Thus an operator may tailor rewards for specific players and or groups of players to improve overall gaming experience.

According to one embodiment incentive rewards directed to a group and or individual players are based upon total wins. In another embodiment incentive rewards directed to a group and or individual players are based upon total losses. In yet another embodiment incentive rewards directed to a group and or individual players are based upon total time in a gambling location. According to one embodiment the incentive reward may be based upon a combination of player related metrics.

According to another aspect rewards may be adjusted dynamically even during a gambling play session indeed the methodology of determining an award may be subject change. In one embodiment a gambling location operator may increase or decrease the value of rewards being offered to groups and or individual players. Adjustments may be made to amplifying feelings of winning offset feelings of loss and may also be tailored to specific needs of the gambling locations. In one example rewards may be tied to specific games and in another to locations in the gambling location that see less activity.

In another embodiment the underlying methodology of calculating distributing a reward may be subject to change. In one embodiment an individual player may be offered some control over the reward calculation methodology. In particular the player may be offered choice as part of account personalization. In another embodiment player information will dictate the reward methodology based on the provided information.

Affiliated locations may also participate in the determination of a reward methodology. The affiliate may use specific reward methodologies as an incentive to a patron not only to visit a gambling location to redeem an award but to increase patron satisfaction and increase likelihood of repeat visits to the affiliate. Customization of the reward methodology may also be of direct benefit to a gambling location. Affiliates and gambling locations may agree to a particular type of reward methodology to increase and or decrease the compensated value of any referral from an affiliate. Different methodologies may be agreed to between affiliated locations and gambling locations based on a perceived value of a particular player or particular group of players. Adjustments may be made after a specified period of time to allow for actual play to measured. Additionally a reward for a referral may be determined after a predetermined period of time.
