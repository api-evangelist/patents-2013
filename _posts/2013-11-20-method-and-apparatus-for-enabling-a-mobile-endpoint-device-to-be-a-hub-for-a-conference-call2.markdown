Currently when a user calls into a conference call with multiple colleagues or other users a user may dial into the conference call using a Polycom device or other conferencing hub. Typically the Polycom device calls into a conferencing bridge or to another caller via a landline telephone call. However some users in a large conference room may be far away from the speaker and may not be in a position to hear the Polycom output device or the other party on the conference call may not be able to hear other users relatively far away from the Polycom input device. In addition specialized conferencing equipment such as Polycom devices are often quite expensive.

Alternatively multiple users may separately dial into a conference bridge to conduct a conference call. However issues with latency lag and echo may cause issues with the quality of the conference call. Another alternative is to have multiple users gather around closely a user s device that is placed on speaker phone mode to conduct the conference call if no Polycom device is available. Notably all of these alternatives have drawbacks.

In one embodiment the present disclosure provides a method computer readable storage device and an apparatus for enabling a mobile endpoint device to be a hub for a conference call. In one embodiment the method connects to the conference call broadcasts a signal to at least one slave mobile endpoint devices to join the conference call over a personal area network receives a pairing request from the at least one slave mobile endpoint device over the personal area network accepts the pairing request and connects the at least one slave mobile endpoint device to the conference call via the master mobile endpoint device over the personal area network wherein both the master mobile endpoint device and the at least one slave mobile endpoint device have two way communications with the conference call and conference call controls.

To facilitate understanding identical reference numerals have been used where possible to designate identical elements that are common to the figures.

The present disclosure broadly discloses a method computer readable storage device and apparatus for enabling a mobile endpoint device to be a hub for a conference call. As discussed above the available options for conducting a conference call all have drawbacks due to inconvenience latency lag echoing or costs. One embodiment of the present disclosure allows users to leverage the users personal mobile endpoint devices e.g. a cellular telephone or a smart phone as a hub for a conference call. As a result each user may have some conference call controls on his or her personal mobile endpoint device that is connected to a master mobile endpoint device via a personal area network PAN that uses a near field communications protocol e.g. Bluetooth Zigbee and the like .

For example the communication network may include a core network a personal area network PAN an endpoint device and one or more mobile endpoint devices and . In one embodiment the core network may be an Internet Protocol IP network e.g. an IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS network that may provide wireless communication services to the mobile endpoint devices and .

In one embodiment the wireless communication services may be cellular communication e.g. 2G 3G 4G LTE and the like services. In another embodiment the communication services may be wireless communication services such as a wireless fidelity Wi Fi service. In one embodiment the communication network may include one or more access networks not shown such as a cellular network a Wi Fi network a cable network and the like situated between the core network and the mobile endpoint device and or the endpoint device . In one embodiment the communication network in is simplified and it should be noted the communication network may also include additional network elements not shown such as for example border elements gateways firewalls routers switches call control elements various application servers and the like.

In one embodiment the endpoint device may be any type of endpoint device used by a user for conference call services. For example the endpoint device may be a conference bridge in communication with the core network or located in the core network . In another embodiment the endpoint device may be a telephone a mobile telephone a smart phone a desktop computer a laptop computer a tablet computer and the like.

In one embodiment the mobile endpoint devices and may be any type of mobile endpoint devices such as for example a cellular telephone a smart phone a tablet computer with voice capability and the like. In one embodiment the mobile endpoint devices and may have a subscription to wireless communication services via the communication service provider of the core network . For example the wireless communication service may be a cellular communication service or subscription. In another embodiment the wireless communication service may be a service provider of Internet services that provides Wi Fi communication services.

In other words the mobile endpoint devices and are not general endpoint devices that require a landline or a wired telephone communication service that could be moved from location to location and re connected e.g. a Polycom main speaker or hub a terminal adapter a landline telephone and the like . In addition the mobile endpoint devices and should not be interpreted as a simple input output device such as a headset or a portable speaker that is technically mobile . Rather the mobile endpoint devices and are capable of obtaining cellular subscription services or Wi Fi services and are capable of running application programs.

In one embodiment the mobile endpoint device may be referred to also as a master mobile endpoint device . In one embodiment the master mobile endpoint device may establish a connection to a conference call with the endpoint device via the core network . In one embodiment the endpoint device may be a conference bridge that the master mobile endpoint device dials into and connects with another caller not shown . In one embodiment the endpoint device may be another telephone or computer that the master mobile endpoint device is calling directly for conferencing services.

In one embodiment the mobile endpoint devices and may also be referred to as slave mobile endpoint devices and . Although only three slave mobile endpoint devices are illustrated in it should be noted that any number of slave mobile endpoint devices may be deployed. In one embodiment the slave mobile endpoint devices and may pair with the master mobile endpoint device over the PAN to connect to the conference call. In other words the mobile endpoint devices and are connected to the conference call through the master mobile endpoint device . Said another way the slave mobile endpoint devices and are not used to directly join or dial into a conference bridge that is setup for a conference call.

In one embodiment the PAN may use a short range open or ad hoc communications protocol. For example the PAN may use a Bluetooth communications protocol a ZigBee communications protocol a wireless universal serial bus wUSB communications protocol and the like.

The master mobile endpoint device and the slave mobile endpoint devices and may be associated with different users. As a result each one of the different users may use his or own mobile endpoint device or as a personal hub to the conference call. In other words each one of the different users may have his or her own speaker and microphone to the conference call and independent conference call controls e.g. controls to the speaker and microphone without the need to hover over the master mobile endpoint device on speakerphone. However it should be noted that the master and slave devices are not limited just to the speakerphone mode during the conference call. For example all modes provided by the respective handset the mobile phone wired or wireless headset in communication with the mobile phone and speakerphone internal of external to the mobile phone can be equally utilized.

In one embodiment the mobile endpoint devices and may be modified to perform the functions described herein. For example the operating systems of the mobile endpoint devices and may be modified to allow the mobile endpoint devices and operate in either a master or slave mode for the communications protocol used to connect to one another over the PAN and include various call controls and conference call controls described herein.

In one embodiment the master mobile endpoint device and the slave mobile endpoint devices and may have installed an application programming interface API that runs a conference call application for performing the functions described herein. In one embodiment the conference call API may allow a cellular telephone or smart phone to be a slave or a master device using a Bluetooth connection. For example currently cellular telephones or smart phones only act as a master device that allows a slave input output device such as a headset or an external speaker to connect to the smart phone. However the smart phone typically cannot connect to another smart phone as a slave device via a Bluetooth connection. In other words the conference call API may modify the Bluetooth communications protocol on the mobile endpoint devices and to allow the mobile endpoint devices and to operate as either a master device or a slave device for a conference call.

In one embodiment the conference call API may provide conference call controls which may be differentiated from call controls. The call control of the master mobile endpoint device may provide various controls e.g. calling a conference bridge hanging up or hook flashing that can be done at anytime. The conference call controls may include controls associated with the conference call that are discussed in further detail below. For example the conference call controls may include muting volume adjustments selectively disconnecting one or more slave mobile endpoint devices and the like. In one embodiment only the master mobile endpoint device may have both call controls and conference call controls and the slave mobile endpoint devices and may only have some limited conference call controls.

As a result when the slave mobile endpoint devices and are connected to the conference call via the connection to the master mobile endpoint device via the PAN each one of the slave mobile endpoint devices and may have slave conference call controls. For example each one of the slave mobile endpoint devices and may independently control its own volume level e.g. louder or quieter toggle a mute button and the like.

In one embodiment the master mobile endpoint device may have master conference call controls in addition to the call controls discussed above. For example the master mobile endpoint device may display or list each one of the slave mobile endpoint devices and that are paired with the master mobile endpoint device via a display e.g. a graphical user interface GUI . In one embodiment the display may allow a user of the master mobile endpoint device to selectively disconnect one or more of the slave mobile endpoint devices and selectively mute one or more of the slave mobile endpoint devices and and the like. The master mobile conference call controls may also include adjusting a master volume e.g. louder or quieter having a mute all function e.g. muting the master device and all slave devices an end conference call function and the like. For example if the master mobile endpoint device terminates the conference call then all of the slave mobile endpoint devices and may automatically be disconnected or unpaired from the master mobile endpoint device .

It should be noted that unlike traditional pairing of a cellular telephone or smart phone to an external input output Bluetooth device the master mobile endpoint device may still be used for two way communications on the conference call. For example when a Bluetooth headset is paired to a smart phone all of the voice communications are sent over the headset. Typically the smart phone is muted and communications cannot be sent or received over the smart phone while the headset is paired with the smart phone. In contrast in the present disclosure the conference call API may modify the communications protocol for the PAN e.g. Bluetooth to allow the master device e.g. the master mobile endpoint device to continue to send and receive communications in addition to acting as a conduit for connections to the conference call for the paired slave mobile endpoint devices and .

In one embodiment the master mobile endpoint device may send an authentication code or a pre defined code to the slave mobile endpoint devices and . For example most communications protocols for the PAN use open or ad hoc protocols. As a result any mobile endpoint device could snoop the signal broadcasted to the slave mobile endpoint devices and to pair to the master mobile endpoint device . However the authentication code may be used to require the slave mobile endpoint devices and to provide the authentication code e.g. an alphanumeric code of any length such as for example four digits to the master mobile endpoint device for authenticating a pairing request.

In one embodiment whenever the master mobile endpoint device receives a pairing request the master mobile endpoint device may provide an audible tone to the user. The audible tone may provide a notification to the user to alert them that other mobile endpoint devices are attempting to pair with his or her master mobile endpoint device . In one embodiment the slave mobile endpoint devices and may also provide an audible tone to the respective users when the pairing request is sent to the master mobile endpoint device .

A real life example is presented to illustrate the benefits of the present disclosure. For example a user may be traveling on business with several business colleagues. The user and the colleagues may have a conference call that they need to connect to while they are travelling.

Previously each user would be required to dial in separately on his or her respective mobile endpoint device. This could create echoes or lag to the other users on the conference call. In addition the conference call bridge may have a limit to the number of users that may be able to join. If the conference bridge can only accommodate one more caller then only one of the users who are travelling would be able to call in and the remaining business colleagues would have to huddle around a single mobile endpoint device placed on speakerphone mode to participate in the conference call.

However using the present disclosure one of the users may call into the conference call. Subsequently the remaining business colleagues could pair to the user s master mobile endpoint device using a conference call API on the mobile endpoint devices over a PAN e.g. a Bluetooth connection . As a result each user would have his or her own hub via his or her own respective mobile endpoint device to participate in the conference call. In one embodiment a hub may be defined as having full two way communications for the conference call and one or more independent conference call controls. In one embodiment the conference call controls are independent in that a user may toggle one of his or her conference call controls without affecting the same control of another user. For example the conference call controls may include volume adjustment or a mute button.

In another embodiment no conference call service may be available. However one of the users e.g. referred to as the calling party may directly call a called party. The remaining users may pair to the calling party s master mobile endpoint device using a conference call API on the mobile endpoint devices over the PAN e.g. a Bluetooth connection . As a result each user would have his or her own hub via his or her own respective mobile endpoint device to participate on the call with the called party. In essence an ad hoc conference call may be created even when no conference call bridge was previously reserved or established.

The method begins at step . At step the method connects to a conference call. For example the master mobile endpoint device may first dial into a conference bridge or with another caller.

At step the method may broadcast a signal to one or more slave mobile endpoint devices to join the conference call over a PAN. For example the signal may be an indication that the conference call is connected and that the slave mobile endpoint devices should begin initiating requests to pair with the master mobile endpoint device. The signal may also include a pop up message is sent to the slave mobile endpoint device to notify the user to begin initiation of the pairing request.

In one embodiment the PAN may use a Bluetooth communications protocol a ZigBee communications protocol a wUSB communications protocol and the like. In one embodiment the master mobile endpoint device and the slave mobile endpoint device may have installed and be running a conference call API to allow the mobile endpoint device to be a master or a slave device using one of the communications protocols described above for the PAN.

At step the method may receive a pairing request. For example one or more of slave mobile endpoint devices may receive the broadcasted signal to join the conference call and are now initiating the pairing by sending a pairing request to the master mobile endpoint device.

At optional step the method may provide an audible tone when the pairing request is received. For example the audible tone may provide a notification to the user of the master mobile endpoint device each time that a slave mobile endpoint device is attempting to pair with the master mobile endpoint device. This may allow the user of the master mobile endpoint device to manage the connections to the master mobile endpoint device and monitor which slave mobile endpoint devices are attempting to pair with the master mobile endpoint device.

At optional step the method may authenticate the pairing request. For example a pre defined code or an authentication code e.g. a four digit alphanumeric code may be sent to the desired one or more slave mobile endpoint devices. In one embodiment the pre defined code or the authentication code may be sent before the master mobile endpoint device connects to the conference call.

In one embodiment after the pairing request is received the master mobile endpoint device may send an authentication request to the slave mobile endpoint device. The master mobile endpoint device may then wait for a response. When the response is received the master mobile endpoint device may verify that the received response matches the pre defined code or the authentication code.

At step the method may determine if the pairing request is accepted. If the pairing request is not accepted e.g. the response did not match the pre defined code or authentication code at step or a user of the master mobile endpoint device refuses the pairing request manually the method may proceed to step .

At step the method does not connect the slave mobile endpoint device to the master mobile endpoint device. The method then proceeds to step where the method ends.

Referring back to step if the method accepts the pairing request the method may then proceed to step . At step the method may connect the slave mobile endpoint device to the conference call as a hub via the master mobile endpoint device over the PAN. For example the slave mobile endpoint device may be paired to the master mobile endpoint device via Bluetooth connection. As a result the slave mobile endpoint device may have slave conference call controls and the master mobile endpoint device may have master conference call controls. In addition the master mobile endpoint device and the slave mobile endpoint device may each have independent two way communications with other callers on the conference call e.g. the called party or other callers on a conference bridge .

At step the method determines if a conference call is terminated by the master mobile endpoint device. If the conference call is not terminated the method returns to step where the slave mobile endpoint device remains connected to the conference call via the master mobile endpoint device. However if the master mobile endpoint device terminates the conference call at step the method proceeds to step . At step the method ends.

The method begins at step . At step the method receives a signal over a personal area network PAN to pair with a master mobile endpoint device that is already connected to a conference call. For example the signal may be an indication that the conference call is connected and that the slave mobile endpoint devices should begin initiating requests to pair with the master mobile endpoint device. The signal may also include a pop up message is sent to the slave mobile endpoint device to notify the user to begin initiation of the pairing request.

In one embodiment the slave mobile endpoint device and the master mobile endpoint device may run a conference call API that allows the mobile endpoint devices to operate as a slave device or a master device in a communications protocol e.g. Bluetooth used over the PAN. In one embodiment the master mobile endpoint device may broadcast a signal using the communications protocol of the PAN.

At step the method send a pairing request. For example the slave mobile endpoint device may initiate the pairing by sending a pairing request to the master mobile endpoint device.

At optional step the method may provide an audible tone when the pairing request is sent. In one embodiment the audible tone may provide a notification to a user of the slave mobile endpoint device confirming that the pairing request was sent successfully and that the master mobile endpoint device has received the pairing request.

At optional step the method may authenticate the pairing request. For example a pre defined code or an authentication code e.g. a four digit alphanumeric code may be sent by one or more slave mobile endpoint devices to the master mobile endpoint device. In one embodiment the pre defined code or the authentication code may have been received by each of the slave mobile endpoint devices before the master mobile endpoint device connects to the conference call.

In one embodiment after the pairing request is sent the master mobile endpoint device may send an authentication request to the slave mobile endpoint device. The slave mobile endpoint device may then send a response to the master mobile endpoint device. The master mobile endpoint device may verify that the received response matches the pre defined code or the authentication code.

At step the method determines if the pairing request is accepted. If the pairing request is not accepted e.g. the response did not match the pre defined code or authentication code at step or a user of the master mobile endpoint device refuses the pairing request manually the method may proceed to step .

At step the method notifies the slave mobile endpoint device that the pairing request was denied. The method then proceeds to step where the method ends.

Referring back to step if the method accepts the pairing request the method may then proceed to step . At step the method may connect the slave mobile endpoint device to the master mobile endpoint device over the PAN as a hub of the conference call. For example the slave mobile endpoint device may be paired to the master mobile endpoint device via Bluetooth connection. As a result the slave mobile endpoint device may have slave conference call controls and the master mobile endpoint device may have master conference call controls. In addition the master mobile endpoint device and the slave mobile endpoint device may each have independent two way communications with other callers on the conference call e.g. the called party or other callers on a conference bridge .

At step the method determines if the connection over the PAN is terminated by the master mobile endpoint device. For example the master mobile endpoint device may have master conference call controls that include selectively disconnecting any one of a plurality of slave mobile endpoint devices paired to the master mobile endpoint device. If the connection over the PAN is terminated the method may proceed to step where the method ends.

However if the connection over the PAN is not terminated the method may proceed to step . At step the method may determine if the connection to the conference call is terminated by the master mobile endpoint device. If the conference call is not terminated the method returns to step where the slave mobile endpoint device remains connected to the conference call via the master mobile endpoint device. However if the master mobile endpoint device terminates the conference call at step the method proceeds to step . At step the method ends.
