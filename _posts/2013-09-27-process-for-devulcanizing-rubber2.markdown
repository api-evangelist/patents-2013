This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 707 218 filed on Sep. 28 2013 which is incorporated herein by reference.

Embodiments of invention relate to devulcanizing sulfur cured rubber by thermo mechanical techniques while removing or scavenging sulfur and sulfur bearing species that are a by product of the devulcanization process.

Rubber membranes are used in a variety of applications. For example it is common in the art to employ rubber sheet material to cover rooftops especially flat or low sloped roofs. One type of technologically useful membrane is prepared from olefinic rubber such as EPDM rubber which is a terpolymer of ethylene propylene and a diene monomer. A curative is employed to crosslink the EPDM terpolymer and thereby create a durable protective membrane. Sulfur curatives are often used to cure or crosslink the rubber. Advantageously EPDM has a fully saturated backbone which provides resistance to ozone and oxidation.

These protective membranes must be able to withstand severe environmental conditions without the membrane failing. Depending on the geographic location the EPDM terpolymer membranes must be able to withstand temperatures that can reach up to as high as about 90 C. for prolonged periods of time. Further these membranes must be able to withstand long exposure to UV light and ozone without undergoing chemical degradation. Further these membranes must withstand mechanical stresses that are experienced as least in part from wind uplift forces. As is known in the art useful EPDM membranes must meet the performance standards set forth in ASTM D 4637 03 and D1418 85.

While technologically useful these membranes have a limited life. In many situations the service life does not exceed thirty years. Replacement of roofing membrane may include placement of new membrane over the existing membrane or removal of the existing membrane followed by installation of the new membrane. The latter is often desirable or required.

Removal of an existing membrane creates a disposal issue. Thousands if not millions of square feet of EPDM based membranes are used to cover roofs and therefore disposal of existing membranes is not trivial. Solutions to the problem that have been proposed include recycling of the scrap EPDM for use in other applications such as fuel or as filler in new rubber products.

Entities in many industries seek to recycle EPDM rubber in order to reduce waste and increase profits by putting scrap rubber to beneficial use. In mechanical processes EPDM rubber is recycled simply by physically cutting and grinding the same into small pieces that can be incorporated into new rubber products essentially as filler. The particle size of the ground rubber may vary depending on the grinding methods employed. Large particles of ground rubber which are typically used as fuel are obtained with regular shredders or grinders while fine rubber particles are obtained by cryogenic grinding and used as fine fillers in rubber and plastic products. Mechanically recycled rubbers are typically employed in applications where the mechanical and physical properties of the end product are not too demanding. Few waste rubber products can be mechanically recycled for use in their original applications. For example while others have mechanically recycled scrap EPDM roofing membranes this recycled rubber is not used in new roofing membranes because the small pieces of recycled rubber are still vulcanized and thus not able to successfully interact with the remainder of the rubber matrix of the new roofing membrane.

In order to process the ground rubber particles and form them into useful products they are typically mixed with virgin polymers. Although ground rubber may be incorporated into virgin rubber in this manner the ground rubber remains phase separated from the virgin material and therefore may not become incorporated into the rubber matrix upon curing of the virgin rubber.

In light of this efforts have been made to devulcanize rubber products including EPDM. Chemical devulcanization is an example that is particularly distinguishable from the non devulcanizing mechanical cutting and grinding method previously stated above. U.S. Pat. No. 6 956 065 teaches the use of amines as devulcanizing agents to devulcanize EPDM rubber. U.S. Pat. No. 5 770 632 also discloses a chemical devulcanization process.

Yet another devulcanization method involves a thermo mechanical devulcanization process. In these processes traditional rubber processing instruments such as open mills and twin screw extruders subject scrap rubber to shear and heat to achieve a partial devulcanization. U.S. Pat. No. 7 342 052 discloses a thermo mechanical method of devulcanizing scrap rubber including heating the scrap rubber agitating the scrap rubber in a thermo kinetic mixer and adding an oil to the scrap rubber as it is agitated. The thermo kinetic mixer contemplated by the patent is a double boiler vessel including a mixing chamber having a rotor to apply shear stresses to the scrap rubber.

U.S. Pat. Nos. 2 461 192 and 6 632 918 each disclose a thermo mechanical method of devulcanizing scrap rubber including heating the scrap rubber to a temperature within a desired range and applying shear stresses to the heated scrap rubber while subjecting the rubber to increased pressures. U.S. Pat. No. 2 461 192 contemplates use of a Banbury mixer to apply the shear stresses to the scrap rubber and U.S. Pat. No. 6 632 918 contemplates using a twin screw extruder to apply the shear stresses to the scrap rubber.

One or more embodiments of the present invention provide a process for devulcanizing EPDM rubber comprising the step of introducing sulfur cured EPDM to an extruder introducing from about 0.5 to about 20 wt scavenging agent based upon the total weight of the EPDM and scavenging agent and mixing and masticating the EPDM at a temperature sufficient to at least partially devulcanize the sulfur cured EPDM.

Embodiments of the invention are based at least in part on the discovery of a devulcanization process for sulfur cured rubber that includes thermo mechanical treatment of the sulfur cured rubber while removing and or scavenging sulfur or sulfur bearing species from the process. Thus while the prior art may contemplate thermo mechanical devulcanization of sulfur cured rubber the prior art does not appreciate the deleterious effect that sulfur and sulfur bearing species can have on the process. In particular it has been found that sulfur and or sulfur bearing species can degrade the equipment effecting the thermo mechanical devulcanization and thereby deleteriously impact the process. For example it has been observed that metal components of the extruder such as the screws or elements of a twin screw extruder or spindles of a planetary extruder lose mass and diameter at unexpectedly high rates during the devulcanization of sulfur cured rubber. It has unexpectedly been found that removal or scavenging of sulfur or sulfur bearing species has an appreciable impact on the success of these devulcanization techniques. In lieu of or in addition to removal and or scavenging the sulfur or sulfur bearing species the use of degradation resistant metals for the screws spindles and other components of the extruder could also alleviate the problems.

In one or more embodiments the material treated and ultimately reclaimed according to this invention includes sulfur cured olefinic rubber. In one or more embodiments this olefinic rubber is contained within a scrap rubber composition that can be recycled according to this invention.

In one or more embodiments the material treated according to embodiments of this invention includes cured olefinic rubber contained within a scrap rubber composition that may also include other constituents such as fillers oils antioxidants resins stearic acid tackifiers various sulfur bearing compounds accelerators and sundry other rubber additives that may be employed in the preparation of rubber products such as EPDM roofing membranes. In these or other embodiments the scrap rubber composition may include reinforcing fabric materials such as polyesters and the like. Thus while it is believed that the process of this invention specifically acts on and devulcanizes the cured olefinic rubber the material being treated and processed according to embodiments of this invention includes a scrap rubber composition.

In one or more embodiments the scrap rubber composition includes from about 5 to about 50 wt. in other embodiments from about 15 to about 40 wt. in other embodiments from about 20 to about 40 wt. and in other embodiments from about 25 to about 30 wt. cured olefinic rubber based on the entire weight of the scrap rubber composition.

In one or more embodiments the scrap rubber composition may also include filler materials such as carbon black and or one or more mineral fillers. In one or more embodiments the scrap rubber composition treated according to embodiments of the present invention may include from 15 to 55 wt. in other embodiments from about 20 to about 50 wt. in other embodiments from about 30 to about 45 wt. and in other embodiments from about 35 to about 40 wt. carbon black based on the entire weight of the scrap rubber composition.

In these or other embodiments the scrap rubber composition may include from 10 to 40 wt. in other embodiments from 15 to 30 wt. and in other embodiments from 18 to 25 wt. oil or other extenders based upon the entire weight of the scrap rubber composition.

In these or other embodiments the scrap rubber composition may include from 3 to 20 wt. in other embodiments from 5 to 15 wt. and in other embodiments from 6 to 12 wt. mineral filler based upon the entire weight of the scrap rubber composition.

As those skilled in the art appreciate olefinic rubber includes polymers that are curable and have sufficient amorphous character to yield cured products demonstrating one or more elastomeric properties. For example olefinic rubbers include copolymers of ethylene with one or more alpha olefin comonomers and optionally dienes. In particular embodiments the olefinic rubber is copolymer of ethylene propylene and one or more diene monomers. As known in the art these polymers may be referred to as EPDM. The term EPDM is used in the sense of its definition as found in ASTM D 1418 94 and is intended to mean a terpolymer of ethylene propylene and a diene monomer with the residual unsaturation portion of the diene in the side chain. Illustrative methods for preparing such terpolymers are found in U.S. Pat. No. 3 280 082 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

As described above the olefinic rubber component e.g. EPDM of the scrap rubber composition is sulfur cured. In particular embodiments the cured olefinic rubber component which may also be referred to as the crosslinked or vulcanized rubber component is sulfur cured. In one or more embodiments sulfur cured olefinic rubber includes sulfur containing crosslinks between polymer molecules. In one or more embodiments the sulfur containing crosslinks may form an infinite network or gel within the scrap rubber composition.

In one or more embodiments the cured olefinic rubber component e.g. cured EPDM prior to treatment according to the present invention is cured to a degree where less than 10 wt. in other embodiments less than 5 wt. in other embodiments less than 2 wt. in other embodiments less than 1 wt. and in other embodiments less than 0.1 wt. of the rubber component is soluble in chloroform at 65 C.

The source of the scrap rubber composition may vary. In particular embodiments the scrap rubber composition is obtained from existing membrane products such as EPDM roofing membranes or geomembranes that have been removed from service. For example they may include membranes removed from an existing roof or geomembranes removed from existing water containment sources or the like. In other embodiments the cured EPDM is obtained from manufacturing scrap such as from the manufacturing of EPDM membranes including roofing membranes and geomembranes. In one or more embodiments the scrap rubber composition need not derive from membrane and may be obtained from roofing flashing products walkway pads and the like.

In one or more embodiments the scrap rubber composition is treated within an extruder that is capable of imparting sufficient mechanical energy and or thermal energy on the sulfur cured rubber to effect devulcanization or partial devulcanization of the sulfur cured rubber. In one or more embodiments the extruder is a twin screw extruder. In other embodiments the extruder is a ring extruder. In yet other embodiments the extruder is a planetary roller extruder which may simply be referred to as a planetary extruder or as an extruder. In still other embodiments the extruder is a continuous mixer such as a Farrel Continuous Mixer FCM .

As is known in the art extrusion processes may be generally segmented into different phases as the materials being processed within the extruder are conveyed within the extruder. In one or more embodiments and by way of example the process may include a first phase where the sulfur cured process is heated while undergoing initial mastication. In certain embodiments the sulfur cured composition is ground and generally homogeneous on a macroscale. The first phase may take place within a first barrel or first series of barrels of the extruder.

The second phase generally includes intense heating and or mastication of the sulfur cured rubber to effect most or all of the devulcanization of the rubber. Within the second phase the rubber may undergo back mixing and experience high pressures within the extruder. In one or more embodiments the second phase may take place in one or more barrels of the extruder that are downstream of the first phase barrels.

The third and final phase generally includes cooling and conveying of the processed materials to a location such as a die where the processed materials are finished. In one or more embodiments the third phase may take place in one or more barrels of the extruder that are downstream of the second phase barrels.

An exemplary process for the devulcanization of sulfur cured rubber can be explained with reference to which show a planetary roller extruder which may simply be referred to as planetary extruder . The drawings serve to facilitate explanation of the extruder and its general operation particularly as it relates to the present process but in actual practice the shape and size of extruder might be substantially different from that illustrated and yet still be within the scope of the invention.

Planetary roller extruder includes a feeding section and a compounding section . The scrap rubber composition is added into the feed throat and metered onto the conveying screw of the filling section . The screw conveys the scrap rubber composition into the compounding section . The compounding section includes four planetary roller barrel sections and collectively referenced by the numeral herein which may optionally be separated by rings and collectively referenced by the numeral herein . In certain embodiments each roller barrel section includes a 45 helical toothed cylinder a 45 helical toothed main spindle and a plurality of 45 helical toothed planetary spindles . In some embodiments the helical gearing can have any suitable angle for example an angle of 10 to 60 . In other embodiments an angle of greater than 20 may be useful.

Conventional planetary extruders contain at least 3 and can contain up to 24 planetary spindles depending on the diameter of the cylinder and process design. Of course one of skill in the art would realize that a greater number of planetary spindles could be used depending on the specific dimensions and construction of the extruder. In one embodiment of the invention the planetary roller extruder has from 3 to 24 planetary spindles in other embodiments from 4 to 16 planetary spindles and in yet other embodiments from 4 to 10 planetary spindles . In one or more embodiments each barrel section may be equipped with a different number of planetary spindles to achieve a desired effect within each barrel.

The rotation of the main spindle can cause the planetary spindles to be set in rotational movement as a result of the helical gearing of the main spindle interacting with the helical gearing of the planetary spindles . The planetary spindles may also mesh with the internal gearing of the cylinder section . The helical gearing of the main spindle the planetary spindles and the cylinder section may be employed to convey the scrap rubber composition in the direction of the discharge orifice .

In accordance with certain aspects of the present invention at least one of the roller barrel sections includes a double transversal planetary spindle . The present invention is not limited to the use of double transversal planetary spindles. Other spindle configurations that provide the desired levels of mixing can also be used.

The maximum number of planetary spindles can be a function of the diameter of the main spindle and the helical toothed cylinder . The planetary spindles can exhibit many different tooth geometries e.g. full helical flights double transversal helical flights also known as back cut spindles or zoned helical flights etc. The number of planetary spindles chosen and their geometries e.g. open vs. full flight can be manipulated in such a way as to influence the dynamic discharging effect of each roller barrel section and the discharging differential between sections. Additionally the gap between the ring and the main spindle can be changed to vary the dynamic discharging effect of each barrel section and the discharging differential between the barrel sections .

In one or more embodiments sulfur and sulfur bearing species are removed from the extruder as volatiles. In these or other embodiments water is removed from the extruder in the form of volatiles i.e. steam . In one or more embodiments the volatiles are removed from the extruder through a vent within the extruder. In one or more embodiments a vacuum pump not specifically shown can be used to improve the volatilization and removal of volatiles.

In one or more embodiments one or more vents are located in the second phase of the extruder where the rubber undergoes intense heating and or mastication and most or all of the devulcanization of the rubber is believed to take place. For example and as shown in volatile compounds present within extruder or at least a portion thereof are removed through an outlet which may include a vent section within the extruder located within the second barrel . In combination therewith or in lieu of vent section vent section may be positioned at third barrel . In one or more embodiments a vent optionally with vacuum can also be placed at the forth barrel

In one or more embodiments sulfur and sulfur bearing species are scavenged and or neutralized by the addition of a scavenging agent to the extruder. In addition to or in lieu of the desiccant may be added to the extruder in order to scavenge water and thereby inhibit any degradation reactions wherein sulfur and or sulfur bearing species may react or interact with water to effect degradation of the metal within the extruder. For purposes of this specification the scavenging agent may also be referred to as a neutralizing agent.

In one or more embodiments alkali metal and or alkaline earth metal oxides are added to the extruder. Specific examples of such oxides include but are not limited to calcium oxide and magnesium oxide. In other embodiments alkali metal and or alkaline earth metal carbonates are added to the extruder. Specific examples of such oxides include but are not limited to calcium carbonate calcium magnesium carbonate sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. Other materials that could be added include hydroxides such as calcium and magnesium hydroxides.

In one or more embodiments the amount of the scavenging agent employed i.e. added to the extruder in the practice of the invention may be described with respect to the rubber material to be devulcanized. In one or more embodiments at least 0.5 wt in other embodiments at least 1 wt in other embodiments at least 1.5 wt in other embodiments at least 2 wt and in other embodiments at least 2.5 wt scavenging agent based upon the total weight of the scavenging agent and rubber material to be processed is employed.

In one or more embodiments from about 0.5 to about 20 wt in other embodiments from about 1.0 to about 15 wt and in other embodiments from about 1.5 to about 10 wt scavenging agent based upon the total weight of the scavenging agent and rubber material to be processed is employed.

In one or more embodiments the scavenging agent and or desiccant can be added to the extruder at a down steam location i.e. at a location where devulcanization is believed to primary occur . For example the scavenging agent and or desiccant can be added in the second phase of the extruder where the rubber undergoes intense heating and or mastication and most or all of the devulcanization of the rubber is believed to take place. In other embodiments the scavenging agent is added together with the rubber material to be processed i.e. at the feed throat of the extruder .

In one or more embodiments the scavenging agent and or desiccant is added directly to the extruder or it may be added to the extruder in combination with a carrier. The use of a carrier can advantageously facilitate the handling and introduction of the scavenging agent and or desiccant into the extruder. For example the carrier can facilitate dispersion and mixing of the scavenging agent and or desiccant once introduced to the extruder. In one or more embodiments the carrier may include an oil such as an aliphatic oil. In other embodiments the carrier can include a polymer such as a low molecular weight i.e. high melt flow polyolefin or unvulcanized or low Mooney rubber e.g. EPR . The scavenging agent and or desiccant can be dispersed in the carrier and then fed to the extruder. For example the scavenging agent and or desiccant can be combined with the carrier within a side feeder or single screw extruder and then fed into one of the down stream barrels e.g. barrel 2 or 3 of the extruder.

In one or more embodiments the oil includes a processing oil of the type that is commonly used in the rubber industry. Examples of processing oils include paraffinic oils aromatic oils naphthenic oils vegetable oils other than castor oils and low PCA oils including MES TDAE SRAE heavy naphthenic oils and black oils. A particular processing oil is Sunpar 2280 from Sunoco Inc.

The skilled person will be able to practice the present invention and select appropriate temperature and residence time within the extruder to effect devulcanization of the sulfur cured rubber.

The rubber sheet material as described herein can be used to cover a roof. As the sheet is unrolled over the roof substructure in an otherwise conventional fashion the seams of adjacent sheet layers are overlapped. The width of the seam can vary depending on the requirements specified by the architect building contractor or roofing contractor and thus do not constitute a limitation of the present invention.

The overlapping edges of the roofing membranes can be cleaned with soap and water or the appropriate solvent to remove any grease oil or other contaminants that could interfere with providing adequate adhesion and or may be solvent cleaned as desired to enhance bond formation and increase seam adhesion peel strength. Typical solvents used for cleaning the overlapped edges of the roofing membrane include hexane heptane or toluene however solvent cleaning is generally not required. Where a bonding adhesive is used one example suitable for use with this invention is BA 2004 a neoprene based adhesive commercially available from Firestone Building Products Company and where a lap splice seam adhesive is used one example suitable for use with this invention is Firestone s SA 1065 a commercially available butyl based lap splice adhesive. Application of the adhesive can be facilitated by spray brush swab or other means known in the art.
