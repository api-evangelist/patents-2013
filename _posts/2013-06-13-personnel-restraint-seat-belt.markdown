This patent application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 659 214 titled Lighted Egress Apparatus ARL 09 38P filed on Jun. 13 2012 the entire contents which are hereby incorporated by reference herein including all attachments and other documents that were incorporated by reference in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 659 214. This patent application is related to U.S. Non Provisional patent application No. 13 916 745 ARL 09 38 also titled Lighted Egress Apparatus and filed on Jun. 13 2013 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The present invention relates generally to personnel restraint seat belts and more particularly to such a seat belt which enables rapid identification of the belt during emergency situations.

Essentially all military and non military vehicles include personnel safety restraint seat belts for securing the personnel to the vehicle during the operation of the vehicle. During normal operation of the vehicle the release of the seat belts can be easily accomplished by the military personnel.

Military and non military vehicles as well as the personnel within those vehicles however are oftentimes subjected to emergency situations. For example an improvised explosive device IED bomb blast rollover explosion accident gas leak and so forth may not only damage or even render inoperable the vehicle but may also temporarily incapacitate the occupants of the vehicle. When such an event occurs the occupants are subjected to violent physical effects which can severely alter their cognitive reasoning capabilities this coupled with chaotic life threatening situations stress and confusion makes it even more difficult for soldiers to perform emergency egress and survival procedures. This invention helps to reduce this problem by making the restraint belts easier to locate see identify and grasp for expedient cutting and hence the saving of lives under these intense and chaotic emergency egress conditions.

Furthermore during such an event the vehicle safety belts may become locked and intermingled or entwined with other straps either present within the vehicle or used to secure or otherwise carry gear and other equipment in the vehicle. When this happens it may be difficult to identify the seat belt. In addition to the restraint belts being intermingled or entwined with other straps there is also a danger that the shoulder belts will be caught in a Gear Valley on the soldier. Soldiers wear great amounts of gear and equipment known as Body Borne Equipment BBE on their chests ammo pouches Improved First Aid Kit IFAK flashlights radios grenade pouches etc. . Such BBE can entrap hide and obscure the shoulder belts for example if a safety belt becomes wedged in between two ammo pouches the safety belt will be difficult to see or locate. The gap between two pieces of equipment such as two ammo pouches is referred to as a Gear Valley . In addition to other belts and straps intermingling with the restraint belts present in the vehicle the restraint belts may become difficult to see locate and identify even on the soldier s chest because of the Gear Valley effect and comingling with the multitude of chest mounted gear. In addition to the problem of the Gear Valley soldiers also at times will wear gas masks. When wearing a gas mask a soldier s close in vision is degraded especially around his own chest and body so the addition of tactile and visual indicators to the belts is a huge advantage for them especially when helping others who may not be able to see their own belts.

In these situations it is oftentimes necessary for the vehicle personnel to release themselves from the vehicle seat belts and escape from the vehicle. For example if the vehicle is in water or on fire serious injury or death can result unless the vehicle occupants quickly escape from the vehicle.

However in such emergency situations a rapid escape from the vehicle by unlatching the seat belt may not be practical or possible if the release buckle is jammed or inoperable. For example if the vehicle occupant is blinded by smoke debris eye damage total darkness or the like he or she may not be able to quickly identify the restraint seat belt to cut the seat belt apart with a knife. This is particularly true where the restraint seat belt is intertwined with other belts present within the vehicle or in a Gear Valley which results in excessive search and fumble time in order to find the proper seat belt to cut and free the personnel from the vehicle.

The proper identification of the seat belt by the vehicle occupants during an emergency situation is particularly serious for vehicle occupants that have been injured or rendered unconscious so that it is impossible for the occupants to extricate themselves from the vehicle. In these situations rescuers must be able to rapidly enter the vehicle and identify and cut the personnel restraint seat belts in order to free the occupants. As such these rescuers face the same difficulties in the proper identification of the restraint seat belt during the rescue operation.

The present invention provides a personnel restraint seat belt which overcomes many of the above mentioned disadvantages of the previously known seat belts.

In brief the restraint seat belt of the present invention comprises an elongated flexible web having a front surface a rear surface and two spaced apart side edges. The seat belt itself is typically constructed from a woven fabric although other materials may be used without deviation from the spirit or scope of the invention.

A distinguishing feature is provided adjacent at least one and preferably both of the side edges of the web. This distinguishing feature provides a rapid identification of the personnel restraint seat belt since the distinguishing feature is used only on personnel restraint seat belts and no other types of belt gear or equipment.

One or more different types of distinguishing features may be utilized in accordance with the present invention. For example the distinguishing feature can comprise a plurality of bumps which protrude outwardly from either the front or rear surface or both adjacent one or both side edges of the web. Since these bumps protrude outwardly from the web the bumps provide a tactile feedback so that the seat belt can be immediately identified and cut to free the personnel from the vehicle. This tactile feature will also work with soldiers occupants who are wearing gloves as typically soldiers wear combat protective gloves. These tactile distinguishing features can also be either illuminated luminous or reflective and or be a combination of any of these features.

Alternatively the distinguishing feature comprises a side edge having a cross sectional shape and area which differs from the cross sectional shape and area of the central portion of the seat belt web. Thus the side edges of the seat belt web provide a tactile feedback which facilitates rapid identification of the seat belt so that it may be cut and free the vehicle occupant.

In a still further modification the distinguishing feature includes one or more color strips adjacent the side edges of the web. These color strips may be either illuminated i.e. powered or simply highly reflective or luminescent. In any event the seat belt web may be easily and rapidly identified by the light reflected from the seat belt web or alternatively light emitted from the seat belt web. The illumination feature can be automatically activated by sensors which activate the system when an accident rollover or crash occurs.

In a still further modification the side edges of the seat belt web include a plurality of cut outs. These cut outs again provide tactile feedback to the vehicle occupants or a rescuer to facilitate the rapid identification of the seat belt web. This rapid identification of the seat belt web enables the seat belt web to be quickly cut and the vehicle personnel quickly freed.

In a still further modification of the invention the front side of the web has a color that differs from the rear side of the web. For example the front side of the web i.e. the forwardly exposed side may be a dull green or brown color for its camouflage effect while the rear side of the seat belt web is a brightly colored non camouflage color such as orange. Consequently in the event that the seat belt is attached improperly or twisted at least a portion of the rear side of the seat belt will become visible and provide a clear and instantly recognizable indication that the seat belt is improperly connected. Restraint belt effectiveness can be severely diminished if the belt has even one twist in it the fibers and webbing strands are designed to resist linear forces and when the belt is positioned in a non linear configuration i.e. twist the ability of the strands to react to forces it is not designed for can severely degrade its effectiveness. The improper connection of the seat belt of course may otherwise result in injury to the personnel.

With reference first to a military vehicle is illustrated diagrammatically with personnel e.g. a soldier seated within the vehicle . The soldier is held to the vehicle by a personnel restraint seat belt . In the conventional fashion the seat belt includes elongated webs which extend around the soldier and are releasably locked to the vehicle by release buckle .

With reference now to a portion of the seat belt web is shown and includes a front surface which faces forwardly of the soldier a rear side which faces the soldier and two side edges . The web itself is flat and flexible and may be constructed of any suitable material such as woven fabric a synthetic material or the like.

Still referring to in order to differentiate the web for the restraint seat belts from other types of belts that may be present within the vehicle a distinguishing feature which is used only in connection with personnel restraint seat belts is provided adjacent at least one and preferably both of the web side edges .

For example as shown in the distinguishing feature includes a reflective or luminous strip . The reflective or luminous strip may be either continuous along the side edges of the web or may be present in spaced apart strips. In any event the reflective or luminous strips enable the seat belt web to be rapidly differentiated from other belts that may be present within the vehicle so that the web may be released or cut and the soldier rapidly freed from the vehicle . If the vehicle is upside down and the war fighter is then hanging upside down as well it may be beneficial for the soldier to cut individual belts as opposed to releasing them all at once with the release buckle . This may reduce or eliminate further body damage to oneself or a soldier located beneath the suspended soldier by allowing a safer and more controlled descent rather than dropping instantaneously after releasing all the belts simultaneously. This controlled extrication capability may be very beneficial for rescue crews especially for incapacitated soldiers who may be injured a controlled extrication may prevent further bodily injury rather than dropping the injured soldier all at once.

Alternatively the strips may be replaced by an electrically powered device such as a fiber optic illuminated at one end or an electroluminescent EL panel or any other electrically powered device. Flexible thin film conductors will permit circuitry to be embedded into or onto the restraint belts to power any such illumination device as needed. In these situations the use of the powered electric device completely eliminates the need to use external light to identify the seat belt web .

With reference now to a modification to the present invention is shown in which the distinguishing feature comprises a plurality of spaced bumps adjacent to one or both of the side edges of the web . As best shown in these bumps protrude outwardly from either the front surface of the web rear surface of the web or both.

With reference now to the bumps may take any of several different forms. For example in the bumps are shown as being semispherical in shape. Alternatively as shown in the bumps may be polyhedral in shape. Regardless of the shape of the bumps the bumps protrude outwardly from one or both surfaces of the web . In one embodiment the bumps are formed from tritium dots or another luminous material or paint that can be used to provide markings that are visible under specific lighting. If the tritium dots or luminescent dots are applied to a belt in sufficient thickness the dots will also provide tactile feedback. Thus tritium dots or other luminescent material can be used to provide visual indicators or indicator that are both visual and tactile. In yet another embodiment bumps edge configuration or other distinguishing feature comprise a material that is visible under a specific wavelength of light. The wavelength can be provided on a cutting tool. Thus the bumps edge configuration or other distinguishing feature will only be visible when illuminated with the tool to provide a belt with indicators that are less visible for example during stealthy operations.

In operation the bumps provide a tactile feedback which enables the user or a rescuer to rapidly identify the seat belt web so that it may be cut and the vehicle occupant freed from the vehicle. Additionally the bumps are preferably aligned on the web so that they do not register with each other when the web is coiled in order to minimize the thickness of the coil.

With reference now to alternatively the distinguishing feature comprises an edge configuration having a cross sectional area different than the cross sectional area of a central portion of the web . For example as shown in one such edge configuration would be a generally triangular strip which extends either continuously or at spaced intervals adjacent the side edges of the web . As shown in the cross sectional area of the edge configurations generally have a larger cross sectional area than the central portion of the web for the same lateral width as the edge configuration.

Although the edge configuration illustrated in is shown as protruding outwardly from only the front surface of the web it may protrude outwardly from both the front surface and rear surface of the web as shown in . Similarly other shapes such as a spherical shape as shown in or a rectangular or dumbbell shape as shown in may alternatively be used.

Regardless of the actual shape of the edge configuration the edge configuration provides tactile feedback to an occupant of a vehicle during an emergency situation and or to a rescuer so that the seat belt web may be easily and rapidly identified. Once identified the seat belt web may be released or cut and the vehicle occupant freed.

With reference now to the distinguishing feature may alternatively comprise a plurality of spaced cut outs or attached protuberances along one or both sides of the seat belt web . These cut outs either alone or in combination with three dimensional bumps along one or both side edges of the web may be used to provide a tactile feedback of the web . These bumps may be of any convenient shape such as rectangular bumps as shown in or spherical bumps as shown in .

It is not necessary that the cut outs be combined with three dimensional bumps as shown in . Rather the cut outs may be flush with the front and rear surfaces and of the seat belt web as shown in . Furthermore the shape of the cut outs may be any convenient shape such as triangular as shown in or loop shaped as shown in .

As shown in the belt web may also include one or more ultraviolet infrared or otherwise non visible targets which reflect when illuminated by ultraviolet infrared or otherwise non visible illumination.

With reference now to a still further improvement of the present invention is shown in which the front side of the web has one color or color scheme. For example dull greens and dull browns may be used on the front side of the web in order to provide for additional camouflage for the soldier.

However the opposite side of the web is colored a completely different and contrasting color such as bright orange. Consequently in the event that the seat belt is twisted as shown in the twist in the seat belt will expose the contrasting color on the rear side of the seat belt web so that it may be easily detected and corrected by the soldier.

From the foregoing it can be seen that the present invention provides significant improvements in seat belt technology which are particularly suitable for military uses. However no undue limitations should be drawn therefrom and instead the present invention may be used on non military as well as military applications.

Having described the invention it can be seen that the present invention provides several important advances in seat belt technology. Having described the invention however many modifications thereto will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which it pertains without deviation from the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims.
