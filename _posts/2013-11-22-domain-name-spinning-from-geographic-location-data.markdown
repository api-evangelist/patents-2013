This continuation application claims the benefit of and is related to the following patent and patent applications 

U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 092 230 METHODS FOR SUGGESTING DOMAIN NAMES FROM A GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION DATA. 

The subject matter of all patent applications is commonly owned and assigned to Go Daddy Operating Company LLC. All prior applications are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.

The present inventions generally relate to the field of domain name suggestion and registration and specifically to the field of suggesting and registering domain names based on a geographic location within online mapping software selected by the user or detected by a geo location software on a mobile device.

The present inventions provide methods and systems for displaying suggesting and registering available domain names on a client computer based on selected geographical locations from online mapping service software. An exemplary method may comprise several steps including the step of displaying any combination of online mapping service software and domain name suggestion registration software on a client computer. The online mapping service software may be configured to zoom anywhere from a world view to an individual residence view including any levels in between to view any geographical locations including but not limited to continents countries regions states counties areas cities or neighborhoods. The domain name suggestion registration software may be an overlay on or otherwise synchronized and or coordinated with the online mapping service software thereby allowing the user to click on or otherwise select the geographical area and locations displayed. The combination of software may then use the selected geographical area and or locations to select a plurality of available domain names from data storage related to the geographical area and or locations. These available domain names may be in a primary market and or a domain name aftermarket and may be parsed for keywords related to the geographical areas and or locations. These keywords along with one or more Top Level Domains TLD may be displayed on the client computer either as combined or separate user interface controls possibly at coordinates on a map appropriate to the displayed geographical area. The selections of the user may be used to display to the user in a preferred order suggested available domain names and receive the selection of domain names from the user. In some embodiments another user interface control may also receive additional keywords from a user to spin the domain name suggestions possibly predefined keywords specific to an industry. These domain name spinning suggestions from the user may be combined with the keywords parsed from the available domain names related to the geographical areas and or locations and or one or more a TLDs selected by the user to suggest and display available domain names which may then be selected by the user.

The present inventions also provide methods and systems for an automated calculation and display of one or more suggested domain names using a geo location software feature on a mobile client computer device such as a PDA or smart phone. Any combination of online mapping service software and domain name suggestion registration software may determine receive tag and display the location of the user and or client computer based on the GPS or other geo location signal picked up from the mobile client computer device. A plurality of available domain names may be parsed and displayed according to the steps outlined above. Using the determined location and the keywords from parsed available domain names a series of suggested domain names may appear through domain name registration software which may be used in coordination or as an overlay to the online mapping software. Developers contractors builders real estate agents domain name speculators or any combination may use the software applications within these systems and methods in response to developing areas that show promising value. They may use these inventions to secure the domain names related to the areas or real estate to develop and create custom splash pages for homes or businesses based on the street address or business name respectively determined by the GPS signal and or domain name suggestion registration software. The suggested domain names may be as specific as the business or address found by the geo location software and or as general as the state or other general area determined by the geo location software.

The above features and advantages of the present inventions will be better understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The present inventions will now be discussed in detail with regard to the attached drawing figures that were briefly described above. In the following description numerous specific details are set forth illustrating the Applicant s best mode for practicing the invention and enabling one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention. It will be obvious however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without many of these specific details. In other instances well known machines structures and method steps have not been described in particular detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention. Unless otherwise indicated like parts and method steps are referred to with like reference numerals.

A network is a collection of links and nodes e.g. multiple computers and or other devices connected together arranged so that information may be passed from one part of the network to another over multiple links and through various nodes. Examples of networks include the Internet the public switched telephone network the global Telex network computer networks e.g. an intranet an extranet a local area network or a wide area network wired networks and wireless networks.

The Internet is a worldwide network of computers and computer networks arranged to allow the easy and robust exchange of information between computer users. Hundreds of millions of people around the world have access to computers connected to the Internet via Internet Service Providers ISPs . Content providers place multimedia information e.g. text graphics audio video animation and other forms of data at specific locations on the Internet referred to as websites. The combination of all the websites and their corresponding web pages on the Internet is generally known as the World Wide Web WWW or simply the Web.

For Internet users and businesses alike the Internet continues to be increasingly valuable. More people use the Web for everyday tasks from social networking shopping banking and paying bills to consuming media and entertainment. E commerce is growing with businesses delivering more services and content across the Internet communicating and collaborating online and inventing new ways to connect with each other.

Prevalent on the Web are multimedia websites some of which may offer and sell goods and services to individuals and organizations. Websites may consist of a single webpage but typically consist of multiple interconnected and related web pages. Websites unless extremely large and complex or have unusual traffic demands typically reside on a single server and are prepared and maintained by a single individual or entity. Menus and links may be used to move between different web pages within the website or to move to a different website as is known in the art. The interconnectivity of web pages enabled by the Internet can make it difficult for Internet users to tell where one website ends and another begins.

Websites may be created using HyperText Markup Language HTML to generate a standard set of tags that define how the web pages for the website are to be displayed. Users of the Internet may access content providers websites using software known as an Internet browser such as MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER or MOZILLA FIREFOX. After the browser has located the desired webpage it requests and receives information from the webpage typically in the form of an HTML document and then displays the webpage content for the user. The user then may view other web pages at the same website or move to an entirely different website using the browser.

Some Internet users typically those that are larger and more sophisticated may provide their own hardware software and connections to the Internet. But many Internet users either do not have the resources available or do not want to create and maintain the infrastructure necessary to host their own websites. To assist such individuals or entities hosting companies exist that offer website hosting services. These hosting providers typically provide the hardware software and electronic communication means necessary to connect multiple websites to the Internet. A single hosting provider may literally host thousands of websites on one or more hosting servers.

Browsers are able to locate specific websites because each website resource and computer on the Internet has a unique Internet Protocol IP address. Presently there are two standards for IP addresses. The older IP address standard often called IP Version 4 IPv4 is a 32 bit binary number which is typically shown in dotted decimal notation where four 8 bit bytes are separated by a dot from each other e.g. 64.202.167.32 . The notation is used to improve human readability. The newer IP address standard often called IP Version 6 IPv6 or Next Generation Internet Protocol IPng is a 128 bit binary number. The standard human readable notation for IPv6 addresses presents the address as eight 16 bit hexadecimal words each separated by a colon e.g. 2EDC BA98 0332 0000 CF8A 000C 2154 7313 .

IP addresses however even in human readable notation are difficult for people to remember and use. A Uniform Resource Locator URL is much easier to remember and may be used to point to any computer directory or file on the Internet. A browser is able to access a website on the Internet through the use of a URL. The URL may include a Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP request combined with the website s Internet address also known as the website s domain name. An example of a URL with a HTTP request and domain name is http www.companyname.com. In this example the http identifies the URL as a HTTP request and the companyname.com is the domain name.

Domain names are much easier to remember and use than their corresponding IP addresses. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN approves some Generic Top Level Domains gTLD and delegates the responsibility to a particular organization a registry for maintaining an authoritative source for the registered domain names within a Top Level Domain TLD and their corresponding IP addresses. For certain TLDs e.g. .biz .info .name and .org the registry is also the authoritative source for contact information related to the domain name and is referred to as a thick registry. For other TLDs e.g. .com and .net only the domain name registrar identification and name server information is stored within the registry and a registrar is the authoritative source for the contact information related to the domain name. Such registries are referred to as thin registries. Most gTLDs are organized through a central domain name Shared Registration System SRS based on their TLD.

The process for registering a domain name with .com .net .org and some other TLDs allows an Internet user to use an ICANN accredited registrar to register their domain name. For example if an Internet user John Doe wishes to register the domain name mycompany.com John Doe may initially determine whether the desired domain name is available by contacting a domain name registrar. The Internet user may make this contact using the registrar s webpage and typing the desired domain name into a field on the registrar s webpage created for this purpose. Upon receiving the request from the Internet user the registrar may ascertain whether mycompany.com has already been registered by checking the SRS database associated with the TLD of the domain name. The results of the search then may be displayed on the webpage to thereby notify the Internet user of the availability of the domain name. If the domain name is available the Internet user may proceed with the registration process. If the domain name is not available for registration the Internet user may keep selecting alternative domain names until an available domain name is found.

Software for an online mapping service can have both practical and entertainment applications. A user may view almost any location in the world using the satellite images or provided graphical maps within the software for popular online mapping services. This technology may be used to view many cities and famous landmarks as well as navigating between one location and another. The online mapping software may be used to view every level of Earth from the planet itself down to a birds eye view of the home in which the user lives and every level of geographical location in between either by finding a specific geographic location selected or entered by the user or by zooming into the appropriate level of geographical locations selected by the user.

Although online mapping services may be accessed via a desktop computer mobile devices including but not limited to laptop computers smart phones personal digital assistants etc. have become ubiquitous in recent years. The networking speeds for these mobile devices are increasing and there is more accessibility to mobile devices and wireless access points.

People tend to always have their laptop phone PDA etc. where as they don t always have their desktop computer. This presents unique ways to generate revenue using mobile devices where retailers and other businesses such as domain name registrars can capitalize on spontaneous purchases for some customers and provide more options for others.

Whether on a mobile device or a desktop computer people are using online software to locate themselves nearby businesses and residential addresses. By entering or zooming into a country state region county city area neighborhood street address or any other geographical location the user can get a bird s eye view of almost anywhere on earth.

GPS tagging is also becoming more popular because people are interested in geo tagging and geo tagging applications. Mobile application development has grown in recent years and the download rate for these applications including GPS related applications have a large download rate. In addition to driving directions people are interested in geo tagging their current location which can be accurate to within 15 feet of the user. These technologies also create unique ways to generate revenue using mobile devices which can capitalize on spontaneous purchases for some customers and provide more options for others.

Regarding the inventions disclosed herein any combination of online mapping software in a data center operated by an online mapping service or other hosting provider may be used in combination with any combination of domain name suggestion and or domain name registration software in a data center operated by a domain name registrar or other hosting provider. The software modules described herein may be run separately but may share common information or interfaces possibly via an API. In other embodiments the software modules may be two or more separate software module packages used in conjunction possibly by overlaying one on top of the other such as an overlay of the user interface controls for the domain name suggestion registration software on the online mapping software. In still other embodiments the online mapping software and domain name suggestion registration software may be integrated software modules presented to the user in a unified and seamless way.

As a non limiting example of such software modules an online mapping software may be configured to receive input from the user which may trigger the online domain name suggestion and or registration software described herein. An available domain name keyword parsing module may be used to parse available domain names for keywords related to geographical areas locations selected by the user on the client computer and extract keywords from the available domain names to retrieve and compare information stored in data storage for purposes of primary and or aftermarket domain name availability. Several related software modules working together disclosed herein may likewise be used to suggest domain names based on the geographical locations etc.

The selection of these geographical locations and geographical areas may be determined according to input received from the user of the client machine Step . As a non limiting example the online mapping software may include a user input control which allows the user to zoom the displayed online map to various levels which in turn display various geographical areas containing multiple geographical locations such as cities within a state in . In other embodiments the user may input a specific geographical location such as a specific city that the user wants to view. The online mapping software may then determine the appropriate level to zoom the mapping software in order to display the selected geographical area and or geographical location and other geographical locations at the same level.

In some non limiting example embodiments the online mapping software may be configured to receive input from the user in the form of a user clicking on one or more specific geographic locations to trigger the online domain name suggestion and or registration software described herein. The domain name suggestion registration component of this software combination in this example may detect the one or more selected geographical locations within the geographical areas cities within the state of Colorado in .

In this non limiting example online mapping software may be displayed on a client computer and any combination of software and or user interface controls described herein may be configured to receive a command to zoom the online mapping software display to the major cities within the state of Colorado the displayed geographical locations and the geographical area in this example respectively. The mapping software may also display additional details such as the major freeways in this example but these details will not be discussed here in the interest of simplicity of the example.

In other embodiments not shown in the user may select one or more specific cities within Colorado Denver Boulder Colo. Springs Fort Collins etc. and input these selections into other user interface controls such as a text box check box or drop down box etc. in order to view the selected cities on the online mapping software. In still other embodiments the disclosed software modules may make a determination of the best level of the online mapping software to display to the user based on the cities selected by the user. These specific city selections may also be input as a means to request suggestions for available domain names related to that city. The disclosed software modules may then determine using the keywords from parsed available domain names what suggested available domain names to be displayed. In some embodiments the user would need to know the name of the city to determine exact matches available for domain names for that city such as the example embodiment seen in .

After receiving a selection of one or more major cities in the state of Colorado from the user any combination of the disclosed software may analyze a group of available domain names in a primary market or domain name aftermarket. These available domain names may be selected from a database or any other data storage related to the domain name markets or aftermarkets and may be parsed for keywords related to the selected cities in Colorado or any other geographical divisions within the selected geographical area Step Step . This parsing for keywords may be accomplished by software modules on the server computer s . In the interest of simplicity in this non limiting example it will be assumed that the domain names for major cities such as Denver.com Boulder.com Colorado Springs.com etc. are not available domain names so a lesser known city Berthoud will be used in the following examples.

In this non limiting example the software modules for the domain name suggestion registration software may be run on all exact matches for city names in the selected area. Alternatively in this example the city of Berthoud may have been selected or the domain name suggestion registration software may have determined that a search for the city of Boulder does not yield any suggested domain names as they are not available but that the nearby city of Berthoud has several domain names available including domain names with top level domains .com .net .gov .edu and .us. In other embodiments described herein variations on the names of the cities selected or surrounding cities in the greater city area may also be used to suggest register domain names. The domain names suggested may be derived by parsing the domain name into keywords as well as all subsequent steps described herein for parsing domain names and comparing the keywords to the names of the geographical divisions to return a result set Steps .

The keywords related to the cities selected and parsed from the available domain names may be associated to map coordinates possibly pulled from a database or any other data storage associated with the online mapping service software. These coordinates may be used by the domain name suggestion registration software to display user interface inputs containing the keywords associated with the available domain names on the user interface of the client machine at the coordinates determined by the online mapping service software next to Berthoud Colo. in the example embodiment seen in .

These suggested available domain names may be displayed according to the geographical locations selected by the user where the geographical division is appropriate to the domain names that are available and displayed using any combination of software and hardware on the client computer Step . In the example embodiments shown in a combination of suggested keywords and TLDs may be presented to the user on the map next to the city of Berthoud in a single user interface input. In other embodiments such as those seen in and the keywords and TLDs presented to the user may be displayed in separate user interface controls. The maps within the online mapping software may display the geographical locations appropriate to the available domain names.

For example the dropdown box may be integrated into the map software from one or more software modules in the Map GPS data center using one or more software modules on the server in the registrar data center . These software modules working together may display an interface element such as a dropdown box next to a city with available domain names such as Berthoud in the example embodiment in .

The example embodiment shown in has been simplified to only display available domain names with exact matches to the city of Berthoud. In this simplified and non limiting example embodiment the city of Berthoud has the actual name of the city available with several top level domain names. In other embodiments related to domain name spinning described herein combinations of the city name with related keywords parsed from available domain names may be displayed as well including for example BerthoudTourism.com BerthodCityCouncil.com BerthoudSchoolDistrict.edu etc.

This embodiment also shows a dropdown box for only one city. However other embodiments may include user interface controls for all cities on the map or any city which may be configured to be selected in the geographical area by the user. These user interface controls may include links check boxes buttons etc. for the user to click on for each of the cities displayed on the map. In other embodiments each of the cities displayed at that level of geographical area on the map may have its own dropdown box containing the available domain names for that city. These cities may be compared to the keywords parsed from available domain names related to the cities selected using any combination of the steps described related to an herein.

Once the user has selected the keywords TLDs and or available domains related to the keyword geographic area and available domains the user may select a user interface control to register the domain. In the embodiment shown in the user may select a link to register the domain. The domain name suggestion registration software may include a registration web page on a registrar website auto filled by information passed through HTML fields query string etc. from an interface such as that shown in . After selecting the user interface control to register the domain name the user may be taken to a registrar domain name registration web page where the selected domain name may be registered. In other embodiments other interface elements such as a button may be used to take the registrant to the registration webpage.

The information taken from the form elements on the interface shown in may be used to pass the selected information from the displayed page to the registrar web page. This may be accomplished by passing the information by hidden form fields query strings etc. used to open the domain name registration web page which may then be populated with the information selected by the user thereby streamlining the process of registering the desired domain name.

In the non limiting example embodiment shown in the user may have selected a city meant to be the focus of the suggested domain names in this case Grand Junction. In other embodiments alternative user interface controls may be used to select the city that is the focus of the domain name suggestion. For example the user may have entered into a text box check box drop down box etc. a selection of Grand Junction Colo. In other embodiments suggestions may be made for all smaller towns surrounding Grand Junction.

In the interest of simplicity only the user interface controls related to Grand Junction are shown in the non limiting example embodiment shown in . Input from the one or more software modules and one or more user interface controls possibly combining software modules from the online mapping software and the domain name suggestion registration software may cause an interface for domain name spinning to appear to allow the user to enter one or more keywords in this example Insurance associated with the insurance industry to be combined with the city selected in this case Grand Junction. Instructions may also be displayed to the user when the geographical location is selected by the user as seen in such as clicking on the city selected. In other embodiments a user may click on multiple cities which may in turn cause multiple interfaces to be displayed for each city within that state or any other geographical location within any geographical area etc.

The non limiting example embodiment shown in shows that after entering the keywords the user wants added to create variations for domain name suggestions for that city the user may be provided one or more user interface elements to select a TLD that the user wants appended to the city name and selected keyword. In other embodiments only the keyword and not the TLD may be required for the software modules to determine available domain names.

The combination of software modules may compare and analyze the selected keyword and the selected city analogous to the steps of parsing and displaying geographical area domain name related keywords Step described herein relating to . These software modules may determine available domain names and their related keywords. In some embodiments the software modules may automatically determine available domain names and TLDs available using the geographical locations chosen and the keywords input by the user. In other embodiments the software may select and display available TLDs as a separate control as seen in . The selections of suggested available domain names may be displayed to the user and the selection may be received by the one or more software modules Step as described herein but may also include variations on the keywords entered by the user displaying the closest combination and selection of TLD s first. In other embodiments a list may be created which automatically combines the closest combination of keyword with city name with the most popular TLD available for the combinations.

As seen in if desired combinations of the keyword with the city and selected TLD are not available other domain suggestion techniques as known in the art may be used to offer other possibilities such as including hyphens in the combination as shown. Other variations may include underlines combining the city and keyword with other words such as online etc. This may be applied to all domain suggestion algorithms described herein. In other embodiments all possible combinations of the keywords related to available domain names and available TLDs may be selected and sent to the client computer where one or more client side software modules may analyze the selections of the user and immediately display the best options for suggested available domain names.

In this example embodiment the user may have zoomed in to look at a shopping center at the crossroads of Spine Road and Lookout road where information from a database in data storage from either data center may contain information about this shopping center and may list any relevant information about the businesses within the shopping center. Additional information such as demand for the retail space sales records for the businesses MLS listings etc. may also be determined and stored to determine the desirability of the real estate space and the domain names related to this real estate.

In five businesses occupy the shopping center King Soopers Blackjack Pizza Dairy Queen Gunbarrel Deli and Gunbarrel Preschool. These businesses and the surrounding area may be displayed using the online mapping software or any combination of online mapping software and domain name suggestion registration software described herein Step . These businesses may be listed in a dropdown box as shown in the non limiting example in or within any other user interface control.

The user may then select one of several TLD s shown from a second dropdown list. As with other embodiments disclosed herein the software modules may be configured to display the area businesses and TLDs automatically or may display the businesses and TLDs when the user clicks on either the shopping center to view all businesses in the shopping center or on each business individually if available and desired.

Any steps previously described analogous to and or described in may be employed to suggest available domain names related to those businesses the shopping centers and the areas in which they are located. These steps may include embodiments where the TLD is separately displayed or may make suggestions according to available combinations of spinning keywords the businesses shopping centers and TLDs.

Several options may be available once the user selects the area business and TLD. In some embodiments the business and TLD may be combined together by the software modules where the business already includes the name of the area of the city such as Gunbarrel Deli and Gunbarrel Preschool. In other embodiments the software may be configured to automatically combine the name of the area with the selected business and the TLD as would be seen in embodiments including GunbarrelKingSoopers.com GunbarrelBlackjackPizza.com and GunbarrelDairyQueen.com. In still other embodiments the user may wish to select the area to combine with the business and TLD. In still other embodiments the software may determine automatically based on the area selected by the user what area name to combine with the business and TLD or may detect that businesses with the area name already included do not need to have the area appended to the name of the business such as Gunbarrel Deli and Gunbarrel Preschool.

Once the geo location feature information has been used to parse available domain names for keywords related to the geographical location Step a series of suggested domain names related to the domain name keywords may be displayed on a client computer possibly a mobile device thereby suggesting domain names based on the keywords parsed and or extrapolated from the region city place current developments residential location etc. determined by the geo location feature using the cell phone or other mobile device and the GPS integrated into the mobile device. In embodiments analogous to the domain name may be an exact match and may be combined with a TLD. In other embodiments the domain name keywords may be combined with variations of the keywords and may be selected separately from the TLD as seen in .

The geo location software may be any software hardware combination that provides reliable location and time information in various weather and at various times on or near the Earth using a receiver which calculates the user s position by precisely timing the signals sent. As a non limiting example a GPS system may be used as the geo location software. The GPS may use a global navigation satellite system GNSS to provide location and time information where there is an unobstructed line of site for 4 GPS satellites. The GPS receiver on the client computer mobile device may calculate its position by timing the signals sent by the satellites. Each satellite may continually transmit a message that includes the time the message was transmitted. The receiver may then use the message it receives to determine the transit time of each message and compute the distance to each satellite. These distances along with the satellites locations may be used with the possible aid of trilateration depending on which algorithm is used to compute the position of the receiver. This position may then be displayed perhaps with a moving map display or latitude and longitude elevation information may be included. Many GPS units show derived information such as direction and speed calculated from position changes.

The suggested domain names may be relevant to the area being viewed on the map including relevant shopping centers or residential areas in up and coming areas. In this non limiting example the user may be located using the geo domain feature on a mobile device from a world level of the geo location feature to the United States country level and on to the state level displaying the state of Colorado to the city level in Boulder Colo. to a specific area within Boulder known as the Gunbarrel area.

As a non limiting example the star in may show the location for a manager for a local King Soopers supermarket based on the signal received from the geo location feature such as a GPS possibly located on the manager s client computer possibly a smart phone. In this example the manager may want to create a website for the local store showing specials what products are available directions to the store etc. To accomplish this the manager may start the software for the present invention including opening a synchronized software application that uses information from both the registrar data center and or information from either or both of the mapping software data center or information taken from GPS software and possibly stored in such a data center.

As seen in previously shown and described embodiments the information for available domain names may have been parsed for keywords related to possible information and the relevant geographical divisions may have been associated to map coordinates and marked on the map Step Step possibly from the map showing the GPS information determined by the geo location feature on the smart phone Step .

The location for the user may be shown on the displayable map that shows the location of the user possibly as determined by the GPS software. shows the location of the manager user by showing a star in the King Soopers store. The software using both the GPS mapping software and the registrar software may then display suggested domain names based on the location of the user manager Steps . This software may be used together possibly as integrated separate software overlays or may be integrated into a single software.

In some embodiments there may be additional software modules specific to the type of organization or franchise trying to access the software to register certain domain names. In these embodiments King Soopers would only want managers or others within the organization to be able to access the software to register the domain names. To accomplish this the software may require the managers to have a unique password or corporate password that would allow them to access the software thereby avoiding situations where others could register domain names in order to sell them to the organizations franchises.

In other embodiments contractors developers domain speculators may recognize trends using the data and possible software modules described herein to determine such trends in up and coming developing areas and may want to register as many domain names relevant to the area as possible to later sell to vendors franchises as they begin to move into these developing areas. The software and data to determine the up and coming areas for sections of towns may include possibly a database of recent news articles about the relevant areas such as real estate development contractors retailers magazines public MLS sales records etc.

This non limiting example also demonstrates that any of the embodiments herein may be used not only in the primary domain name market but also in the domain name aftermarket. By buying the geographically related domain names early the domain speculators may be able to take advantage of auctioning off the domains after they are originally bought and sell to those in the up and coming hot areas of towns.

As seen in the method steps disclosed regarding may also be applied to the example embodiments shown in . shows that the embodiments illustrated in as well as other disclosed embodiments may include the step of receiving real estate information for one or more houses possibly within a residential area Step . Available domain names related to those houses the residential areas and the areas they are located in may be suggested using method steps analogous to or described in any of the method steps described in .

Data storage in these embodiments may contain information about available domain names related to the street address and the area being viewed on the map in response to user input or the geo tagging of the remote client computer. In this non limiting example the user may have zoomed in from a world level of the mapping software to the United States country level and on to the state level displaying the state of Colorado to the city level in Boulder Colo. to a specific area within Boulder known as the Gunbarrel area. Specific streets within the Gunbarrel area are shown in this example embodiment and using the information determined from method steps described in or analogous to those in the addresses on these streets with available domain names may be suggested to the user.

The user in the example embodiment in has zoomed in to look at or the geo location software has tagged a neighborhood at the crossroads of N. 75th Old Mill Road and Tanglewood Trail where a database in either the mapping or the registrar data centers or integrated data storage may contain information about this neighborhood and may list the addresses with available corresponding domain names within the neighborhood. Additional information such as demand for the houses within the neighborhood real estate listings high prices being sold in the area etc. may also be determined and stored to determine the desirability of the houses within the neighborhood and the related domain names.

Five houses are available for domain name registration within the residential area displayed in 4598 Tanglewood Trail 4582 Tanglewood Trail 4576 Tanglewood Trail 4572 Tanglewood Trail and 7485 Old Mill Road. These addresses may be listed in a dropdown box or any other user interface control as shown in the non limiting example in .

The user may then select one of several TLD s shown from a second dropdown list. As before the software modules may be configured to display the available addresses and TLDs automatically or may display the addresses and TLDs when the user clicks on either the individual addresses or addresses for surrounding residences if available and desired. In embodiments with similar features to the user may specifically select possibly via checkbox etc. only one address to see selected domain names related to the address.

In other embodiments addresses not shown but found within the neighborhood that are desirable and have available corresponding domain names may also be listed. For example although houses on Old Mill Road are not seen on the map displayed the domain name suggestion drop down boxes show available domain names corresponding to the addresses on Old Mill Road. To accomplish this the software may be configured to receive the addresses within a certain radius of the selected house or the location of the user.

Several options are available once the user selects the area address and TLD. In one embodiment address and TLD may be combined together where the address already includes just the name of the address. In other embodiments the software may be configured to automatically combine the name of the address with the city and or area. In some embodiments the user may wish to select the area to combine with the business address and TLD. In other embodiments the user may select hyphenated versions or underlines etc.

In the embodiments illustrated in as well as other disclosed embodiments may include the steps of suggesting domain names based on the keywords parsed and or extrapolated from the neighborhood or addresses determined by the geo location feature using the cell phone and the GPS integrated into the mobile device as described regarding . The software may be configured to receive from the real estate agent developer a range of houses within a fixed area defined by the user to suggest all available homes domain names within that fixed area. 1 mile 10 miles within the neighborhood within the city etc. 

As a non limiting example the star in may show the location for a real estate agent with a listing for a 4576 Tanglewood Trail based on the signal from the geo location feature possibly located on the real estate agent s smart phone. In this example the agent may want to create a website for the listing including custom splash pages for the home directions to the home etc. To accomplish this the agent may start the present invention including opening a synchronized software application that uses information from both the registrar data center and or information from either or both of the mapping software data center or information taken from GPS software and possibly stored in such a data center.

As seen in previously shown and described embodiments the information for available domain names may have been parsed for keywords related to possible information and the relevant geographical divisions may have been associated to map coordinates and marked on the map possibly from the map showing the GPS information determined by the geo location feature on the smart phone.

The location for the user may be shown on the displayable map that shows the location of the user as determined by the GPS software. shows the location of the agent user by showing a star in the address of 4576 Tanglewood Trail. The software using both the GPS online mapping software and the domain name suggestion registration software may then display suggested domain names based on the location of the agent user. This software may be used together as possibly overlays or may be integrated into a single software.

In some embodiments there may be additional software specific to the type of real estate organization trying to access the software to register certain domain names. In these embodiments certain real estate groups would only want agents or others within the organization to be able to access the software to register the domain names. To accomplish this the software may require the agents to have a unique password or corporate password that would allow them to access the software thereby avoiding situations where others could register listed addresses and sell them to the organizations franchises. This would also apply to contractors or builders who could potentially blend the uses that both domain name speculators and realtors have for geo specific domain names.

In other embodiments contractors developers domain speculators may recognize trends in up and coming developing areas and may want to get as many domain names relevant to the area as possible to sell to real estate agents or developers as they begin to sell residences in these developing areas. The software to determine the up and coming areas for hot sections of towns may include possibly a database of recent news articles about the area in relevant areas such as real estate development contractors retailers magazines etc.

The additional steps included in the embodiments illustrated in are not limited to their respective illustrated embodiments and may be combined in several different orders and modified within multiple other disclosed embodiments. Likewise the method steps disclosed herein may be accomplished by a software module executed on a server and or client configured to accomplish that method step.
