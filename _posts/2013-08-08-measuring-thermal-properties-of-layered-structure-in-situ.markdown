title: Measuring thermal properties of layered structure in situ
abstract: An in situ method for deriving the thermal properties of a layered structure represents physical layers by effective thermal layers. The method requires access to only one side of a structure and performs a series of tests wherein a periodic heat flux is applied to the surface of the structure. Each test employs a unique frequency, which is associated with an effective thermal layer of the structure. During the tests the temperature of the surface is monitored and a record of transient temperature is kept. A thermal model of effective layers is created based on the number of tests/frequencies available. The values of the applied heat fluxes are incorporated into this thermal model of effective layers. An optimization technique is used to find the thermal capacity and thermal resistance of the effective layers by best matching the predicted response to that of the measured transient temperature response.

Our invention falls within the field of non destructive testing and more particularly falls within the area of non destructive testing to ascertain thermal qualities of structures or materials. Our method is applicable to testing anisotropic layered structures by observing surface temperature changes during the course of a controlled heating of the surface.

Various techniques are known and used to ascertain thermal properties of layered structures wherein heat is applied to the structure and temperature changes at the surface or an interface are observed. In these techniques experimental data is used via modeling and optimization or error minimization processes to derive thermal properties such as thermal conductivity or thermal diffusivity. See for example a paper by Model in Vol. 26 No. 1 January 2003 titled Thermal Transport Properties of Layered Materials Identification by a New Numerical Algorithm for Transient Measurements. That paper contemplates a mathematical model wherein a flat planar heat source is sandwiched at the interface between two identical layered structures. The use of lowered surface heat excitation frequencies to elicit thermal responses of deeper zones within a structure was discussed in Thermal Non Destructive Characterization by the Thermal Transfer Function and the Numerical Method of Control Volumes by Bellatar et al. at NDT.net August 2003 Vol. 8 No. 8.

Generally the present invention provides an improved in situ method for deriving the thermal properties of a layered structure wherein the material properties of the layers vary and the thickness of the layers also vary. The physical layers of the structure are treated as being regrouped into thermally effective layers. We regard a thermally effective layer as consisting of a generally layer shaped planar zone of the structure which behaves thermally as a unit since the zone has a single characteristic heat capacity value and a single characteristic heat conductivity value. The improved method requires access to only one side of a layered structure so that for example only the exterior surface of a military vehicle s layered hull minor needs to be accessed to determine thermal qualities of the armor. The improved method further includes performing a series of tests wherein a sinusoidal heat flux is applied to the surface of the structure. A single frequency of heat flux input is found and used for each test in the series and a given test in the series uses a different frequency than other tests. Each frequency is associated with a thermally effective layer of the structure. During the tests the temperature of the surface is monitored such that a graph of temperature change over time or transient temperature can be plotted. By various optimization techniques the transient temperature data can be used to derive the thermal capacity and thermal conductivity of the effective thermal layers. Our method can be applied to homogeneous one layer structures as well as to anisotropic layered structures.

A modified thermoelectric heating device is placed atop layered structure . Device alternately heats and cools structure and the heating element of device can be any heating element found in commercially available thermoelectric devices. Cooling is done by active refrigeration as opposed to merely allowing heat previously imparted to structure to escape to the surrounding environment. Accordingly a refrigeration unit provides chilled coolant to device via coolant line and receives used coolant from device via return line . Device alternately heats and cools structure and measures the temperature of structure at the interface between device and structure . Heating and cooling occurs in a continuous cycle so that the thermal flux at the interface between device and structure is preferably a sinusoidal function of time with a characteristic frequency. Although the aforementioned function is preferred to be sinusoidal the function merely needs to exhibit a periodic cyclic ebb and flow of heat flux at the interface between device and structure . Thus for example the function can be a quasi sinusoidal function such as a saw tooth function or a function where the curvature is not precisely sinusoidal.

The heat flux between device and structure is measured by a thin film heat flux sensor closely adhered to and congruent with the bottom of device . The value for heat flux can be calculated based on the electrical inputs to refrigeration unit and device but it is preferred to measure heat flux directly with sensor . The heating and cooling of device is governed by a control unit by logic circuitry or by a combination of unit and circuitry . Circuitry is typically a circuit board built into device and control unit is typically a personal computer or a laptop computer having a monitor screen . Heat flux sensor includes at its center a temperature sensor designated as reference numeral in which typically is a thermocouple type of sensor. Control unit communicates with refrigeration unit thermoelectric device flux sensor and temperature sensor by respective lines or channels and .

Thermal interface material in the form of a thin thermal gap pad is disposed between sensor and structure the pad minimizing the thermal interface resistance due to irregularities or roughness of the surface of structure where device is positioned. The thickness and thermal qualities of such pads from any supplier are quite uniform and controlled by suppliers of such pads. The pad s thermal qualities can be easily be treated in any calculations by which thermal qualities of structure are derived from heat flux and temperature readings at the interface between thermoelectric device and structure . Other thermal interface materials in the form of grease paste or tape can be used and in some cases it may be unnecessary or not preferred to use a thermal interface material.

The apparatus of is advantageous in that the surface upon which device bears can be tilted at any angle and can even be facing downward. Consequently layered armor structures on vehicles can be tested using this apparatus no matter what the angular orientation of the armor structure is so that testing armored structures under field conditions is feasible. Additionally the test apparatus shown in is highly portable in that it weighs less than 50 pounds and no component need have a longest dimension greater than about two and one half feet. In these figures all portions of the test apparatus are disposed upon or are faced by surface of layered structure no sensor or other test equipment is disposed upon of faced by opposed surface of structure .

Our method for deriving the thermal properties of a layered structure involves treating the structure as if it were a slab of semi infinite thickness a slab bounded by one planar surface but having an infinite thickness. It can be shown from an analytic solution involving a semi infinitely thick slab exposed to a surface heat flux i.e. the semi infinite solid solution that the following relatively simple closed form equation Equation 1 can be obtained relating material properties of interest to surface heat flux and temperature 

When heated continuously on one side a given specimen of layered structure will for a short time behave thermally as a slab of semi infinite thickness and its thermal qualities can be derived by Equation 1. The specimen acts in accordance with Equation 1 until the temperature of opposite unheated side begins to be significantly influenced by the heat source. Thus a layered armor structure heated on the front side will act thermally as a semi infinitely thick slab until the back face ceases to have an essentially constant temperature and begins to exhibit a steady temperature rise with time. Our experiments show that depending on the exact composition thickness and number of layers in an armor recipe specimens of actual armor will behave thermally as semi infinitely thick slabs for several minutes or less when continuously heated on one face by a constant two to four Watt source.

To expand the time window during which layered structure armor acts as a slab of semi infinite thickness one can vary the heating method by replacing the continuous heating technique with the sinusoidal heating and cooling cycle described above. In the most preferred method the cooling part of the cycle removes an amount of heat from structure equal to the amount of heat imparted to structure during the heating portion of the cycle. By this method the opposed surface or back face remains at a constant temperature indefinitely so that device can be operated continuously thereby allowing any number of heating cooling cycle frequencies to be applied and tested efficiently in a single uninterrupted trial session. Despite the fact that surface or face remains at a constant temperature the portion of surface or face at the interface of device and structure will vary over time as the structure is subjected to various frequencies of sinusoidal heating cooling cycles.

Treating layered structures as semi infinitely thick slabs as discussed in connection with Equation 1 above is an important aspect of our method for creating a thermal model of a known layered structure utilizing varied frequencies of heating cooling cycles. Creation of a thermal model is best explained by example in conjunction with . In that figure a known layered armor structure is designated at having individual layers of armor material and . The thickness area location within structure and material of each of these layers is known. Also known for each layer are k the conductivity of the material p the density of the material c the specific heat of the material and C the heat capacity of the material . The heat capacity and thermal conductivity for structure as a whole are known as well.

A test apparatus like that shown in is utilized except that structure replaces structure in those figures. Device imparts heating cooling cycles to one exposed surface of structure at various frequencies. For most layered structures and for most multi layered armor structures testing with two or more frequencies is necessary or at least desired. Typically the selected frequencies include a low frequency a medium frequency and a high frequency. As a rule of thumb the low frequency is in the range of approximately 10Hz to 10Hz the medium frequency is in the range of approximately 10Hz to 10Hz and the high frequency is in the range of approximately 10Hz to 10Hz. Layers at or near the bottom or the face opposite where device is located of a layered structure thermally respond well to low frequencies and do not respond as well to medium or high frequencies. Layers in the middle of a structure or tend to best respond thermally to medium frequencies and layers at or near the top or the face where device is located respond well thermally to high frequencies.

For each of the chosen heating cooling cycle frequencies there is for thermal modeling purposes an effective thermal layer which has its own characteristic thermal conductivity or alternately thermal resistance R and has its own characteristic heat capacity. The effective thermal layers are the components of a thermal model of a layered structure. Accordingly in thermal model of structure is comprised of thermal effective layers and in the thermally effective layers are labeled as having respective characteristic resistances of Rand Rand R.

The method of determining the thermally effective layers of a structure involves using a test specimen whose width and length are preferably known so that the heat capacity for the thermally effective layers is more conveniently found. Thus as seen in the width A and the length B of layered structure are known and are typically one foot and two feet respectively. The specimen is typically surrounded by an adiabatic environment in that any exposed face of structure or any exposed edges of the structure s layers contacted by adiabatic materials such as a body of air or wood or insulating foam having a higher thermal resistance than any of the physical layers of the structure. Thermoelectric device is typically centered on the exposed face of the layered structure and a temperature sensor schematically shown at is disposed at the center of the interface between device and the exposed surface of structure . To determine the thermal qualities of the first effective layer the layer contacted by device the first layer is somewhat arbitrarily assumed to have a thickness t. For example in a layered structure whose overall thickness is 2.0 inches tcan be presumed to be 0.50 inches or 0.75 inches or another selected value. Preferably if the dimensions A B and tare known or presumed the volume of the first thermally effective layer can be determined and the specific heat cof the first effective layer is then a direct proportion function of its heat capacity C. Hence in our discussions of the qualities of thermally effective layers we often refer to a layer s specific heat in lieu of its heat capacity since one quality determines the other in our method.

As discussed previously the thermal qualities of the thermally first effective layer of structure are found by applying a set of a high frequency sinusoidal heating cooling cycles by means of device . A table of data such as that in is kept. In the table for regular time intervals the temperature and heat flux q or Watts per unit area are recorded the time intervals can be for example one second long or can be orders of magnitude longer or shorter depending on the circumstances of the test. Next a second thermally effective layer is treated by applying a second set of heating cooling cycles at a lower frequency than was used for the first effective layer a second data table again similar to that in is generated. The process of applying successively lower heating cooling frequencies for additional thermally effective layers and creating additional associated data tables continues until the desired number of thermally effective layers has been processed. Typically for a layered armor structure one to two inches thick three effective thermal layers are determined although any number of effective layers can be found in a given case depending mainly on the accuracy of one s instruments and the level of effort one wishes to expend. For some applications it is not necessary to know the overall thickness or depth of the structure and characterizing a selected number of upper layers will suffice. This would be the case for example when characterizing the thermal characteristics of layers of material of and under a road or other cases where the structure can be treated as if it were infinitely thick. As another example this would also be the case where only the outer layer or a set of outer layers are of interest. It is also possible to have a single thermally effective layer for a structure particularly when the structure is monolithic or has layers of thermally similar material.

The values for the thermal conductivity or the thermal resistance of effective layers as well as the heat capacity values or specific heat values for these layers is are then derived. This is done by a thermal solver program or thermal simulation program in conjunction with an optimization code. Numerous thermal solver tools or thermal simulation computer programs are commercially available and may be used for our method. For the sake of being complete in our disclosure and not by way of recommendation we note that we used the thermal solver MuSES or Multi Service Electro optics Signature code which inter alia is useful for computer aided design modeling as applied to thermal behavior of multi component structures. There are also numerous methods to achieve optimization including the Levenberg Marquardt method or Nelder Mead based optimizers. A discussion of optimization techniques used in thermal modeling of layered structures can be found in a paper by Regine Model in Vol. 26 No. 1 January 2003 titled Thermal Transport Properties of Layered Materials Identification by a New Numerical Algorithm for Transient Measurements. Again for the sake of being complete in our disclosure and not by way of recommendation we note that we used optimization code found in ModeFRONTIER a known multi objective optimization and design environment.

Using the thermal solver program a thermal model or virtual representation of structure is created having effective thermal layers corresponding to those of structure . The values for conductivity or resistance and for capacity or specific heat for each effective layer are arbitrarily picked. For a given effective layer if these picked values are incorrect then the temperature changes as output by the model will not match the temperature changes experienced by structure for the same heat flux inputs. On the other hand for a given effective layer if these picked values are accurate then the temperature changes as output by the model will closely match the temperature changes experienced by structure for the same heat flux inputs . In is shown a typical virtual data table associated with a given effective layer of the thermal model or virtual representation of structure . The Time and q columns of the table have the same entries as the respective Time and q columns of the Real table. The values T T T. . . in may or may not show temperature changes matching those in depending on the values for conductivity or resistance and capacity or specific heat which have been chosen. The optimization technique is used to try for each effective layer combinations of values for conductivity or resistance and capacity or specific heat for the model until the temperature changes shown by the model emulate temperature changes reflected by the actual testing of structure as represented by the real data table in .

The real changes in temperature over time or transient temperature for a thermally effective layer of structure can be depicted graphically as by curve in . The data points for curve are taken from a real data table such as that shown in . It will be seen that curve has a sinusoidal shape as a consequence of the sinusoidal heating cooling cycles generated by thermoelectric device . Curve is typical but the precise shape of the curve will vary from one effective layer to another. Curve serves as a standard or benchmark for the transient temperature readings produced by the corresponding effective layer in the thermal model of structure whose data points are derived from a virtual data table such as that depicted in . Thus if the picked values for conductivity or resistance and capacity or specific heat for the model are accurate the curve the representing the temperature changes shown by the model will have the same or essentially the same shape as curve . But if the picked values for conductivity or resistance and capacity or specific heat for the model are not accurate the curve the representing the temperature changes produced by the model will not have the same shape as curve in such a case the curve the representing the temperature changes produced by the model can have a shape for example like curve in .

In is shown an analysis graph wherein curve depicts the slopes at a continuum of points along the curve derived from a real data table like the one in . Any conventional method to derive the slope of a function can be used to generate curve . As a matter of choice we used the following fourth order central difference approximation Equation 2 below to characterize the slope of the transient temperature response.

One slight variation of our method is to find the first thermally effective layer of structure then create a virtual representation of that effective layer and then find optimized values for conductivity or resistance and for heat capacity or specific heat for the virtual representation of the first thermally effective layer this process is repeated for the second and subsequent effective layers. Otherwise the techniques of our method remain the same. The variation of our method is further explained in conjunction with . In device applies sinusoidal heating cooling cycles to a layered structure in the same fashion as was done for structure . The first thermally effective layer is assumed to have thickness tand the appropriate time temperature and heat flux readings are taken. Optimized values for conductivity and specific heat kand crespectively are derived for layer . Then as seen in a second thermally effective layer presumed to have a thickness thas the appropriate time temperature and heat flux readings recorded. Optimized values for kand care derived for layer . The foregoing process is repeated for the third and subsequent effective layers. represents completion of the variation of our method as applied to structure having four thermally effective layers and having respective presumed thicknesses t t t and t.

A second variation of our method is explained in conjunction with wherein the second variation of our method is applied to a layered structure . The difference between the second variation of our method and what is discussed above is as follows. In the second variation we find the first thermally effective layer using a high frequency of heating cooling cycles applied by device . Then we find the bottom or third thermally effective layer by using a low frequency of heating cooling cycles applied by device . Finally we find a second or middle thermally effective layer using a medium frequency of heating cooling cycles applied by device . Determining the optimized values for each effective layer can occur either just after the transient temperature and heat flux readings are taken for that layer or after the readings for all the layers have been taken.

In one particular application of our method thermally effective layers may represent actual material layers which may be determined if the number of actual layers is known and their thicknesses are known or determined by testing physical measurement manufacturer specification sheets drawings or other means. In a case where even more information is known as for example when the thermal properties of one actual thermally effective layer are known accurate characterization of the remaining layers is facilitated. In another particular application of our method one can determine thermal characteristics near non uniformities in the specimen for example one can thermally characterize layered structure adjacent a door opening by building a model incorporating the door opening or selected edges thereof and associated measurements.

In some cases the match between the modeled thermal qualities and the previously known reference thermal qualities of structures or may be less close than desired in view of the purposes for which the model is created. For example if the model is created for quality control purposes or damage inspection purposes a variance however statistically or mathematically determined of greater than 10 may be undesirable. In such a case an additional frequency is found which causes a temperature rise at the interface between device and the exposed surface of structure or . Finding this frequency as well as finding the frequencies initially used can be done by trial and error over the course of numerous tests however the applicants herein have found that as experience grows with our method one is able to choose frequencies with less and less experimentation. The additional frequency leads to an additional thermally effective layer for the thermal model of layered structure or and the model is revised by adding the additional effective layer and adjusting the presumed thickness of the initially found effective layers if necessary. The revised model is then tested in the same fashion as the original model. The foregoing process of revising the thermal model can be repeated until an acceptable accuracy of the model is achieved.

Once the model is complete it can be used for various purposes. One purpose is quality control in a production setting where layered structures are produced. A thermal model with effective thermal layers is first created using a first sample of the product a quality standard sample known to have been manufactured properly and known to be defect free. Then a second sample of the product is subjected to heating cooling cycles at the same frequencies selected to model the first sample. If the thermal conductivity or thermal resistance or thermal capacity of the second sample does not match that of the first sample then there is an indication that the second sample was not manufactured properly or else has a defect. In similar fashion a sample of a layered product that has been used in the field can be compared to a sample known to be free of defects. For example the layered armor on a military vehicle may have been hit by enemy fire and comparing the conductivity resistance and capacity of the effective thermal layers of vehicle armor to those of a defect free sample will help ascertain whether the vehicle armor has been damaged internally.
