This disclosure generally relates to mobile data systems and more specifically relates to breakout out of data at the edge of a mobile data network in a way that is transparent to existing equipment in the mobile data network so one or more mobile network services may be performed by edge applications at the edge of the mobile data network in response to the broken out data.

Mobile phones have evolved into smart phones that allow a user not only to make a call but also to access data such as e mails the internet etc. Mobile phone networks have evolved as well to provide the data services that new mobile devices require. For example 3G networks cover most of the United States and allow users high speed wireless data access on their mobile devices. In addition phones are not the only devices that can access mobile data networks. Many mobile phone companies provide equipment and services that allow a subscriber to plug a mobile access card into a Universal Serial Bus USB port on a laptop computer and provide wireless internet to the laptop computer through the mobile data network. In addition some newer mobile phones allow the mobile phone to function as a wireless hotspot which supports connecting several laptop computers or other wireless devices to the mobile phone which in turn provides data services via the mobile data network. As time marches on the amount of data served on mobile data networks will continue to rise exponentially.

Mobile data networks include very expensive hardware and software so upgrading the capability of existing networks is not an easy thing to do. It is not economically feasible for a mobile network provider to simply replace all older equipment with new equipment due to the expense of replacing the equipment. For example the next generation wireless network in the United States is the 4G network. Many mobile data network providers are still struggling to get their entire system upgraded to provide 3G data services. Immediately upgrading to 4G equipment is not an economically viable option for most mobile data network providers. In many locations portions of the mobile data network are connected together by point to point microwave links. These microwave links have limited bandwidth. To significantly boost the throughput of these links requires the microwave links to be replaced with fiber optic cable but this option is very costly.

Mobile network services are performed in a mobile data network in a way that is transparent to most of the existing equipment in the mobile data network. The mobile data network includes a radio access network and a core network. A breakout component in the radio access network breaks out data coming from a basestation and hosts edge applications including third party edge applications that perform one or more mobile network services at the edge of the mobile data network based on the broken out data.

The foregoing and other features and advantages will be apparent from the following more particular description as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

The claims and disclosure herein provide mechanisms and methods for a breakout component in a radio access network to break out data coming from a basestation and to host edge applications including third party edge applications that perform one or more mobile network services at the edge of the mobile data network based on the broken out data.

Referring to a prior art mobile data network is shown. Mobile data network is representative of known 3G networks. The mobile data network preferably includes a radio access network RAN a core network and an external network as shown in . The radio access network includes the tower basestation with its corresponding NodeB and a radio interface on a radio network controller RNC . The core network includes a network interface on the radio network controller the serving node gateway node and operator service network as part of the mobile data network . The external network includes any suitable network. One suitable example for an external network is the internet as shown in the specific example in .

In mobile data network user equipment communicates via radio waves to a tower . User equipment may include any device capable of connecting to a mobile data network including a mobile phone a tablet computer a mobile access card coupled to a laptop computer etc. The tower communicates via network connection to a basestation . Each basestation includes a NodeB which communicates with the tower and the radio network controller . Note there is a fan out that is not represented in . Typically there are tens of thousands of towers . Each tower typically has a corresponding base station with a NodeB that communicates with the tower. However network communications with the tens of thousands of base stations are performed by hundreds of radio network controllers . Thus each radio network controller can service many NodeBs in basestations . There may also be other items in the network between the basestation and the radio network controller that are not shown in such as concentrators points of concentration or RAN aggregators that support communications with many basestations.

The radio network controller communicates with the serving node . In a typical 3G network the serving node is an SGSN which is short for Service GPRS Support Node where GPRS stands for general packet radio service. The serving node mediates access to network resources on behalf of mobile subscribers and implements the packet scheduling policy between different classes of quality of service. It is also responsible for establishing the Packet Data Protocol PDP context with the gateway node for a given subscriber session. The serving node is responsible for the delivery of data packets from and to the basestations within its geographical service area. The tasks of the serving node include packet routing and transfer mobility management attach detach and location management logical link management and authentication and charging functions. The serving node stores location information and user profiles of all subscribers registered with the serving node . Functions the serving node typically performs include GPRS tunneling protocol GTP tunneling of packets performing mobility management as user equipment moves from one basestation to the next and billing user data.

In a typical 3G network the gateway node is a GGSN which is short for gateway GPRS support node. The gateway node is responsible for the interworking between the core network and external networks. From the viewpoint of the external networks gateway node is a router to a sub network because the gateway node hides the core network infrastructure from the external network. When the gateway node receives data from an external network such as internet addressed to a specific subscriber it forwards the data to the serving node serving the subscriber. For inactive subscribers paging is initiated. The gateway node also handles routing packets originated from the user equipment to the appropriate external network. As anchor point the gateway node supports the mobility of the user equipment . In essence the gateway node maintains routing necessary to tunnel the network packets to the serving node that services a particular user equipment .

The gateway node converts the packets coming from the serving node into the appropriate packet data protocol PDP format e.g. IP or X.25 and sends them out on the corresponding external network. In the other direction PDP addresses of incoming data packets from the external network are converted to the address of the subscriber s user equipment . The readdressed packets are sent to the responsible serving node . For this purpose the gateway node stores the current serving node address of the subscriber and his or her profile. The gateway node is responsible for IP address assignment and is the default router for the subscriber s user equipment . The gateway node also performs authentication charging and subscriber policy functions. One example of a subscriber policy function is fair use bandwidth limiting and blocking of particular traffic types such as peer to peer traffic. Another example of a subscriber policy function is degradation to a 2G service level for a prepaid subscriber when the prepaid balance is zero.

A next hop router located in the operator service network OSN receives messages from the gateway node and routes the traffic either to the operator service network or via an internet service provider ISP towards the internet . The operator service network typically includes business logic that determines how the subscriber can use the mobile data network . The business logic that provides services to subscribers may be referred to as a walled garden which refers to a closed or exclusive set of services provided for subscribers including a carrier s control over applications content and media on user equipment.

Devices using mobile data networks often need to access an external network such as the internet . As shown in when a subscriber enters a request for data from the internet that request is passed from the user equipment to tower to NodeB in basestation to radio network controller to serving node to gateway node to operator service network and to internet . When the requested data is delivered the data traverses the entire network from the internet to the user equipment . The capabilities of known mobile data networks are taxed by the ever increasing volume of data being exchanged between user equipment and the internet because all data between the two have to traverse the entire network.

Some efforts have been made to offload internet traffic to reduce the backhaul on the mobile data network. For example some mobile data networks include a node called a HomeNodeB that is part of the radio access network. Many homes have access to high speed Internet such as Direct Subscriber Line DSL cable television wireless etc. For example in a home with a DSL connection the HomeNodeB takes advantage of the DSL connection by routing Internet traffic to and from the user equipment directly to the DSL connection instead of routing the Internet traffic through the mobile data network. While this may be an effective way to offload Internet traffic to reduce backhaul the HomeNodeB architecture makes it difficult to provide many mobile network services such as lawful interception mobility and charging consistently with the 3G or 4G mobile data network.

Referring to a mobile data network includes mechanisms that provide various services for the mobile data network in a way that is transparent to most of the existing equipment in the mobile data network. shows user equipment tower NodeB radio network controller serving node gateway node operator service node and internet the same as shown in . The additions to the mobile data network when compared with the prior art mobile data network in include the addition of three components that may provide mobile network services in the mobile data network along with a network management mechanism to manage the three components. The mobile network services are performed by what is called herein a Mobile Internet Optimization Platform MIOP and the mobile network services performed by the Mobile Internet Optimization Platform are referred to herein as MIOP services. The three MIOP components that provide these mobile network services are shown in as MIOP NodeB MIOP RNC and MIOP Core . A network management system shown as MIOP NMS manages the overall solution by 1 managing the function of the three MIOP components and 2 determining which MIOP NodeBs in the system aggregate to which MIOP RNCs via the overlay network for performance fault and configuration management and 3 monitoring performance of the MIOP NodeBs to dynamically change and configure the mobile network services. The MIOP NodeB MIOP RNC MIOP Core MIOP NMS and the overlay network and any subset of these and are referred to herein as MIOP components.

The mobile network services provided by MIOP NodeB MIOP RNC and MIOP Core include any suitable services on the mobile data network such as data optimizations RAN aware services subscriber aware services edge based application serving edge based analytics etc. All mobile network services performed by all of MIOP NodeB MIOP RNC and MIOP Core are included in the term MIOP services as used herein. In addition to the services being offer in the MIOP components MIOP NodeB MIOP RNC and MIOP Core the various MIOP services could also be provided in a cloud based manner.

MIOP NodeB includes a first service mechanism and is referred to as the edge based portion of the MIOP solution. MIOP NodeB resides in the radio access network and has the ability to intercept all traffic to and from the NodeB . MIOP NodeB preferably resides in the base station shown by the dotted box in . Thus all data to and from the NodeB to and from the radio network controller is routed through MIOP NodeB . MIOP NodeB performs what is referred to herein as breakout of data on the intercepted data stream. MIOP NodeB monitors the signaling traffic between NodeB and RNC and on connection setup intercepts in particular the setup of the transport layer allocation of the UDP Port IP address or AAL2 channel . For registered sessions the breakout mechanism will be configured in a way that all traffic belonging to this UDP Port IP address to AAL2 channel will be forwarded to an data offload function. MIOP NodeB thus performs breakout of data by defining a previously existing path in the radio access network for non broken out data by defining a new second data path that did not previously exist in the radio access network for broken out data identifying data received from a corresponding NodeB as data to be broken out sending the data to be broken out on the second data path and forwarding other data that is not broken out on the first data path. The signaling received by MIOP NodeB from NodeB is forwarded to RNC on the existing network connection to RNC even though the data traffic is broken out. Thus RNC sees the signaling traffic and knows the subscriber session is active but does not see the user data that is broken out by MIOP NodeB . MIOP NodeB thus performs two distinct functions depending on the monitored data packets 1 forward the data packets to RNC for signaling traffic and user data that is not broken out including voice calls and 2 re route the data packets for user data that is broken out.

Once MIOP NodeB breaks out user data it can perform any suitable service based on the traffic type of the broken out data. Because the services performed by MIOP NodeB are performed in the radio access network e.g. at the basestation the MIOP NodeB can service the user equipment much more quickly than can the radio network controller . In addition by having a MIOP NodeB that is dedicated to a particular NodeB one MIOP NodeB only needs to service those subscribers that are currently connected via a single NodeB. The radio network controller in contrast which typically services dozens or even hundreds of basestations must service all the subscribers accessing all basestations it controls from a remote location. As a result MIOP NodeB is in a much better position to provide services that will improve the quality of service and experience for subscribers than is the radio network controller.

Breaking out data in the radio access network by MIOP NodeB allows for many different types of services to be performed in the radio access network. These services may include optimizations that are similar to optimizations provided by known industry solutions between radio network controllers and the serving node. However moving these optimizations to the edge of the mobile data network will not only greatly improve the quality of service for subscribers but will also provide a foundation for applying new types of services at the edge of the mobile data network such as terminating machine to machine MTM traffic at the edge e.g. in the basestation hosting applications at the edge and performing analytics at the edge.

MIOP RNC includes a second service mechanism in mobile data network . MIOP RNC monitors all communication between the radio network controller and serving node . The monitored communications are all communications to and from the radio network controller and the rest of the core network. MIOP RNC may provide one or more services for the mobile data network. MIOP RNC preferably makes the decision of whether or not to allow breakout of data. If MIOP RNC decides to breakout data for a given subscriber session it may send a message to MIOP NodeB authorizing breakout by MIOP NodeB or may decide to breakout the data at MIOP RNC depending on the configured breakout decision criteria and selected radio channel. Because messages to and from the core network establishing the PDP context for a given subscriber session are monitored by MIOP RNC the decision of whether or not to breakout data resides in the MIOP RNC .

MIOP Core includes a third service mechanism in the mobile data network . MIOP Core may include all the same services as MIOP RNC or any suitable subset of those services. If the decision is made not to provide services at MIOP NodeB or MIOP RNC these same services plus more sophisticated services can be performed at MIOP Core . Thus mobile data network provides flexibility by allowing a decision to be made of where to perform which services. Because MIOP NodeB MIOP RNC and MIOP Core preferably include some of the same services the services between components may interact e.g. MIOP NodeB and MIOP Core may interact to optimize TCP traffic between them or the services may be distributed across the mobile data network e.g. MIOP NodeB performs breakout and provides services for high speed traffic MIOP RNC performs breakout and provides services for low speed traffic and MIOP Core provides services for non broken out traffic . The MIOP system architecture thus provides a very powerful and flexible solution allowing dynamic configuring and reconfiguring on the fly of which services are performed by the MIOP components and where. In addition these services may be implemented taking advantage of existing infrastructure in a mobile data network.

MIOP NMS is a network management system that monitors and controls the functions of MIOP NodeB MIOP RNC and MIOP Core . MIOP NMS preferably includes MIOP internal real time or near real time performance data monitoring to determine if historical or additional regional dynamic changes are needed to improve services on the mobile data network . MIOP NMS provides a user interface that allows a system administrator to operate and to configure how the MIOP components and function.

The overlay network allows MIOP NodeB MIOP RNC MIOP Core and MIOP NMS to communicate with each other. The overlay network is preferably a virtual private network primarily on an existing physical network in the mobile data network. Thus while overlay network is shown in separate from other physical network connections this representation in is a logical representation.

As shown in the overlay network from the NodeBs to POC is a virtual private network implemented on existing physical network connections. However the overlay network requires a second router RT which is connected via a physical network connection to POC and is connected via physical network connection to MIOP RNC . This second router RT may be a separate router or may be a router implemented within MIOP RNC . MIOP RNC is also connected to router RT via a physical network connection and is also connected to MIOP Core . Physical connection in is shown in a line with short dots because it is not part of the pre existing physical network before adding the MIOP components arrows with solid lines and is not part of the overlay network arrows with long dots . Note the connection from MIOP RNC to MIOP Core is via existing physical networks in the core network.

We can see from the configuration of the physical network and overlay network in that minimal changes are needed to the existing mobile data network to install the MIOP components. The most that must be added is one new router and three new physical network connections and . Once the new router and new physical network connections and are installed the router and MIOP components are appropriately configured and the existing equipment in the mobile data network is configured to support the overlay network the operation of the MIOP components is completely transparent to existing network equipment.

As can be seen in data on the overlay network is defined on existing physical networks from the NodeBs to POC. From POC the overlay network is on connection to RT and on connection to MIOP RNC . Thus when MIOP NodeB in needs to send a message to MIOP RNC the message is sent by sending packets via a virtual private network on the physical network connections to POC then to RT then to MIOP RNC . Virtual private networks are well known in the art so they are not discussed in more detail here.

Referring to MIOP NodeB preferably includes a breakout mechanism an edge service mechanism and an overlay network mechanism . The breakout mechanism determines breakout preconditions that when satisfied allow breakout to occur at this edge location. Breakout mechanism in MIOP NodeB communicates with the breakout mechanism in MIOP RNC shown in to reach a breakout decision. The breakout mechanism after receiving a message from MIOP RNC authorizing breakout on connection setup intercepts in particular the setup of the transport layer allocation of the UDP Port IP address or AAL2 channel . For authorized sessions the breakout mechanism will be configured in a way that all traffic belonging to this UDP Port IP address to AAL2 channel will be forwarded to a data offload function. For traffic that should not be broken out the breakout mechanism sends the data on the original data path in the radio access network. In essence MIOP NodeB intercepts all communications to and from the basestation and can perform services at the edge meaning at the edge of the radio access network that is close to the user equipment . By performing services at the edge the services to subscribers may be increased or optimizes without requiring hardware changes to existing equipment in the mobile data network.

The breakout mechanism preferably includes breakout preconditions that specify one or more criterion that must be satisfied before breakout of data is allowed. One suitable example of breakout preconditions is the speed of the channel. In one possible implementation only high speed channels will be broken out at MIOP NodeB . Thus breakout preconditions could specify that subscribers on high speed channels may be broken out while subscribers on low speed channels are not broken out at MIOP NodeB . When the breakout preconditions are satisfied the MIOP NodeB registers the subscriber session with MIOP RNC . This is shown in method in . MIOP NodeB intercepts and monitors network traffic to and from NodeB basestation step . When the traffic does not satisfy the breakout preconditions step NO method returns to step . When the traffic satisfies the breakout conditions step YES MIOP NodeB sends a message to MIOP RNC on the overlay network to register the subscriber session for breakout step . With the subscriber session registered with MIOP RNC the MIOP RNC will determine whether or not to breakout data for the subscriber session and where the breakout is done as explained in more detail below.

Referring back to MIOP NodeB also includes an edge service mechanism . The edge service mechanism provides one or more services for the mobile data network . The edge service mechanism may include any suitable service for the mobile data network including without limitation caching of data data or video compression techniques push based services charging application serving analytics security data filtering new revenue producing services etc. The edge service mechanism is the first of three service mechanisms in the MIOP components. While the breakout mechanism and edge service mechanism are shown as separate entities in the first service mechanism could include both breakout mechanism and edge service mechanism .

MIOP NodeB also includes an overlay network mechanism . The overlay network mechanism provides a connection to the overlay network in thereby allowing MIOP NodeB to communicate with MIOP RNC MIOP Core and MIOP NMS . As stated above the overlay network is preferably a virtual private network primarily on an existing physical network in the mobile data network .

Referring to MIOP RNC preferably includes a breakout mechanism an RNC service mechanism an overlay network mechanism and business intelligence . Breakout mechanism includes breakout criteria that specifies one or more criterion that when satisfied allows breakout of data. Subscriber registration mechanism receives messages from MIOP NodeB and registers subscriber sessions for which the breakout preconditions in MIOP NodeB are satisfied. When the breakout mechanism determines the breakout criteria is satisfied the breakout mechanism will then determine where the breakout should occur. When the breakout can occur at MIOP NodeB the MIOP RNC sends a message to MIOP NodeB on the overlay network authorizing breakout at MIOP NodeB . When the breakout should occur at MIOP RNC the breakout mechanism in MIOP RNC performs the breakout as well for the traffic remaining then . This is shown in more detail in method in . MIOP RNC monitors network traffic between the radio network controller and the serving node step . When the traffic does not satisfy the breakout criteria step NO method loops back to step . When the network traffic satisfies the breakout criteria step YES the breakout mechanism determines whether the subscriber session is registered for breakout step . A subscriber session is registered for breakout when the MIOP NodeB determined the traffic satisfied the breakout preconditions and registered the subscriber session for breakout as shown in . Returning to when the subscriber is registered for breakout step YES MIOP RNC sends a message via the overlay network to MIOP NodeB authorizing breakout of traffic for the subscriber session step . MIOP NodeB may then breakout traffic for the subscriber session step . When the subscriber is not registered for breakout step NO method checks to see if MIOP RNC is going to do breakout step . If not step NO method is done. When MIOP RNC is going to do breakout step YES the traffic is then broken out at MIOP RNC step .

In one specific example the breakout preconditions specify only high speed channels are broken out at MIOP NodeB and when the breakout preconditions are satisfied the subscriber session is registered for breakout as shown in . illustrates that even when the breakout preconditions are not satisfied breakout can still be performed at MIOP RNC . Thus even if the subscriber session is on a low speed channel if all the other breakout criteria are satisfied breakout of the low speed channel may be performed at MIOP RNC . The mobile data network thus provides great flexibility in determining when to do breakout and where.

Referring back to the RNC service mechanism provides one or more services for the mobile data network. RNC service mechanism is the second of three service mechanisms in the MIOP components. The RNC service mechanism may include any suitable service for the mobile data network including without limitation caching of data data or video compression techniques push based services charging application serving analytics security data filtering new revenue producing services etc.

While the breakout mechanism and RNC service mechanism are shown as separate entities in the second service mechanism could include both breakout mechanism and RNC service mechanism . The overlay network mechanism is similar to the overlay network mechanism in providing a logical network connection to the other MIOP components on the overlay network in . MIOP RNC also includes business intelligence which includes 

The business intelligence may be instrumented by the RNC service mechanism to determine when and what types of MIOP services to perform for a given subscriber. For example services for a subscriber on a mobile phone may differ when compared to services for a subscriber using a laptop computer to access the mobile data network. In another example voice over internet protocol VoIP session could have the data broken out.

Referring to the MIOP Core includes a core service mechanism and an overlay network mechanism . Core service mechanism provides one or more services for the mobile data network. Core service mechanism is the third of three service mechanisms in the MIOP components. The core service mechanism may include any suitable service for the mobile data network including without limitation caching of data data or video compression techniques push based services charging application serving analytics security data filtering new revenue producing services etc. In one specific implementation the MIOP Core is an optional component because all needed services could be performed at MIOP NodeB and MIOP RNC . In an alternative implementation MIOP Core performs some services while MIOP RNC performs others or none. The overlay network mechanism is similar to the overlay network mechanisms in in providing a logical network connection to the other MIOP components on the overlay network in .

Referring to the MIOP NMS is a network management system that monitors and manages performance of the mobile data network and controls the function of MIOP NodeB MIOP RNC and MIOP Core . MIOP NMS preferably includes a network monitoring mechanism a performance management mechanism a security management mechanism and a configuration management mechanism . The network monitoring mechanism monitors network conditions such as alarms in the mobile data network . The performance management mechanism can enable disable or refine certain services by supporting the execution of services in real time or near real time such as services that gather information to assess customer satisfaction. The security management mechanism manages security issues in the mobile data network such as intrusion detection or additional data privacy. The configuration management mechanism controls and manages the configuration of MIOP NodeB MIOP RNC and MIOP Core in a way that allows them to dynamically adapt to any suitable criteria including data received from the network monitoring mechanism time of day information received from business intelligence etc.

Referring again to when the traffic satisfies the breakout criteria step YES and the subscriber session is registered for breakout step YES MIOP RNC sends a message to MIOP NodeB authorizing breakout of traffic for this subscriber session step . In response MIOP NodeB begins decrypting the bearer examining the signaling and user IP traffic tunneled through it and may breakout the traffic for this subscriber session step . Note however MIOP NodeB may still decide not to breakout all traffic based on other criteria such as type of IP request the destination of the traffic or the ISO Layer 7 Application of the decrypted user traffic. Determination of the Application may be performed simply by inspection of the IP 5 tuple or optionally via inspection at layer 7 using Deep Packet Inspection DPI techniques. This is shown in the specific example in . Method in is one suitable implementation of step in . MIOP NodeB monitors IP requests from the subscriber step . When the user traffic IP request matches a specified type criteria step YES the IP session is broken out for the subscriber step . When the IP request does not match a specified criteria type step NO no breakout is performed. For example let s assume that IP requests to access video over the RTP layer 7 Application Protocol are broken out so the video data may be cached in MIOP NodeB but other requests such as Google searches are not. The MIOP NodeB monitors the IP requests from the subscriber step and when the subscriber session IP request carries RTP traffic is for a video file step YES the IP session is broken out step . Otherwise the IP session is not broken out at MIOP NodeB. This is one simple example to illustrate additional flexibility and intelligence within MIOP NodeB that may determine whether or not to perform breakout for a given subscriber session at the MIOP NodeB after being authorized by MIOP RNC to perform breakout for that subscriber session. Any suitable criteria could be used to determine what to breakout and when at MIOP NodeB once MIOP NodeB has been authorized for breakout in step in .

Referring to method shows a method for determining when to run MIOP services. The Packet Data Protocol PDP activation context for a subscriber is monitored step . A PDP activation context is established when user equipment connects to tower and the subscriber runs an application that triggers the PDP activation procedure. The core network will determine the subscriber and perhaps corresponding user equipment. When MIOP services are allowed step YES services for this subscriber session are run step upon the arrival of data from the subscriber. When MIOP services are not allowed step NO no MIOP services are run. In one simple example MIOP services in the mobile data network are allowed for authorized subscribers but are not allowed for subscribers from a different wireless company that are roaming.

MIOP services may require communicating between MIOP components on the overlay network. Referring to a method shows communications by MIOP NodeB when MIOP services are running step . When the edge service mechanism requires communication with MIOP RNC step YES MIOP NodeB exchanges messages with MIOP RNC over the overlay network step . When the edge service mechanism requires communication with MIOP Core step YES MIOP NodeB exchanges messages with MIOP Core over the overlay network step . The overlay network thus allows the various MIOP components to communicate with each other when MIOP services are running.

Referring to implementations for MIOP NodeB and MIOP RNC are shown by way of example. Other implementations are possible within the scope of the disclosure and claims herein. User equipment is connected to NodeB . Note the antenna shown in is not shown in but is understood to be present to enable the communication between user equipment and NodeB . MIOP NodeB includes an edge cache mechanism which is one suitable example of edge service mechanism in . MIOP NodeB includes an interface referred to herein as IuB Data Offload Gateway IuB DOGW . This gateway implements the breakout mechanism according to one or more specified breakout preconditions shown in . IuB DOGW includes a switching application an offload data handler and an RNC channel handler . The switching application is responsible for monitoring data packets received from NodeB forwarding the broken out data packets to the offload data handler according to its configuration and relaying the non broken out data packets and control system flows to the RNC via the original connections in the RAN. While switching application is shown as two separate boxes in this is done to visually indicate the switching application performs switching on two different interfaces the network interface and overlay network interface but the switching application is preferably a single entity.

When a breakout decision is made and MIOP RNC sends a message to MIOP NodeB authorizing breakout see step in when MIOP NodeB decides to breakout specified user data the specified user data received by the switching application from NodeB is broken out which means the switching application routes the specified user data to the offload data handler so the broken out data is routed to the data path defined for breakout data. The offload data handler may send the data to the edge cache mechanism for processing which can route the data directly to MIOP RNC via the overlay network as shown by the path with arrows going from NodeB to MIOP RNC .

User data that is not broken out and signaling traffic is routed directly back by the switching application to RNC. In this manner non broken out data and signaling traffic passes through the IuB DOGW to RNC while broken out data is routed by the IuB DOGW to a different destination. Note that edge cache mechanism may send messages to MIOP RNC as shown in but the broken out messages themselves are not sent to MIOP RNC .

MIOP RNC includes an interface referred to herein as IuPS data offload gateway IuPS DOGW . IuPS DOGW forwards all signaling and non broken out data traffic from RNC to SGSN via the GTP tunnel. IuPS DOGW includes the breakout mechanism breakout criteria and subscriber registration mechanism shown in and discussed above with reference to . IuPS DOGW may exchange messages with IuB DOGW via the overlay network to perform any needed service in MIOP NodeB or MIOP RNC . For the specific implementation shown in while the IuPS DOGW in MIOP RNC does not include an offload data handler the IuPS DOGW could include an offload data handler and switching application similar to those shown in MIOP NodeB when MIOP RNC also needs to perform breakout of data.

The IuPS DOGW includes an RNC channel handler . The RNC channel handlers in MIOP NodeB and in MIOP RNC monitor data traffic to and from RNC related to a broken out subscriber session and provide a keep alive channel maintenance mechanism.

Specific methods are shown in that illustrate how the specific implementation in could be used. show a method for setting up breakout of data. The UE sends a connection request to the RNC step . The RNC sets up a radio link via NodeB step . The RNC then sets up a network connection with NodeB step . The UE and SGSN then communicate for the attach and authentication procedure step . IuB DOGW detects the leading message in the attach and authentication procedure and registers the subscriber session with IuPS DOGW when preconditions are fulfilled e.g. UE is capable to carry high speed traffic step . During the attach and authentication procedure IuPS DOGW monitors the security context sent from SGSN to RNC step . IuPS DOGW then sends keys to IuB DOGW step . These keys are needed to decipher decrypt the upcoming signaling and uplink user data and to cipher encrypt the downlink user data. UE then requests PDP context activation to SGSN step . In response SGSN sets up a network tunnel to RNC step . IuPS DOGW monitors network tunnel setup from SGSN to RNC and makes a decision breakout YES step . IuPS DOGW sends a message to IuB DOGW indicating breakout YES step . Continuing on SGSN sends an RAB assignment request to UE step . IuPS DOGW detects the RAB assignment request from SGSN to UE and replaces the SGSN transport address with IuPS DOGW transport address step . IuPS DOGW sends a message to MIOP Core indicating breakout YES step . RNC communicates with NodeB and UE to re configure signaling and data radio bearer step . RNC acknowledges to SGSN when RAB assignment is complete step . SGSN accepts PDP context activation by sending a message to UE step . UE and SGSN may then exchange data for the PDP context step .

Referring to a method begins by establishing a PDP context step . Method in include the detailed steps for establishing a PDP context. When breakout YES RAB assignment requests from SGSN to RNC are monitored by IuPS DOGW step . IuPS DOGW modifies any RAB assignment requests from SGSN to RNC to replace the SGSN transport address in the RAB assignment request with the IuPS DOGW transport address step in case of matching breakout criteria during PDP context activation procedure. The switching application on IuB DOGW is configured upon the RAN transport layer setup to identify based on IP addresses and ports the broken out traffic and forwards this traffic to the Offload data handler and forwards non broken out traffic and control system data flows to the RNC step .

Referring to a method begins when NodeB sends data towards RNC step . The switching application in IuB DOGW redirects the broken out traffic to the edge service mechanism step such as edge cache mechanism in . The switching application also forwards non broken out data and signaling data to the RNC step via the original RAN connections. The RNC can still receive data for non broken out traffic from MIOP NodeB when breakout YES step . The RNC then sends non broken out traffic from MIOP NodeB from UE when breakout YES to IuPS DOGW transport address specified in RAB assignment request step .

A simple example is now provided for the specific implementation in to show how data can be cached and delivered by MIOP NodeB . Referring to method represents steps performed in the implementation in for a cache miss. UE sends a data request to NodeB step . NodeB sends the data request to IuB DOGW step . We assume the requested data meets the offload criteria at MIOP NodeB step which means MIOP NodeB has been authorized to perform breakout and has determined this requested data should be broken out. IuB DOGW sends the data request to the edge cache mechanism step . We assume the data is not present in the edge cache mechanism so due to the cache miss the edge cache mechanism sends the data request back to IuB DOGW step . IuB DOGW then forwards the data request to MIOP RNC via the overlay network step . In the worst case the content is not cached on MIOP RNC or MIOP Core MIOP RNC routes the data request to via the overlay network to the MIOP Core which passes the data request up the line to the internet which delivers the requested data to MIOP Core which delivers the requested data via the overlay network to MIOP RNC step . IuPS DOGW then sends the requested data to IuB DOGW step . IuB DOGW then sends the requested data to the edge cache mechanism step . The edge cache mechanism caches the requested data step . The edge cache mechanism sends the requested data to IuB DOGW step . The offload data handler in IuB DOGW sends the requested data to NodeB step . NodeB then sends the requested data to UE step . At this point method is done.

Method in shows the steps performed for a cache hit in the specific implementation in . The UE sends the data request to NodeB step . NodeB sends the data request to IuB DOGW step . The requested data meets the offload criteria at MIOP NodeB step . IuB DOGW sends the data request to the edge cache mechanism step . Due to a cache hit the edge cache mechanism sends the requested data from the cache to IuB DOGW step . The offload data handler in IuB DOGW sends the requested data to NodeB step . Node B then sends the requested data to UE step . Method shows a great advantage in caching data at MIOP NodeB. With data cached at MIOP NodeB the data may be delivered to the user equipment without any backhaul on the core network. The result is reduced network congestion in the core network while improving quality of service to the subscriber.

The methods shown in provide detailed steps for the specific implementation in . Other implementations may have detailed steps that are different than those shown in . These are shown by way of example and are not limiting of the disclosure and claims herein.

The architecture of the MIOP system allows services to be layered or nested. For example the MIOP system could determine to do breakout of high speed channels at MIOP NodeB and to do breakout of low speed channels at MIOP RNC. In another example MIOP NodeB may have a cache MIOP RNC may also have a cache and MIOP Core may also have a cache. If there is a cache miss at MIOP NodeB the cache in MIOP RNC could be checked followed by checking the cache in MIOP Core. Thus decisions can be dynamically made according to varying conditions of what data to cache and where.

To support the MIOP services that are possible with the mobile data network shown in the preferred configuration of MIOP NodeB is a combination of hardware and software. The preferred configuration of MIOP RNC is also a combination of hardware and software. The preferred configuration of MIOP Core is software only and can be run on any suitable hardware in the core network. The preferred configuration of MIOP NMS is software only and can also be run on any suitable hardware in the core network.

In the most preferred implementation the various functions of MIOP NodeB MIOP RNC MIOP Core and MIOP NMS are performed in a manner that is nearly transparent to existing equipment in the mobile data network. Thus the components in prior art mobile data network that are also shown in the mobile data network in have no knowledge of the existence of the various MIOP components with the exception of existing routers that may need to be updated with routing entries corresponding to the MIOP components. The MIOP services are provided by the MIOP components in a way that requires no changes to hardware and only minor changes to software i.e. new router entries in any existing equipment in the mobile data network thereby making the operation of the MIOP components transparent to the existing equipment once the MIOP components are installed and configured. The result is a system for upgrading existing mobile data networks as shown in in a way that does not require extensive hardware or software changes to the existing equipment. The MIOP services herein can thus be performed without requiring significant capital expenditures to replace or reprogram existing equipment.

Referring to one suitable hardware architecture for MIOP NodeB is shown. MIOP NodeB is one specific implementation for MIOP NodeB shown in and . MIOP NodeB is one suitable example of a breakout component that may be incorporated into an existing mobile data network. The specific architecture was developed based on a balance between needed function and cost. The hardware components shown in may be common off the shelf components. They are interconnected and programmed in a way to provided needed function while keeping the cost low by using off the shelf components. The hardware components shown in include a system controller a service processor a security subsystem and a telco breakout subsystem . In one suitable implementation for MIOP NodeB shown in the system controller is an x86 system. The service processor is an IBM Integrated Management Module version 2 IMMv2 . The security subsystem includes an ATMEL processor and a non volatile memory such as a battery backed RAM for holding keys. The telco breakout system performs the breakout functions for MIOP NodeB . In this specific implementation the x86 and IMMv2 are both on a motherboard that includes a Peripheral Component Interconnect Express PCIe slot. A riser card plugged into the PCIe slot on the motherboard includes the security subsystem along with two PCIe slots for the telco breakout system . The telco breakout system may include a telco card and a breakout card that performs breakout as described in detail above with respect to .

One suitable x86 processor that could serve as system controller is the Intel Xeon E3 1220 processor. One suitable service processor is an IBM Renassas SH7757 but other known service processors could be used. One suitable processor for the security subsystem is an ATMEL processor UC3L064 and one suitable non volatile memory for the security subsystem is a DS3645 battery backed RAM from Maxim. One suitable processor for the telco breakout subsystem is the Cavium Octeon II CN63XX.

Various functions of the MIOP NodeB shown in are divided amongst the different components. Referring to the system controller implements an appliance mechanism a platform services mechanism and an edge application serving mechanism . The appliance mechanism provides an interface to MIOP NodeB that hides the underlying hardware and software architecture by providing an interface that allows configuring and using MIOP NodeB without knowing the details of the underlying hardware and software. The platform services mechanism provides messaging support between the components in MIOP NodeB allows managing the configuration of the hardware and software in MIOP NodeB and monitors the health of the components in MIOP NodeB. The edge application serving mechanism allows software applications to run within MIOP NodeB that perform one or more mobile network services at the edge of the mobile data network in response to broken out data received from user equipment or sent to user equipment. In the most preferred implementation the data broken out and operated on by MIOP NodeB is Internet Protocol IP data requests received from the user equipment and IP data sent to the user equipment. The edge application service mechanism may serve both applications provided by the provider of the mobile data network and may also serve third party applications as well. The edge application serving mechanism provides a plurality of mobile network services to user equipment at the edge of the mobile data network in a way that is mostly transparent to existing equipment in the mobile data network.

Referring to the service processor includes a thermal monitor control mechanism a hardware monitor a fail to wire control mechanism a key mechanism a system controller monitor reset mechanism and a display indicator mechanism . The thermal monitor control mechanism monitors temperatures and activates controls to address thermal conditions. For example the thermal monitor monitors temperature within the MIOP NodeB enclosure and activates one or more fans within the enclosure when the temperature exceeds some threshold. In addition the thermal monitor control mechanism may also monitor temperature in the basestation external to the MIOP NodeB enclosure and may control environmental systems that heat and cool the basestation itself external to the MIOP NodeB enclosure. The hardware monitor monitors hardware for errors. Examples of hardware that could be monitored with hardware monitor include CPUs memory power supplies etc. The hardware monitor could monitor any of the hardware within MIOP NodeB .

The fail to wire control mechanism is used to switch a fail to wire switch to a first operational state when MIOP NodeB is fully functional that causes data between the upstream computer system and the downstream computer system to be processed by MIOP NodeB and to a second failed state that causes data to be passed directly between the upstream computer system and the downstream computer system without being processed by MIOP NodeB . The key mechanism provides an interface for accessing the security subsystem . The system controller monitor reset mechanism monitors the state of the system controller and resets the system controller when needed. The display indicator mechanism activates a display and indicators on the front panel of the MIOP NodeB to provide a visual indication of the status of MIOP NodeB.

Referring to the security subsystem includes a key storage that is a non volatile storage for keys such as a battery backed RAM. The security subsystem further includes a key mechanism and a tamper detection mechanism . Key mechanism stores keys to the non volatile key storage and retrieves keys from the non volatile key storage . Any suitable keys could be stored in the key storage . The security subsystem controls access to the keys stored in key storage using key mechanism . The tamper detection mechanism detects physical tampering of MIOP NodeB and performs functions to protect sensitive information within MIOP NodeB when physical tampering is detected. The enclosure for MIOP NodeB includes tamper switches that are triggered if an unauthorized person tries to open the box. In response the tamper detection mechanism may take any suitable action including actions to protect sensitive information such as not allowing MIOP NodeB to boot the next time erasing keys in key storage and actions to sound an alarm that the tampering has occurred.

Referring to the telco breakout system includes a telco card a breakout mechanism and an overlay network mechanism . Telco card is any suitable card for handling network communications in the radio access network. Breakout mechanism is one specific implementation for breakout mechanism shown in . Breakout mechanism performs the breakout functions as described in detail above. The breakout mechanism interrupts the connection between the NodeB and the next upstream component in the radio access network such as the RNC as shown in . Non broken out data from the upstream component is simply passed through MIOP NodeB to the NodeB. Non broken out data from the NodeB is simply passed through MIOP NodeB to the upstream component. Note the path for non broken out data is the traditional path for data in the mobile data network before the MIOP components were added. Broken out data is intercepted by MIOP NodeB and may be appropriate processed at MIOP NodeB or may be routed to an upstream component via a different data path such as to MIOP RNC via the overlay network. The telco breakout system includes an overlay network mechanism that allows MIOP NodeB to communicate via the overlay network. For example MIOP NodeB could use overlay network mechanism to communicate with MIOP RNC or to communicate with other MIOP NodeBs.

The edge application mechanism may provide many different mobile network services. Examples of some of these services are shown in . This specific implementation for edge application mechanism includes an edge caching mechanism a push based service mechanism a third party edge application serving mechanism an analytics mechanism a filtering mechanism a revenue producing service mechanism and a charging mechanism . The edge caching mechanism is one suitable implementation of edge cache mechanism shown in and includes the functions described above with respect to . The push based service mechanism provides support for any suitable push based service whether currently known or developed in the future. Examples of known push based services include without limitation incoming text messages incoming e mail instant messaging peer to peer file transfers etc.

The third party edge application serving mechanism allows running third party applications that provide mobile network services at the edge of the mobile data network. The capability provided by the third party edge application serving mechanism opens up new ways to generate revenue in the mobile data network. The operator of the mobile data network may generate revenue both from third parties that offer edge applications and from subscribers who purchase or use edge applications. Third party applications for user equipment has become a very profitable business. By also providing third party applications that can run at the edge of the mobile data network the experience of the user can be enhanced. For example face recognition software is very compute intensive. If the user were to download an application to the user equipment to perform face recognition in digital photographs the performance of the user equipment could suffer. Instead the user could subscribe to or purchase a third party application that runs at the edge of the mobile data network executed by the third party edge application serving mechanism that performs face recognition. This would allow a subscriber to upload a photo and have the hardware resources in MIOP NodeB perform the face recognition instead of performing the face recognition on the user equipment. We see from this simple example it is possible to perform a large number of different functions at the edge of the mobile data network that were previously performed in the user equipment or upstream in the mobile data network. By providing applications at the edge of the mobile data network the quality of service for subscribers increases.

The analytics mechanism performs analysis of broken out data. The results of the analysis may be used for any suitable purpose or in any suitable way. For example the analytics mechanism could analyze IP traffic on MIOP NodeB and use the results of the analysis to more intelligently cache IP data by edge caching mechanism . In addition the analytics mechanism makes other revenue producing services possible. For example the analytics mechanism could track IP traffic and provide advertisements targeted to user equipment in a particular geographic area served by the basestation. Because data is being broken out at MIOP NodeB the analytics mechanism may perform any suitable analysis on the broken out data for any suitable purpose.

The filtering mechanism allows filtering content delivered to the user equipment by MIOP NodeB. For example the filtering mechanism could block access to adult websites by minors. This could be done for example via an application on the user equipment or via a third party edge application that would inform MIOP NodeB of access restrictions which the filtering mechanism could enforce. The filtering mechanism could also filter data delivered to the user equipment based on preferences specified by the user. For example if the subscriber is an economist and wants news feeds regarding economic issues and does not want to read news stories relating to elections or politics the subscriber could specify to exclude all stories that include the word election or politics in the headline. Of course many other types of filtering could be performed by the filtering mechanism . The filtering mechanism preferably performs any suitable data filtering function or functions whether currently known or developed in the future.

The revenue producing service mechanism provides new opportunities for the provider of the mobile data network to generate revenue based on the various functions MIOP NodeB provides. An example was given above where the analytics mechanism can perform analysis of data broken out by MIOP NodeB and this analysis could be provided by the revenue producing service mechanism to interested parties for a price thereby providing a new way to generate revenue in the mobile data network. Revenue producing service mechanism broadly encompasses any way to generate revenue in the mobile data network based on the specific services provided by any of the MIOP components.

The charging mechanism provides a way for MIOP NodeB to inform the upstream components in the mobile data network when the subscriber accesses data that should incur a charge. Because data may be provided to the subscriber directly by MIOP NodeB without that data flowing through the normal channels in the mobile data network the charging mechanism provides a way for MIOP NodeB to charge the subscriber for services provided by MIOP NodeB of which the core network is not aware. The charging mechanism tracks the activity of the user that should incur a charge then informs a charging application in the core network that is responsible for charging the subscriber of the charges that should be billed.

The hardware architecture of MIOP NodeB shown in allows MIOP NodeB to function in a way that is mostly transparent to existing equipment in the mobile data network. For example if an IP request from user equipment may be satisfied from data held in a cache by edge caching mechanism the data may be delivered directly to the user equipment by MIOP NodeB without traversing the entire mobile data network to reach the Internet to retrieve the needed data. This can greatly improve the quality of service for subscribers by performing so many useful functions at the edge of the mobile data network. The core network will have no idea that MIOP NodeB handled the data request which means the backhaul on the mobile data network is significantly reduced. The MIOP components disclosed herein thus provide a way to significantly improve performance in a mobile data network by adding the MIOP components to an existing mobile data network without affecting most of the functions that already existed in the mobile data network. The MIOP breakout capability provides a way to significantly improve performance though caching and other processing as well as the ability to provide new functions at the edge e.g. face recognition gaming without a requiring any equipment changes on the existing mobile data network.

One specific implementation for the system controller in is shown in . The system controller includes platform services that execute an edge application serving mechanism . The edge application serving mechanism is a mechanism that serves not only edge applications provided by the mobile data network but third party edge applications as well. Thus the edge application serving mechanism in may include all the functionality of the edge application mechanism and third party edge application serving mechanism shown in . The edge application serving mechanism maintains an edge application registry and a set of edge application services . The edge application registry specifies edge applications that have been installed on MIOP NodeB along with meta data describing the access rights types of data filters on data rules of operation for the edge application and other parameters that define upon which broken out data the edge application may operate. The edge application services are a set of services that an edge application may call to provide services to the edge application as illustrated by the arrow in between the edge applications and the edge application services . The edge application services are essentially a library of functions supported by the system controller and hence by MIOP NodeB . Each of the edge applications is preferably run in a suitable virtual machine such as a kernel based virtual machine KVM which is well known in the art. By running each edge application in its own KVM this assures an edge application may not access any unauthorized information in the MIOP NodeB outside the KVM and may not access other edge applications in their own KVMs.

Referring to a method shows steps for the edge application serving mechanism to serve an edge application. The edge application is delivered to a MIOP NodeB step . The edge application serving mechanism in the MIOP NodeB hosts the edge application step . The edge application serving mechanism acts in concert with the breakout mechanism to provide access to broken out contexts to the edge application step . The edge application provides services based on broken out contexts step . Method is then done.

Referring to a method shows one suitable implementation for a portion of step in that involves the operator of the mobile data network receiving the edge application from a vendor. A vendor packages the edge application into a suitable image step . One suitable type of image is a KVM image that will cause the edge application to run in its own kernel based virtual machine KVM . The vendor then sends the edge application to the operator of the mobile data network for deployment at the edge of the mobile data network i.e. in MIOP NodeBs step . Method is then done.

Referring to a method shows one suitable implementation for another portion of step in that involves distributing the edge application to MIOP NodeBs in the mobile data network. The operator of the mobile data network receives the edge application image such as a KVM image from the vendor step . Metadata that specifies breakout data accessible to the edge application is then embedded in the image step . The metadata may include permissions revision target protocol levels references to allowable PDP context information filters or other mechanisms to allow the breakout mechanism to pass only the desired and allowed elements of the broken out stream to the edge application. The metadata could additionally include other suitable information including version information vendor information dependencies the edge application may have versions other edge applications etc. description of what services the edge application provides necessary connections to other systems within the mobile data network etc. For example for a face recognition edge application the metadata in step could specify the edge application has permission to operate on any still image data files such as .jpg .gif .pdf etc. For a video processing edge application the metadata in step could specify the edge application has permission to operate on any video files such as .mov files. The examples above are not limiting. The disclosure and claims herein extend to any information in the metadata that specifies or identifies data or contexts the edge application may process. After embedding the metadata in step the image is encrypted step and digitally signed step . The signed image is then sent to one or more MIOP NodeBs in the mobile data network step .

Referring to method shows steps that are performed by the edge application serving mechanism in once the package shown in is received by a MIOP NodeB step . The digital signature is checked to make sure the image package is valid step . When the image is not valid step NO an error message is sent step . For example the MIOP NodeB could send an error message to MIOP NMS indicating the image it received is invalid. When the image is valid step YES the image is decrypted step . When installation is needed step YES the edge application is installed in the MIOP NodeB step . Installing the edge application in the MIOP NodeB in step includes writing an entry in the edge application registry in for the edge application. When MIOP NodeB boots all applications that have an entry in the edge application registry are examined and every edge application that is enabled e.g. via a flag in the registry will be started. Edge applications are started in accordance with access controls performance temperature concerns location time e.g. some edge applications may only be enabled during morning and afternoon commute others like movie cache may only be on during evening hours. An example of a suitable edge application registry is shown in to include the name of the edge application the location or path for the edge application and permissions for the edge application. In the example in there is an entry that specifies an edge application called Beta has a location defined by path and has permission to operate on digital image files. Entry specifies an edge application called Omega has a location defined by path and has permission to operate on video files. These entries are shown by way of example. The edge application registry may include any suitable information pertaining to the edge application that may be needed for the edge application serving mechanism to serve the edge application on MIOP NodeB. Note the permissions in the edge application registry are preferably derived from the metadata see in that was sent in the package that included the edge application.

Referring back to installation of the edge application is needed step YES when the edge application has not yet been installed on the MIOP NodeB which means the MIOP NodeB does not have an entry in its edge application registry for the edge application. Installation is not needed step NO when the edge application is an update to an edge application that was previously installed. In that case the edge application is updated step . Note that updating the edge application in step could include updating permissions for the edge application in the edge application registry. Thus if an edge application has an update that expands its capability to a new file type the new permission information will be written to the permissions portion of the entry in the edge application registry that corresponds to that edge application. Once the edge application is installed in step or updated in step the edge application is started step . Method is then done.

Method shown in is one suitable implementation for step in of starting the edge application. First the edge application is looked up in the edge application registry step . Then a check is made to make sure the edge application image is still valid step . This could include for example a re check of the digital signature and could also include other checks such as checking to see if there is an update available for that edge application. If an update is available the update could be retrieved using method in . Yet another check would be to compute a checksum on the edge application and send the checksum to MIOP NMS to verify the checksum is correct. Note the check in step is optional depending on the level of security needed. When the image is not valid step NO an error message is sent step and method is done. For example MIOP NodeB could send a message in step to MIOP NMS indicating the edge application image package is not valid. When the image is valid step YES a kernel based virtual machine KVM is instantiated for the edge application step . Resources are allocated to the KVM step and the edge application is then run in the KVM step .

Referring to a method could be implemented as part of hosting the edge application in step in . The edge application is started step preferably using method in . The performance of the edge application is monitored during runtime step . If there is no problem with the edge application step NO method loops back to step and continues. When there is a problem with the edge application step YES action is taken to resolve the problem step . Many different actions could be taken within the scope of step . For example the edge application could be stopped and re started. Additional resources could be allocated to the KVM for the application. Any suitable action that may help resolve a problem may be performed in step . When the action taken in step resolves the problem step YES method loops back to step and continues. When the action taken in step does not fix the problem step NO the edge application is shut down step and the problem is reported step . In step the problem could be reported to a problem log in MIOP NodeB or could be reported to an entity in the mobile data network such as MIOP NMS. Method is then done.

Referring to a method is one suitable implementation of step in that provides access to broken out contexts to the edge application. A path is defined between the breakout system and the edge application step . For example a virtual local area network VLAN can be defined that allows the two to communicate. The edge application is notified of the defined path step . The breakout subsystem is notified of the defined path and the permissions for the edge application step . The edge application and breakout subsystem send one or more test messages to verify communications on the defined path step . When the two are not able to communicate on the defined path step NO an error message is sent step such as MIOP NodeB sending an error message to MIOP NMS. When the two can successfully communicate on the defined path step YES the successful communication is logged step and the edge application and breakout system then communicate directly for the edge application to provide services to broken out data or contexts step . Method is then done.

A more detailed example of providing access to broken out contexts to the edge application in step and the edge application performing one or more services in step in is shown in method in . Method is one suitable implementation for step in . We assume for this example the edge application metadata specifies a data filter and an API hook step . The data filter is executable code that filters broken out data according to the edge application permissions step so only data that satisfies the data filter is available to send to the edge application. The breakout subsystem then calls the API hook to transfer the filtered data to the edge application step . The edge application then performs one or more services based on the filtered data step . Method is then done. Of course many other implementations of steps and in are within the scope of the disclosure and claims herein.

Referring to a method shows one specific implementation for step in to shut down the edge application. The edge application is notified to stop processing broken out contexts step . The edge application is de registered from serving broken out contexts step . De registering the edge application could mean simply setting a bit in the edge application registry that suspends the edge application from executing or that suspends the edge application from operating on any broken out data. De registering the edge application could also mean deleting the entry in the edge application registry e.g. in that corresponds to the edge application. Wait a predetermined period of time for the edge application to gracefully shut down step . Obviously the predetermined period of time will depend on how long the edge application should take to gracefully shut down. If the edge application gracefully shuts down within the predetermined time period step N the resources used by the KVM for the edge application are then reclaimed step and method is done. If the edge application does not gracefully shut down within the predetermined time period step YES the edge application is forcefully shut down step the MIOP NMS is notified of the forceful shutdown step and the resources used by the KVM for the edge application are reclaimed step . Method is then done.

As stated above with reference to the edge application serving mechanism includes edge application services which is a library of predefined functions that may be invoked by edge applications. Because each edge application runs in a restricted environment virtual machine the edge application will not have access to anything outside the edge application except for those functions included in the edge application services . Examples of suitable edge application services shown in are shown in more detail in . A simple network management protocol SNMP service could be used for the edge application to raise fault management issues as traps to the edge application serving mechanism. These traps could be ignored logged modified and sent to MIOP NMS or sent unmodified to MIOP NMS. A network time protocol NTP service may be used to keep the clock in the KVM synchronized. For example using the NTP service the edge application could synchronize its clock with the clock on the system controller or with a clock in on an NTP server deeper in the mobile data network. A command line interface CLI service could provide access to the CLI interface on MIOP NodeB which would allow the edge application to access the CLI for various operations. The CLI could be accessible for example via a secure shell SSH interface.

A collector service allows gathering audit and diagnostic data from the edge application. For example the edge application may be informed via the collector service to make certain data or logs available to collect the logged data via secure copy SCP or to send the logs or other data to MIOP NMS for processing. A performance service allows gathering key performance indicators KPIs from the edge applications according to metadata which may contain information about metrics to gather and could also specify names memory locations file names or other things of interest for logging and data gathering. The performance service could use the collector service to gather performance data from the edge application and to send the performance data to MIOP NMS for further processing. The health overload service provides health and overload monitoring of edge applications. For example the health overload service could include commands to query the edge application for health and overload information. The health overload service could also provide a dedicated process in the edge application that monitors and reports health and overload information. The configuration services allows downloading the edge application configuration from MIOP NMS and allows saving or restoring edge application configuration. Thus configuration for an edge application could be transferred from MIOP NMS to MIOP NodeB then from MIOP NodeB to the edge application via secure copy SCP . The external communication service allows edge applications to communicate with one or more other systems in the mobile data network. The details of the connection to the other system may be specified in the image metadata or as part of a stored configuration for the edge application received from MIOP NMS. One example where communication with another system is needed is when the edge application is a caching edge application that caches data locally on the MIOP NodeB but may also choose to cache data deeper in the mobile data network such as on MIOP RNC. The external communication services would be used by the caching edge application to communicate with a cache agent on MIOP RNC.

The edge applications referred to in may include edge application developed and deployed by the operator of the mobile data network and may also include third party applications as well. Providing the capability of running third party applications at the edge of a mobile data network opens up a whole new potential source of revenue for the network operator. One can readily see from the popularity of apps for mobile phones and tablet computers that the ability to host third party apps at the edge of the mobile data network gives another source of revenue for both application providers and for the operator of the mobile data network as well.

The mobile data network disclosed herein includes MIOP components that provide a variety of different services that are not possible in prior art mobile data network . In the most preferred implementation the MIOP components do not affect voice traffic in the mobile data network. In addition to performing optimizations that will enhance performance in the form of improved download speeds lower latency for access or improved quality of experience in viewing multimedia on the mobile data network the MIOP architecture also provides additional capabilities that may produce new revenue generating activities for the carrier. For example analytics may be performed on subscriber sessions that allow targeting specific subscribers with additional services from the carrier to generate additional revenue. For example subscribers congregating for a live music event may be sent promotions on paid for media related to that event. In another example subscribers getting off a train may be sent a coupon promoting a particular shuttle company as they walk up the platform towards the street curb. Also premium web content in the form of video or other multimedia may be served from local storage and the subscriber would pay for the additional content and quality of service.

While the mobile data network in and discussed herein is in the context of a 3G mobile data network the disclosure and claims herein expressly extend to other networks as well including Long Term Evolution LTE networks flat RAN networks and code division multiple access CDMA networks.
