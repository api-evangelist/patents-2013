title: Index channel technology
abstract: Index channel technology, in which input to display an index channel is received from a user identity and an index channel definition for the user identity is accessed. The index channel definition defines a sequence of content preview files for content files organized within channels. Display of the index channel is controlled by displaying the content preview files in the sequence defined by the accessed index channel definition and, during display of the content preview files in the sequence defined by the accessed index channel definition, a selection is received to view a content file that corresponds to a content preview file being displayed in accordance with the accessed index channel definition. Display of the content file is controlled and display of the index channel is returned at a position within the sequence of content preview files that corresponds to the received selection.

Content viewers today are exposed to an overwhelming amount of information and are challenged by the degree of interaction and personalization needed to manage this massive amount of information. In an era of digital communications a user may be confused by an array of technology including traditional analog televisions DVRs Digital Video Recorders PVRs Personal Video Recorders media centers EPG Electronic Program Guide based systems Internet related content and traditional remote control devices.

In one aspect a method of providing an index channel within a content delivery network includes receiving from a user identity input to display an index channel associated with a content delivery network and based on the input to display the index channel associated with the content delivery network accessing an index channel definition for the user identity. The index channel definition defines a sequence of content preview files for content files organized within channels available through the content delivery network. The method also includes based on the accessed index channel definition controlling display of the index channel by displaying the content preview files in the sequence defined by the accessed index channel definition and during display of the content preview files in the sequence defined by the accessed index channel definition receiving a selection to view a content file that corresponds to a content preview file being displayed in accordance with the accessed index channel definition. The method further includes based on the received selection to view the content file that corresponds to the content preview file being displayed in accordance with the accessed index channel definition controlling display of the selected content file and returning to display of the index channel at a position within the sequence of content preview files defined by the accessed index channel definition that corresponds to the received selection.

Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example the method may include accessing a generic index channel definition that is used for all users of the content delivery network. In addition the method may include after completion of a first content preview file in the sequence defined by the accessed index channel definition controlling display of an interface element that enables the user identity to provide input to view a first content file that corresponds to the first content preview file and for a predefined period of time after completion of the first content preview file monitoring for input to view the first content file that corresponds to the first content preview file. The method also may include based on the monitoring determining that input to view the first content file that corresponds to the first content preview file was not received within the predefined period of time and based on the determination that input to view the first content file that corresponds to the first content preview file was not received within the predefined period of time identifying a second content preview file that follows the first content preview file in the sequence defined by the accessed index channel definition removing display of the interface element that enables the user identity to provide input to view the first content file that corresponds to the first content preview file and controlling display of the identified second content preview file.

In addition the method may include during display of the selected content file receiving input to return to the index channel and based on the input to return to the index channel returning to display of the index channel at the position within the sequence of content preview files defined by the accessed index channel definition that corresponds to the received selection. The method further may include detecting completion of the selected content file and based on the completion of the selected content file returning to display of the index channel at the position within the sequence of content preview files defined by the accessed index channel definition that corresponds to the received selection.

In some implementations the method may include detecting completion of the selected content file and based on the completion of the selected content file identifying a next content file organized in a channel with the selected content file and controlling display of the next content file. In these implementations the method may include during display of the next content file receiving input to return to the index channel and based on the input to return to the index channel returning to display of the index channel at the position within the sequence of content preview files defined by the accessed index channel definition that corresponds to the received selection.

In some examples the method may include based on the received selection to view the content file that corresponds to the content preview file being displayed in accordance with the accessed index channel definition storing in electronic storage a position within the sequence of content preview files defined by the accessed index channel definition at a time of the selection. In these examples the method may include accessing from electronic storage the stored position within the sequence of content preview files defined by the accessed index channel definition at the time of the selection and using the stored position within the sequence of content preview files defined by the accessed index channel definition at the time of the selection to return to the position within the sequence of content preview files defined by the accessed index channel definition that corresponds to the received selection.

In some implementations the position within the index channel may be encapsulated in a location address of the selected content file. In these implementations the method may include identifying the position within the index channel encapsulated in the location address of the selected content file and using the identified position to return to the position within the sequence of content preview files defined by the accessed index channel definition that corresponds to the received selection.

Also the method may include identifying a next content preview file that follows the selected content preview file in the sequence of content preview files defined by the accessed index channel definition and returning to display of the index channel by displaying the next content preview file. Further the method may include determining a position within the index channel based on the received selection and content files displayed subsequent to the received selection. The determined position may correspond to a next unviewed content preview file that represents the content preview file in the sequence that most closely follows the selected content preview file and does not correspond to any of the content files displayed subsequent to the received selection. The method may include returning to display of the index channel by displaying the next unviewed content preview file.

The method may include accessing an index channel definition defined by an operator of the content delivery network. The method also may include accessing an index channel definition defined by a content curator associated with multiple channels within the content delivery network. The index channel definition may represent an index channel for the multiple channels within the content delivery network defined by the content curator.

In some examples the method may include accessing an index channel definition related to sets of channels within the content delivery network. In these examples the method may include displaying content preview files from different sets of channels within the content delivery network such that a first content preview file associated with a first set of channels is immediately followed by a second content preview file associated with a second set of channels that is different than the first set of channels.

In some implementations the method may include accessing an index channel definition related to multiple channels within the content delivery network. In these implementations the method may include displaying content preview files from different channels within the content delivery network such that a first content preview file associated with a first channel is immediately followed by a second content preview file associated with a second channel that is different than the first channel.

In addition the method may include accessing an index channel definition related to a single channel within the content delivery network. The method may include displaying content preview files from the single channel within the content delivery network such that only content preview files that correspond to content files organized in the single channel are displayed.

In some examples the method may include identifying one or more attributes of the user identity accessing one or more rules related to defining index channels analyzing the one or more rules related to defining index channels with respect to the one or more attributes of the user identity and determining the index channel definition based on the analysis. In these examples the method may include determining which content preview files to include in the index channel and determining a sequence for displaying the determined content preview files in the index channel. Further in these examples the method may include identifying subscriptions the user identity has made for channels in the content delivery network and identifying a market within which the user identity is located analyzing the one or more rules related to defining index channels with respect to the identified subscriptions and the identified market and determining the index channel definition based on the identified subscriptions and the identified market.

The method may include receiving from a remote control device operated by the user identity one or more commands selecting to view the content file that corresponds to the content preview file being displayed in accordance with the accessed index channel definition. The method also may include receiving from a remote control device operated by the user identity one or more commands selecting to return to the index channel and based on the one or more commands selecting to return to the index channel returning to display of the index channel at the position within the sequence of content preview files defined by the accessed index channel definition that corresponds to the received selection. The method further may include receiving from a remote control device operated by the user identity one or more commands navigating through the index channel and based on the one or more commands navigating through the index channel updating display of the index channel in accordance with the navigation through the index channel.

In some implementations the index channel may be a first index channel the index channel definition may be a first index channel definition and the sequence of the content preview files may be a first sequence of first content preview files. In these implementations the method may include receiving from the first index channel a selection to view a second index channel that is different than the first index channel and that is nested within the first index channel and based on the selection to view the second index channel accessing a second index channel definition. The second index channel definition may define a second sequence of second content preview files for content files organized within channels available through the content delivery network. Also in these implementations the method may include during display of the second content preview files in the second sequence defined by the second index channel definition receiving a selection to view a second content file that corresponds to a second content preview file being displayed in accordance with the second index channel definition and based on the received selection to view the second content file that corresponds to the second content preview file being displayed in accordance with the second index channel definition controlling display of the second content file. Further in these implementations the method may include returning from the second content file to display of the second index channel at a position within the second sequence of second content preview files defined by the second index channel definition that corresponds to the selection to view the second content file and returning from the second index channel to display of the first index channel at a position within the first index channel that corresponds to the selection to view the second index channel.

In addition the index channel may include at least two levels of additional index channels nested within the index channel. The method may include navigating through the at least two levels of additional index channels nested within the index channel by stepping through consecutive levels of the at least two additional index channels nested within the index channel and then returning to the index channel by stepping through the consecutive levels of the at least two additional index channels in a reverse order.

In some examples the method may include controlling display of the index channel on a television that is controlled by a remote control device and receiving from the remote control device the selection to view the content file. In these examples the method may include controlling display of the selected content file on the television receiving from the remote control device a command to return to display of the index channel and based on the command to return to display of the index channel returning to display on the television of the index channel at the position within the sequence of content preview files defined by the accessed index channel definition that corresponds to the received selection.

In some implementations the method may include controlling display of the index channel on a mobile device that is controlled by a touch screen interface and receiving first input applied to the touch screen interface to select the content file. In these implementations the method may include controlling display of the selected content file on the mobile device receiving second input applied to the touch screen interface to return to display of the index channel and based on the second input applied to the touch screen interface to return to display of the index channel returning to display on the mobile device of the index channel at the position within the sequence of content preview files defined by the accessed index channel definition that corresponds to the received selection.

In some examples the method may include controlling display of the index channel on a computer that is controlled by a mouse and keyboard and receiving from at least one of the mouse and keyboard the selection to view the content file. In these examples the method may include controlling display of the selected content file on the computer receiving from at least one of the mouse and keyboard a command to return to display of the index channel and based on the command to return to display of the index channel returning to display on the computer of the index channel at the position within the sequence of content preview files defined by the accessed index channel definition that corresponds to the received selection.

In another aspect a system includes at least one computer and at least one computer readable medium coupled to the at least one computer having instructions stored thereon which when executed by the at least one computer causes the at least one computer to perform operations. The operations include receiving from a user identity input to display an index channel associated with a content delivery network and based on the input to display the index channel associated with the content delivery network accessing an index channel definition for the user identity. The index channel definition defines a sequence of content preview files for content files organized within channels available through the content delivery network. The operations also include based on the accessed index channel definition controlling display of the index channel by displaying the content preview files in the sequence defined by the accessed index channel definition and during display of the content preview files in the sequence defined by the accessed index channel definition receiving a selection to view a content file that corresponds to a content preview file being displayed in accordance with the accessed index channel definition. The operations further include based on the received selection to view the content file that corresponds to the content preview file being displayed in accordance with the accessed index channel definition controlling display of the selected content file and returning to display of the index channel at a position within the sequence of content preview files defined by the accessed index channel definition that corresponds to the received selection.

In yet another aspect at least one computer readable storage medium is encoded with at least one computer program comprising instructions that when executed operate to cause a computer to perform operations. The operations include receiving from a user identity input to display an index channel associated with a content delivery network and based on the input to display the index channel associated with the content delivery network accessing an index channel definition for the user identity.

The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other potential features and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

Multiple types of content such as audio e.g. music podcasts video and still images e.g. photographs may be made available over the content delivery network . Licensed and license free content may be made available. For example licensed content may be acquired from a content owner .

Content may be made available from a variety of sources. For example Internet content may be accessed from an Internet link e.g. URL Uniform Resource Locator . Content may also be accessed from peer to peer networks. For example content may be accessed from one or more BitTorrent clients which are part of one or more BitTorrent swarms . Content may be accessed from other sources such as from a television broadcast e.g. MSO Multiple System Operator cable satellite local or from content e.g. photographs audio previously recorded video available from devices e.g. DVR stereo computer DVD Digital Video Disc player connected to a user s home network and or located in a user s home.

Content curators may use a content curator portal to define custom channels which may be made available for subscription by end users . The content curators may be commissioned to search for select and organize multiple types of content from various sources into channels. Content curators may for example organize channels by topic or genre. Content curators may for example select licensed content license free content content available over the Internet or content from their private collection to name a few examples.

Channels may be offered for free to end users or end users may subscribe to channels on a fee basis. Users may rate or rank channels or content curators based for example on programming selection sequencing and quality. Content curators may be promoted for example based on popularity.

Content owners may be compensated for the use of licensed content that they own which is used in channels defined by content curators . For example the system may provide support for digital rights management DRM . By allowing access to their licensed content content owners may experience increased distribution and revenue and targeted exposure in focused channels. Multiple revenue agreements may be possible such as per use agreements subscription revenue sharing and advertisement revenue sharing.

A content curator may work with one or more advertisers such as an ad agency to include advertisements on a channel. For example an advertisement may be displayed if a user switches a channel or when a program finishes. As another example advertisements may be displayed on the display of a remote control device such as while a program is being displayed on a television. Content curators advertisers and content owners may share advertising revenue. Sharing in advertising revenue may provide an incentive for content curators to create interesting and popular channels. A content curator may work with one or more advertisers to create one or more advertisements which are customized and targeted for one or more particular channels. End users may customize advertisement viewing preferences such as by specifying preferred topics preferred or excluded companies region preferences etc.

Advertisers may use an advertiser portal to upload advertisements and to control advertisement publication. Advertisers may define and apply advertisement insertion rules to particular advertisements and or may allow a content curator to decide when and how to insert the advertisements into channels defined by the content curator . APIs Application Programming Interfaces may be provided which allow advertisers to enable the system to interface with standard advertisement inventory management systems to allow for control and management of advertisements . Various advertisement pricing plans may be supported such as individually priced ads or bulk pricing. Other advertising features may be included such as online purchasing of items or providing customer contact options.

Advertisers content curators and content owners may access user viewing behavior data. Advertisers may access user viewing behavior data such as viewed channels viewed content viewed advertisements advertisement display frequency advertisement viewed length user actions during advertisement display user characteristics advertisement and content view times advertisement and content view counts and hosting channel information to monitor reach and performance of advertising campaigns. Advertisements may be targeted to specific users based on recorded user viewing behavior data. Content curators may access user viewing behavior data to learn about behaviors of end users who subscribe to their channels. Content owners may access user viewing behavior data to learn about their fan base such as accessing information about user demographics time of day of access and user actions during content display. Content presentation and playback may be customized and personalized for a particular end user based specifically on recorded user viewing behavior of the particular end user and generally on recorded user viewing behavior of all users.

User viewing behavior data may be captured for example by a media player and or an access device . The media player and or the access device may play content included or ordered on a channel defined by a content curator . In some implementations the media player may play content accessed e.g. streamed or downloaded from the content delivery network by the access device . In some implementations the media player and the access device are different logical functions of the same physical device. In other implementations the media player and the access device are different physical devices. In some implementations the media player is a software application which may be executed for example on a computing device such as a desktop or laptop computer.

In some examples the media player and or the access device may be a dongle that plugs in to an input of a display device such as a television a computer etc. In these examples the dongle may be a High Definition Multimedia Interface HDMI dongle that includes an HDMI connector that plugs into an HDMI port of a television. The HDMI dongle may have a relatively small size and weight such that the HDMI port of the television supports the weight of the HDMI dongle and the HDMI dongle does not significantly diminish the aesthetic appearance of the television. In addition in these examples the dongle may include a network interface that enables the dongle to access a network through which content is accessible. For instance the dongle may include Wi Fi capability that allows the dongle to wirelessly connect to a network that enables access to content available on the Internet. Accordingly the dongle may be configured to wirelessly stream content from the Internet using the Wi Fi capability convert the streamed content into a format needed for an HDMI input port of a television and output the converted content using an HDMI output port of the dongle. The dongle may operate a mobile device based operating system e.g. the Android operating system and the operations performed by the dongle may be performed software e.g. one or more applications executed by the mobile device based operating system. The dongle may be controlled by a remote control device. The commands from the remote control device may be received by the dongle through the network interface e.g. from a server in the cloud . Alternatively the dongle may have an infrared IR or radio frequency RF interface and may receive commands directly from an IR or RF based remote control.

The media player and or the access device may be connected to external media storage devices respectively. The external media storage devices may be for example USB Universal Serial Bus drives. The external media storage devices may be used for example to transfer data to from the media player or the access device respectively such as to transfer data to from a computing device.

The media player and or the access device may communicate wirelessly with one or more remote control devices . The end user may navigate through channels and perform other functions using the remote control device . The remote control device may communicate e.g. using Infrared IR technology of radio frequency RF technology with the television the media player and or the access device . The remote control device also may communicate over a network with the media player and or the access device to control functions of the media player or the access device . The remote control device may include a small display screen that displays preview content and or advertisements.

The media player and or the access device may access content from the content delivery network without consuming resources of a computing device owned by the end user . For example content may be streamed or downloaded into the home of an end user without using resources of a personal computer owned by the end user . The media player and the access device may use less electricity than a personal computer thus reducing the electric bill of the end user . The media player and or the access device may connect to other computing devices connected on a user s home network. The media player and or the access device may include built in functionality to communicate with and download information from a peer to peer network such as the BitTorrent swarm .

The end user may search for and subscribe to content using an end user content search portal . For example the end user content search portal may provide a directory listing of available defined channels. The directory listing may be organized in a hierarchy of categories and sub categories. A particular channel may appear in one or more categories or sub categories. The end user content search portal may also provide a search function to allow end users to search for available defined channels based on a keyword search. As another example users may search for channels based on other criteria such as sorting channels based on channel or content curator popularity or ranking. An end user may subscribe to a defined channel for example by selecting a channel link displayed in a directory listing or in a list of search results.

The end user may also search for and initiate access to individual content items by the access device using a partner site that operates a search engine . As another example the end user may send an email which includes a content link to an email address associated with their access device to initiate automatic access by the access device to the content linked to by the content link. The content link may refer to a content file available on the Internet and may be a reference to a video resource available from a streaming video website. The end user may send an email with an attachment to an email address associated with the access device to initiate access by the access device to the attachment. The end user may use an end user content portal to search for and to select content to cause the access device to access.

The content and directory database stores information about content and also information about defined channels. Content curators may use a content curator portal to define channels and to manage defined channels. The content curator portal may display a listing of licensed and license free content available in the content and directory database . The content curator portal may also provide a search function which allows the content curator to search for content available in the content and directory database and to also search for content available on the Internet such as content available from peer to peer networks such as BitTorrent and content available from streaming video sites.

The content curator portal may communicate with a content curator server . For example a channel definition defined using the content curator portal may be sent to the content curator server which may communicate with the server system to request that the channel definition be stored in the content and directory database . As another example information for existing channel definitions associated with a particular content curator may be retrieved from the content and directory database and sent from the content curator portal server to the content curator portal for display.

In some implementations the content curator portal server is one physical server computing device and in other implementations the content curator portal server includes multiple physical server computing devices. Similarly in some implementations the server system is one physical server computing device and in other implantations the server system includes multiple physical server computing devices. In some implementations multiple physical server computing devices are used with some or all server computing devices implementing both the content curator portal server and the server system . In some implementations one physical server computing device is used with the one physical server device implementing both the content curator portal server and the server system .

The network may be one or more public or private wired or wireless networks such as the Internet or may be a Session Initiated Protocol SIP network such as the PsipTN network offered by TelTel . The network may include for example one or more of the Internet Wide Area Networks WANs Local Area Networks LANs analog or digital wired and wireless telephone networks e.g. a PSTN Integrated Services Digital Network ISDN and Digital Subscriber Line xDSL radio television cable satellite and or any other delivery or tunneling mechanism for carrying data services. The network may include multiple networks or subnetworks each of which may include for example a wired or wireless data pathway.

Content may be accessed by one or more user media player access devices . For example content corresponding to a user subscribed channel may be automatically streamed or downloaded to the media player access device in response to a user selection of a corresponding channel. As another example a user may search for and select content for the media player access device . A user may using a remote user device monitor and manage user initiated content requests. The remote user device may be any type of electronic device configured to exchange communications with the server system over a network. The remote user device may be a general purpose computer e.g. a desktop personal computer a workstation or a laptop computer a mobile or wireless device or a device designed for a specific function e.g. a cell phone a smart phone a tablet PC a personal digital assistant PDA etc. .

The system receives from a content curator input defining multiple content links to include in a channel associated with the content curator with each content link including an address at which content is made available over a network . For example a content curator may search for and select multiple content links using a content curator portal. The content curator portal may display a listing of content available in a content and directory database. The content curator portal may also provide a search function which allows the content curator to search for content available in the content and directory database and to also search for publicly available content such as content available on the Internet. The content curator may select content links which link to various types of content such as Internet video podcasts BitTorrent content other peer to peer content licensed and license free content music etc. For BitTorrent content the content link may refer to a BitTorrent torrent file. For other content the content link may be a URL. When selecting content links for a channel the content curator may select links that have a characteristic in common such as links relating to the same genre.

The system determines supplemental channel information that facilitates user experience of content linked to by at least one of the multiple content links . Supplemental channel information may include for example one or more hot indices one or more content preview files metadata or content order information. A hot index points or refers to a position of interest within a content file. Supplemental channel information is described in more detail below with respect to .

The system determines one or more hot indices for at least one of the multiple content links included in the channel associated with the content curator . Hot indices are described in more detail below with respect to .

The system enables a content curator to review content linked to by a content link . For example the content curator may review content using a media player application which is capable of playing multiple types of content e.g. various types of video content music content . The media player application may be part of or may be accessed through a content curator portal. The content curator may use the media player application to play the content linked to by the content link as well as to stop fast forward rewind and restart the content. The content may be viewed online e.g. in a streaming format or some or all of the content may be downloaded before viewing by the content curator. Some content may be retrieved from a content and directory database prior to being viewed.

The system receives from the content curator selection of one or more hot indices to define in the content linked to by the content link where each of the one or more hot indices points to a different position within the content linked to by the content link . For example the content curator may play the content linked to by the content link in a media player application and may define a hot index in the content by pausing the content playback when a particular point of interest within the content is reached. While the playback is paused the content curator may for example select a define hot index control of the media player application e.g. button menu to define a hot index at the current e.g. paused position within the content. The content curator may restart playback of the content in the media player application and may define additional hot indices by repeating for each additional hot index a pausing of the playback at a point of interest within the content and a selecting of the define hot index control.

The system stores in association with the content link and for each of the one or more hot indices timing data that indicates the position within the content pointed to by the corresponding hot index . For example timing data for a hot index can include hour minute and second values which collectively indicate the position within the content associated with the hot index. Timing data can include for example values such as 1 02 00 indicating hour one minute two second zero 02 12 30 indicating hour two minute twelve second thirty and 00 05 11 indicating hour zero minute five second eleven . Timing data for each hot index associated with a content link may be stored in association with the content link in a database such as in a content and directory database.

The system monitors users viewing behavior when viewing content linked to by a content link . For example the system may monitor users fast forwarding rewinding stopping playing and other behaviors when viewing content linked to by a particular content link. For example the system may track where in the content a user stops after fast forwarding or may track where in the content a user stops after rewinding. As another example the system may track whether particular portions of content are played e.g. watched multiple times and may track the start and end positions of those content portions that are watched multiple times.

Based on the monitoring the system collects viewing behavior analytics data for the content linked to by the content link . For example based on the monitoring the system may collect fast forwarding rewinding playing and other behavior data for the content linked to by the particular content link where the fast forwarding rewinding and playing behavior data includes data indicating portions of the content where users tend to fast forward the content portions of the content where users tend to rewind the content and portions of the content where users tend to play the content. Portions of content may be indicated for example by a portion start time and a portion end time. Viewing behavior analytics data may be stored in association with the content link. That is data may be stored so that viewing behavior analytics data collected for all users for a particular content link may be retrieved.

The system automatically creates one or more hot indices for the content linked to by the content link based on the viewing behavior analytics data where each of the one or more hot indices points to a different position within the content linked to by the content link . For example the system may automatically create without human intervention one or more hot indices for the content linked to by the particular content link based on the fast forwarding rewinding and playing behavior data. As a particular example a hot index may be created to identify a position within the content where users transition from fast forwarding or rewinding the content to playing the content. For example a hot index may be associated with a position in the content which corresponds to the end of a commercial or to a particularly interesting point within the content such as a sports highlight or a highly interesting scene in a movie.

Hot indices may be created at a particular position for a content link if a certain threshold is reached. For example if viewing behavior analytics data indicate that at least a certain number of users e.g. one thousand or at least a certain percentage of users e.g. five percent stop playback of content linked to by a content link at a particular position then a hot index corresponding to that position might be created. Conversely if less than a certain number or certain percentage of users stop playback of content at a particular position then a hot index corresponding to that position might not be automatically created.

The system stores in association with the content link and for each of the one or more automatically created hot indices timing data that indicates the position within the content pointed to by the corresponding hot index . For example timing data for a hot index can include hour minute and second values which collectively indicate a position within the content associated with the hot index. Timing data for each hot index associated with a content link may be stored in association with the content link in a database such as in a content and directory database.

Returning to the system determines a content preview file to associate with at least one of the multiple content links included in the channel associated with the content curator . A content preview file may be for example a subset of the content file linked to a content link e.g. the first thirty seconds of the content file or the content preview file may be a different file having different content than the content file linked to by the content link. As another example a content preview file may be an image file. Content preview files are discussed in more detail below with respect to .

The system enables a content curator to review content linked to by a content link . For example the content curator may review content using a media player application which is capable of playing multiple types of content e.g. various types of video content music content . The media player application may be part of or may be accessed through a content curator portal. The content curator may use the media player application to play the content linked to by the content link as well as to stop fast forward rewind and restart the content. The content may be viewed online e.g. in a streaming format or some or all of the content may be downloaded before viewing by the content curator. Some content may be retrieved from a content and directory database prior to being viewed.

The system receives from the content curator selection of a subset of the content linked to by the content link . For example the content curator may play e.g. watch the content in a media player application and may define a subset of the content by selecting begin time and end time values which indicate the start and end respectively of the content subset. For example the content curator may watch the content and may stop or pause the content playback when the desired start time of the content subset is reached. The content curator may for example indicate that the position within the content at which the playback was paused is the start time of the content subset by selecting a define start time control e.g. menu button of the media player application. The content curator may fast forward and or resume playback of the content and may pause the content again when the desired end time of the content subset is reached. The content curator may for example indicate that the position within the content at which the playback is paused is the end time of the content subset by selecting a define end time control e.g. button menu of the media player application.

The system generates a content preview file for the content linked to by the content link using the selected subset of the content . For example a new content file may be created by copying a subset of a content file linked to by the content link to a newly created content file. The content curator may create a new content file based on a content subset by using a media player application or another application.

The system stores in association with the content link the generated content preview file . For example the content preview file may be stored as a BLOB data type in a database system or the content preview file may be stored in a folder on the hard drive of a server with a path to the content preview file stored in a database .

In response to input adding a content link to a channel associated with a content curator the system automatically searches for a content preview file corresponding to content linked to by the content link . For instance the system may automatically search for a content preview file in response to the content curator adding a content link to a channel using a content curator portal. As one example for movie content the system may automatically search for movie trailers or recorded movie reviews or interviews corresponding to the movie such as by searching using the title of the movie. If a content preview file associated with the movie content is found e.g. found on the Internet based on a movie title search the content preview file may be downloaded and may be associated with the movie content as a preview content file for the movie content file. As another example for music content the system may automatically search for music sample files or recorded interviews corresponding to the music content.

Based on results of the search the system determines whether a previously generated content preview file exists for the content linked to by the content link . For example the system may determine whether a movie trailer file a music sample file or another type of previously generated content preview file exists for the content.

In response to a determination that a previously generated content preview file exists for the content linked to by the content link the system automatically stores in association with the content link the previously generated content preview file . For example the content preview file may be accessed from a remote server and a copy of the content preview file may be requested and copied to the server system . The copy of the content preview file may be stored as a BLOB data type in a database or the copy of the content preview file may be stored in a file system folder of the server system . As another example a link to the content preview file may be stored in a database e.g. the content preview file itself might not be copied to the server system but may be accessible through a stored link which points at the location of the content preview file on the remote server .

In response to a determination that a previously generated content preview file does not exist for the content linked to by the content link the system prompts the content curator to define a content preview file and or generate a default content preview file . For example the content curator may browse for and select a content preview file stored on a local or remote computing device e.g. the content curator may select a preview content file which was not automatically located in reference to step above . As another example the content curator may input a link e.g. URL to a content preview file available on the Internet. The link may be for example a link to streaming content or a link to a content file.

The content curator may generate a content preview file for the content linked to by the content link. For example the content curator may generate a content preview file by specifying a subset of the content linked to by the content link. For example the content curator may watch e.g. play the content in a media player application and may specify a content subset by specifying start and end times within the content. For example the content curator may watch the content file in the media player application and may pause or stop the content at the desired start time select a control to indicate that the paused time is the subset start time resume playback of the content watch and or fast forward the content until the desired subset end time is reached pause or stop the content and select a control to indicate that the paused time is the desired subset end time. As another example the content curator may define a content subset to be a first portion e.g. the first thirty seconds of the content linked to by the content link. A content preview file may be generated by copying the content subset to a new content file.

The content curator may generate a content subset by combining multiple subsets of the content linked to by the content link. For example the content curator may play the content in a media player application and may define multiple start and end times which define multiple content subsets. The content preview file may be generated for example by creating a new content file and appending each content subset to the newly created content file to create a compilation of content subsets. The content subsets may be appended to the content preview file in the order in which they appear in the content linked to by the content link or the content curator may define an order in which the content subsets are to appear in the preview content file.

The content curator may generate a content preview file by combining content from multiple content files or sources. For example a content curator may create a content preview file by combining any or all of previously existing content preview files subsets of previously existing content preview files subsets of the content linked to by the content link subsets of other content files and other content files.

In some implementations a default content preview file may be automatically generated without human intervention in response to a determination that a previously generated content preview file does not exist for the content linked to by the content link. For example a content preview file which includes the first thirty seconds of content may be automatically generated. The length of an automatically generated content preview file may be based on the type of content. For example for movie content a content preview file which includes the first minute of content may be generated and for music content a content preview file which includes the first thirty seconds of content may be generated. In some implementations a default content preview file may be generated by the content curator such as in response to a prompt and the content curator may specify the length e.g. thirty seconds one minute of the default content preview file.

Returning to the system determines metadata to associate with the channel generally and or with at least one of the multiple content links included in the channel associated with the content curator . For example the content curator may provide metadata information such as a channel name and a channel description using a content curator portal. The content curator may also provide notes and comments for one or more content links e.g. the content curator may include a comment or a description for the content linked to by the content link . Metadata may include among other things the run length of the content user and or critic ratings and reviews of the content e.g. either full text reviews or links to reviews links to one or more websites associated with the content and links to related content. Metadata may also include one or more keywords which describe or are representative of the channel to help facilitate the finding of published channels in an end user search portal.

The system determines order information for arranging the multiple content links in the channel associated with the content curator . For example the content curator may arrange content items using a content curator portal user interface. The user interface may display representations of available content items in an available content area of the user interface and may display a list of representations of content links included in a channel in a channel information area of the user interface. A representation of an available content item or content link may be for example an icon a thumbnail or a textual link. The content curator may arrange the representations of content links in the channel information area to define a desired order of content. For example the content curator may drag and drop or otherwise reorder representations of content links in the channel information area of the user interface. The content curator may drag and drop or otherwise move a representation of an available content item from the available content area to the channel information area placing the available content item in a desired position within the list of content links.

Returning to the system defines channel information for the channel associated with the content curator based on the multiple content links and the supplemental channel information . For example referring to the system defines channel information for the channel associated with the content curator based on the multiple content links the one or more hot indices the content preview file the metadata and the order information .

The system publishes the defined channel information at a channel link to make the channel information available to user devices of a content delivery network . For example the defined channel information may be published using RSS Really Simple Syndication or similar technology. The channel link may be made available through an end user content search portal. For example the channel link may appear in one or more directory listings of available channels. The channel link may also be returned as a search result from searches performed through the end user content search portal. Once a user has subscribed to a channel channel information may be sent to a media player access device of the user. In some implementations channel information is sent in response to a user switching to a subscribed channel. In other implementations channel information is sent to the media player access device in response to the user subscription e.g. possibly before the user views the channel for the first time .

The multiple content curators also define using the multiple content curator portal instances respectively supplemental channel information which includes hot indices respectively and preview content respectively. Supplemental channel information may also include metadata associated with a channel generally and or metadata associated with one or more content links associated with a channel and may also include ordering information for arranging content links associated with a channel. A content curator may define using the respective content curator portal instances channel information for a channel based on the respective content links and based on respective supplemental channel information. Defined channel information may be sent to the content curator portal server and may be stored in a content and directory database in association with information identifying the respective content curator .

Metadata and other supplemental channel information may also be associated with one or more content links. The channel definition includes multiple content links as shown in a table . Each content link includes an address at which content is made available over a content delivery network. Each content link may refer for example to a URL of a content file or to a BitTorrent torrent file. For example the content link refers to the URL http www.broadcasterA.com watch show1 episode4 and the content link refers to the BitTorrent torrent file address of http www.nonprofitA.org download fileB.torrent .

As shown in columns of table each content link may have one or more associated hot indices one or more associated content preview files or associated metadata respectively. Hot indices may be automatically identified based on user viewing behavior data or may be manually identified by a content curator. Each hot index refers to a position within a respective content item e.g. content file . For example the content link has associated hot indices corresponding to positions of one minute twenty seconds three minutes thirty seconds and four minutes thirty seconds within the content linked to by the content link . As another example the content link has one associated hot index corresponding to a position of zero minutes forty seconds within the content linked to by the content link . Some content links such as content link have no associated hot indices.

The content link has an associated content preview file named myChannel1.wmv . Content preview files may be generated automatically e.g. as the first portion of an associated content file may be generated manually by a content curator or may be selected from existing content preview files e.g. a movie trailer . Some content links such as content links and do not have associated content preview files.

Content links may have associated metadata. For example as shown in column the content link has metadata describing the content linked to by the content link . Metadata associated with a content link may be distinguished from metadata which is generally associated with the channel and not specifically associated with a content link such as metadata .

The system determines that one or more modifications to channel information that defines a channel associated with a content curator are needed . For example the system may determine that modifications to one or more content links hot indices content preview files or other supplemental channel information are needed. The system may determine automatically without human intervention that modifications are needed or the system may determine that modifications are needed based on a received input from a content curator. Determining that modifications to channel information are needed is described in more detail below with respect to .

The system receives from the content curator input describing one or more modifications to content links included in the channel associated with the content curator . For example a content curator may add a new content link to a channel may edit an existing content link e.g. update the link address or may delete a content link from a channel. For example illustrates an available content user interface area which displays content which is available to be added to a channel. The user interface may be displayed for example on a content curator portal. The available content user interface displays available content file representations . For example the representations may be icons or thumbnail images.

The available content user interface area may be displayed on a content curator portal along with a channel definition area . The content curator may use the channel definition area to define and or modify a channel definition. For example the channel definition area is displaying a channel definition for a channel named DJ s Channel . To add a new content link to a channel the content curator may drag an available file representation and drop it onto a content links area of the channel definition area . The content links area includes representations of content links which are currently included in the channel. The content curator may for example drag the representation of a File content item and drop it onto the content links area between the representations and as illustrated by a dashed line representation . The dragging and dropping of the representation results in the adding of a new content link to the channel and also in a modification of the positions of the content links currently in the channel. The content curator may select a representation to delete or to modify an existing content link.

Returning to the system receives from the content curator input describing one or more modifications to supplemental channel information related to the channel associated with the content curator . For example the content curator may add edit or delete one or more hot indices preview content files or metadata for a channel or the content curator may reorder content links for a channel. For example and as illustrated in the content curator may use a hot index area of the channel definition user interface area to add a new hot index for a File content link to delete a hot index for a File A content link or to edit a hot index for a File D content link.

As another example the content curator may use a preview file area to add a new content preview file e.g. corresponding to representation for the File A content link or to delete a content preview file e.g. corresponding to representation for the File B content link. In some implementations the content curator portal allows a content curator to edit an existing content preview file e.g. to edit a video audio or image file . In other implementations to effectively edit an existing content preview file the content curator may delete the existing content preview and add a new content preview file which includes the desired changes.

Returning to the system determines that one or more modifications to the channel information that defines the channel associated with the content curator are needed based on the received input . For instance in the example of the system may determine that one or more modifications to the DJ s Channel channel are needed based on the content curator interacting with the channel definition user interface area .

The system monitors aspects of the channel associated with the content curator . For example the system may monitor without human intervention aspects of content links and supplemental channel information associated with the channel. The system may automatically detect aspects of the channel such as broken or changed content links newly created hot indices and newly available content preview files. Monitoring aspects of content links and supplemental channel information is described in more detail below with respect to .

The system may automatically detect for example that the content link for File A e.g. corresponding to representation is a broken link e.g. that File A is no longer accessible at the specified content link . The system may also detect for example that the content link for File C e.g. corresponding to representation has changed e.g. that the File C is still accessible but is accessible at a different link address . As another example the system may determine that a new hot index has been automatically generated for File C based on viewer behavior analytics. For example automatic monitoring of user viewing behavior may have determined that users frequently stop rewinding the File C content at a position of 5 30 and the system may determine that a new hot index corresponding to position 5 30 of File C has been created. As yet another example of automatic monitoring of channel aspects the system may detect that a new content preview file is available for File B e.g. the content link corresponding to representation . For example File B may be movie content and a new movie trailer may have been made available and discovered by the system .

Returning to based on the monitoring the system automatically determines that one or more modifications to content links included in the channel associated with the content curator are needed . For instance in the example of the system may determine that a deletion modification of the content link associated with representation is needed based on the detection of a broken link for File A . As another example the system may determine that an update link modification is needed for the content link associated with representation based on the detection of the modified link for File C .

Based on the monitoring the system automatically determines that one or more modifications to supplemental channel information related to the channel associated with the content curator are needed . For instance in the example of the system may determine that an add hot index modification is needed based on the determination that a new hot index has been created for File C . As another example the system may determine that an add content preview file modification is needed based on the detected availability of a new content preview file for File B .

Returning to the system identifies updated channel information that defines updates to the channel information needed to make the one or more modifications . For instance in the example of the system may identify the newly added content link for File associated with the representation the newly added content preview file for File A the newly added hot index for File the deletion of the hot index for File A the modification of the hot index for File D and the deletion of the content preview file for File B . In the example of the system may identify the delete link modification the update link modification the add hot index modification and the add new content preview file modification . The updated channel information may include only the information related to the channel that has changed.

The system publishes the updated channel information at a channel link for the channel such that subscribers to the channel receive the updated channel information . For example the updated channel information may be published using RSS or similar technology. Updated channel information may be automatically sent to media player access devices of users who have subscribed to the channel. Channel information for an update may include only information related to modified channel information e.g. downloaded channel information for an update may not include information for channel information that has not changed .

A user may receive an update message subsequent to a media player access device receiving updated channel information. For instance in the example of channel lists for users one two and N respectively each include the DJ s Channel channel as shown by channel indicators which the content curator modified using the user interface . In response to the modifications to the channel updated channel information may be sent to the media player access devices for user one user two and user N . Each of the users one two and N may see an update message the next time they use their media player access device which indicates that DJ s Channel has been updated.

Whether a user sees update messages or other update indicators may depend on whether a user has already watched content related to channel updates. For instance in the example of the DJ s Channel channel has current content associated with File A File File B File C and File D with the File content recently added. Suppose that user one has already watched the File A File B File C and File D content. An updated content list for the DJ s Channel channel for user one shows a single representation corresponding to the recently added File content. The representation is highlighted e.g. with a dashed line to indicate that it represents newly added content. User one does not receive notification related to the new hot index associated with the File C content or the new content preview file associated with the File A content since user one has already watched the File C and File A content.

Although user one has watched File A File B and File C those content files may or may not be deleted from the media player access device associated with user one. For example the content list may be a content list which shows unwatched shows for the associated channel. In general in some implementations a content file may be deleted after a user has finished viewing the content file possibly based on a user preference . In some implementations a content file may be deleted after being viewed and after the content expires. In other implementations content files are deleted only if a user issues an explicit request to delete a content file.

Suppose that user two has not watched any of the File A File B File C or File D content. After receiving updated channel information a content list for user two may display representations for the File A File File B and File C content respectively. A representation for the File D content may be available for example by scrolling. The representation for the File content is highlighted to indicate that it represents newly added content. A representation of a recently added preview file for File A and a representation of a recently added hot index for File C may appear highlighted to indicate that the corresponding supplemental channel information is new.

As another example suppose that user N has watched File A but has not watched File B File C or File D . A content list for user N may include representations corresponding to the File File B File C and File D content respectively. The representation for the File content is highlighted to indicate that it represents newly added content. The channel list does not include a representation for File A or a notification of the new content preview file for File A since user N has already watched File A . A representation for the recently added hot index for File C is highlighted to indicate that the corresponding hot index is new.

A user may also be updated in response to updates to channel information which are automatically determined e.g. in contrast to channel information updates initiated by a content curator . For instance in the example of channel lists for users one two and N respectively each include the DJ s Channel channel as shown by channel indicators . Assume that modifications have been previously automatically determined based on monitoring of aspects of the channel. In response to the modifications updated channel information may be sent to the media player access devices for user one user two and user N . The users two and N may see an update message the next time they use their media player access device which indicates that DJ s Channel has been updated.

Suppose similar to the user one user two and user N viewing behavior in the example of that user one has already watched the File A File B File C and File D content a content list for user one is correspondingly empty . In such a scenario user one might not see the update message or see any notifications related to the modifications since the updates are applicable to content that user one has already seen. Also in some examples update messages may generally be displayed only if certain types of updates occur e.g. new or deleted content links and may not be shown if only certain other types of updates occur e.g. if the only types of updates that have occurred are modifications to supplemental channel information update messages might not be displayed .

Suppose in the example of that prior to the updates that user two has watched the File D content but has not watched any of the File A File B or File C content. A content list may correspondingly display representations and for the File B and File C content respectively. A representation for File A is not shown due to the modification . The representation for File C might not be highlighted despite the update link modification . For example the update link modification might not be deemed of interest to the user e.g. the File C content is still available and the user may not be interested in the fact that the link is available at a different link address . A representation of a recently added preview file for File B e.g. corresponding to modification and a representation of a recently added hot index for File C e.g. corresponding to modification may appear highlighted to indicate that the corresponding supplemental channel information is new. Similarly representations and corresponding to the recently added preview file for File B e.g. modification and the recently added hot index for File C e.g. modification may appear highlighted in a content list for user N . The content list does not include a representation for File A due to modification .

As another example of defining a channel in some implementations a first user may subscribe to a channel associated with a second user. For example the second user may send a content item or a link to a content item to the first user such as by sending an electronic communication e.g. email addressed to a communications address associated with the media player access device of the first user. In response to receiving an electronic communication from the second user the media player access device of the first user or as other examples a server device or a remote control device associated with the first user may extract the content from the communication e.g. by streaming content through a link included in the communication extracting content attached to the communication or downloading content using download information e.g. a BitTorrent torrent file included in the communication to name a few examples .

After content has been extracted the content may be organized in a channel associated with the second user. The first user may watch the content items received from the second user in a manner similar to watching content files included on a channel defined by a content curator. In some implementations the second user in this example is a content curator. In some implementations the second user is not a defined content curator but is a regular user who has subscribed to the system. For example the first user and second user may be friends or may belong to the same family. For example a first user sending content to a second user with the received content being organized into a channel for the second user may be a convenient way for the second user to share content with the first user and possibly with other users e.g. the second user may send electronic communication to a group of users .

In some implementations content curators may define points of interest in channels organized by the content curators. In these implementations the points of interest may represent interactive elements that supplement and enhance content arranged in the channels organized by the content curators. For instance a point of interest may define a specific time interval for an episode to display a curator prepared text message to appear on a media player outputting the episode. The purpose of the point of interest may be to prompt the user to take some sort of action while watching that episode. The action that the user is asked to take may be executed from a remote control such as by pushing a button on the remote control. The actions may include asking the user if he or she wants to receive more information about a subject celebrity object related to the content currently being played. If the user answers yes then a promotional message or coupon may be sent to the user s email account or to his mobile phone. In another example the action may include asking the user to participate in taking a poll or survey. In yet another example the action may include asking the user to set up a future reminder which will trigger a reminder message to be sent to the user s mobile phone at a future time e.g. a real time reminder to remind the user about a television program which is about to air . A point of interest may be created by a content curator on a Curation Management System CMS using techniques similar to those discussed above for creating supplemental channel information. An episode can have multiple points of interest and if a user takes no action to a point of interest then the point of interest message will disappear after a timeout period. In addition a channel also may have its own point of interest which is separate from points of interest for the episodes within that channel and is output based on viewing of the channel regardless of what episodes from the channel are being viewed.

The system accesses data used in defining a point of interest that supplements content arranged in a channel associated with the content curator . For example the system may display an interface that enables a content curator to enter information that defines a point of interest and receive the data that defines the point of interest through the displayed interface. In this example the system may solicit and receive information defining when the point of interest should be output how the point of interest should be output with content defined by the channel and what action the point of interest invokes based on a response from a user perceiving the point of interest.

In some examples the system automatically without input from the content curator determines data used in defining the point of interest based on one or more rules that control definition of points of interest for the channel associated with the content curator on the content delivery network. In these examples the one or more rules may be system defined rules that specify when points of interest are presented within multiple channels in the content delivery network or when a point of interest is to be presented in a particular episode for all channels that include the particular episode. The one or more rules also may be specific to the content curator and only control definition of points of interest for channels associated with the content curator. The content curator may provide input defining the one or more rules and the system may automatically without further input from the content curator define points of interest for the content curator s channels based on the provided input. The one or more rules may use various criteria in determining to define points of interest. The criteria may include the type of content arranged in a channel end user interactions with content and or channels external events e.g. changing weather data or stock prices or any other criteria using data accessible to the system .

In some implementations the system accesses timing information that indicates when the point of interest is used to supplement content arranged in the channel associated with the content curator on the content delivery network. In these implementations the timing information may be defined relative to an amount of time a particular episode or content file has been played or relative to an amount of time a channel has been output. For instance the timing information may indicate that the point of interest should be output five minutes into playing of a particular episode organized in the channel or may indicate that the point of interest should be output after the channel has been experienced by a user for two hours. The timing information also may define an absolute time at which the point of interest should be displayed such as every Thursday at 8 00 PM or on July 29 at 6 PM. The timing information also may be defined relative to actions taken by a user experiencing a channel or an episode. For instance the timing information may indicate that the point of interest should be displayed after content of a channel or episode has been fast forwarded for more than one minute e.g. a point of interest to jump to a hot index may be displayed when the content of a channel or episode has been fast forwarded for more than one minute . In addition the timing information may be relative to the number of times a user has taken a particular action such as skipping episodes a particular number of times or watching entire episodes without interruption for a particular number of times e.g. a first poll point of interest soliciting feedback on the channel may be displayed after a user has skipped three episodes in the channel and a second poll point of interest soliciting feedback on the channel may be displayed after a user has watched three episodes in a row in their entirety without fast forwarding . Any timing parameters and any actions taken by a user in experiencing content on the channel or within an episode may be used to trigger presentation of a point of interest.

In some examples the timing information indicates a duration of how long the point of interest is output to supplement content arranged in the channel associated with the content curator on the content delivery network. In these examples the system receives form the content curator input defining how long the point of interest should be displayed with content from the channel. For instance the content curator may specify that the point of interest should be displayed for thirty seconds and the system receives the duration information for use in defining the point of interest. In other examples the system may use a default duration e.g. fifteen seconds for all points of interest.

In some implementations the system accesses output information that defines how the point of interest is output with content arranged in the channel associated with the content curator on the content delivery network. The output information may define the visual display of the point of interest and or the audio output of the point of interest. For example the output information may define text to be displayed with content arranged in the channel associated with the content curator on the content delivery network and or one or more user input controls to be displayed with content arranged in the channel associated with the content curator on the content delivery network. In this example the output information also may include a definition of where the point of interest is output in a visual interface. The definition of where the point of interest is output in the visual interface may specify that the point of interest is displayed as a horizontal bar running along a lowermost edge of the interface a horizontal bar running along an uppermost edge of the interface a vertical bar running along a left edge of the interface a vertical bar running along a right edge of the interface or a location in a central portion of the interface displaying content from the channel. The system may enable the content curator to modify any output characteristics for the point of interest.

Further the system may display a preview of content to a content curator in receiving input that defines the point of interest. For instance the system may enable the content curator to watch or scrolling content of content files organized in the content curator s channel to identify a location at which the content curator would like to output the point of interest. In this regard the system may receive from the content curator input indicating that the content curator would like to output the point of interest at the current point in the content displayed in the preview and determine the timing information from that input. Also the system may receive a definition of where the point of interest is output in the visual interface based on the content curator s interaction with the content displayed in the preview e.g. the content curator may click on or tap an area of the content displayed in the preview to set that point as the location where the point of interest is to be displayed .

In addition the system may accesses action information that defines one or more actions that occur based on user interaction with the point of interest. The actions may include any types of actions that enhance and supplement the user s experience of content arranged in the channel. For example the action information may include link actions that link to other content that is related to or relevant to the content arranged in the channel. In this example the link action would cause the system to output content made available at a linked address responsive to interaction with the point of interest. The content made available at the linked address may include another video made available at the linked address and or a web page with information relevant to the content being output from the channel. The system may enable the user to perceive the content information associated with the link action and then return to the content organized in the channel at the point in time at which the user interacted with the point of interest.

The display text input box receives text input used in displaying the point of interest. The system may use the text provided in the display text input box as a message to display with the point of interest. The button text input box receives text input used in displaying the buttons used to interact with the point of interest. In this example the arrangement and location of the point of interest is predefined by operators of the system and the text provided to the display text input box and the button text input box is used to customize the text included in the predefined point of interest arrangement. In other examples content curators may be allowed to define the arrangement and location of the point of interest and may have more control over customizations of the appearance of the point of interest.

In addition the hyper link input box receives text input defining a link address used in linking to additional content or information based on a response to the point of interest. The system stores the link address with the action information for the point of interest and uses the link address in performing the action associated with the point of interest. The system may store data representing the point in the content at which the user responded to the link point of interest and may use the stored data to return to the exact point in the content at which the user responded to the link point of interest upon the user providing input indicating a desire to return to the content in the channel e.g. user input selecting a back or menu button .

The interface also includes a cancel input control and a save input control . The cancel input control enables a user to exit the interface without setting a point of interest. The save input control enables a user to save the input provided in the interface and trigger definition of the point of interest based on the saved information.

Referring again to the action information also may include notification actions that notify the user of additional information related to or relevant to the content being output from the channel. The notification actions may result in content or information related to or relevant to the content being output from the channel to be immediately sent to another device e.g. a mobile device of the user that interacted with the point of interest. The user that interacted with the point of interest then may view the content or information using the other device without an interruption in the content being output from the channel.

The display text input box receives text input used in displaying the point of interest. The system may use the text provided in the display text input box as a message to display with the point of interest. The button text input box receives text input used in displaying the buttons used to interact with the point of interest. In this example the arrangement and location of the point of interest is predefined by operators of the system and the text provided to the display text input box and the button text input box is used to customize the text included in the predefined point of interest arrangement. In other examples content curators may be allowed to define the arrangement and location of the point of interest and may have more control over customizations of the appearance of the point of interest.

The interface also includes a cancel input control and a next input control . The cancel input control enables a user to exit the interface without setting a point of interest. The next input control enables a user to save the input provided in the interface and move to the next interface where the user is able to define the action information of the notification point of interest. In this regard the next interface enables the user to define the notification action in terms of what content or information is provided with the notification and to which device the notification is to be provided e.g. an application on the user s mobile device or the user s electronic mail account .

Referring again to the action information further may include scheduled notification actions that provide a reminder to the user or at a future time notify the user of additional information related to or relevant to the content being output from the channel. The scheduled notification actions may result in a reminder or content information related to or relevant to the content being output from the channel to be sent to another device e.g. a mobile device of the user that interacted with the point of interest at a future time that is likely more convenient for the user to receive the reminder or content information. The system provides the reminder or content information to the user at the scheduled future time to provide the reminder or content information to the user at a time that is likely best for the user to receive the information. For instance a scheduled notification may provide the user with a reminder for a particular television show fifteen minutes prior to the show being broadcast or a scheduled notification may provide the user with information about a product on a Saturday morning because the system has learned that the user typically shops on Saturday mornings and the information about the product may be most effectively presented to the user at a time when the user is already shopping or planning to shop.

The display text input box receives text input used in displaying the point of interest. The system may use the text provided in the display text input box as a message to display with the point of interest. The button text input box receives text input used in displaying the buttons used to interact with the point of interest. In this example the arrangement and location of the point of interest is predefined by operators of the system and the text provided to the display text input box and the button text input box is used to customize the text included in the predefined point of interest arrangement. In other examples content curators may be allowed to define the arrangement and location of the point of interest and may have more control over customizations of the appearance of the point of interest.

The interface also includes a cancel input control and a next input control . The cancel input control enables a user to exit the interface without setting a point of interest. The next input control enables a user to save the input provided in the interface and move to the next interface where the user is able to define the action information of the scheduled notification point of interest. In this regard the next interface enables the user to define the scheduled notification action in terms of what content or information is provided with the notification to which device the notification is to be provided e.g. an application on the user s mobile device or the user s electronic mail account and what time the scheduled notification is to be provided.

Referring again to action information may include poll actions that request users to participate in a poll. The poll actions may pose a question to users perceiving the channel associated with the content curator with a set of potential answers to the question. The system may define the poll question and answers based on input provided by the content curator.

The display text input box receives text input used in displaying the point of interest. The system may use the text provided in the display text input box as a message to display with the point of interest. In this case the message is a poll question presented to the user with the content from the channel.

The button text input boxes and receive text input used in displaying the buttons used to interact with the point of interest. In this example multiple buttons are defined to correspond to multiple potential answers to the poll question and the text input in the button text input boxes and represents the answers to the poll question. The add button input control receives input to add another button to the point of interest thereby adding an additional potential answer to the poll question. The add button input control enables a content curator to customize the number of buttons in the point of interest up to a predefined limit.

The interface also includes a cancel input control and a save input control . The cancel input control enables a user to exit the interface without setting a point of interest. The save input control enables a user to save the input provided in the interface and trigger definition of the point of interest based on the saved information.

Referring again to the system defines the point of interest based on timing information output information and action information . For instance the system stores in electronic storage data that represents the point of interest and enables the point of interest to be presented with content defined by the channel or episode associated with the point of interest. The point of interest is defined in accordance with the timing information the output information and the action information received from the content curator.

In the data structure includes four example rows of point of interest data that define four example points of interest. The four example points of interest relate to the interfaces and respectively. As shown the first row corresponds to a first point of interest defined using the interface . The first point of interest is not associated with a channel but is associated with the episode www.cityep2.com such that the first point of interest is displayed in all channels of the content curator that defined the first point of interest that include the episode www.cityep2.com. The first point of interest is displayed at the 5 34 mark of the episode www.cityep2.com and has a duration of thirty seconds. The first point of interest is a link point of interest and displays the text Have you ever seen such a beautiful night. The button for the first point of interest is displayed in association with the text Plan Your Trip Online and the first point of interest links to www.trav2.com city2 upon selection of the button for the first point of interest.

The second point of interest is not associated with an episode but is associated with the channel www.my3.com such that the second point of interest is only in the channel www.my3.com of the content curator that defined the second point of interest. The second point of interest is displayed after the channel www.my3.com has been tuned for ten minutes and has a duration of ten seconds. The second point of interest is a notification point of interest and displays the text Better Life Products. The button for the second point of interest is displayed in association with the text Get Shopping Information and the second point of interest causes shopping information to be sent to a user s mobile device upon selection of the button for the second point of interest.

The third point of interest is not associated with a channel but is associated with the episode www.soc14.com such that the third point of interest is displayed in all channels of the content curator that defined the third point of interest that include the episode www.soc14.com. The third point of interest is displayed at the 32 30 mark of the episode www.soc14.com and has a duration of two minutes. The third point of interest is a scheduled notification point of interest and displays the text Watch Highlights of the FIFA World Cup Championship. The button for the third point of interest is displayed in association with the text Remind me to watch and the third point of interest causes a reminder to watch World Cup highlights to be sent to a user s mobile device at 8 00 PM on Jul. 30 2013.

The fourth point of interest is associated with the channel www.cook8.com and also associated with the episode www.tea143.com such that the fourth point of interest is displayed in the episode www.tea143.com but only for the channel www.cook8.com. Accordingly the fourth point of interest is not displayed in other channels of the content curator that include the episode www.tea143.com. The fourth point of interest is displayed at the 00 10 mark of the episode www.tea143.com and has a duration of one minute. The fourth point of interest is a poll point of interest and displays the text Which is your favorite one in tea time as the poll question. The buttons for the fourth point of interest are displayed in association with the text Tea Cake and Coffee which represent the potential answers to the poll question that are selectable by a user. The fourth point of interest causes poll results to be displayed to the user with the content from the channel.

As described above the data structure is associated with a single content curator and represents the points of interest the single content curator has defined. Each content curator in the content delivery network may have his or her own data structure such that points of interest are specific to content curators and do not permeate to channels defined by other content curators. In some implementations content curators may be able to share and exchange points of interest to gather more poll data or assist each other in providing the best interactive experience for subscribers to the channels of the content curators.

Returning again to the system associates the point of interest with at least one of the channel associated with the content curator and a content link arranged in the channel associated with the content curator . For instance the system associates the point of interest with a particular channel a particular episode or both a particular channel and a particular episode. The system may associate the point of interest with a particular channel by storing a representation or indication of the point of interest in channel information for the particular channel. The system may associate the point of interest with a particular episode by identifying all channels of the content curator that include the particular episode and storing a representation or indication of the point of interest for the particular episode in channel information for each of identified channels.

For episode points of interest the timing information may indicate that the point of interest is to be output at a specific time during output of content linked to by a content link for the episode arranged in the channel associated with the content curator on the content delivery network. In these examples the system associates the point of interest with the content link arranged in the channel associated with the content curator on the content delivery network and controls at the specific time during output of the content linked to by the content link output of the point of interest in addition to the content linked to by the content link. The system may make the point of interest available in multiple channels that are associated with the content curator and that each include the content link. In addition the system may withhold the point of interest from channels that are defined by other content curators on the content delivery network and that include the content link such that the point of interest is output only when the user is experiencing the content linked to by the content link from the channel associated with the content curator.

For channel points of interest the timing information may indicate that the point of interest is to be output at a specific time during selection of the channel associated with the content curator on the content delivery network. In these examples the system associates the point of interest with the channel associated with the content curator on the content delivery network and controls at the specific time during selection of the channel associated with the content curator output of the point of interest in addition to the content defined by the channel associated with the content curator. The system may control at the specific time during selection of the channel associated with the content curator output of the point of interest regardless of how the channel has been controlled during selection such that the point of interest is output with different content for different users. For instance different users may fast forward and or rewind through content at different rates and because the fast forwarding and rewinding does not impact how long the channel has been selected the point of interest may be output with different content for different users of the content delivery network.

The system controls based on the timing information and the output information output of the point of interest in addition to content defined by the channel associated with the content curator . For example the system monitors for the time specified by the timing information and based on detecting the time specified by the timing information integrates a representation of the point of interest with the content defined by the channel associated with the content curator. The system may determine the representation of the point of interest based on the output information customized by the content curator and predefined attributes of how points of interest are displayed. The system may output the point of interest for the duration indicated by the timing information. To the extent the timing information does not specify a duration the system may output the point of interest for a default period of time. The system may integrate a representation of the point of interest with the content defined by the channel associated with the content curator by adding the text defined by the output information to a display of the content defined by the channel associated with the content curator and or adding one or more user input controls defined by the output information to a display of the content defined by the channel associated with the content curator.

Returning again to the system receives an indication that the user interacted with the point of interest output in addition to the content defined by the channel associated with the content curator . For example system receives an indication that the user interacted with the point of interest by selecting an input control associated with the point of interest. The indication of the user s interaction with the point of interest may be a signal from a remote control that indicates the user s selection of an input control associated with the point of interest. In the case of a poll point of interest such as that shown in interface the indication of the user s interaction with the point of interest may indicate which of the three input controls and the user selected.

The system performs an action defined by the action information . For instance upon receiving the indication of the user s interaction with the point of interest the system performs the action associated with the point of interest in the action column of the data structure . As described previously the actions may include any types of actions that enhance and supplement the user s experience of content arranged in the channel. For example the action may include link actions that link to other content that is related to or relevant to the content arranged in the channel. In this example the system may output content made available at a linked address responsive to interaction with the point of interest. The system may enable the user to perceive the content information associated with the link action and then return to the content organized in the channel at the point in time at which the user interacted with the point of interest.

The action also may include notification actions that notify the user of additional information related to or relevant to the content being output from the channel. In this example the system may immediately send content or information related to or relevant to the content being output from the channel to another device e.g. a mobile device of the user that interacted with the point of interest. The user that interacted with the point of interest then may view the content or information using the other device without an interruption in the content being output from the channel.

The action further may include scheduled notification actions that provide a reminder to the user or at a future time notify the user of additional information related to or relevant to the content being output from the channel. In this example the system may send a reminder or content information related to or relevant to the content being output from the channel to another device e.g. a mobile device of the user that interacted with the point of interest at a future time that is likely more convenient for the user to receive the reminder or content information. The system may send the reminder or content information to the user at the scheduled future time to provide the reminder or content information to the user at a time that is likely best for the user to receive the information.

The action may include poll actions that request users to participate in a poll. In this example the system may pose a question to users perceiving the channel associated with the content curator with a set of potential answers to the question. The system may define the poll question and answers based on input provided by the content curator.

The system accesses information defined by a notification action to be communicated to the user that interacted with the point of interest . For example the system may access the action information associated with the notification action and stored in action column of data structure and use the action information to determine the information to access. In this example the action information may identify a link to information to be communicated to the user or may identify a file that stores the information to be communicated to the user. The system may access the information to be communicated to the user using the link defined by the action information or may access the file that includes the information to be communicated to the user. For example the system may access shopping information associated with Better Life Products from a link to website operated for Better Life Products or from a file that stores a promotional message for Better Life Products.

The system identifies communication information associated with the user that interacted with the point of interest . For example the system may identify electronic mail information associated with the user that interacted with the point of interest. Alternatively or in addition the system may identify device information for a communication device of the user e.g. the user s mobile device which is different than a device outputting the content defined by the channel associated with the content curator. For example the notification action information may define to which device the notification is to be provided e.g. an application on the user s mobile device or the user s electronic mail account based on information provided by a content curator. In other cases the system may allow the user that interacted with the point of interest to decide to which device the notification should be sent by for example displaying a set of input controls from which the user may select the device to which the user prefers the notification to be sent.

The system sends to the user that interacted with the point of interest using the identified communication information the accessed information . For example system may send the accessed information to the user that interacted with the point of interest using the identified electronic mail address the identified device information or both. For example the system may send the shopping information associated with Better Life Products to the user s electronic mail account or to the user s mobile device.

The system accesses information defined by a scheduled notification action to be communicated to the user that interacted with the point of interest . For example the system may access the action information associated with the notification action and stored in action column of data structure and use the action information to determine the information to access. In this example the action information may identify a link to information to be communicated to the user or may identify a file that stores the information to be communicated to the user. The system may access the information to be communicated to the user using the link defined by the action information or may access the file that includes the information to be communicated to the user. For example the system may access from a file the text Watch highlights of the FIFA World Cup Championship to use in a reminder for the scheduled notification action. The system also may access a World Cup highlights video using a link defined by the action information and imbed the World Cup highlights video with the reminder.

The system determines a time defined by the scheduled notification action at which to deliver the accessed information . For example the system may determine a time based on information stored in the action column of the data structure e.g. 8 00 PM on Jul. 30 2013 . In some implementations the system may determine a time based on information that the system has learned about the user. For example the system may have learned that the user typically shops on Saturday morning and the system may determine that notification for to provide the user with information about or coupons for a product should be delivered on Saturday morning at 10 00 AM.

The system identifies communication information associated with the user that interacted with the point of interest . For example the system may identify electronic mail information associated with the user that interacted with the point of interest. Alternatively or in addition the system may identify device information for a communication device of the user e.g. the user s mobile device which is different than a device outputting the content defined by the channel associated with the content curator. For example the scheduled notification action information may define to which device the notification is to be provided e.g. an application on the user s mobile device or the user s electronic mail account based on information provided by a content curator. In other cases the system may allow the user that interacted with the point of interest to decide to which device the notification should be sent by for example displaying a set of input controls from which the user may select the device to which the user prefers the notification to be sent.

The system monitors for the time at which to deliver the accessed information . For example the system may use a system clock to monitor for the date and time at which to deliver the accessed information.

The system sends using the identified communication information the accessed information to the user that interacted with the point of interest at the time at which to deliver the accessed information . For example system may send the accessed information to the user that interacted with the point of interest using the identified electronic mail address the identified device information or both at the determined delivery time. For example the system may send a reminder including the text Watch highlights of the FIFA World Cup Championship along with a link to a video of World Cup highlights to the user s electronic mail address at 8 00 PM on Jul. 30 2013. As another example the system may send the shopping information or coupon to the to the user s mobile device at 10 00 AM Saturday morning.

The system determines an answer to a poll for a user that corresponds to one of multiple answer input controls selected by the user . For example the system may receive an indication of one of multiple poll answer input controls selected by the user from a remote control. For instance the system may receive an indication that a user has selected the input control of interface indicating that the user prefers tea at tea time.

The system updates data tracking results of the poll based on the determined answer to the poll for the user . For example the system may receive poll data from multiple users and may update the poll data with each determined poll answer. Updating the data tracking results for the poll may include incrementing a counter associated with the determined answer to the poll for the user and incrementing a counter associated with the total responses received for the poll. For instance in response to receiving an indication that a user has selected the input control of interface the system may increment a counter associated with the choice of Tea as a response to the poll question Which is your favorite one in tea time 

The system determines a result of the poll based on the updated data tracking results of the poll . For example the system may calculate the percentage of total poll responses associated with each of multiple answers to the poll based on the updated tracking results. In addition the system may compare the calculated percentages and determine a leading answer to the poll.

The system controls output to the user of the determined result of the poll . For example the system may display the poll results in the point of interest interface upon receiving a selection of a poll input control from a user.

In some implementations the system may use a user s poll response to choose a point of interest to be displayed at a later point during a particular episode being viewed by a user. For example a curator may define three different link type points of interest to be displayed at a later point of the www.tea143.com episode one related to tea another related to cake and a third related to coffee. Based on a user s selection of Tea in response to the poll interest defined in the fourth row of data structure the system may determine that the curator s link type point of interest related to tea should be displayed at the later point in the www.tea143.com episode.

The system determines that a channel point of interest conflicts with an episode point of interest . For example a channel point of interest may conflict with an episode point of interest when the timing information for both a channel point of interest and an episode point of interest conflict. Referring to the points of interest defined in data structure a user may be viewing episode www.cityep2.com on channel www.my3.com and because the user may have been viewing another episode on channel www.my3.com for 4 minutes and 20 seconds prior to starting the episode www.cityep2.com the timing of the first and second points of interest in data structure will conflict. The conflict arises because the channel point of interest i.e. the second point of interest in data structure is scheduled to be displayed after the user has been viewing channel www.my3.com for 10 minutes which due to the user s actions prior to beginning episode www.cityep2.com coincides with the timing of the episode point of interest i.e. the first point of interest in data structure . To determine whether a channel and an episode point of interest conflict the system may take into account both the scheduled starting time of each point of interest and the respective duration of each point of interest. By taking into account both the schedule starting time and the duration the system may effectively create a real time Gant chart for scheduled points of interest based on a user s interaction with episodes within a channel.

In addition when determining whether a conflict exists the system may include a short amount of buffer time into the calculation such that the display of one point of interest may be removed from a user s display for a short duration before displaying a second point of interest. For example it may be desirable to have at least a ten second gap between consecutive points of interest to ensure a user recognizes the second point of interest.

The system accesses one or more rules used in resolving conflicts for points of interest . Upon determining that a channel point of interest conflicts with an episode point of interest the system may access one or more rules to resolve the conflict. For example a rule may include prioritizing channel points of interest over episode points of interest such that the channel point of interest is output to the user but the episode point of interest is not. Another rule may include accessing a ranking of points of interest and selecting the point of interest with the highest ranking. Yet another rule may include prioritizing either the channel or the episode point of interest based on the time of day. Another rule may include prioritizing either the channel or the episode point of interest based on information learned about the user. Yet another rule may include prioritizing the episode point of interest over the channel point of interest. Although several examples of rules have been provided many other rules for resolving conflicts for points of interest are also possible.

The system analyzes the channel point of interest and the episode point of interest with respect to the one or more rules . For example the system may apply the rule to the channel and episode points of interest that conflict. In a case in which there are more than one rule the system may determine which rule should be applied to the conflicting channel and episode points of interest. For example the rules may be ranked. As another example the system may determine a ranking for the channel point of interest and a ranking for the episode point of interest based on accessed ranking of points of interest compare the ranking of the channel point of interest to the ranking of the episode point of interest and apply a rule based on the compared rankings.

The system selects one of the channel point of interest and the episode point of interest to output in addition to content defined by the channel . For instance the system selects the appropriate one of the channel point of interest or the episode point of interest to output in addition to content defined by the channel based on the applied rule. For example if the rule was to prioritize channel points of interest over episode points of interest the system may select the channel point of interest to output in addition to content defined by the channel. In some implementations the system may place the unselected point of interest in an electronic queue to be output at a later time.

All or some of the data may be used in conjunction with the number of channel subscribers to evaluate the performance of different curators to determine revenue sharing and or to determine which curator s content to promote. In addition the data may also be displayed or used on a per channel or per episode basis to provide even more granular performance data. In some implementations the system may also provide each curator with data tracking their own points of interest to evaluate their own channels episodes or individual points of interest. For example the system may track the number of responses received to each point of interest created by a curator.

The operations described above with respect to may be performed on any suitable media device e.g. a television a mobile device a computer etc. that is capable of outputting the interfaces described with respect to and receiving input from a suitable input device e.g. a remote control device a touch screen interface a mouse and keyboard etc. in performing the operations described with respect to . For example points of interest may be displayed on a television and interacted with through commands received from a remote control device operated by a user perceiving the points of interest. In another example points of interest may be displayed on a mobile device and interacted with through input e.g. touch events swiping gestures etc. applied to a touch screen interface of the mobile device. In yet another example points of interest may be displayed on a computer and interacted with through commands received from a mouse and or keyboard operated by a user perceiving the points of interest.

In some implementations when an end user first launches a content presentation portal to access content from system three sets of channels are displayed. Each set of channels may contain a fixed number of video channels. For example each set of channels can contain up to 27 channels stacked together. A set of channels may be a convenient way to organize a number of related video channels in one place. When the content presentation portal is first launched the first episode of the first channel in the middle set may immediately begin playing. The user may be allowed to navigate to other channels in the highlighted set using up arrow and down arrow input controls provided in the content presentation portal. In addition the user may be allowed to navigate to another set of channels using left arrow and right arrow input controls provided in the content presentation portal. The content presentation portal may provide a full screen view of a particular episode in the highlighted channel when a user selects any location in a playback area of the content presentation portal. Additionally the content presentation portal may provide input controls to allow a user to subscribe to new channels. The subscribed channels may be placed a user defined set of channels. The content presentation portal may also include system operator defined sets of channels and content provider defined sets of channels. An end user may not be allowed to alter attributes of either the operator defined sets of channels and content provider defined sets of channels. For example an operator e.g. a business that runs and maintains system may control the video channels and episodes organized in operator defined sets of channels. In this example an operator defined set of channels may include an account support channel the features videos explaining various features of the system and a highlights channel that shows highlights of content from preferred content providers. Similarly a content provider e.g. a group of content curators from a television station may control the video channels and episodes organized in content provider defined sets of channels. For example a content provider may be XYZ News Corporation and an XYZ News Corporation set of channels may include a local XYZ News channel e.g. XYZ News Fairfax a national XYZ News channel and an XYZ News commentary channel e.g. MSXYZ News . In this example based on an agreement between the operator and XYZ News Corporation the operator of the system may use the XYZ News Corporation set of channels as the preferred content provider set of channels that users cannot alter. In addition the operator defined sets of channels and content provider defined sets of channels may be sets of channels that are required to be displayed in an end user s content presentation portal at a particular location. In this regard the operator reserves screen real estate in users portals and may display sets of channels defined by the operator in the reserved screen real estate and or sell or lease the reserved screen real estate to content providers and content curators.

The system receives from a user identity a request to access a content delivery network . For example the system may display a user login interface. In some implementations an access device may be associated with a user identity and when powered on by the user the access device requests access to the content delivery network from system and serves as the user identity. A user identity may be a content delivery network user account associated with one or more individual content presentation portal users. Furthermore a user may be able to access system from multiple access devices using one user identity. For instance multiple family members may use a single user identity e.g. user account to access content from the system using a smart phone a media player a laptop computer an Internet enabled television or any other device capable of accessing a content delivery network.

The system identifies the user identity that is requesting access to the content delivery network . For example the system may identify the user identity that is requesting access to the content delivery network based on user account information such as a user name an electronic mail address or other appropriate user login information. In implementations in which a user account is associated with an access device the system may identify the user identity that is requesting access to the content delivery network by identification information for the access device e.g. a serial number or a media access control MAC address of the access device . The system may perform authentication of the user identity as a prerequisite to granting access to the content delivery network. For instance the system may require a password or access token to authenticate the user identity.

The system accesses user defined settings associated with the user identity . For example the system uses the user identity to access user defined settings for the content presentation portal. User defined settings may include settings related to which additional sets of channels to include in the portal e.g. in addition to any required sets of channels an order of the additional sets of channels in the portal channels to which a user has subscribed an order of channels within the additional sets of channels and user defined names and or display formats for the additional sets of channels in the portal. The user defined settings are described in more detail with respect to the user setting control interfaces described below and shown in .

The channel icons and show the user the channels that are associated with the displayed set of channels. For example as shown in a user has placed Science channel Talk channel Power channel and Bike channel in channel set . The add channel icon may allow a user to add to the channel set displayed in interface channels to which the user has subscribed. The channel sorting input controls and allow a user to define how the channels are arranged within the channel set displayed in interface . A user selection of the updated time channel sorting input control may cause the channels to be sorted by the time of the most recent update. For example the channel with the most recently updated episode may be displayed first within channel set in the portal. A user selection of the customized order channel sorting input control may allow the user to customize the order of the channels within the channel set displayed in interface . For example the order that the channels are listed in interface may indicate to the user the order in which the channels are displayed within channel set in the content presentation portal. Interface may allow a user to change the order that the channels are displayed within channel set by altering the position of channel icons and in interface for example by dragging and dropping one of channel icons and into a new position. A user selection of the set on top channel sorting input control in the upper right corner of the channel icons may cause the channel associated with the selected channel icon to be assigned as the first channel to be displayed in the channel set displayed in interface . For example when the user view s channel set in the portal the Power channel may be the first channel displayed within channel set .

The channel store icon may allow a user to access a channel store hosted on the system . The channel store may provide a list of channels or sets of channels from various curators and content providers to which the user can subscribe. Content curators or content providers may arrange channels in a set and require users to purchase the entire set of channels rather than individual channels within the set.

The portal menu provides a user with a list of channel sets available within the content presentation portal associated with the user s user identity that may be edited by the user using interface . The highlighted set Set in the portal menu may indicate which set is presently displayed for editing in interface .

The interface also includes a preview input control and a save input control . The preview input control enables a user to preview any changes that the user made to the channel set displayed in interface . The save input control enables a user to save the user s settings related to the channel set displayed in interface .

The preferred curator s channel set icon represents one or more content provider channel sets and the system channels channel set icon represents one or more system operator channel sets. The preferred curator s channel set icon and the system channels channel set icon may for example be shaded bolded or highlighted in an appropriate manner to indicate to a user that attributes related to those channel sets may not be changed by the user. Thus the inclusion of the channel sets and in the user s portal and the position of the channel sets and within the user s portal are locked and cannot be changed by the user.

The next two channel set icons and represent user defined channel sets. For example channel set icons and may represent channel sets that the user has defined and which contain channels to which the user has subscribed. The final three channel set icons and represent content provider defined channel sets that for example may not be required to be included in the user s portal but to which the user may have voluntarily subscribed. For example the channel set associated with channel set icon may have been defined by Curator and would include content e.g. channels and episodes as defined by Curator . User defined channel sets associated with channel set icons and may contain content e.g. channels and episodes as defined by the user or a friend or family member of the user. In addition the user may be allowed to edit some of the attributes related to the content provider defined channel sets represented by channel set icons and such as the order that the channel sets are presented in the portal but may not be allowed to alter the content e.g. channels and episodes contained within the channel set. In other words the user s ability to change attributes related to the voluntarily subscribed content provider defined channel sets is less restricted than the user s ability to change attributes related to required content provider defined channel sets but is more restricted than the user s ability to change attributes related to user defined channel sets.

The add set icon may allow a user to add channel sets to the portal e.g. by subscribing to new content provider defined channel sets or by placing additional subscribed channel sets that were previously removed from the portal . The channel set sorting input controls and allow a user to define how the channel sets other than any required channel sets are arranged within the portal. A user selection of the updated time channel set sorting input control may cause the channel sets other than any required channel sets to be sorted by the time of the most recent update. For example the channel set with the most recently updated episode may be displayed first within the portal after the required channel sets. A user selection of the customized order channel set sorting input control may allow the user to customize the order in which the channel sets other than any required channel sets are presented in the portal. For example the order that the channel sets are listed in interface may indicate to the user the order in which the channels are presented in the portal after the required channel sets. Interface also may allow a user to change the order that the channels sets other than any required channel sets are presented in the portal by altering the position of channel set icons and in interface for example by dragging and dropping one of channel set icons and into a new position.

The interface also includes a preview input control and a save input control . The preview input control enables a user to preview any changes that the user made to the channel sets displayed in interface . The save input control enables a user to save the user s settings related to the channel sets displayed in interface .

Returning to the system accesses system settings that define one or more required sets of channels . For example the system may access system settings that define one or more required system operator defined sets of channels one or more content provider defined sets of channels and attributes related to the required sets of channels. Settings related to attributes of the required sets of channels may include an order for presenting the required sets of channels in the portal a position for one or more of the required sets of channels to be displayed in the portal an order of channels within each of the required sets of channels and or a name and display format for one or more sets of the required sets of channels. For example a position of one of the sets of required sets of channels to be displayed in the portal may define specific real estate within the portal display that the required set of channels is to occupy e.g. a center position on the portal display such that the required set of channels is readily viewable by the user when initially accessing the content delivery network .

The system defines a portal for the user identity based on the accessed user defined settings and the accessed system settings . For example the system may integrate both the accessed user defined settings and the accessed system settings to define a content presentation portal for the user identity. Defining the portal may include using the user defined and system settings to determine content to be displayed in the user s portal and how the content should be presented to the user in the portal. In other words based on both the user defined and system settings the system may compile appropriate channels into user defined sets of channels compile appropriate channels into required sets of channels both system operator defined and content provider defined access appropriate content provider defined sets of channels e.g. non required content provider defined sets of channels apply appropriate names to the sets of channels and present each of the accessed and compiled sets of channels in the portal according to the user defined and system settings.

The system controls display of the defined portal for the user identity . For example the system displays the content presentation portal to the user as defined by the user defined and system settings. In addition the system receives inputs from the user and allows the user to navigate among the content presented to the user in the portal. A more detailed description of the content presentation portal is provided below in conjunction with .

The representations of sets of channels and present the channels within the set of channels in a stacked view. For example the first channel in each set of channels is displayed such that it appears to lie on top of a stack of other channels within the set. The representation of the active set of channels includes a playback area in which content from an active channel of the active set of channels is displayed and video associated with an episode on the active channel is streamed for a user to view. The portal may allow a user to view a streaming episode in a full screen view by selecting any portion of the playback area for example. Alternatively or in addition a selectable full screen icon may be displayed or a designated button on a remote control may be used to transition the streaming episode into and out of a full screen view. In addition the representation of the active set of channels includes descriptive text below the playback area. The descriptive text may include a name of the set of channels e.g. CTS Selection a name of the channel of the active set of channel that is presently displayed in the playback area e.g. Travel Stories an indication of the number of channels in the active set of channels e.g. Ch. 1 of 27 and a title of the presently streaming episode from the active channel e.g. Mountain Biker gets taken out by buck . Additionally the representation of the active set of channels includes episode selection arrows above and below the playback area. The episode selection arrows enable a user to cycle through available episodes within the active channel in the active set of channels. In some implementations the system immediately begins playing the selected episode as the user cycles through the episodes.

In some examples the system automatically rotates through the episodes in the active channel and the channels in the active set displayed in the representation of the active set of channels . In these examples after the first episode in the first channel in the active set completes the system automatically begins displaying video content from the second episode in the first channel in the active set. The system may cycle through all of the episodes in the first channel in the active set and then move to episodes in the second channel in the active set. The system may cycle through all of the channels in the active set in this manner and return to the first episode in the first channel in the active set after all channels in the active set have been played. Alternatively after all channels in the active set have been played the system may make the next set in the portal the active set.

Other techniques for automatically rotating through episodes channels and sets may be used. For example rather than playing all episodes from a channel in the active set the system may select one episode from the channel and then move to the next channel after the episode completes. In this example the system goes through the channels in the active set more quickly enabling the user to get a sense of the content in all channels in the active set more quickly. The number of episodes played for each channel may be selected by a content curator or the user and the episode s to display may be defined by the order of the episodes in the channel selected by the content curator or randomly selected. As the system cycles through the channels over and over the system may to the extent possible select a new episode e.g. an episode that has not been played each time a channel repeats. In some implementations the system may randomly select the episode and the channel in the active set to display. In addition although the description has focused on the playing of the episodes the system also may display content preview files in the representation of the active set of channels .

The representations of the inactive sets of channels and may be positioned on either side of the representation of the active set of channels . The representations of the inactive sets of channels and may include features similar to the representation of the active set of channels but may be shaded and of a smaller size to indicate that the representations of the inactive sets of channels and are inactive. In addition the playback area of the representations of the inactive sets of channels and may include a still image of either the first channel or a most recently viewed channel contained within the inactive sets of channels. Also the descriptive text of the representations of the inactive sets of channels and may be abbreviated. In some implementations the portal may allow a user to select one of the representations of the inactive sets of channels and in response the system may cycle through the available sets of channels by transitioning the selected inactive set of channels into an active set of channels displayed in the representation of the active set of channels . Thus the user may be able to cycle through all available sets of channels associated with the user s user identity by repeatedly selecting the representation of inactive set of channels . And by selecting the representation of inactive set of channels the user may cycle through the available sets of channels in the opposite direction. In some implementations the system immediately begins playing a first episode in a first channel of the new active set of channels after the user cycles to the new active set of channels. For example when the user cycles to the XYZ News set of channels the first episode of the first XYZ News channel will begin playing.

The first set of channels displayed by system when the portal is launched in the representation of the active set of channels may be a required set of channels for example. The set of channels in representation of inactive set of channels may be for example a user defined set of channels and the set of channels displayed in representation of inactive set of channels may be for example a non required content provider defined set of channels. In some implementations when the portal is initially launched the system immediately begins playing the first episode of the active channel in the active set of channels.

The input controls include a select input control a home input control a previous input control a flip channel input control and a show menu input control. The select input control may enable a user to select various menu commands input controls associated with points of interest or to play and pause content episodes displayed in the representation of the active set of channels. The home input control may enable a user to return the portal to a home display for example. The previous input control may enable a user to return to a previously viewed episode channel or set of channels after the user has navigated away from the previously viewed episode channel or set of channels. The flip channel input control may enable a user to cycle through channels within the active set of channels. In some implementations the system immediately begins playing a first episode in a displayed channel after the user cycles to the channel. For example when the system receives a user selection of the flip channel input control the system displays the second channel in the active set of channels and begins playing a first episode in the second channel. The show menu input control may enable the user to view a menu associated with the portal . For example a user may access interfaces and from a portal menu.

As shown in the portal may allow the user to trigger the input controls in a variety of ways. For example the user may be able to trigger the select input control by 1 clicking with a mouse or touch pad on the input control 2 by touching the input control on a touch screen 3 by pressing an Enter button on a keyboard or keypad or 4 by pushing an OK button on a remote control.

In some implementations required sets of channels and channels within required sets of channels are selected based on attributes of a user identity associated with a content presentation portal. For example required sets of channels may be selected based on viewing markets demographics viewing history interaction with points of interest time of day or seasons.

The system identifies one or more attributes of the user identity requesting access to the content delivery network . For example attributes of the user identity may include a viewing market within which a user associated with the user identity is located demographics of the user identity a psychographic profile of the user identity channels to which the user identity is subscribed a viewing history of the user identity a history of interaction with points of interest by the user identity a time of day or a season of the year.

The system accesses one or more rules related to defining system settings . For example rules related to defining system settings may include rules defining what channels to include in required sets of channels based on one or more of the user identity attributes rules defining an order of channels within a required set of channels based on one or more of the user identity attributes rules defining what sets of channels should be required for the user identity based on one or more of the user identity attributes and or rules defining an order of required sets of channels in the portal based on one or more user identity attributes. For instance a rule may require that a set of channels defined by a preferred content provider e.g. XYZ News be a required set of channels and be positioned first in user portals of all user identities in a specific viewing market e.g. a Washington D.C. viewing market . Rules may be used to comply with agreements with content providers or they may be used to promote well performing content providers. Additionally rules may be different in different viewing markets and geographical regions for example. In some implementations the rules may be prioritized or ranked. The rules may be dynamic and adaptive to changes in content content providers or advertisers for example.

The system analyzes the one or more rules related to defining system settings with respect to the one or more attributes of the user identity . For example the system analyzes the one or more rules related to defining system settings with respect to the user identity attributes to determine which rules to apply to the user identity attributes. For example system may analyze the one or more rules to determine which rules apply in the viewing market within which the user identity is located. Different content providers may serve different viewing markets for instance.

The system determines the system settings based on the analysis . For example system applies the appropriate rules to the user identity attributes to determine the appropriate channels to include in required sets of channels for the user identity an order of the channels in the required sets of channels for the user identity required sets of channels for the user identity and or an order for the required sets of channels to be presented in the user identity s portal. For example the rules may indicate that a viewing market of the user identity e.g. Washington D.C. is assigned the XYZ News set of channels and thus may determine the XYZ News set of channels as a required set of channels for the user identity. In addition the system may determine based on the rules and the user identity s viewing history that the XYZ News set of channels should be the first set of channels displayed in the user identity s content presentation portal.

The operations described above with respect to may be performed on any suitable media device e.g. a television a mobile device a computer etc. that is capable of outputting the interfaces described with respect to and receiving input from a suitable input device e.g. a remote control device a touch screen interface a mouse and keyboard etc. in performing the operations described with respect to . For example a portal may be displayed on a television and interacted with through commands received from a remote control device operated by a user perceiving the portal. In this example the user may navigate through sets of channels within the portal by providing input using the remote control device and then navigate through channels within a selected set of channels by providing input using the remote control device. In another example a portal may be displayed on a mobile device and interacted with through input e.g. touch events swiping gestures etc. applied to a touch screen interface of the mobile device. In this example the user may navigate through sets of channels within the portal by providing swiping gestures e.g. horizontal swiping gestures in a left or right direction to the touch screen interface of the mobile device and then navigate through channels within a selected set of channels by providing swiping gestures e.g. vertical swiping gestures in an up or down direction to the touch screen interface of the mobile device. In yet another example a portal may be displayed on a computer and interacted with through commands received from a mouse and or keyboard operated by a user perceiving the portal. In this example the user may navigate through sets of channels within the portal by providing input using the mouse and or keyboard and then navigate through channels within a selected set of channels by providing input using the mouse and or keyboard.

In some implementations a content curator or a system operator may compile an index channel consisting of previews or highlights from selected episodes of a single channel or from several channels so as to create a video index channel. For example in some implementations the index channel provides the user with a short preview of a particular episode and at the end of the preview a point of interest will be presented requesting whether the user would like to watch the full episode. In this example if the user responds affirmatively to the point of interest for example by pressing an appropriate button on his remote control then the portal will automatically exit the index channel and display the channel containing the full episode. Conversely if the user does not respond to the point of interest then a short preview of the next episode in the index channel will be played. The index channel may enable a user to preview and select from various episodes included within a single channel various channels included within a single set of channels or various sets of channels available to the user within the content delivery network. In other words the index channel functions as a directory for episodes channels and sets of channels available to the user from within the content delivery network and provides the user with an easy way to quickly browse through content and make a decision to either continue browsing or begin watching a full episode.

The action to take a user from one video to another video may be called hyper video. Once a user hyper videos to an episode from the index channel e.g. by responding affirmatively to the point of interest that requested whether the user would like to watch the full video the user can select a go back input control e.g. by pressing a go back button on a remote at any time and the portal will return to the user s prior location in the index channel before the user hyper videoed to the episode.

The system receives from a user identity input to display an index channel associated with a content delivery network . For example system receives an input from a user identity indicating that the user identity would like to view an index channel. An index channel may enable a user associated with the identity to preview content that is available to the user identity within the content delivery network . For instance an index channel may provide the user identity with multiple preview files that are related to content files stored on the content delivery network .

In some implementations multiple different index channels may be available for the user identity to view. In these implementations the input to display an index channel may be a user selection of a specific index channel. For example one index channel may provide the user identity with previews of content contained within a specific channel e.g. previews of episodes contained in a local XYZ News channel while a second index channel may provide the user identity with previews of content contained within a specific set of channels e.g. previews of episodes within channels contained in an XYZ News set of channels . In some examples the index channel definition may be a generic definition that is common to all user identities while in other examples the index channel definition may be unique to some or each user identity. Additional implementations may include multiple index channel definitions some index channel definitions that are generic some index channel definitions that are unique to subsets of user identities e.g. a subset of users located within a common viewing market and or some index channel definitions that are unique to each user identity.

The system accesses an index channel definition for the user identity . For example an index channel definition may include settings that define the content and various attributes of an index channel. Settings may include a listing of episodes channels or sets of channels and associated preview files to be included in the index channel a viewing sequence for the preview files and a predefined delay time between playing consecutive previews. Index channels may be defined by an operator of the delivery network by a content provider or content curator or by a user. The index channel definition will be described in more detail with respect to and .

In some implementations the index channel definition may be a generic definition that is common to all user identities while in other implementations the index channel definition may be unique to some or each user identity. Additional implementations may include multiple index channel definitions some index channel definitions that are generic some index channel definitions that are unique to subsets of user identities e.g. a subset of users located within a common viewing market and or some index channel definitions that are unique to each user identity.

The system controls display of the index channel by displaying the content preview files in the sequence defined by the accessed index channel definition and the system receives a selection to view a content file that corresponds to a content preview file being displayed . For example the system displays the selected index channel in the user identity s content presentation portal. In this example the system may initially start playing a first content preview file in the sequence of preview files defined by the accessed index channel definition. The system also may receive input from a user while a preview file is playing enabling the user to view a content file that corresponds to the playing preview file. For instance while a user is viewing a preview file for an episode of Dateline XYZ News the user may press a button e.g. an OK or Select button on a remote control to view the full episode. Conversely if a playing preview file ends without the system receiving a user input to view a full episode associated with the preview file the system may continue to monitor for a user input for a predetermined period of time before identifying and playing a next preview file in the sequence of preview files defined in the index channel definition. In some implementations the system may present an interface element e.g. a link point of interest to the full episode prompting the user to provide an input to watch the full episode associated with the ended preview file. The system may continue playing preview files in the sequence defined by the index channel definition in the described manner until the system receives an input indicating that the user would like to view a full episode. Details regarding the display format for presenting the index channel to the user are described with respect to below.

The system controls display of the selected content file . Upon receiving a selection to view a content file that corresponds to a playing preview file the system accesses the associated content file e.g. an episode and immediately begins playing the content file from the beginning. For example after a user selects to view the episode associated with a preview that the user was watching the system may immediately display the episode in a full screen view and begin playing the episode. Alternatively for example after the user selects to view the episode the system may display content presentation portal and begin playing the selected episode in the representation of the active channel set .

The system returns to display of the index channel at a position within the sequence that corresponds to the received selection . For example the system returns to a display of the index channel at the same position within the sequence of preview files that the user was viewing when the user selected to view a content file associated with the preview file. Therefore the user may continue viewing the index channel where the user left off without the need to navigate back to the same position. In some implementations position within the sequence of preview files to which system returns in the index channel is the next preview file in the sequence after the preview file which the user selected. For example if the sequence of preview files included preview file A followed by preview file B and then by preview file C and a user selected to watch the content file associated with preview file A the system when returning to display of the index channel will begin playing preview file B. Some implementations may incorporate viewing history information about the user s user identity when determining a position in the preview file sequence to which to return. For example in such implementations the user s viewing history information may indicate that the user has previously viewed the content file associated with preview file B. In this example when the system returns to display the index channel after having received the user s selection to view the content file associated with preview file A the system may skip preview file B based on the user s viewing history information and instead begin playing preview file C.

In addition there are several methods by which the system may return to displaying the index channel from playing a content file e.g. an episode . In some implementations the system may receive a user input to return to the system index channel at any time while playing a content file. In some examples when the user selected content file is finished playing the system may automatically return to the index channel at the position within the sequence that corresponds to the received selection. In additional implementations when the user selected content file is finished playing the system may identify a next content file organized in the same channel as that of the selected content file and begin playing the second content file. In these implementations the system may continue playing content files from the selected file s channel until a user input is received to return to the index channel.

In order to return to the position within the sequence that corresponds to the received selection the system may store an indication of the position within the sequence of preview files at a time that the system receives the user s selection to view a content file. For example the system may store an indication of the position e.g. a pointer within the sequence of preview files in an electronic storage location e.g. RAM . In this example the system then may access the stored indication of the position when the system returns to the index channel to begin playing the index channel at the position within the sequence that corresponds to the received selection. In some implementations the system may encapsulate the position in a location address of the selected content file. In these implementations the system may identify the position encapsulated in the location address of the content file when the system returns to the index channel to begin playing the index channel at the position within the sequence that corresponds to the received selection.

In some implementations index channels and episodes may be nested. In these implementations a user may transition from a first index channel to a second index channel that is different than the first index channel and nested within the first index channel. From the second index channel the user may then transition to an episode or another index channel nested within the second index channel. When the user transitions to an episode within the second index channel the user may return from the episode to the second index channel at a position corresponding to the selection of the episode and then transition back to the first index channel at a position corresponding to the selection of the second index channel. Any number of nesting relationships may be used in index channels and episodes within the content delivery network and users may traverse through the nesting relationships using the techniques described throughout this disclosure.

Referring to interface illustrates an example interface for defining an index channel for sets of channels e.g. a set level index channel . Interface includes a set level index channel viewing pane and an available sets viewing pane . The set level index channel viewing pane displays icons representing the sets of channels that have been added to the set level index channel. For example a Set icon a Set icon a Set icon a Set icon a Set icon a Set icon and a Set icon have each been added to the set level index channel. The set level viewing pane also includes viewing pane scroll inputs and that enable a user to scroll through the channel set icons representing channel sets included in the set level index channel. For example the set level index channel may include more channel set icons than can be displayed within the set level index channel viewing pane . In this example the scroll inputs and allow a user to scroll in either direction through all of the channel set icons that have been added to the set level index channel. In some implementations the order in which the channel set icons are displayed within the set level index channel viewing pane defines a sequence in which preview files from the included channel sets should be played in the set level index channel. In such implementations the user may alter the sequence by dragging and dropping channel set icons from one position in the set level index channel viewing pane to a new position within the set level index channel viewing pane . For example if a user wants preview files associated with Set to play first the user may drag the Set icon from its current position to a new position to the left of the Set icon .

The available sets viewing pane displays all of the channel sets that are available for the user to add to the set level index channel. For example the available channel viewing pane includes a Set A icon a Set B icon a Set C icon a Set D icon a Set E icon a Set F icon and a Set G icon . As with the set level index channel viewing pane all of the channel sets available to the user may not be displayed within the available channel viewing pane so the available sets viewing pane also may include viewing pane scroll inputs and to allow a user to scroll through all of the available channel sets. In addition the available sets viewing pane includes a search input box . The search input box may enable a user to enter a textual search query for a specific channel set and upon receiving the textual search query the channel sets displayed in the available sets viewing pane may be filtered to show only those channel sets that match the textual search query.

Channel sets may be added to the set level index channel by dragging and dropping a set icon from the available sets viewing pane to the set level index channel viewing pane . Likewise channel sets may be removed from the set level index channel by dragging and dropping a set icon from the set level index channel viewing pane to the available sets viewing pane .

In addition the interface includes several index channel setting inputs and . The channels previewed before moving to next set setting input enables a user to define the number preview files from each set of channels to be played. As shown the setting input enables a user to select from three options playing all of the preview files associated with each channel set playing one preview file associated with each channel set or a custom option in which the user may define the number of preview files to play from each channel set. After the defined number of preview files have been played the index channel will begin playing one or more preview files from the next channel set in the sequence of channel sets as defined in the set level index channel preview pane .

The time between previews setting input enables a user to define the length of time that the system will monitor for a user selection of content associated with a preview file after the preview file has finished playing and before beginning to play the next preview file in the sequence of preview files for the index channel. For example as shown a user has entered a three second monitoring period in the setting input . In this example when a preview file finishes playing in the index channel the system will monitor for a user input for three seconds before playing the next preview file in the defined sequence.

The preview selection setting input enables a user to choose an order in which multiple preview files from each channel set should be played. As shown the setting input provides a user the options of playing preview files from each set of channels in an order defined by the channel or a random order. For example an order defined by channel may indicate that preview files associated with channels within each set of channels should be played in the order in which the channels in the set of channels are ordered until the proper number of preview files as indicated by the setting input have been played. Conversely a random order may indicate that the system will randomly choose preview files that are associated with a set of channels to be played until the proper number of preview files as indicated by the setting input have been played.

Referring to interface illustrates an example interface for defining an index channel for channels e.g. a channel level index channel of channels in Set . Interface includes a Set index channel viewing pane and an available channels viewing pane . The Set index channel viewing pane displays icons representing the channels that have been added to the Set index channel from among all the channels available in channel Set . For example a Channel icon a Channel icon a Channel icon a Channel icon a Channel icon a Channel icon and a Channel icon have each been added to the Set index channel. The Set index channel viewing pane also includes viewing pane scroll inputs and that enable a user to scroll through the channel icons representing channels included in the Set index channel. For example the Set index channel may include more channel icons than can be displayed within the Set index channel viewing pane . In this example the scroll inputs and allow a user to scroll in either direction through all of the channel icons that have been added to the set level index channel. In some implementations the order in which the channel icons are displayed within the Set index channel viewing pane defines a sequence in which preview files from the included channels should be played in the Set index channel. In such implementations the user may alter the sequence by dragging and dropping channel icons from one position in the Set index channel viewing pane to a new position within the Set index channel viewing pane . For example if a user wants preview files associated with Channel to play first the user may drag the Channel icon from its current position to a new position to the left of the Channel icon .

The available channels viewing pane displays all of the channels that are available in Set . For example the available channels viewing pane includes a Channel A icon a Channel B icon a Channel C icon a Channel D icon a Channel E icon a Channel F icon and a Channel G icon . As with the Set index channel viewing pane all of the channels available in Set may not be displayed within the available channels viewing pane so the available channels viewing pane also may include viewing pane scroll inputs and to allow a user to scroll through all of the available channels. In addition the available channels viewing pane includes a search input box . The search input box may enable a user to enter a textual search query for a specific channel and upon receiving the textual search query the channel icons displayed in the available channels viewing pane may be filtered to show only those channel icons that match the textual search query.

Channels may be added to the Set index channel by dragging and dropping a channel icon from the available channels viewing pane to the Set index channel viewing pane . Likewise channels may be removed from the Set index channel by dragging and dropping a channel icon from the Set index channel viewing pane to the available channels viewing pane .

In addition the interface includes several index channel setting inputs and . The episodes previewed before moving to next set setting input enables a user to define the number preview files from each channel to be played. As shown the setting input enables a user to select from three options playing all of the preview files associated with each channel playing one preview file associated with each channel or a custom option in which the user may define the number of preview files to play from each channel. After the defined number of preview files have been played the Set index channel will begin playing one or more preview files from the next channel in the sequence of channels as defined in the Set index channel preview pane .

The time between previews setting input enables a user to define the length of time that the system will monitor for a user selection of content associated with a preview file after the preview file has finished playing and before beginning to play the next preview file in the sequence of preview files for the Set index channel. For example as shown a user has entered a three second monitoring period in the setting input . In this example when a preview file finishes playing in the Set index channel the system will monitor for a user input for three seconds before playing the next preview file in the defined sequence.

The preview selection setting input enables a user to choose an order in which multiple preview files from each channel set should be played. As shown the setting input provides a user the options of playing preview files from each channel in an order defined by the channel or a random order. For example an order defined by the channel may indicate that preview files associated with episodes within each channel should be played in the order in which the episodes in the channel are ordered until the proper number of preview files as indicated by the setting input have been played. Conversely a random order may indicate that the system will randomly choose preview files that are associated with a channel to be played until the proper number of preview files as indicated by the setting input have been played.

In some implementations index channel definitions are determined for a user identity based on attributes of the user identity. For example index channel definitions may be determined based on channel set channel subscriptions viewing history viewing markets demographics interaction with points of interest time of day or seasons.

As shown in the hierarchy includes a set level index channel that includes sets from a first set to an nth set. The first set in the set level index channel is related to a first set index channel that includes channels organized within the first set and the nth set in the set level index channel is related to an nth set index channel that includes channels organized within the nth set. The first set index channel includes channels from a first channel in the first set to an nth channel in the first set and the nth set index channel includes channels from a first channel in the nth set to an nth channel in the nth set.

The first channel in the first set index channel is related to a first channel from first set index channel that includes episodes organized within the first channel in the first set and the nth channel in the first set index channel is related to an nth channel from first set index channel that includes episodes organized within the nth channel in the first set. The first channel from first set index channel includes episodes from a first episode in the first channel from the first set to an nth episode in the first channel from the first set and the nth channel from first set index channel includes episodes from a first episode in the nth channel from the first set to an nth episode in the nth channel from the first set.

The first channel in the nth set index channel is related to a first channel from nth set index channel that includes episodes organized within the first channel in the nth set and the nth channel in the nth set index channel is related to an nth channel from nth set index channel that includes episodes organized within the nth channel in the nth set. The first channel from nth set index channel includes episodes from a first episode in the first channel from the nth set to an nth episode in the first channel from the nth set and the nth channel from nth set index channel includes episodes from a first episode in the nth channel from the nth set to an nth episode in the nth channel from the nth set.

The index channel has a parent relationship to the index channels and and a grandparent relationship to the index channels and . The index channels and have a child relationship to the index channel and a parent relationship to the index channels and . The index channels and have a child relationship to the index channels and and a grandchild relationship to the index channel .

The set index channel representation illustrates the sets of channels arranged in the set index channel representation . In this example the set index channel representation includes the sets of channels illustrated in such that the set index channel representation includes all of the sets of channels included in the portal of the user identity. As shown the set index channel representation includes a preferred curator set a system set a user s set Ken s set Curator set Curator set and Curator set . The double lines in the center of the set index channel representation indicate the set that corresponds to the content preview file being displayed in the display area . In the example shown in a content preview file selected from Ken s set has just completed playing in the display area .

In some implementations a user may be able to provide input to move the sets in the set index channel representation to cause a different set to be positioned within the double lines and as a consequence change the position within the set index channel and cause a content preview file from a different set of channels to be displayed. In these implementations the sets in the set index channel representation may be moved using left or right arrow inputs or through a click or touch and drag operation.

In addition a user may provide input selecting one of the sets in the set index channel representation . Selection of a set represented in the set index channel representation may cause display of an index channel for the selected set. In this regard selection of a set represented in the set index channel representation may result in traversing to a lower level in the hierarchy of index channels shown in . For instance selection of a set represented in the set index channel representation may result in the display of the index channel shown in being replaced with the display of the index channel shown in discussed below.

In some examples the set index channel representation automatically rotates to the next set in the set index channel as each content preview file completes and the user does not provide input to view the episode associated with the content preview file. In these examples when a content preview file completes the system may display a message indicating that the content preview file will be switched to a new content preview file to the extent the user does not provide input selecting to view the episode corresponding to the content preview file within a threshold period of time. As shown in the system has detected completion of the content preview file selected from Ken s set displays the message to indicate that the user has three seconds to select the content preview file selected from Ken s set waits for three seconds for the user to provide input selecting the content preview file and then moves to a content preview file from the next set within the set index channel based on a determination that input selecting the content preview file has not been received by the expiration of the three seconds. Providing the message and waiting a short period of time may be helpful to alert the user that the content preview file has ended and the system is transitioning to the next set in the set index channel. The period of time that the system waits prior to transitioning to the next set may be defined by a content curator and or the user.

The system may use a variety of techniques to select which content preview file from the set to display. For example the system may use the order of channels in the set and the order of episodes in the channels to select the content preview file. In this example when the index channel first displays a particular set the system selects a content preview file for the first episode arranged in the first channel in the particular set. The next time the index channel displays the particular set the system may display a content preview file for the second episode arranged in the first channel in the particular set or a content preview file for the first episode arranged in the second channel in the particular set depending on the preference of the content provider associated with the particular set and or the user.

In another example the content provider associated with the particular set may select an order for the content preview files displayed for the particular set that diverges from the order defined by the set or channels within the set. For instance although it may make sense to view a series of episodes in a channel chronologically the content provider may select a content preview file from a later episode to be displayed first because the content preview file from the later episode may present a more interesting storyline and may be more likely to get user s interested in the channel. Similarly although it may make sense to arranged channels in a set alphabetically the content provider may select to display a content preview file from a channel that is arranged later in the alphabetic list first because that channel is the most popular.

Further selection of the content preview file to display for a set may be randomly selected. For example when the index channel is positioned at a particular set the system may randomly select a channel within the set and then randomly select a content preview file from the randomly selected channel. In this example rules may specify that all content preview files within the particular set must be displayed once prior to any content preview files in the particular set being played twice. Rules also may specify that a content preview file from each channel must be displayed before any channel is repeated.

Although have been described in terms of the index channel moving to the next set after a single content preview file from the set has been played other implementations are possible. For instance the system may play all content preview files from a set before moving to the next set. Alternatively the system may play one content preview file from each channel in a set before moving to the next set. Any number or combination of content preview files may be displayed before moving to the next set and a content curator and or the user may define how the system plays content preview files in automatically moving through the set index channel.

The channel index channel representation illustrates the channels arranged in the channel index channel representation . In this example the channel index channel representation includes channels organized in a set of channels such as a set of channels to which the user has subscribed. As shown the channel index channel representation includes a first channel a second channel a third channel a fourth channel a fifth channel a sixth channel and a seventh channel . The double lines in the center of the channel index channel representation indicate the channel that corresponds to the content preview file being displayed in the display area . In the example shown in a content preview file selected from the fourth channel has just completed playing in the display area .

In some implementations a user may be able to provide input to move the channels in the channel index channel representation to cause a different channel to be positioned within the double lines and as a consequence change the position within the channel index channel and cause a content preview file from a different channel to be displayed. In these implementations the channels in the channel index channel representation may be moved using left or right arrow inputs or through a click or touch and drag operation.

In addition a user may provide input selecting one of the channels in the channel index channel representation . Selection of a channel represented in the channel index channel representation may cause display of an index channel for the selected channel. In this regard selection of a channel represented in the channel index channel representation may result in traversing to a lower level in the hierarchy of index channels shown in . For instance selection of a channel represented in the channel index channel representation may result in the display of the index channel shown in being replaced with the display of the index channel shown in discussed below.

In some examples the channel index channel representation automatically rotates to the next channel in the channel index channel as each content preview file completes and the user does not provide input to view the episode associated with the content preview file.

Providing the message and waiting a short period of time may be helpful to alert the user that the content preview file has ended and the system is transitioning to the next channel in the channel index channel.

For instance although it may make sense to view a series of episodes in a channel chronologically the content curator may select a content preview file from a later episode to be displayed first because the content preview file from the later episode may present a more interesting storyline and may be more likely to get user s interested in the channel.

Further selection of the content preview file to display for a channel may be randomly selected. For example when the index channel is positioned at a particular channel the system may randomly select an episode from the particular channel and use a content preview file that corresponds to the selected episode. In this example rules may specify that all content preview files within the particular channel must be displayed once prior to any content preview files in the particular channel being played twice.

Although have been described in terms of the index channel moving to the next channel after a single content preview file from the channel has been played other implementations are possible.

Any number or combination of content preview files may be displayed before moving to the next channel and a content curator and or the user may define how the system plays content preview files in automatically moving through the channel index channel.

The episode index channel representation illustrates the episodes arranged in the episode index channel representation . In this example the episode index channel representation includes episodes organized in a channel such as a channel to which the user has subscribed. As shown the episode index channel representation includes a first episode a second episode a third episode a fourth episode a fifth episode a sixth episode and a seventh episode . The double lines in the center of the episode index channel representation indicate the episode that corresponds to the content preview file being displayed in the display area . In the example shown in a content preview file for the fourth episode has just completed playing in the display area .

In some implementations a user may be able to provide input to move the episodes in the episode index channel representation to cause a different episode to be positioned within the double lines and as a consequence change the position within the episode index channel and cause a content preview file from a different episode to be displayed. In these implementations the episodes in the episode index channel representation may be moved using left or right arrow inputs or through a click or touch and drag operation.

In some examples the episode index channel representation automatically rotates to the next episode in the episode index channel as each content preview file completes and the user does not provide input to view the episode associated with the content preview file. In these examples when a content preview file completes the system may display a message indicating that the content preview file will be switched to a new content preview file to the extent the user does not provide input selecting to view the episode corresponding to the content preview file within a threshold period of time. As shown in the system has detected completion of the content preview file selected from the fourth episode displays the message to indicate that the user has three seconds to select the content preview file selected from the fourth episode waits for three seconds for the user to provide input selecting the content preview file and then moves to a content preview file from the next episode within the episode index channel based on a determination that input selecting the content preview file has not been received by the expiration of the three seconds. Providing the message and waiting a short period of time may be helpful to alert the user that the content preview file has ended and the system is transitioning to the next episode in the episode index channel. The period of time that the system waits prior to transitioning to the next episode may be defined by a content curator and or the user.

The system identifies one or more attributes of the user identity . For example attributes of the user identity may include channels channel sets to which the user identity subscribes a viewing history of the user identity a history of interaction with points of interest by the user identity a viewing market within which a user associated with the user identity is located demographics of the user identity a psychographic profile of the user identity a time of day or a season of the year.

The system accesses one or more rules related to defining index channels . For example rules related to defining an index channel may include rules defining what channels channel sets to include in an index channel based on one or more of the user identity attributes rules defining an order of channels channel sets within an index channel based on one or more of the user identity attributes and or rules defining what index channels to provide to the user identity based on one or more of the user identity attributes. For instance a rule may require that channels channel sets to which the user identity subscribes must be included in an index channel. In another example a rule may define one or more channels channel sets to which the user identity is not subscribed but which are similar to the channels channel sets to which the user identity is subscribed. In addition rules may be used to comply with agreements with content providers or they may be used to promote well performing content providers. Additionally rules may be different in different viewing markets and geographical regions for example. In some implementations the rules may be prioritized or ranked. The rules may be dynamic and adaptive to changes in content content providers or advertisers.

The system analyzes the one or more rules related to defining index channels with respect to the one or more attributes of the user identity . For example the system analyzes the one or more rules related to defining index channels with respect to the user identity attributes to determine which rules to apply to the user identity attributes. For example system may analyze the one or more rules to determine which rules apply based on the user identity s viewing history or the channels channel sets to which the user identity subscribes. In another example system may analyze the one or more rules to determine which rules apply in the viewing market within which the user identity is located. Different content providers may serve different viewing markets for instance.

The system determines the index channel definition based on the analysis . For example system applies the appropriate rules to the user identity attributes to determine the appropriate channels channel sets to include in an index channel for the user identity an order of the channels channel sets in the index channel for the user identity and or which index channels to provide to the user identity.

For example index channels may be displayed on a television and interacted with through commands received from a remote control device operated by a user perceiving the index channels. In this example the user may navigate through the index channels by providing input using the remote control device and then select episodes and return to index channels e.g. hyper video by providing input using the remote control device. In another example index channels may be displayed on a mobile device and interacted with through input e.g. touch events swiping gestures etc. applied to a touch screen interface of the mobile device. In this example the user may navigate through index channels by providing swiping gestures e.g. horizontal swiping gestures in a left or right direction to the touch screen interface of the mobile device and then select episodes and return to index channels e.g. hyper video by providing touch events to the touch screen interface of the mobile device. In yet another example index channels may be displayed on a computer and interacted with through commands received from a mouse and or keyboard operated by a user perceiving the index channels. In this example the user may navigate through index channels by providing input using the mouse and or keyboard and then select episodes and return to index channels e.g. hyper video by providing input using the mouse and or keyboard.
