MicroRNAs are a broad class of small non coding RNAs that control diverse biological processes including major signaling pathways by regulating the expression of complementary target mRNAs Ambros 2004 . Dysregulation of microRNAs in various disease entities is caused by alterations in the genome Mi et al. 2007 differential expression or viral infections in some cases changing microRNA function into tumor suppressors or oncogenes. MicroRNAs were recently implicated in the regulation of diverse cardiac functions in a series of elegant genetic studies Care et al. 2007 Yang et al. 2007 . Although these studies help to delineate the roles of microRNA in heart physiology growth and morphogenesis detailed molecular mechanisms for microRNAs in disease pathways in vivo are poorly understood. Single stranded oligonucleotide microRNA antagonists have been shown to silence endogenous microRNAs in vitro and in vivo with resulting effects on target mRNA and protein levels and metabolism Kruetzfeldt et al. 2005 Esau et al. 2006 . These findings pointed to the application of microRNA antagonists for in vivo validation of microRNA function and perhaps more importantly as a novel therapeutic modality.

It is discovered herein that modified oligonucleotides complementary to miR 21 are pharmaceutical agents for the inhibition of miR 21. In certain embodiments the modified oligonucleotides are administered to a subject having a disease characterized by the upregulation of miR 21. In certain embodiments the disease is cancer. In certain embodiments the disease is heart failure. In certain embodiments the disease is fibrosis. Fibrosis results from the development of excess fibrous connective tissue in an organ or tissue in response to damage or injury. Left untreated fibrosis can lead to a variety of conditions of the heart lungs kidney liver and skin among other tissues.

It is discovered herein that fibroblast derived miR 21 plays a critical role in fibrosis. Enhancement of miR 21 levels promoted fibroblast survival whereas suppression of endogenous miR 21 induced apoptotic cell death. Thus herein identified is a mechanism by which miR 21 regulates fibroblast survival. Aberrant fibroblast proliferation and survival may lead to fibrosis. Accordingly modified oligonucleotides complementary to miR 21 are pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of fibrosis. In certain embodiments a modified oligonucleotide complementary to miR 21 is an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to miR 21.

The inventors demonstrate a critical role of fibroblast derived miR 21 and SPRY1 in the heart . The data suggest that stress induced and miRNA mediated activation of ERK MAPkinase activity may importantly regulate cardiac fibrosis. This study represents the first example of a microRNA therapeutic application in a disease model. Specifically antagonizing miR 21 prevented the structural and functional deterioration in a murine model. These findings suggest a new therapeutic entry point for heart failure and show the broad therapeutic potential of microRNA antagonists.

The invention particularly concerns cardiac specific diseases involving fibrosis fibrosis related diseases like cardiac hypertrophy hypertensive heart disease diastolic and systolic heart failure storage diseases related to heart such as M. Fabry cardiomyopathies e.g. dilatative cardiomyopathy hypertrophic cardio myopathy with and without obstruction restrictive cardiomyopathy arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and other forms of cardiomyopathy like e.g. diabetic cardiomyopathy constrictive pericarditis coronary artery disease myocardial infarction acute and chronic right heart failure cardiac arrhythmias due to fibrosis myocarditis related fibrosis diseases of the heart valves leading to valve stenosis or insufficiency e.g. sclerosis e.g. mitral valve stenosis and or insufficiency aortic valve stenosis and or insufficiency tricuspidal valve stenosis and or insufficiency pulmonary valve stenosis and or insufficiency.

In certain embodiments one or more modified oligonucleotides of the present invention is formulated as a prodrug. In certain embodiments upon in vivo administration a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically pharmaceutically or therapeutically more active form of a modified oligonucleotide. In certain embodiments prodrugs are useful because they are easier to administer than the corresponding active form. For example in certain instances a prodrug may be more bioavailable e.g. through oral administration than is the corresponding active form. In certain instances a prodrug may have improved solubility compared to the corresponding active form. In certain embodiments prodrugs are less water soluble than the corresponding active form. In certain instances such prodrugs possess superior transmittal across cell membranes where water solubility is detrimental to mobility. In certain embodiments a prodrug is an ester. In certain such embodiments the ester is metabolically hydrolyzed to carboxylic acid upon administration. In certain instances the carboxylic acid containing compound is the corresponding active form. In certain embodiments a prodrug comprises a short peptide polyaminoacid bound to an acid group. In certain of such embodiments the peptide is cleaved upon administration to form the corresponding active form.

In certain embodiments a prodrug is produced by modifying a pharmaceutically active compound such that the active compound will be regenerated upon in vivo administration. The prodrug can be designed to alter the metabolic stability or the transport characteristics of a drug to mask side effects or toxicity to improve the flavor of a drug or to alter other characteristics or properties of a drug. By virtue of knowledge of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism in vivo those of skill in this art once a pharmaceutically active compound is known can design prodrugs of the compound see e.g. Nogrady 1985 Medicinal Chemistry A Biochemical Approach Oxford University Press New York pages 388 392 .

Microarray analysis in a transgenic mouse model of cardiac failure heart restricted overexpression of the 1 adrenergic receptor Engelhardt et al. 1999 revealed progressive de regulation of the cardiac microRNA expression signature with increasing severity of the disease . While miR 21 expression was modest in normal myocardium this microRNA was among the strongest regulated microRNAs in the failing heart. In fact in mice with end stage heart failure miR 21 was the single strongest upregulated microRNA . Quantitative Northern blot analysis confirmed upregulation of miR 21 in the mouse and further revealed a marked upregulation in human heart failure . Increased expression of the miR 21 precursor as assessed by Northern blotting suggested a transcriptional mechanism. Thus the human miR 21 promoter was studied in more detail. A miR 21 promoter region was identified and is highly conserved in several species . Studies on human miR 21 expression confirmed its transcriptional regulation by two transcription factors calcium cAMP response element protein CREB and serum response factor SRF which are classically activated during the cardiac stress response. Deletion of CREB and mutation of the SRF binding sites in the miR 21 promoter resulted in markedly decreased miR 21 expression in response to serum stimulation indicating a major role for these two transcription factors in miR 21 regulation . An essential role for miR 21 in cardiac morphology and function was detected by a morpholino based approach in a biased screen to knock down several ubiquitously expressed microRNAs in zebrafish. Knockdown of miR 21 led to a dramatic impairment of cardiac structure and function . More than 95 of injected animals displayed massive pericardial effusions FIG. inset and and impaired ventricular function as determined by video microscopy .

To study these essential functions of miR 21 in the mammalian heart in further detail the inventors modulated miR 21 expression in isolated cardiomyocytes. The inventors transfected synthetic miR 21 precursors as well as antisense miR 21 inhibitors routinely achieving 95 transfection efficiency of oligonucleotide delivery . Overexpression of miR 21 led to a robust enhancement of mature miR 21 while inhibition of miR 21 completely suppressed endogenous miR 21 expression as determined by Northern blot analysis . However neither enhancement nor suppression of miR 21 levels in cardiomyocytes significantly affected the morphology size or number of primary rat cardiomyocytes under resting conditions or under conditions of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy . Cardiomyocyte specific miR 21 transgenic mice overexpressing miR 21 25 fold relative to wildtype littermates displayed no obvious cardiac phenotype with intact structure of the left ventricular myocardium and absence of interstitial fibrosis bottom . Contrary to the substantially increased miR 21 expression in the failing heart these data show that manipulation of miR 21 expression levels in isolated cardiomyocytes and cardiomyocyte specific miR 21 transgenic mice models fails to corroborate a significant function of miR 21 in the heart as indicated by the observed effects in zebrafish and the substantially increased miR 21 expression in the failing heart. Therefore the inventors next explored a potential role of miR 21 in a non cardiomyocyte cell type e.g. cardiac fibroblasts. Using in situ hybridization weak miR 21 signals were detected in normal myocardium whereas in failing myocardium the hybridization signal was greatly enhanced. At high magnification the hybridization signal was restricted primarily to small interstitial cells presumably cardiac fibroblasts. Using a pre plating procedure the inventors fractionated neonatal rat hearts into a cardiomyocyte and fibroblast fraction. Indeed the inventors detected endogenous miR 21 expression primarily in cardiac fibroblasts .

MiR 21 expression is selectively increased in various human cancers Lu et al. 2005 lorio et al. 2005 and was shown to contribute to tumor growth and spread by diverse mechanisms in different cells. Since miR 21 appears to target distinct mRNAs in a cell type specific manner the inventors decided to investigate potential heart specific miR 21 targets. Using a bioinformatic approach the inventors screened several microRNA databases for potential miR 21 targets with 3 UTR comprising seed sequences and matching flanking nucleotides and focused this analysis on candidates with reported cardiac expression. A summary is depicted in Table 1 below.

A screen for theoretical miR 21 targets revealed 22 known potential target genes of which 8 were previously shown to be expressed within cardiac tissue. Combination of three different target prediction tools identified Spry1 sprouty1 as a highly likely candidate. Sprouty1 SPRY1 a known inhibitor of the Ras MEK ERK pathway Hanafusa et al. 2002 Casci et al. 1999 emerged as a potential target due to its high score and significant expression level in the heart Table 1 . The 3 UTR of the Spry1 mRNA contains several predicted microRNA binding sites of which only one corresponds to a microRNA highly upregulated during cardiac disease miR 21 see . To determine the cell type in which Spry1 is expressed the inventors employed an allele of Spry1 in which the lacZ gene replaces part of the Spry1 coding sequence. Assays for lacZ expression showed prominent staining in the adult mouse heart . Higher magnification identified a spotted pattern of Spry1 expression originating from interstitial fibroblasts lower panel . Thus both miR 21 and its putative target Spry1 are co expressed in cardiac fibroblasts and not in the cardiomyocyte fraction. In accordance with these observations no detectable downregulation of SPRY1 expression was found in transgenic mice overexpressing miR 21 in a cardiomyocyte specific manner. In addition cardiac CREB the transcriptional activator of miR 21 expression is localized exclusively in fibroblasts. The inventors then tested the relevance of these findings to human disease. Indeed analysis of left ventricular cardiac tissue samples from patients with end stage heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy demonstrated increased miR 21 expression and significant repression of SPRY1 protein expression . These findings were accompanied by activation of ERK MAPkinase as evidenced by an increased phospho ERK ERK ratio .

MiR 21 functions were then characterized in co cultures of interstitial fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes to mimic the composition of intact cardiac tissue. The inventors assessed miR 21 function by transfection of synthetic miR 21 precursor molecules or inhibitors. Increasing miR 21 induced a strong repression of SPRY1 protein expression and increased ERK MAPkinase activation . SiRNA mediated Spry1 silencing likewise resulted in ERK MAPkinase activation . The inventors next evaluated whether miR 21 mediated derepression of fibroblast ERK MAPkinase signaling would suffice to affect fibroblast survival. In agreement with a potential role of ERK MAPkinase signaling in myocardial fibrosis enhancement of miR 21 levels promoted cardiac fibroblast survival whereas suppression of endogenous miR 21 induced apoptotic cell death . The inventors also found miR 21 based regulation of SPRY1 expression to be critical for the secretory function of cardiac fibroblasts as both overexpression of miR 21 as well as siRNA mediated silencing of SPRY1 expression significantly augmented secretion of fibroblast growth factor 2 FGF2 into the supernatant . This study thus delineated a novel signaling paradigm in the failing heart where re expression of miR 21 during cardiac disease augments ERK MAPkinase activity through inhibition of SPRY1. In the mammalian heart this mechanism may regulate fibroblast survival and thereby critically govern the extent of interstitial fibrosis and cardiac remodeling.

To evaluate the function of miR 21 in vivo in a normal setting and in heart failure miR 21 activity was inhibited using modified oligonucleotide complementary to miR 21 miR 21 antagonist . A pressure overload induced hypertrophy mouse model in was used as a model for human heart failure. In this model a reproducible cardiac stress response is achieved through transverse aortic constriction TAC . This model highly resembles the failing human heart due to its matching pattern of both microRNA and mRNA changes in global expression profiles Thum et al. 2007 .

To determine the localization of antagomir 21 within the heart a Cy 3 labeled antagomir 21 was injected intravenously via a jugular vein catheter. Strong staining throughout the left ventricular myocardium was observed indicating that modified oligonucleotides complementary to miR 21 achieve distribution to cardiac tissue. The miR 21 antagonist comprised 2 O methyl sugars at each nucleoside two phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages at the 5 most end of the oligonucleotide three phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages at the 3 most end of the oligonucleotide and a cholesterol linked through a hydroxyprolinol linker. miR 21 antagonists had the nucleobase sequence of SEQ ID NO 1 or SEQ ID NO 12. Untreated sham or TAC operated mice were treated with antagomir 21 or a control oligonucleotide at doses of 80 mg kg for three consecutive days. Treatment with antagomir 21 strongly repressed elevated cardiac miR 21 expression for up to three weeks as determined in Northern blots and real time PCR analysis . This treatment completely reversed TAC induced downregulation of SPRY1 and ERK MAPkinase activation during pressure overload to levels observed in sham operated mice . Interstitial fibrosis and heart weight were significantly increased three weeks after TAC in untreated mice but were strongly attenuated by antagomir 21 treatment . Indeed collagen content of the myocardium was essentially normalized by antagomir 21 treatment. Further where heart weight doubled three weeks after TAC antagomir 21 treatment prevented hypertrophy. In sham operated mice treatment with antagomir 21 did not result in significant changes in cardiac weight or interstitial fibrosis indicating no discernable effect of miR 21 antagonism on the normal heart or overt cardiotoxicity of antagomir 21 treatment. After TAC operation and antagomir 21 treatment global transcriptome analysis revealed normalization of various deregulated genes . Specifically genes highly upregulated during cardiac fibrosis such as collagen 1 1 collagen 3 1 biglycan fibromodulin or connective tissue growth factor were reduced after specific inhibition of miR 21 by 42 39 44 38 and 37 respectively lower panel . In further studies cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography. Left ventricular end diastolic diameters increased significantly three weeks after TAC and fractional shortening was impaired as is commonly observed in human heart failure. When compared with controls antagomir 21 treatment prevented left ventricular dilatation and normalized parameters of fractional shortening essentially to levels observed in sham operated animals . Similar results were obtained with antagomir 21 treatment in an isoproterenol induced cardiac disease model.

An additional experiment was performed in which mice were subject to pressure overload of the left ventricle for three weeks before treatment with antagomir 21. During this period the animals displayed significant left ventricular hypertrophy fibrosis and impaired cardiac function. After this three week time period mice were treated with antagomir 21 and observed for an additional three weeks. Whereas animals treated with control displayed progressive impairment of left ventricular function as well as interstitial fibrosis and cardiac hypertrophy animals treated with antagomir 21 showed significant attenuation of the impairment of cardiac function as well as regression of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.

These data demonstrate a critical role for fibroblast derived miR 21 and SPRY1 in the heart. Abnormal expression of miR 21 in cardiac fibroblasts inhibits SPRY1 protein expression resulting in augmentation of ERK MAP kinase activity. In turn this enhances cardiac fibroblast survival and thereby the interstitial fibrosis and cardiac remodeling that is characteristic of the failing heart. This model summarized in assigns a primary role to cardiac fibroblast activation in myocardial disease. Antagonizing miR 21 in the murine model of heart disease prevented structural and function deterioration. Accordingly the present invention provides methods for the treatment of fibrosis comprising administering a modified oligonucleotide complementary to miR 21. The present invention further provides methods for the treatment of fibrosis related to cardiac disease comprising administering a modified oligonucleotide complementary to miR 21.

Malignant transformation of normal to cancer cells requires the acquisition of several oncogenic traits such as uncontrolled cell division resistance to programmed cell death apoptosis invasion and angiogenesis. Genetic alterations often result in constitutive activation of common downstream signal transduction pathways such as the mitogen activated protein MAP kinase cascade involving c RAF 1 MEK 1 ERK 1 2 p38 and JNK and others. Mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK cascades are key signaling pathways involved in the regulation of normal cell proliferation survival and differentiation. Aberrant regulation of MAPK cascades contribute to cancer and other human diseases. In particular the extracellular signal regulated kinase ERK MAPK pathway has been the subject of intense research leading to the development of pharmacologic inhibitors for the treatment of cancer. In normal cells it is well established that the activation of the kinase ERK 1 2 is regulated by receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGF receptors and platelet derived growth factor receptors PDGFRs via activation of Ras which in turn activates the RAF 1 MEK I ERK 1 2 cascade. Because this signal transduction pathway is hyperactivated in many human cancers inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases Ras c RAF 1 and MEK 1 have all been developed and are at various stages of development. The treatment of cancer may therefore be possible by administering an effective amount of an inhibitor of the RAF 1 MEK I P ERK 1 2 pathway.

Sprouty SPRY is a family of intracellular proteins that are endogenous regulators of receptor tyrosine kinase pathways such as the Ras MAP kinase pathway. Mammalian species express four isoforms of Sprouty which act as inhibitors of growth factor induced cellular differentiation migration and proliferation. The inventors identified sprouty 1 to inhibit ERK phosphorylation which may result in modulation of tumor formation. The inventors suggest that upregulation of miR 21 in many human cancers inhibits sprouty 1 thus activating ERK to result in enhanced tumor formation and progression. Antagonism of miR 21 e.g. by an antagomir 21 is therefore able to prevent and or attenuate tumor formation and or progression.

Here the inventors studied in detail expression of Spry 1 and Erk activation after transfection of scrambled miR 50 nmol L 72 hours miR 21 precursor molecules 50 nmol L 72 hours or miR 21 antagonists 50 nmol L 72 hours . In separate experiments scrambled siRNA or a specific siRNA cocktail against Spry1 three different microRNAs 16.7 nmol L each were transfected to the co culture. Transfection efficiency was monitored by realtime PCR measurements TaqMan MicroRNA Assays Applied Biosystems and Northern blotting.

The miRanda algorithm Griffiths Jones et al. 2006 was used to scan for potential miR 21 binding sites in 3 UTR sequences of the human and murine genome. Subsequently Karlin Altschul normalization was performed miRBase Targets version 4.0 http microrna.sanger.ac.uk targets v4 . In detail the inventors used the miRBase data base Version 4 Sanger Institute USA and sorted potential miR 21 targets by using the algorithms high number of conserved species 6 low p value 15. This procedure revealed 22 known genes to be potential miR 21 targets of which 8 were previously shown to be expressed within heart tissue based on their GEO expression profile http www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov geo see Table 1 . 5 genes were additionally predicted as miR 21 targets using the PicTar miRNA data base 9 Krek et al. 2005 http pictar.bio.nyu.edu . Using the TargetScan miRNA target prediction software Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research USA Release 4.0 July 2007 http www.targetscan.org the inventors identified targets with conserved sites with 8 mer seed matches for miR 21 only for two targets. Spry1 was then studied in more detail.

Protein lysates from explanted hearts or cultured fibroblasts cardiomyocytes were prepared as described Buitrago et al. 2005 . Extracts 20 50 g protein per lane were mixed with sample loading buffer and under reducing conditions separated on 10 SDS polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were electrotransferred onto PVDF membrane Immun Blot Bio Rad . The bands were detected using a chemiluminescence assay ECL Plus Amersham . The inventors used primary antibodies against sprouty 1 Santa Cruz sc 30048 dilution 1 250 1 500 Erk1 2 Cell Signaling 9102 dilution 1 1000 phospho Erk1 2 Cell Signaling 9101 dilution 1 1000 and G Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc 378 dilution 1 1000 as well as appropriate secondary antibodies Anti mouse HRP Cell Signaling 7076 dilution 1 10000 Anti rabbit HRP Cell Signaling 7074 dilution 1 10000 .

The inventors used male C57BL 6 mice 10 12 weeks old 25 g from Charles River Laboratories Sulzfeld Germany . Transaortic constriction TAC was created using a 7 0 suture tied twice around the aorta and a 27 gauge needle. The needle was then gently retracted yielding an about 80 constriction of the aorta. During the same operations a jugular vein catheter was implanted by standard surgical procedures. The sequences were antagomir 21 5 oUsoCsoAoAoCoAoUoCoAoGoUoCoUoGoUoAoAoGsoCsoUsoAs Chol 3 . All nucleotides used in synthesis are 2 OMe modified Subscript o . Subscript s represents a phosphorothioate linkage Cy3 indicates Cy3 dye label at the 5 end of the oligo Chol represents cholesterol linked through a hydroxyprolinol linkage. Treatment started 24 h post TAC and animals received PBS or miR 21 antagonist injections via an implanted jugular vein catheter three consecutive days jugular vein injections of PBS or miR 21 antagonist at doses of 80 mg per kg body weight in 0.2 ml per injection. As a positive control for effective cardiac delivery Cy 3 labeled modified oligonucleotide antagomir 181a 80 mg kg was injected into the jugular vein catheter and the heart was removed 3 h later fixed and Cy3 staining observed by fluorescence microscopy.

After 3 weeks of TAC mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and cardiac dimensions and function were analyzed by 15 MHz pulse wave Doppler echocardiography. Then the heart was removed weighted after removal of atria and subjected to further analysis. Echocardiographic studies were performed under light anesthesia with spontaneous respiration using isoflurane. Two independent ultrasonographer experienced in rodent imaging and blinded to the experimental groups performed the echocardiography operating a Toshiba Power Vision 6000 with a 15 MHz transducer. 2D left parasternal short axis views at the level of the papillary muscles were recorded. Correct probe placement was judged by the round appearance of the left ventricular LV cavity after angulation and craniocaudal transducer movements. LV end diastolic area was calculated by manual tracings of the endocardial border followed by planimetry with the Nice software package Toshiba Medical Systems . Simultaneous transversal M mode tracings were recorded with the cursor placed in the middle of the LV cavity. Fractional shortening was calculated as described Collins et al. 2001 .

Mouse hearts were fixed in 4 buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. 5 m picrosirius red sections were examined using a Nikon ECLIPSE 50i microscope equipped with filters to provide circularly polarized illumination Whittaker et al. 1994 . The lower filter was placed above the microscope s field iris diaphragm ring while the upper filter was constructed from a combination of a quarter wave plate placed below a linear polarizer aligned such that its transmission axis was at 45 to the fast axis of the wave plate. These two filters were crossed that is aligned so that the background in the field of view was as dark as possible. Tissue images were obtained with a 20 objective lens recorded on a cooled digital camera DS 5Mc Nikon and analyzed using SigmaScan Pro 5.0 image analysis software SPSS Inc. USA . Precisely original circularly polarized images were resolved each into its cyan yellow magenta and black components using the automated function CYMK provided by the image analysis . The black component was subtracted from the polarized image. Prior to subtraction the black component was adequately brightness adjusted to ensure the elimination of the interstitial space and non collagen elements but not of the thinnest collagen fibers confirmed by inspection . Then the subtracted image was subjected to a final color separation into its hue saturation value HSV components using the automated function HSV provided by the image software. A histogram of hue frequency was obtained from the resolved 8 bit hue image which contains 256 colors. The following hue definitions were used red 2 9 and 230 256 orange 10 38 yellow 39 51 green 52 128. The hue range 129 229 consists of interstitial space and non birefringent tissue elements. The number of pixels within hue red orange yellow and green ranges was determined and expressed as a percentage of the total number of collagen pixels which in turn was expressed as a percentage of the total number of pixels in the image.

Cardiac fibroblasts obtained by the preplating step during cardiomyocyte isolation were cultured until sub confluence. Cell purity was 95 based on staining with the fibroblast marker anti rat prolyl 4 hydroxylase Acris Antibodies AF5110 1 data not shown . After treatment with miR 21 precursors inhibitors or respective controls see above Annexin V positive fibroblasts were measured by FACS analysis Annexin VFLUOS kit Roche Diagnostics GmbH Mannheim Germany . Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA was performed to quantify FGF 2 concentrations in supernatants of miR 21 modulated cardiac fibroblasts. FGF 2 determination was carried out using the Quantikine FGF Basic Immunoassay kit R D Systems Minneapolis USA according to the manufacturer s specifications.
