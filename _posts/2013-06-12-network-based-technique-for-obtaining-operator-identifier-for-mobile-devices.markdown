title: Network based technique for obtaining operator identifier for mobile devices
abstract: Efficient network based techniques can be implemented in the equipment of an operator of a mobile communication network to automatically obtain an operator or billing identifier associated with a mobile device of a user or subscriber associated with the network. Such techniques can be utilized even when a client application program on the device is restricted by the device manufacturer from providing the operator's billing identifier in communications through the mobile network with an associated application server. The operator identifier associated with the user's mobile device can be obtained without significantly impacting system resources, performance, or user experience.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 247 651 filed Sep. 28 2011 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

In recent years mobile communication services have expanded and increased in popularity around the world. Many operators of modern mobile communication networks offer their users or subscribers advanced data communication services in addition to standard wireless mobile communication services such as for voice calls or mobile messaging services e.g. text and or multimedia and data transport services e.g. for Internet access or third party email or content access . Advanced application layer data services from the carriers and third party providers may take various forms and may include different subscription based services. For example such subscription based services provided by the mobile network operator or wireless carrier may allow a user subscriber to purchase or access premium data content e.g. streaming video directly from the user s mobile device via for example a client application program executing on the device and have the charges for the premium service included on the mobile service bill from the mobile network operator or wireless carrier.

In general a mobile network operator relies on a unique operator or billing identifier associated with the particular mobile device user to identify the user or user account in order to bill the user s account directly for the particular service purchased or accessed by the user at the mobile device e.g. via the client application . An example of an operator billing identifier that is commonly used by mobile network operators is the telephone number associated with a mobile device of the user. This number may be referred to as the Mobile Directory Number MDN in 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 3GPP2 wireless network systems or the Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Network Number MSISDN in 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3GPP systems.

However the mobile network operator may not have an efficient way to determine the billing identifier based on the information received from the client application at the operator s application server. For example the billing identifier may not be included in the data communication requests from the client application to the associated application server configured to provide the user requested service or transaction through the mobile communication network. In some cases this may be due to the type of mobile device or operating system environment on which the client application is executing. For example the device manufacturer or operating system developer may restrict the client application from accessing the identifier assigned to the mobile device by the operator directly from the mobile device instead requiring an application configuration that uses a different type of identifier such as one assigned by the operating system developer. Such an operating system configuration precludes the client application from providing the identifier in communications with the associated application server.

One example of such a mobile computing platform is the iPhone OS or iOS mobile operating system from Apple Inc. of Cupertino Calif. Current versions of the application programming interface API for this particular operating system do not provide a capability to determine the network operator s billing identifier programmatically from the mobile device itself. Instead the application can only obtain and use a different identifier for example a device identifier specified by the manufacturer of the device e.g. the unique device identifier or UDID associated with iOS devices . Consequently for any mobile device with the iOS operating system or other operating system that presents a similar type of problem network operators must rely on the manufacturer of the device or the API developer publisher e.g. Apple Inc. for obtaining the operator assigned device identifier based on a mapping of the manufacturer s device identifier e.g. the UDID in the iOS example to the operator identifier for billing purposes. This involves the device manufacturer or operating system developer in the commercial transactions that occur between the operator and the operator s mobile service customers which may be undesirable for the operator.

Other conventional techniques are available to mobile network operators for obtaining the operator assigned identifier without the aid of the device manufacturer or API developer. For example the application server may track the IP address associated with the mobile device for purposes of identifying the operator identifier e.g. MDN associated with the device for data communications. In this example the application server uses one or more elements in the mobile communication network itself to determine the appropriate operator identifier ID based on the IP address associated with the device e.g. a carrier database that maintains a mapping between operator ID and IP address assigned for each mobile device . However performing such an operation is operationally intensive as it requires the carrier database to track IP address assignment for each mobile device and the application server to make this determination for each data communication from the device as the assigned IP address and or associated operator ID for the device may have changed since the previous request. For example each IP address to operator ID mapping must be tracked over time including each time a new IP address is assigned to the device and each time any previously assigned IP address that is associated with an operator identifier for the device is modified.

In addition a unique static or dynamic IP address may need to be assigned to the mobile device so as to uniquely map the IP address with the appropriate operator identifier and therefore ensure the identifier associated with the device is correctly identified. This unique IP address would remain dedicated to the device for as long as there is active data traffic associated with the IP data flow. However assigning a dedicated IP address to the mobile device for an indefinite period of time would reduce the number of IP addresses available for use in the network. This would be a significant problem for the mobile communication network as the current availability of global IP version 4 IPv4 addresses becomes increasingly scarce.

To mitigate problems associated with limited supplies of IP addresses modern mobile network systems may rely on network address translation NAT schemes. However such NAT schemes typically use a relatively small pool of available IP addresses which are shared concurrently amongst mobile devices for enabling data communications to other devices which for example are external to the mobile communication network through the Internet. Therefore assigning a unique IP address to each mobile device to allow an application server to determine each mobile device operator identifier may be incompatible with the NAT scheme of the communication network.

Other techniques exist that do not require a dedicated IP address to be permanently assigned in order to obtain the operator identifier. For example the application server may require the user to supply the MDN for example as part of a validation process based on short message service SMS or multimedia messaging service MMS messages. However such techniques generally lead to reduced user experience as several user interactions are required merely to obtain the MDN.

Also any validation process that is dependent on user input is generally susceptible to human error e.g. user enters a wrong MDN or to improper or fraudulent use. In an example one user User B may provide an MDN belonging to another cooperating user User A for advanced data services for which only User A has a valid subscription. The application server may subsequently send a validation request in the form of an SMS message based on the provided MDN which would therefore reach User A. User A can then send another SMS message with authentication information in response to the validation request from the server so as to complete the account validation verification process for the benefit of User B. In a further example the SMS message from the application server may include a password or verification code required for accessing the particular application data services. User A could forward this message to User B which User B could provide to the application in order to complete the validation verification process.

Furthermore not all mobile devices e.g. the iPad tablet device from Apple Inc. support SMS or MMS messaging technology and hence would preclude the use of any validation process that uses this technology.

In the following detailed description numerous specific details are set forth by way of examples in order to provide a thorough understanding of the relevant teachings. However it should be apparent that the present teachings may be practiced without such details. In other instances well known methods procedures components and or circuitry have been described at a relatively high level without detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring aspects of the present teachings.

The various examples disclosed herein relate to techniques and systems for enabling an operator of a mobile communication network which also provides an application service from a network connected server to automatically obtain an operator or billing identifier associated with a user of a mobile device based on network communications for the mobile device through the mobile communication network. For example the network communications may be associated with one or more data services that are provided by an associated application server to the mobile device user via a client application program executing on the user s mobile device. In contrast to the aforementioned conventional techniques the operator identifier associated with the particular user is automatically obtained without requiring any interaction from the mobile device user for this purpose. Furthermore the teachings as described herein may be used even in scenarios in which a manufacturer of the mobile device or other developer of the device operating system has configured a client application program on the device to use a different identifier and not provide the operator s billing identifier in the communications with the associated application server.

As noted above in contrast to aforementioned conventional techniques for obtaining operator identifier information the teachings described herein provide an efficient network based way to obtain and utilize this information without limiting network resources or adversely impacting system performance. In several examples an access request for advanced data services is sent from the user s mobile device via a client application program to an application server through a mobile communication network. Alternatively a client application interface for such data services as provided by the application server initiates one or more data communication requests for automatically obtaining the operator identifier associated with the mobile device user. While several examples refer to the mobile directory number MDN as the operator or billing identifier it is noted that these examples are presented for explanatory purposes and are not intended to limit the present disclosure thereto.

Reference now is made in detail to the examples illustrated in the accompanying drawings and discussed below. An exemplary general network system which provides a variety of mobile communication services is described initially with respect to . As will be described in further detail below the network system illustrated in can be used to provide communications for advanced data services in which an operator identifier associated with a mobile device user is automatically determined. Next network elements and processes related to automatically obtaining the operator identifier for providing mobile application services to the mobile device user are described with respect to .

The terms operator and carrier are used herein interchangeably to refer broadly and inclusively to any provider or supplier of mobile network communication services including services for the transmission of real time voice and data communication through a wireless or mobile communication network. An operator or carrier can be for example and without limitation a wireless service provider that provides services to mobile phone subscribers or a Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP service provider that provides services to subscribers who use a personal computer or similar computing device to make and receive phone calls. VoIP is used herein to refer broadly to the digital transmission of real time voice communications over Internet Protocol IP networks such as the Internet or similar networks.

Additionally the terms data services and advanced data services are used herein interchangeably to refer broadly and inclusively to services for the communication of data and any functionality as provided by the network operator carrier for mobile device users subscribers through the mobile communication network.

As previously noted such advanced data services include subscription based services that enable the mobile device user to purchase premium content e.g. multimedia content including streaming video as offered by the operator of the mobile communication network directly from the device e.g. either mobile device or mobile device in this example. As will be described in further detail below this functionality may be provided to the user via a mobile communication application or client application program or simply client that is executed on the mobile device of the user. It should be appreciated that such client application can be any type of communication application interface or process executable on the mobile device and configured for enabling data communications with an associated application server through the mobile communication network. For example the client application may be implemented as a web interface for an associated application server. Alternatively the client application may be a dedicated application program that is installed and executed on the user s device specifically for enabling the user to access the functionality provided by a particular data service.

In the example shown in two mobile client devices or mobile devices and are configured to communicate over a mobile communication network . These devices may be referred to as mobile stations for users in the mobile communication network. Mobile devices and are examples of mobile devices or mobile stations that enable a user of such devices to access or purchase advanced data services provided by the wireless network operator or carrier. Mobile devices and can be any type of mobile computing device capable of communications over one or more networks. Examples of such mobile computing devices include but are not limited to portable handsets smart phones tablet computers and personal digital assistants.

Any enhanced data services provided by the carrier or network operator via a client application executed on the mobile device of a user may be delivered to a smart mobile device such as a smart mobile phone or tablet computing device having for example a touch screen display for user input. Similarly such data services may be delivered to other types of mobile devices as well including for example mobile devices that do not have a touch screen display but are capable of executing client applications for purposes of delivering advanced functionality and data services from the carrier to users. Hence in the simplified example shown in mobile device is a mobile device that does not have a touch screen display and mobile station is a smart mobile device having a touch screen display for user input e.g. iPhone from Apple Inc. . As should be apparent given this description implementation of advanced functionality such as on line data services generally will involve at least some execution of software programming in the mobile devices in addition to various user input output functions and data communications through the network from the mobile devices.

Client program applications can be configured to execute on many different types and configurations of mobile devices and . Furthermore such a client application includes an application program or interface executable on a user s mobile device which facilitates the delivery of data services to the user s device. For example the client application can enable mobile device users to access or purchase advanced data services provided by the carrier. The client application executing on mobile devices or may be written in any one of various well known programming languages. For example the client application can be written to execute on a binary runtime environment for mobile BREW based mobile device a Windows Mobile based mobile device Android I Phone Java Mobile or RIM based mobile device such as a BlackBerry or the like.

As will be described in further detail below the client application can send a request to one or more servers e.g. server over network and any other interconnected networks for access to the user requested service provided by the carrier. Accordingly mobile device and or mobile device are configured to communicate over the air with a base station and through the traffic network for various voice and data communications e.g. through the Internet with a server and or with application servers .

If the mobile service carrier offers a specialized data service to mobile device subscribers or users e.g. via a client application executed on the users respective mobile device the service may be hosted on a carrier operated application server for communication via the networks and . Alternatively such data service may be provided by a separate entity alone or through agreements with the carrier in which case the service may be hosted on an application server such as server connected for communication via the networks and . Servers such as and may provide any of a variety of common application or service functions in support of or in addition to an application program running on the mobile device . However for purposes of further discussion we will focus on functions thereof in support of mobile data services requiring the operator identifier associated with a mobile user or carrier specific account associated with that user. For any given service provided by the carrier to its users an application program within the mobile device may be considered as a client and the programming at or may be considered as the server or application server application for the particular service. However it should be noted that the server or application server may comprise multiple servers as may be necessary to perform the desired functionality for the particular service provided by the carrier.

In this example network provides mobile wireless communications services to those mobile devices as well as to other mobile devices not shown for example via a number of base stations BSs . The present techniques in accordance with the teachings described herein may be implemented in any of a variety of available mobile networks or on any type of mobile device compatible with such a network . As such it should be noted that the illustration in depicts only a simplified example of a few relevant elements of the system and the network for ease of explanation and purposes of discussion herein.

For example the wireless mobile communication network may be implemented as a network conforming to one or more well known wireless networking standards and protocols. Examples of such standards include but are not limited to the code division multiple access CDMA IS 95 standard the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3GPP wireless IP network standard the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 3GPP2 wireless IP network standard the Evolution Data Optimized EVDO standard the Global System for Mobile GSM communication standard the time division multiple access TDMA standard or other standards used for public mobile wireless communications.

Network of system as shown in is configured to enable users at mobile devices and to subscribe to one or more types of the aforementioned data services offered through the mobile communication network of the operator or wireless carrier. Furthermore mobile devices and enable such users to initiate voice telephone communications in addition to more advanced data services e.g. services related to the delivery premium data content and services such as streaming video through the network . Accordingly mobile devices and are configured to process and handle data communications in accordance with the particular type of network communication standard or configuration associated with network . In an example network allows users of the mobile devices such as and and other mobile devices not shown to initiate and receive telephone calls to each other as well as through the public switched telephone network or PSTN and telephone stations connected to the PSTN. Additionally network enables users to request various data services via the Internet such as downloads web browsing email and other similar types of web services. Such data services are hosted at one or more application servers associated with the network .

In the example illustrated in system further includes a computer device for a user that is communicatively coupled to a server over Internet . Computer device is any general purpose or special purpose computing device capable of executing one or more client applications and exchanging data communications to server or other servers over one or more networks. Examples of such computing devices include but are not limited to desktop computers laptop or notebook computers and tablet computers. Such networks include interconnected networks as shown by networks and in the example system of . Such interconnected networks can include for example and without limitation local area networks wide area networks intranets and the Internet.

As the mobile communication network of system can be implemented using a number of interconnected networks the overall network for system may include a number of radio access networks RANs . The overall network may additionally include regional ground networks interconnecting a number of RANs and a wide area network WAN interconnecting the regional ground networks to core network elements. A regional portion of the network s of system such as that serving application data to each of mobile devices and can include one or more RANs. In addition the network s can include a regional circuit and or packet switched network including any associated signaling network facilities.

Physical elements of a RAN operated by one of the mobile service providers or carriers include a number of base stations represented in the example by the base stations BSs . Although not separately shown in such a base station can include a base transceiver system BTS which can communicate via an antennae system at the site of base station and over the airlink with one or more of the mobile devices when the mobile devices are within range. Each base station can include a BTS coupled to several antennae mounted on a radio tower within a coverage area often referred to as a cell. The BTS is the part of the radio network that sends and receives RF signals to from the mobile devices that are served by the base station .

The radio access networks can also include a traffic network represented generally by the cloud at which carries the user communications and data for the mobile devices between the base stations and other elements with or through which the mobile devices communicate. The network can also include other elements that support functionality other than device to device media transfer services such as messaging service messages and voice communications. Specific elements of the network for carrying the voice and data traffic and for controlling various aspects of the calls or sessions through the network are omitted here form simplicity. It apparent given this description that the various network elements can communicate with each other and other aspects of the mobile communications network in system and other networks e.g. the public switched telephone network PSTN and the Internet either directly or indirectly.

The carrier will also operate a number of systems that provide ancillary functions in support of the communications services and or application services provided through the networks of system . Further elements of these systems are configured to communicate with other nodes or elements of the networks in system via one or more private IP type packet data networks also referred to as an intranet i.e. a private networks. Generally such systems are connected to enable communication via the private network . It should be recognized that systems outside of the private network could serve the same functions as well. Furthermore these systems can be operated by the network service provider as part of the overall network in system . Examples of systems that communicate via the intranet type network as shown in include one or more application servers and a related authentication server for the application service of server . The systems in are described for explanatory purposes and that the techniques described herein are not intended to be limited thereto.

In the example shown in to ensure that the application service offered by server is available to only authorized devices users the provider of the application service also deploys an authentication server . The authentication server could be a separate physical server as shown or authentication server could be implemented as another program module running on the same hardware platform as the server application . Essentially when the server application server in our example receives a service request from a client application on a mobile device or the server application provides appropriate information to the authentication server to allow server application to authenticate the mobile device or as outlined herein. Upon successful authentication the server informs the server application which in turn provides access to the service via data communication through the various communication elements e.g. and of the network . A similar authentication function may be provided for carrier service s offered via the server either by the server if there is an appropriate arrangement between the carrier and the operator of server by a program on the server or via a separate authentication server not shown connected to the Internet .

It should be noted that the above noted authentication functions performed by server is separate from the functions performed by application server e.g. server for automatically obtaining the operator or billing identifier information associated with either mobile device or for purposes of billing or charging the user of the mobile device as will be described in further detail below with respect to . However both sets of functions may be performed by the same server in the mobile communication network depending on the particular implementation of the particular communication network.

For purposes of discussion system will be described with reference to one or more of the components in system of as described above but it is not intended that system be limited thereto. As shown by the example illustrated in system includes a mobile device of a user . Mobile device executes a client application which is associated with one or more application servers over a network . For example mobile device may be implemented using either mobile device or mobile device in system of as described above. Client application can be any mobile communication application program as previously described which is executable at mobile device and configured to communicate with application server s through network . For example client application can transmit data communication requests to application server through a mobile communication network for purposes of accessing various types of advanced data services provided by an operator of mobile communication network . Such data services may for example be hosted at application server s and accessed by user directly from device using an interface provided by client application .

Network can be any network or combination of networks in an overall mobile communication network for transmitting data communications between various devices associated with the mobile communication network . Network can include but is not limited to a wired e.g. Ethernet or a wireless e.g. Wi Fi or 3G network. In addition network can include but is not limited to a local area network medium area network and or wide area network such as the Internet. Network can support protocols and technology including but not limited to Internet or World Wide Web protocols and communication services. Referring back to network may be implemented using for example a combination of networks and of system as described above. Intermediate network routers gateways or servers may be provided between components of communication system depending upon a particular application or environment.

As noted above mobile device user may access the data services provided by the operator for example by subscribing or purchasing digital content or services using client application via a graphical user interface presented to user via a touch screen display of mobile device . Accordingly client application is configured to send one or more data communication requests S for establishing a data connection with application server and accessing the user subscribed services through network .

More importantly for this example client application is configured to access application server using at least two different destination data communication addresses assigned to application server . For example both destination addresses may be public IP addresses associated with the requested data service or application server which provides data communications associated with the service through mobile communication network . Further these destination data communication addresses may be either actual IP addresses or domain names that the client resolves to actual IP addresses for example by using a domain name system DNS server.

However one of the destination data communication addresses in particular is configured in mobile communication network so as to cause network to assign a unique data communication address to device for purposes of obtaining the operator identifier associated with mobile device . The destination data communication address is considered dedicated for this purpose due to its configuration in mobile communication network . Specifically any flow of data communication directed to the particular destination data communication address is assigned a unique source data communication address. For example the unique source data communication address may be a unique source public IP address. Alternatively the unique source data communication address may include a combination of a unique source IP address and a unique port number where both the source IP address and source port assigned to mobile device are tracked in mobile communication network . The source data communication address in this example is considered unique for this purpose as it remains assigned to device until a valid operator identifier associated with device has been obtained. For example a one to one network address translation NAT mapping scheme between a source private IP address of the network operator s private network and the unique source public IP address can be used to effect such a unique or dedicated source data communication address.

The other destination data communication address es assigned to application server are configured in mobile communication network so that a shared destination data communication address be assigned to device . The shared destination data communication address can be used by client application for sending general access requests to application server for example when it is determined that the client application has access to a valid operator ID for any subsequent access requests. Specifically any flow of data communication directed to the destination data communication address es for general communication access is assigned a shared source data communication address e.g. a source public IP address assigned to more than one device . For example a one to many NAT mapping scheme between the source private IP address and a shared source public IP address can be used to effect such a shared source data communication address. In this example the source public IP address can be shared concurrently among the mobile device and a plurality of other mobile devices communicating through mobile communication network .

Such a dedicated or unique destination data communication address may be specified in mobile communication network in any number of ways depending on for example the implementation details associated with the particular network. In an example client application is configured by default to use the dedicated destination data communication address as an initial destination address for a new data communication with the associated application server e.g. server in our example . For example this dedicated destination address may be hard coded in client application itself or stored as an application file at device located in a memory of device that is accessible to client application . Upon obtaining the operator identifier for device application server indicates in its response to client application that a valid operator identifier has been obtained and or stored for later use e.g. at the server or client S .

Upon receiving such an indication or notification from server client application is configured to use the other destination address for subsequent data communication requests for example in general data communication access requests to application server . Like the dedicated address the other destination address may be hard coded in client application or stored at device . Alternatively this destination address may be provided to client application by server e.g. as a second destination IP address to use once the operator identifier has been obtained. For example the address may be reset or reinitialized to the dedicated destination address if application server sends a response to client application indicating that the stored operator identifier is no longer valid thereby initiating a new request from the client using the initial default dedicated destination address. This can occur if for example mobile communication service for the mobile device and or mobile device user that is associated with the previously obtained stored operator identifier e.g. MDN has been suspended or deactivated. This can also occur if for example the operator identifier associated with the mobile device has been modified e.g. the MDN for the user has changed to a different number .

In a different example application server or NAT designates a portion of its available destination data communication address space to form a set or pool of dedicated destination addresses out of which particular dedicated destination addresses are sent to particular mobile client application programs when the operator identifier must be retrieved from communication network or reset upon discovering that a stored identifier is no longer valid.

It should be appreciated that the particular implementation may vary from one operator s mobile communication network to another and that the functionality as described herein is not limited to any particular implementation or designation for determining the destination or source data communication addresses to be used. For example it should be apparent given this description that an operator may use one of several different approaches for obtaining the operator identifier associated with a mobile device that do not involve having to assign a unique source data communication address to the device as described above. However it would also be apparent that such approaches may be technically feasible but potentially more complex for the operator to implement in the mobile communication network. In one example of such an approach the mobile communication network is configured to track both the source data communication address in addition to the source data communication port assigned to the mobile device. The ability to also track the communication port for the device would remove the requirement of assigning a unique source communication address to the device for obtaining the operator identifier for example by enabling the use of various port forwarding or translation schemes in the network.

In order to implement the above described NAT schemes system further includes a NAT device for intercepting data communication requests from client application that are directed to application server based on one of the destination data communication addresses assigned to server . As shown in NAT is communicatively coupled to application server via for example a data connection S for facilitating data communication between application server and client application through mobile communication network . For example NAT may be implemented as a router or dedicated server which is configured to receive network data communication e.g. in the form of IP data packets and also modify the network address information associated with such data communication e.g. IP address information in IP data packet headers . Furthermore NAT is configured to implement various network communication schemes including different network address or port translation schemes for translating or mapping public network address and or port information to one or more private network addresses associated with the private network of the operator carrier. In a further example NAT may be integrated with or implemented as a component of application server for providing the same type of functionality for the same purpose. Furthermore application server can be configured to detect any data communication requests from client application directed to the destination data communication addresses directly or alternatively based on communications from NAT .

In an example client application is assigned a unique source data communication address as described previously in response to a data communication request from client application that is directed through mobile communication network to the dedicated destination data communication address assigned to application server . In this example client application is configured to use the dedicated destination address when it is determined that a valid operator identifier associated with mobile device is not accessible or available for use. Client application is thus configured to use the dedicated network address solely for purposes of obtaining a valid operator identifier when it is determined that either client application does not have access to a valid operator identifier for providing the requested data services for user . Alternatively client application is configured to use the shared network address for general communication with the server or when it is determined that client application has access to a valid identifier or the identifier is available for use.

When client application transmits data communication or access requests using the dedicated destination address application server e.g. via NAT tracks the source data communication address currently assigned to mobile device and retrieves the corresponding operator identifier. In an example application server tracks both the source port number assigned to device in addition to the source communication address. In general the network operator maintains a database e.g. database comprising a mapping of operator identifiers e.g. MDNs to source data communication addresses e.g. source IP addresses and optionally source ports assigned to each mobile device in the mobile communication network . Therefore in our example application server can query database for retrieving the operator identifier associated with mobile device based on the source data communication address S .

Upon retrieving the operator identifier from database application server queries another database which maintains a mapping between the operator identifier and a device specific identifier associated with mobile device S .

As referred to herein the term device specific identifier refers to one or more identifiers specific to the mobile device. For example the device specific identifier for mobile device may be a unique identifier assigned by the manufacturer or operating system developer or provider. Further the device specific identifier includes a mobile equipment identifier and or a unique device identifier. Examples of different types of mobile equipment identifiers that can be used include the mobile equipment identifier MEID and the International Mobile Equipment Identity IMEI number. Application server can then store the operator identifier e.g. MDN mobile equipment identifier e.g. MEID and any other unique device identifier information associated with mobile device . A specific example of another type of device specific identifier is the unique device identifier UDID associated with some versions of the iOS operating system from Apple Inc. For example the UDID or other unique identifier associated with a particular mobile device may be included in the communication request from client application to application server assuming this information is accessible to client application . Based on the foregoing the examples described herein may refer to either the mobile equipment identifier or the unique device identifier or to both inclusively. These examples and techniques are described herein are not limited to using only one device specific identifier.

The identifier information associated with mobile device can be stored at application server or at mobile device including any storage device that may be coupled to each. The stored information associated with mobile device is used for subsequent communication requests from client application through network to application server . As noted above since client application has access to a valid operator identifier subsequent requests from client application can be directed to application server via network by using the non dedicated or shared destination network address associated with application server .

For subsequent requests directed to the shared destination network address application server retrieves the operator identifier e.g. MDN mobile equipment identifier e.g. MEID and other unique device identifier information e.g. UDID previously stored for mobile device . Applications server can retrieve this information either from a local storage device or a carrier database not shown that is accessible to server or from mobile device via client application depending on the storage location of this information. The particular location i.e. either the server or client for storing the operator and mobile equipment and or unique device identifier s may be selected based on one or more operational factors or considerations that may be particular to the mobile communication network implementation or type of mobile device executing or hosting client application .

Examples of such factors include but are not limited to computing performance network efficiency memory or storage availability information security and user experience. For example storing the operator and mobile equipment identifiers along with any additional device identifier information at the mobile device may increase the performance of the client application since the client can quickly obtain the necessary information locally and include it directly within the initial communication request to application server . This may be advantageous for the performance of application server as well if for example application server would have need to query a remote database in order to retrieve the necessary information which likely would take a greater amount of time than locally accessing the information. Any increase in performance or efficiency would also improve user experience as the requested data services would be provided faster to the user s mobile device. Conversely however storing the information solely at the client may be less secure as it would be more susceptible to unauthorized modification or use.

As previously discussed the operator identifier and additional identifier information associated with mobile device may be stored locally at device e.g. in a flash storage device integrated within or communicatively coupled to device or alternatively at application server e.g. in a file stored in a memory device of server or in an external data store coupled to the server . It is noted that application server may use any number of well known techniques to notify client application when a stored operator identifier either at the client or at the server is no longer valid. For example client application may use an internal flag e.g. implemented as a Boolean operator that can be toggled between two different values signifying whether the stored identifier information is still valid. Further application server may send a notification in a data communication response to client application when application server determines that this information is no longer valid or active in the mobile communication network . Such a notification may direct client application to reset or reinitialize the stored operator ID for example by initiating a new communication request using the dedicated destination data communication address from the client through the communication network to the application server . Application server can thereby specify the particular destination data communication address e.g. either the dedicated destination address used for the purpose of obtaining the operator identifier associated with mobile device or the destination address used for general communication with application server for client application to use in any subsequent data communication requests.

In another example if the operator identifier information is stored at the client device then application server analyzes the information to determine whether it is still valid. For example application server checks the operator identifier and mobile equipment identifier or unique device identifier received from client application against the information stored in carrier database . As carrier database is updated automatically by the mobile network operator whenever a change is made to the operator identifier e.g. the user is assigned a new mobile directory number application server is able to periodically verify that the stored information is still accurate before providing any data services to client application .

Additional examples and description related to the operations of client application and application server are provided below with respect to the exemplary methods illustrated in and respectively.

Method begins in step which includes generating a new data communication access request directed to the application server so as to initiate the delivery of advanced data services for the user at the mobile device. In an example the client generates an initial request to be sent to the application server in order to establish a network data connection with the server. For example the initial request may be generated in response to input from the user e.g. via a graphical user interface provided by the client application at the mobile device. Alternatively as described above the application server may initiate the client to send the request e.g. when it is determined by the server that a stored operator identifier is no longer valid or that the associated device identifier has become inactive. In step the client determines whether a valid operator ID is available or accessible for use in execution of the application program at the mobile device. As previously discussed the operator identifier ID necessary for providing the advanced data services e.g. subscription based service that requires billing the user as requested from the application server can be stored at either the client or the server. In an example if the operator ID including the associated device ID is stored at the mobile device the client can access this stored information and include it in the request sent to the application server.

As will be described in further detail below with respect to the application server determines whether the client has access to the operator ID based on the access request from the client and more specifically based on the destination network communication address to which the request was directed. If the client does not have access to a valid operator ID method proceeds to step in which the request for server access is directed to a destination network data communication address that is dedicated for purposes of retrieving a valid operator ID as previously described in reference to system of .

Accordingly the application server tracks the destination data communication address in order to determine whether a valid operator identifier needs to be obtained before providing the appropriate response to the client. Method thus proceeds to step in which a response is received from the server. If the operator ID and associated information retrieved by the application server are to be stored at the mobile device for subsequent requests for the client the response from the server may include the operator ID and device ID information. Therefore method includes the optional step which includes storing the ID information received from the server in a local storage device that is accessible to the mobile device for later use in subsequent server access requests. Method can then return to step to generate subsequent data communication requests for server access in which case the steps of method are repeated. Alternatively method can conclude after step or optional step when performed if additional server access requests are unnecessary.

Referring back to step if the operator ID is stored at the client device method proceeds to steps which includes determining whether the application server has sent a request to the client for validating the ID information stored at the device. Steps of method thus correspond to cases in which the operator and device ID information are stored at the client device. The application server can additionally validate the stored information using any number of well known validation techniques. In one example of such a validation technique the application server generates a random string and includes the generated string in a push message to the device. The random string may be generated using any number of well known techniques. For example the random string may be based on a known unique identifier associated with the mobile device that is separate from the unique device ID e.g. MEID referred to previously. Further such unique identifier may be generated using a hash algorithm e.g. an MD5 Message Digest cryptographic hash algorithm.

As shown in step of method the client application would then be required to return the random string along with operator ID and device ID associated with the device to complete the validation. This would help mitigate the potential for fraud including cases where the same valid operator to device ID mapping is distributed and shared amongst several users of different mobile devices.

Method begins in step which includes receiving a new access request for data communications through the mobile communication network from the client application program e.g. client application on a mobile device of a user. As previously noted this request may be directed by the client application to either a dedicated destination data communication address or one of several shared destination data communication addresses all of which are assigned to the associated application server. In step a determination is made as to whether the mobile client application has access to an operator identifier associated with the mobile device. As noted above the application server in this example makes the determination based on the destination data communication address e.g. destination IP address to which the request was directed. Also as noted above the client application program may access the application server using at least two separate destination addresses a specific destination address dedicated in the mobile communication network solely for obtaining the operator identifier and at least one other shared destination address for general access to the application server. In the mobile communication network of the operator the dedicated destination address is configured such that any flow of data communication directed to the particular destination address is assigned a unique source network communication address as described above. For example a one to one NAT mapping scheme may be used in place of the default many to one NAT mapping when it is determined that the operator identifier needs to be retrieved.

Upon determining the client does not have access to a valid operator identifier based on the access request method proceeds to steps for obtaining a valid operator identifier. For example such a determination may be made when this particular client has never previously established a data connection with the application server or when the client attempts to establish a data connection after the application server has determined that the stored operator identifier e.g. either at the client or server as noted above is no longer valid e.g. a modification has been subsequently made to the operator identifier .

In step the operator identifier e.g. MDN is obtained by querying a database of the operator carrier in the mobile communication network e.g. database in system of as described above . This database is queried using the source communication network address e.g. source IP address and optionally the source port number associated with the mobile device which is derived from the received access request from the client. As noted above this database includes a mapping between source communication addresses associated with the mobile devices that are known to the mobile communication network and their respective operator identifiers. The mapping of source communication address to operator identifier associated with each device is generally maintained by the network operator carrier and may be updated for example when the mobile device tries to establish a data connection for exchanging data communications with other devices through the mobile communication network including any devices that are external to the communication network. In addition for any subsequent changes to the operator identifier the information stored in the carrier database is updated accordingly. For example the operator identifier may need to be updated if the mobile telephone number for the user has been modified or reassigned to a different user. In general such modifications are made by other components or elements in the mobile communication network which generally are separate or distinct from the application server itself.

Upon retrieving the operator identifier from the first carrier database in step method proceeds to step which includes querying a second carrier database to obtain a device identifier e.g. MEID associated with the mobile device based on the operator identifier obtained from the first database. Similar to the first database this second database is also maintained by the carrier in our example and includes a mapping between the operator identifier e.g. MDN and the device or equipment identifier e.g. MEID associated with the mobile device. In step the operator identifier obtained in step is stored in association with the device identifier obtained in step for example at either the mobile device on which the client application is executing or at the application server e.g. in a local memory device integrated with the application server or a separate database that is directly accessible to the server.

Although not shown in the example flowchart of step may further include storing additional identifier information specific to the mobile device e.g. UDID associated with some versions of iOS smart mobile devices as previously mentioned in association with the operator identifier and device identifier. For example such additional identifier information may be provided in the data communication request from the mobile client application. Therefore this information can be used to quickly obtain the operator identifier that is also associated with the device in response to subsequent data communication requests from the client.

Once the identifier information has been stored method can proceed to step in which an appropriate response is transmitted to the client application based on the initial data communication request and the obtained identifier information associated with the mobile device. Thus step corresponds to subsequent data communication access requests from the client application directed to a non dedicated or shared destination data communication address assigned to the application server. Step includes obtaining the previously stored operator identifier device or equipment identifier and other unique identifier associated with the mobile device e.g. either from the server or from client .

In step the aforementioned second database of the carrier is queried to determine whether the operator identifier to device identifier mapping is still valid e.g. whether the operator identifier e.g. MDN has been modified since the last time the server was accessed by the client application for data communication. If the database indicates that the operator identifier is still active e.g. user has not suspended communication services provided by the network operator and that the stored identifier mapping is valid e.g. device s MDN has not changed then the operator identifier is considered to be valid and this operator billing identifier is charged for the advanced data services provided to the user via the client application. In contrast to conventional solutions for determining the identifier the steps of method avoid any operationally intensive processing related to mapping data communication address to the operator identifier associated with the user s mobile device.

However if in step a determination is made that the operator identifier to device identifier mapping is no longer valid e.g. MDN stored for device has been suspended or modified then method proceeds to step which includes determining whether the second database including the mapping of operator identifier to device equipment identifier supports query by the device identifier as opposed to the obtained operator identifier. If so in step this database is queried accordingly to obtain the correct operator identifier which is presumably up to date as the database in question is maintained by the mobile network operator as noted previously. A performance advantage associated with the ability to query the database based on the device identifier is realized since the operator identifier can be retrieved using the device identifier associated with the mobile device rather than having to resort to the operationally intensive process of obtaining the operator identifier by tracking the data communication address assigned to the mobile device. For example such tracking would require directing the client to use the dedicated destination address to obtain operator identifier information and assigning a unique source communication IP address to the device for all data communication requests. Although not shown in it should be noted that in addition to determining whether the operator identifier is still valid method may also determine if the device specific identifier for example the MEID associated with the device is still valid or active. For example the network operator may use such a device specific identifier to monitor whether the mobile device was reported as being stolen. This allows the network operator to deactivate the device or device identifier associated with the device so as to preclude any further use of the device for accessing communication services through the operator s mobile communication network.

If this second carrier database does not allow querying based on the device identifier then method repeats steps to as described above which includes obtaining the operator identifier by initiating a data communication request from the client application through the mobile communication to the application server using the dedicated destination address. For example the application server can transmit a response to the client application that triggers the client application to reinitialize or reset the destination data communication address from the shared destination address to the dedicated destination address for use in subsequent data communication requests to the application server. However this approach still mitigates any issues related to limiting network resources or performance as the process of mapping data communication address to the operator identifier associated with the mobile device is repeated only when it is determined that the stored operator identifier for the device is no longer valid i.e. as opposed to tracking this mapping for each access request .

Steps of method pertain to the case where the operator and device equipment identifier information is stored at the mobile device of the client application. As illustrated by these steps additional validation of the stored information can optionally be performed for example using a push message include additional device specific identifier information e.g. UDID that includes a random string as described above with respect to method of . The random string may be generated using any number of well known techniques also as described above. As the client application is required to return the random string along with operator and device equipment identifiers to complete the validation the potential for fraudulent use whereby the same valid operator identifier to device identifier mapping is distributed amongst different mobile device users is reduced as discussed above.

Methods and of respectively provide several advantages over conventional techniques for obtaining an operator s billing identifier associated with a mobile device of a user or subscriber when such information is not available for data communications initiated at the mobile device through a mobile communication network to an associated application server. For example methods and can be used even when a mobile communication application on the mobile device is restricted for example by the device manufacturer from accessing the operator identifier from the device itself.

In particular method provides efficient network based techniques that can be implemented in equipment of the operator s mobile communication network for automatically obtaining the operator identifier associated with the mobile device without significantly impacting network resources performance or user experience. Furthermore method uses the operator identifier to device identifier mapping as described above to minimize the use of the operationally intensive process of mapping back from a data communication address assigned to the device to the operator identifier associated with the device. Moreover method also provides the additional functionality for validating stored identifier information by using for example a message push mechanism based on a randomly generated string.

General structure programming and operations of the various types of mobile devices should be well known. For completeness and ease of explanation the relevant functional elements aspects of the two exemplary mobile devices and of will be described at a high level with respect to the example mobile devices devices illustrated in respectively. However it should be apparent that mobile devices and as described above are not intended to be limited to the examples shown in .

For purposes of such a discussion provides a block diagram illustration of an exemplary mobile device that does not have a touch screen display interface i.e. a non touch type mobile device . Although the mobile device may be a smart phone or may be incorporated into another device such as a personal digital assistant PDA or the like for discussion purposes the illustration shows the mobile device is in the form of a handset. The handset embodiment of the mobile device functions as a normal digital wireless telephone station. For that function mobile device includes a microphone for audio signal input and a speaker for audio signal output. The microphone and speaker connect to voice coding and decoding circuitry vocoder . For a voice telephone call for example the vocoder provides two way conversion between analog audio signals representing speech or other audio and digital samples at a compressed bit rate compatible with the digital protocol of wireless telephone network communications or voice over packet Internet Protocol communications.

For digital wireless communications the handset also includes at least one digital transceiver XCVR . To function appropriately in modern mobile communications networks the handset would be configured for digital wireless communications using one or more of the common network technology types. The concepts discussed here encompass embodiments of the mobile device utilizing any digital transceivers that conform to current or future developed digital wireless communication standards. Mobile device may also be capable of analog operation via a legacy network technology.

The transceiver provides two way wireless communication of information such as vocoded speech samples and or digital information in accordance with the technology of the network . The transceiver also sends and receives a variety of signaling messages in support of the various voice and data services provided via the mobile device and the communication network. Each transceiver connects through RF send and receive amplifiers not separately shown to an antenna . The transceiver may also support various types of mobile messaging services such as short message service SMS enhanced messaging service EMS and or multimedia messaging service MMS .

The mobile device includes a display for displaying messages menus or the like call related information dialed by the user calling party numbers. A keypad enables dialing digits for voice and or data calls as well as generating selection inputs for example as may be keyed in by the user based on a displayed menu or as a cursor control and selection of a highlighted item on a displayed screen. The display and keypad are the physical elements providing a textual or graphical user interface. Various combinations of the keypad display microphone and speaker may be used as the physical input output elements of the graphical user interface GUI for multimedia e.g. audio and or video communications. Of course other user interface elements may be used such as a trackball as in some types of PDAs or smart phones.

In addition to normal telephone and data communication related input output including message input and message display functions the user interface elements also may be used for display of menus and other information to the user and user input of selections including any needed during the execution of a client application invoked by the user to access one or more advanced data or web services provided by the carrier as discussed previously. As will described in further detail below mobile device includes a processor and programming stored in device memory which is used to configure the processor so that the mobile device is capable of performing various desired functions including functions involved in delivering enhanced data services provided by the carrier via the client application.

In the example device shown in a microprocessor serves as a programmable controller for mobile device . Microprocessor is configured to control all operations of the mobile devices devices including any operations associated with one or more client applications that it executes. Further microprocessor performs any operations in accordance with programming associated with such client application s in addition to other standard operations in general for the device.

Also as shown in mobile device includes flash type program memory for storage of various software or firmware program routines and mobile configuration settings for example and without limitation the mobile directory number MDN and or mobile identification number MIN . Mobile device may also include a non volatile random access memory RAM for a working data processing memory. As should be apparent given this description other storage devices or configurations may be added to or substituted for those in the example. In an example a flash based program memory stores firmware including a device boot routine device driver software an operating system processing software for client application functions routines and any control software specific to the carrier or mobile device. In operation the programming associated with the boot routine stored in program memory i.e. the firmware is loaded into e.g. into cache memory of microprocessor and executed by the microprocessor for example when the device is power cycled or reset. Memory may also be used to store any of a wide variety of other applications for example and without limitation a web browser applications and messaging service applications for sending and receiving text and or multimedia messages. Memory devices and can also be used to store various data such as telephone numbers and server addresses downloaded data such as multimedia content and various data input by the user.

For purposes of such a discussion provides a block diagram illustration of an exemplary mobile device having a touch screen user interface. As such mobile device can be any smart mobile device e.g. smart phone or tablet device . Although possible configured somewhat differently at least logically a number of the elements of the exemplary touch screen type mobile device are similar to the elements of mobile device and are identified by like reference numbers in . For example the touch screen type mobile device includes a microphone speaker and vocoder for audio input and output functions much like in the earlier example. The mobile device also includes a at least one digital transceiver XCVR for digital wireless communications although the handset may include an additional digital or analog transceiver. The concepts discussed here encompass embodiments of the mobile device utilizing any digital transceivers that conform to current or future developed digital wireless communication standards. As in mobile device the transceiver provides two way wireless communication of information such as vocoded speech samples and or digital information in accordance with the technology of the network . The transceiver also sends and receives a variety of signaling messages in support of the various voice and data services provided via the mobile device and the communication network. Each transceiver connects through RF send and receive amplifiers not separately shown to an antenna . The transceiver may also support various types of mobile messaging services such as short message service SMS enhanced messaging service EMS and or multimedia messaging service MMS .

As in the example of mobile device a microprocessor serves as a programmable controller for the mobile device in that it controls all operations of the mobile device in accord with programming that it executes for all normal operations and for operations involved in the procedure for obtaining operator identifier information under consideration here. Like mobile device mobile device includes flash type program memory for storage of various program routines and mobile configuration settings. The mobile device may also include a non volatile random access memory RAM for a working data processing memory. Of course other storage devices or configurations may be added to or substituted for those in the example. Hence as outlined above the mobile device includes a processor and programming stored in the flash memory configures the processor so that the mobile device is capable of performing various desired functions including in this case the functions associated with a client application executing on the mobile device involved in the techniques for providing advanced data services by the carrier.

In the example shown in the user input elements for mobile device include a touch screen display and a keypad. The keypad of mobile device may include one or more hardware keys . For example the keypad may be implemented as a sliding keyboard of mobile device and keys may correspond to the keys of such a keyboard. Alternatively the hardware keys including keyboard of mobile device may be replaced by soft keys presented in an appropriate arrangement on the touch screen display. The soft keys presented on the touch screen display would operate similarly to hardware keys and thus can be used to invoke the same user interface functions as with the hardware keys.

In general the touch screen display of mobile device is used to present information e.g. text video graphics or other content to the user of the mobile device. Such a touch screen display may be for example and without limitation a capacitive touch screen display. In operation the touch screen display detects the occurrence and relative location of user input with respect to the viewable area of the display screen. The user input may be an actual touch of the display device with the user s finger stylus or similar type of peripheral device used for user input with a touch screen. Use of a touch screen display as part of the user interface enables a user to interact directly with the information presented on the display.

Accordingly the exemplary mobile device includes a display which the microprocessor controls via a display driver to present visible outputs to the device user. The mobile device also includes a touch position sensor . The sensor is relatively transparent so that the user may view the information presented on the display . A sense circuit sensing signals from elements of the touch position sensor and detects occurrence and position of each touch of the screen formed by the display and sensor . The sense circuit provides touch position information to the microprocessor which can correlate that information to the information currently displayed via the display to determine the nature of user input via the screen.

The display and touch sensor and possibly one or more keys if included are the physical elements providing the textual and graphical user interface for the mobile device . The microphone and speaker may be used as additional user interface elements for audio input and output.

The structure and operation of the mobile devices and as outlined above were described to by way of example only.

As shown by the above discussion functions relating to the delivery of advanced data services via a graphical user interface or client application e.g. client application of described above of a mobile device may be implemented on computers connected for data communication via the components of a packet data network operating as a mobile communication network as shown in . Although special purpose devices may be used such devices also may be implemented using one or more hardware platforms intended to represent a general class of data processing device commonly used to run server programming so as to implement the functions discussed above in albeit with an appropriate network connection for data communication.

As known in the data processing and communications arts a general purpose computer typically comprises a central processor or other processing device an internal communication bus various types of memory or storage media RAM ROM EEPROM cache memory disk drives etc. for code and data storage and one or more network interface cards or ports for communication purposes. The software functionalities involve programming including executable code as well as associated stored data e.g. files used to store operator and device identifier information. The software code is executable by the general purpose computer that functions as the application server. In operation the code is stored within the general purpose computer platform. At other times however the software may be stored at other locations and or transported for loading into the appropriate general purpose computer system. Execution of such code by a processor of the computer platform enables the platform to implement the methodology for automatically obtaining operator identifier information based on data communication for a mobile device through a mobile communication network to an application server in essentially the manner performed in the implementations discussed and illustrated herein.

A server for example includes a data communication interface for packet data communication. The server also includes a central processing unit CPU in the form of one or more processors for executing program instructions. The server platform typically includes an internal communication bus program storage and data storage for various data files to be processed and or communicated by the server although the server often receives programming and data via network communications. The hardware elements operating systems and programming languages of such servers are conventional in nature. Of course the server functions may be implemented in a distributed fashion on a number of similar platforms to distribute the processing load.

Hence aspects of the methods of automatically obtaining the operator identifier for providing advanced or premium data services to a mobile device user as outlined above may be embodied in programming. Program aspects of the technology may be thought of as products or articles of manufacture typically in the form of executable code and or associated data that is carried on or embodied in a type of machine readable medium. Storage type media include any or all of the tangible memory of the computers processors or the like or associated modules thereof such as various semiconductor memories tape drives disk drives and the like which may provide non transitory storage at any time for the software programming. All or portions of the software may at times be communicated through the Internet or various other telecommunication networks. Such communications for example may enable loading of the software from one computer or processor into another for example from a management server or host computer of the application service provider into the computer platform of the mobile communication server that will be the application server. Thus another type of media that may bear the software elements includes optical electrical and electromagnetic waves such as used across physical interfaces between local devices through wired and optical landline networks and over various air links. The physical elements that carry such waves such as wired or wireless links optical links or the like also may be considered as media bearing the software. As used herein unless restricted to non transitory tangible storage media terms such as computer or machine readable medium refer to any medium that participates in providing instructions to a processor for execution.

Hence a machine readable medium may take many forms including but not limited to a tangible storage medium a carrier wave medium or physical transmission medium. Non volatile storage media include for example optical or magnetic disks such as any of the storage devices in any computer s or the like such as may be used to implement the databases etc. shown in the drawings e.g. databases and of . Volatile storage media include dynamic memory such as main memory of such a computer platform. Tangible transmission media include coaxial cables copper wire and fiber optics including the wires that comprise a bus within a computer system. Carrier wave transmission media can take the form of electric or electromagnetic signals or acoustic or light waves such as those generated during radio frequency RF and infrared IR data communications. Common forms of computer readable media therefore include for example a floppy disk a flexible disk hard disk magnetic tape any other magnetic medium a CD ROM DVD or DVD ROM any other optical medium punch cards paper tape any other physical storage medium with patterns of holes a RAM a PROM and EPROM a FLASH EPROM any other memory chip or cartridge a carrier wave transporting data or instructions cables or links transporting such a carrier wave or any other medium from which a computer can read programming code and or data. Many of these forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to a processor for execution.
