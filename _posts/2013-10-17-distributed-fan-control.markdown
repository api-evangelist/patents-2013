title: Distributed fan control
abstract: A device for processing graphics data may include a plurality of graphics processing units. The device may include a fan to dissipate thermal energy generated during the operation of the plurality of graphics processing units. Each of the plurality of graphics processing units may generate a pulse width modulated signal to control the speed of the fan. The device may include one or more monitoring units configured to monitor a signal controlling the speed of the fan. One or more of the plurality of pulse width modulated signals may be adjusted based on the monitored signal. One or more of the plurality of pulse width modulated signals may be adjusted such that a signal controlling the fan maintains a desired duty cycle.
