This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 550 853 titled Method and System for Providing Messaging Gateway Services filed on Aug. 31 2009 the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

Modern lifestyles are becoming increasingly more reliant on mobile communication devices such as cellular phones laptop computers pagers personal digital assistants and the like. Advances in technology services and affordability have further given rise to a host of additional features beyond that of conventional voice communication such as short messaging services SMS multimedia messaging services MMS enhanced messaging services EMS wireless application protocol WAP push messaging services and the like. In conjunction with these advances the affordability and ubiquity of mobile communication devices has served as a catalyst for the growth in mass distribution of unsolicited or unwanted messages more commonly referred to as SPAM by content providers e.g. advertisers broadcasters promoters etc. Not surprisingly it is becoming rather burdensome upon users and operators of these messaging services to deal with the onslaught of SPAM without inadvertently affecting legitimate enterprise or intruding upon privacy rights.

Therefore there is a need for an approach that can efficiently and effectively provide messaging gateway services.

A preferred apparatus method and software for providing messaging gateway services are described. In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the preferred embodiments of the invention. It is apparent however that the preferred embodiments may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the preferred embodiments of the invention.

Although various exemplary embodiments are described with respect to multimedia messaging service MMS and short messaging service SMS protocols and technologies it is contemplated that various exemplary embodiments are applicable to other equivalent messaging services protocols and technologies.

It is observed that conventional methodology for exchanging messages between two or more parties typically involves a sending party generating a message specifying one or more desired recipients by for instance known addressing information corresponding to one or more user devices of the intended recipients and transmitting the generated message to the intended recipients via one or more messaging services such as one or more SMS MMS etc. messaging services. It is noted that the addressing information may relate to one or more directory numbers electronic serial numbers ESN international mobile equipment identifiers IMEI international mobile subscriber identity IMSI numbers machine access control MAC addresses mobile directory numbers MDN mobile equipment identifiers MEID mobile identification numbers MIN mobile station international integrated services digital network number MSISDN internet protocol IP addresses port addresses messaging aliases etc. Without knowledge of the addressing information corresponding to the intended recipients sending parities are essentially unable to transmit messages to one or more desired recipients. This often results in for instance advertisers businesses enterprises governments institutions organizations and the like hereinafter collectively referred to as content suppliers turning to mass broadcasting or even spamming techniques to disseminate their information. Namely the content suppliers may resort to generating or otherwise compiling exhaustive distribution lists as well as generalized messages that are then transmitted to the masses utilizing the distribution list information. As can be expected this often causes individuals to guard their contact or addressing information even more closely which further aggravates the situation. At the other end of the spectrum certain individuals may benefit from some of the disseminated information however because the content is not targeted to these particular individuals the information may simply be ignored. In certain instances the individuals may also fear that their contact information may be shared or utilized in other unacceptable manners such that the individuals will often choose to forgo receiving any messages to avoid receiving undesired information. Furthermore because the content is generally unsolicited recipients tend to attach a stigma to the content and thereby are even less likely to pay attention. Consequently it is becoming rather burdensome on users and operators of these messaging services to deal with the onslaught of SPAM without inadvertently affecting legitimate enterprise or intruding upon privacy rights.

It is also observed that telecommunication service providers traditionally utilize disparate reference points or interfaces between VAS applications and messaging service centers when supporting differing modes of messaging on their infrastructures. For instance telecommunication service providers have conventionally enabled value added service providers VASP to submit messages to short messaging service centers SMSC utilizing a short message peer to peer SMPP protocol which is provided by for example Short Message Peer to Peer Protocol Specification Version 5 SMS Forum February 2003 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In order to make use of the SMPP protocol an SMPP session is established between networking entities e.g. between an SMSC and a VAS application that is based on an application layer connection such as a transmission control protocol internet control protocol TCP IP connection. Contrastingly telecommunication service providers have enabled VASPs to submit messages to multimedia messaging service centers MMSC utilizing an MM7 protocol which is provided by for example Digital Cellular Telecommunications System Phase 2 Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS Multimedia Messaging Service MMS Functional Description Stage 2 Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP Technical Specification TS 123.140 V6.16.0 April 2009 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Messaging via an MM7 reference point is based on the exchange of simple object access protocol SOAP messages that include attachments and are transported between networking elements e.g. between an MMSC and a VAS application utilizing hypertext transfer protocol HTTP or hypertext transfer protocol secure HTTPS . It is noted however that having to implement various messaging protocols for various types of messages increases the complexity of the networking infrastructure as well as user devices configured to send and receive multiple types of messages.

Therefore the approach according to certain embodiments of system stems from the recognition that by providing gateway messaging services whereby subscribers can selectively opt whether or not to receive messages e.g. SMS messages MMS messages etc. associated with one or more value added services whether originating from a service provider of the gateway messaging services or a third party content provider facilitates the prevention of or at least reduction in subscriber reception of unsolicited undesirable or otherwise unwanted messages as well as enables service providers to effectively and efficiently deal with the onslaught of SPAM without inadvertently affecting legitimate enterprise or intruding upon privacy rights. Certain other embodiments of system stem from the recognition that by enabling subscribers to seamlessly define and customize one or more preferences policies and or parameters for receiving these messages enables value added service providers to better target message content to consumers and thereby provides an efficient and convenient technique to enhance and personalize the consumer experience as well as increases the likelihood that consumers will be responsive to received messages such as advertisement messages.

Additional embodiments of system stem from the recognition that by supporting various modes for subscribers to opt in and out of receiving messages associated with the value added services such as via short messaging and networked application interfaces offers subscribers ease with which to participate in the messaging gateway services of system . Further embodiments of system stem from the recognition that by extending the MM7 reference point or interface to other forms of messaging such as SMS messaging enables network service providers to reduce the complexity of network communications and thereby also reduce the complexity of networking nodes configured to send receive and forward these communications.

According to various embodiments system introduces gateway messaging services whereby users or subscribers can selectively opt in and out of receiving messages such as SMS messages MMS messages and the like associated with one or more value added services. In this manner users may be permitted access to portal via user devices or in order to subscribe to one or more value added services associated with VAS applications as well as create customize and manage one or more user profiles for targeting message content to these individuals. The user profiles may include one or more user defined preferences policies and or parameters enabling subscribers to opt in or opt out of receiving messages associated with VAS applications . The preferences policies or parameters may further specify various aspects governing the who what when where and how messages are to be received such as various parameters defining amount e.g. certain number of messages per hour day week etc. frequency of presentation e.g. continuously periodically on demand etc. messaging mode e.g. SMS messaging MMS messaging etc. content classifications e.g. basic materials capital goods energy financial healthcare information services technology transportation utilities etc. and the like. In certain embodiments the preferences policies and or parameters may include other suitable criteria such as one or more whitelists specifying permissible VASPs VAS applications messages message content etc. that may be targeted to the users and one or more blacklists specifying impermissible or objectionable VASPs VAS applications messages message content etc. that should not be received. In order to help authenticate or otherwise validate the authenticity of opting to receive messages associated with one or more value added services messaging gateway may generate identifiers such as personal identification numbers PIN codes passwords etc. for users to input to portal . These identifiers may be received such as via short message multimedia message electronic mail facsimile etc. at one or more of user devices and from messaging gateway before during or at a respite of registration via portal . Exemplary processes for opting in out of receiving messages associated with VAS applications via portal are described in more detail in association with .

In other instances users may be permitted to generate and transmit messages e.g. SMS MMS etc. messages to particular VAS application s in order to subscribe to one or more value added services associated with these VAS application s . According to certain embodiments VAS applications may be identified by one or more short codes. Short codes generally refer to short strings of alpha and or numeric characters to which a message may be addressed and thereby includes a common addressing scheme for participating infrastructures such as the infrastructure of system . It is also contemplated that short codes may additionally or alternatively include other characters symbols etc. In this manner VAS applications may be assigned one or more short codes for uniquely identifying value added services provided to user devices and via messaging gateway and messaging service center . As such short codes may be assigned to different applications services service providers and the like on a network carrier by carrier basis or may be uniquely assigned by for instance a common short code association CSCA . As will become more apparent below subscribers of these value added services may opt in and out of receiving messages associated with the services by specifying one or more short codes to identify the services and addressing information corresponding to one or more user devices and for receiving or not receiving messages associated with the services. Exemplary processes for opting in and out of receiving messages associated with VAS applications via messaging are described in more detail in association with .

According to various embodiments VAS applications offer value added services to users or subscribers of the messaging services of system via messaging gateway and messaging service center . It is contemplated that VAS applications may directly interface with messaging gateway or may access messaging gateway over one or more networks such as data network . In this manner VAS applications may be managed and operated by a service provider of the messaging gateway services of system or any suitable third party value added service provider. It is noted that value added services generally refer to complementary or ancillary application services that add value to otherwise core services of a service provider. As such value added services may be provided to subscribers at no additional charge or may be provided to users at a fee. Some examples of value added services include call transfer services call forwarding services voice mail services location based services vendor services messaging services advertising services ticketing services multimedia services content distribution services emergency services and the like. With respect to embodiments of system VAS applications provide subscribers of the core services of system with one or more messages such as SMS messages MMS messages etc. as part of the value added services. In this manner theses messages and or content thereof may be stored to one or more message content repositories such as message content repository or any other suitable storage location of or accessible to system such as message content repository a memory not shown of messaging service center VAS application user devices and etc. Further intended recipients of these messages may be stored to one or more distribution lists that in turn may be stored to recipient lists repository or any other suitable storage location of or accessible to system . As will become more apparent below as subscribers of the value added services opt in and or out of receiving messages from VAS applications addressing information e.g. directory numbers ESNs IMEIs IMSIs MAC addresses MDNs MEIDs MINs MSISDNs IP addresses port addresses messaging aliases etc. associated with user devices and can be added and removed from these distribution lists.

According to particular embodiments VAS applications may submit messages to messaging gateway for delivery to one or more subscribers at for instance user devices and . Submission of messages whether SMS messages MMS messages etc. to messaging gateway by VAS applications may be accomplished via an MM7 reference point between respective networking nodes. In this manner messaging gateway is configured to intercept interrogate and selectively filter messages from VAS applications based on one or more filtering criteria which may be governed based on the previously described user defined policies preferences and or parameters. Additionally or alternatively messaging gateway may further filter received messages from VAS applications or validate VAS applications based on one or more complied lists of permissible VAS application identifiers e.g. short code identifiers stored to a memory not shown of messaging gateway or any other suitable storage location or memory of or accessible to messaging gateway . It is noted that these complied lists may be generated and maintained by messaging gateway such as when a VASP registers modifies and or cancels a VAS with a service provider of the messaging gateway services of system . In this manner VASPs may be permitted access to messaging gateway via a user device e.g. computing device in order to register with the messaging gateway services of system . An exemplary process for registering a value added service provider to the messaging gateway services of system is described in more detail in conjunction with . Message delivery is explained in more detail in association with .

System may also include messaging service center that is configured to provide one or more messaging services e.g. SMS MMS etc. to user devices and via one or more networks and . In this manner messaging service center may be configured to receive route and deliver messages between and among user devices and and VAS applications . It is noted that messages received from VAS applications are first intercepted interrogated and selectively filtered or blocked by messaging gateway such that unblocked messages may be forwarded to messaging service center for delivery to subscribers. Messages from subscribers of the core services of system however may be received at messaging service center with or without being first intercepted interrogated and or selectively filtered by messaging gateway . It is noted that messages from these core service subscribers may be delivered to VAS applications via messaging gateway such that messaging gateway may perform one or more processes based on receiving such messages as will become more apparent below.

As part of receiving routing and delivering messages messaging service center may be configured to store message content message information e.g. state flags sender addresses recipient addresses etc. and or messages hereinafter collectively referred to as message content to message content repository . As such message content may be stored upon submission arrival and or departure of messages from messaging service center . In certain instances message content may be uploaded to and or downloaded from message content repository such as via portal . Additionally or alternatively subscribers and or value added service providers may be enabled to delete forward modify update and or view message content stored to message content repository however it is also contemplated that message content may be stored to one or more other storage locations or memories of or accessible to messaging service center and thereby one or more of the previous functions may be implemented at or by one or more of these other storage locations or memories. As such messaging service center may include computer hardware such as described with respect to and or one or more computer executable instructions e.g. software programs that enable messaging service center to receive route and deliver messages via networks and . Even though messaging gateway and messaging service center are illustrated as separate entities it is contemplated that messaging gateway and messaging service center may according to certain embodiments be collocated. Moreover even though only one messaging service center is shown it is also contemplated that system may include a plurality of messaging service centers which may function in a clustered manner. As such messaging gateway may serve according to other embodiments as a centralized gateway for the plurality of messaging service centers or alternatively system may include a plurality of messaging gateways such that one or more messaging gateways may be configured to interface with one or more of the plurality of messaging service centers .

According to exemplary embodiments system may also include location register such as a home location register HLR visitor location register VLR etc. in order to facilitate message routing and delivery. In this manner location register may be configured to permanently and or temporarily store information about subscribers such as information corresponding to service subscriptions user profiles location information etc. Additionally location register may include information for routing voice and or data communications to and from user devices and and VAS applications .

As such discrimination module may selectively permit messaging requests to be forwarded to suitable messaging service centers such as SMSC MMSC etc. that are not otherwise blocked by discrimination module . An exemplary process for messaging delivery wherein messaging gateway intercepts interrogates and filters messages received from VAS applications is explained in more detail with reference to .

In certain embodiments gateway may further include validation module for filtering received messages from VAS applications based on one or more complied lists of permissible VAS application identifiers e.g. short code identifiers stored to a memory not shown of gateway or any other suitable storage location or memory of or accessible to gateway . Exemplary processes for validating a VAS application such as VAS applications are described with respect to . It is noted that complied lists of permissible VAS application identifiers may be generated maintained and or provisioned to gateway such as when a VASP registers modifies and or cancels a VAS with a service provider of the messaging gateway services of system . According to particular exemplary embodiments registration module may be provided to facilitate VASP registration modification and or cancellation of a VAS. As such registration module may be configured to exchange information between user devices and and a web browser or other networked based application or system for these purposes.

In exemplary embodiments registration module may execute one or more GUI applications or interface with one or more GUI applications of portal that are configured to provide VASPs with one or more menus of options for registering modifying and or cancelling a VAS. As noted an exemplary process for registering a VASP to the messaging gateway services of system is described in more detail in conjunction with . It is also noted that registration module may execute one or more GUI applications or interface with one or more GUI applications of portal that are configured to enable subscribers of the core services of system to create customize and manage one or more user profiles e.g. one or more user defined preferences policies and or parameters for targeting message content to these individuals and or opt in and out of receiving messages from one or more value added services. In this manner registration module may also generate identifiers such as personal identification numbers PIN codes passwords etc. for users to input to suitable interfaces when opting to receive messages associated with a particular VAS. As such registration module and or validation module may utilize the identifier as well as certain other information to validate the authenticity of an opt in request. These identifiers may be provided to users via communication interface in the form of a short message multimedia message electronic mail facsimile etc. message before during or at a respite of an opt in registration. Exemplary processes for opting in out of receiving messages associated with VAS applications via for instance one or more GUIs are described in more detail with .

Registration module may also facilitate opting in and out of receiving messages from one or more value added services via messaging e.g. short messaging. According to certain embodiments VAS applications may be identified by one or more short codes that may be utilized along with other information by registration module to update user profiles and or signal VAS applications to update distribution lists to effectuate users opting in and out receiving messages from one or more value added services. As previously mentioned exemplary processes for opting in out of receiving messages associated with VAS applications via messaging are described with .

According to particular embodiments gateway may also include reporting module that is configured to send and receive status information to and from networking entities such as VAS applications SMSC MMSC etc. to indicate various messaging statuses such as accepted deleted delivered expired opted out pending rejected submission error submitted undeliverable unknown etc. status associated with receiving routing and delivering messages among and between user devices and and VAS applications . In certain instances status information may be included in one or more delivery reports from for example one or more messaging service centers e.g. SMSC and MMSC . As such reporting module and or event data interface may be configured to store the delivery report or information provided therein to event data repository or any other suitable storage location of or accessible to gateway . It is noted that the delivery report information may be utilized for billing purposes and or ensuring successful delivery of messages.

Event data interface may also be configured to receive event data information from various event data sources such as a billing system not shown of system . As such this event data may relate to the deactivation of one or more addresses associated with user devices and such as when users of these devices cancel their subscriptions to the core services of system . Accordingly event data interface may provide event data information to registration module in order to initiate one or more processes to remove deactivated addresses from one or more distribution lists and or to update user profiles including associations linkages references etc. to the deactivated addresses. An exemplary process for removing a deactivated address from a distribution list associated with a value added service and updating at least one user profile is explained in more detail with .

Additionally gateway may include one or more processors or controllers for effectuating the aforementioned features and functionality as well as one or more memories not shown for permanent and or temporary storage of one or more forms of data identifiers information informational elements messages parameters preferences policies request responses short codes variables etc.

According to certain exemplary embodiments registration module may generate a policy or contract that the VASP may rely on and in turn be required to adhere to. The policy may specify one or more cost structures participation requirements responsibilities etc. of the VASP as well as expound upon the various messaging gateway services provided by messaging gateway . Registration module may be configured to cause one or more hardcopies or softcopies of these policies contracts etc. to be transmitted to the administrator for physical and or electronic approval e.g. signatory approval . As such registration module may provide the policies contracts etc. via download electronic mail facsimile instant message postal mail or any other suitable mode of communication. Thus when a service provider of the messaging gateway services of system or registration module receives the agreement of the VASP to the policies contracts etc. such as in the form of a virtual or physical signature the VASP may be officially registered to the messaging gateway services.

At step registration module may receive one or more short codes associated with one or more VAS applications such as VAS applications that are managed by the VASP. As such the short code s may be provisioned in step to one or more messaging service centers e.g. SMSC MMSC etc. and or messaging gateway . For instance registration module may store the short code s to a memory not shown of messaging gateway so that for example validation module may access these short code s when validating communications from or associated with VAS applications as will become more apparent below. It is noted however that registration module may store the short code s to any suitable storage location or memory of or accessible to messaging gateway and or the one or more messaging centers and . As previously discussed these short code s may be complied in one or more lists of permissible identifiers that relate to VAS applications e.g. VAS applications capable of distributing messages via system .

At step SMSC forwards the SMS message to messaging gateway as for example an MM7 delivery request. According to exemplary embodiments an MM7 delivery request may be based on a SOAP message including attachments that is transported between networking elements e.g. between SMSC and messaging gateway utilizing HTTP HTTPS etc. In this manner an MM7 delivery request may be a multipurpose internet mail extension MIME encapsulating a SOAP envelope which includes a SOAP header and a SOAP body and one or more SOAP attachments. As such an MM7 delivery request may include one or more informational elements in the SOAP envelope to facilitate for instance management of user profile information and delivery of a message to at least one intended recipient e.g. VAS application . It is noted that the informational element s may be presented in the form of one or more XML tags. An exemplary list of informational elements that may be included within an MM7 delivery request as well as corresponding descriptions and locations within an MM7 delivery request are provided in TABLE 1.

In step messaging gateway receives the delivery request and transmits a delivery response e.g. an MM7 delivery response to SMSC informing SMSC that the delivery request was received. Similar to the delivery request the delivery response may be based on a SOAP message having attachments whereby HTTP S is utilized as the transport protocol between networking elements. In this manner an MM7 delivery response may include one or more informational elements e.g. XML tags in the SOAP envelope to inform SMSC that the delivery request was received. An exemplary list of informational elements that may be included within a delivery response as well as corresponding descriptions and locations within a delivery response are provided in TABLE 2.

Per step messaging gateway i.e. registration module updates a user profile associated with mobile device based on one or more of the informational elements included within the MM7 delivery request. That is registration module may parse the delivery request for one or more commands comments or subjects as well as a sender address a VAS application identifier and or a VASP identifier. The commands comments or subjects enable messaging gateway to identify the delivery request as an opt in message. In this manner registration module may modify one or more preferences policies and or parameters of a user profile associated with the sender address e.g. address of mobile terminal to indicate that a user of mobile terminal has opted to receive messages associated with a VAS or VASP identified by the VAS and or VASP identifiers. It is noted that the one or more preferences policies and or parameters may be stored to location register or any other suitable storage location or memory of or accessible to messaging gateway . As such messaging gateway forwards per step the opt in message to VAS application in for example an MM7 opt in message which may also be based on a SOAP message including attachments that is transported between networking elements e.g. between messaging gateway and VAS application utilizing HTTP S . The MM7 opt in message may include one or more informational elements e.g. XML tags in the SOAP envelope to facilitate for instance management of distribution lists and delivery of confirmation messages to users subscribing to the VAS. An exemplary list of informational elements that may be included within an MM7 opt in message as well as corresponding descriptions and locations within the MM7 opt in message are provided in TABLE 3.

In exemplary embodiments VAS application receives the opt in message and acknowledges reception by transmitting an acknowledgement to messaging gateway per step . At step VAS application updates a distribution list based on one or more of the informational elements of the opt in message. For instance VAS application may parse the opt in message for a sender address and a VAS identifier to thereby modify a distribution list associated with the VAS identifier to include the sender address. It is noted that the distribution list may be stored to recipient list repository or any other suitable storage location or memory of or accessible to VAS application . Accordingly VAS application may transmit at step an opt in confirmation message to mobile device to confirm that the user was subscribed to the identified VAS. A more detailed description for transmitting a message from VAS applications to user devices is provided with .

Utilizing the short code s and address es portal formulates and transmits an opt in registration request to messaging gateway per step . It is noted that the opt in registration request may include one or more commands codes instructions etc. to cause messaging gateway to generate and transmit a subscriber identifier e.g. PIN to the user that can be utilized by the user to validate the opt in registration request as will become more apparent below. Accordingly the opt in registration request may be an MM7 opt in registration request that is based on a SOAP message including attachments and transported between networking elements e.g. between portal and messaging gateway via HTTP S . As such an MM7 opt in registration request may include one or more informational elements e.g. XML tags in the SOAP envelope to facilitate for instance generation and transmission of the identifier to the user. An exemplary list of informational elements that may be included within an MM7 opt in registration request as well as corresponding descriptions and locations within an MM7 opt in registration request are provided in TABLE 4.

Accordingly messaging gateway receives the opt in registration request and transmits in step an opt in registration request response e.g. an MM7 opt in registration response to portal informing portal that the opt in registration request was received. The opt in registration request response may be based on a SOAP message having attachments whereby HTTP S is utilized as the transport protocol between networking elements. In this manner an MM7 opt in registration request response may include one or more informational elements e.g. XML tags in the SOAP envelope to inform portal that the opt in registration request was received. An exemplary list of informational elements that may be included within an MM7 opt in registration request response as well as corresponding descriptions and locations within an MM7 opt in registration request response are provided in TABLE 5.

At step messaging gateway generates an identifier e.g. PIN code password etc. based on the opt in registration request. For instance registration module may parse the opt in registration request for one or more sender addresses VAS application identifiers and or VASP identifiers. In this manner registration module may formulate an identifier as well as an opt in registration message e.g. an SMS message for transmitting the identifier to the user at for example one or more of the sender addresses. It is noted that registration module may further store the generated identifier to a user profile associated with the one or more sender addresses that in turn may be stored to location register or any other suitable storage location or memory of or accessible to messaging gateway . In exemplary embodiments the generated identifier may be stored to the user profile so that it may be correlated with a combination of one or more identifiers such as the one or more sender addresses VAS application identifiers and or VASP identifiers. It is also noted that the opt in registration message may include one or more sender addresses in a header portion and the identifier in a body portion. Additionally the body may further include one or more instructions to help the user validate the opt in registration request via portal .

To deliver the opt in registration message to the user messaging gateway submits a messaging request e.g. an MM7 messaging request to SMSC and receives a messaging request response from SMSC indicating reception of the messaging request per step . The messaging request and messaging request response may be based on the MM7 protocol i.e. based on SOAP messages including attachments that are transported between networking elements e.g. between messaging gateway and SMSC utilizing HTTP S . As such the messaging request and messaging request response may include one or more informational elements e.g. XML tags in respective SOAP envelopes to facilitate for instance delivery of the opt in registration message to the user. An exemplary list of informational elements that may be included in an MM7 messaging request and an MM7 messaging request response as well as corresponding descriptions and locations within an MM7 messaging request and MM7 messaging request response are respectively provided in TABLES 6 and 7.

Based on one or more of the informational elements of the messaging request such as date and time earliest delivery time delivery condition etc. SMSC delivers the opt in registration message to the intended recipient s provided in the recipient address informational element of the messaging request per step . It is noted that the opt in registration message or content for generating the opt in registration message may be provided in the content informational element of the messaging request. Further SMSC may store the opt in registration message to for instance message content repository or any other suitable storage location or memory of or accessible to SMSC before delivery to the intended recipient address es such as computing device . User devices such as computing device that receive the opt in registration message may transmit an acknowledgement to SMSC in step acknowledging that the opt in registration message was received.

According to exemplary embodiments the user can input the identifier e.g. PIN provided in the opt in registration message to a GUI of portal via for example computing device . In this manner computing device submits a registration validation request to portal per step . Utilizing the identifier portal generates and transmits at step an opt in registration validation request to messaging gateway . It is noted that the opt in registration validation request may utilize the MM7 reference point and thereby may be based on a SOAP message including attachments that is transported between networking elements e.g. between portal and messaging gateway utilizing HTTP S . As such the opt in registration validation request may include one or more informational elements e.g. XML tags in a SOAP envelope to facilitate for instance validating the authenticity of the user actually opting to receive messages associated with the identified value added service s and updating one or more user profiles associated with the user device s . An exemplary list of informational elements that may be included within an MM7 opt in registration validation request as well as corresponding descriptions and locations within an MM7 opt in registration validation request are provided in TABLE 8.

At step messaging gateway via for example registration module and or validation module validates the opt in registration validation request. That is registration module and or validation module may parse the opt in registration validation request for a combination of one or more identifiers such as a combination including a sender address VASP identifier VAS application identifier and validation identifier previously generated by messaging gateway and compare the combination to one or more permissible combinations correlated within a user profile associated with the sender address. As mentioned the user profile may be stored to location register or any other suitable storage location or memory of or accessible to messaging gateway . In step messaging gateway transmits a validation response to portal utilizing for instance an MM7 reference point between messaging gateway and portal . Thus the validation response may be based on a SOAP message including attachments that is transported between networking elements e.g. between portal and messaging gateway utilizing HTTP S . The validation response may include one or more informational elements e.g. XML tags in a SOAP envelope to facilitate for instance notifying portal that the opt in registration validation request was validated and that the address es provided by the user may be permissibly added to one or more distribution lists associated with the VASP and or VAS identifiers. An exemplary list of informational elements that may be included within an MM7 validation response as well as corresponding descriptions and locations within an MM7 validation response are provided in TABLE 9.

It is further noted that in step messaging gateway via for example registration module updates a user profile associated with the sender address es . For instance registration module may modify one or more preferences policies and or parameters of a user profile associated with the sender address es to indicate that a user of corresponding user device s e.g. mobile device has opted to receive messages associated with a VAS identified by the VAS and or VASP identifiers. Accordingly portal receives the validation response and updates per step a distribution list based on the one or more addresses and short codes input by the user to portal . Namely portal modifies one or more distribution lists associated with the one or more short codes input by the user to include the one or more addresses in the distribution list s . It is noted that the distribution list s may be stored to recipient list repository or any other suitable storage location or memory of or accessible to portal . At step portal transmits a confirmation message to for instance computing device confirming subscription to the value added service s . In exemplary embodiments the confirmation message may be presented to the user via a GUI interface of portal . It is also contemplated that the confirmation message may be transmitted to one or more of the address es added to the distribution list s by portal .

Accordingly messaging gateway may validate in step the messaging request based on one or more of the informational elements of the messaging request. For instance validation module may parse the messaging request for one or more identifiers such as a VASP identifier and or a VAS application identifier and compare such identifier s to a plurality of permissible identifiers of VASPs or VAS applications authorized to transmit messages to subscribers via system . Validation module may also block VAS application from transmitting messages to one or more intended recipients per step . That is validation module may parse the messaging request for one or more recipient addresses and utilizing the recipient addresses retrieve from for example location register or any other suitable storage location or memory of or accessible to messaging gateway one or more user profiles corresponding to the recipient addresses. As such validation module may determine whether any of the recipient addresses relate to subscribers who have opted not to receive messages from the VASP associated with VAS application and or from VAS application . Additionally validation module may further determine whether any of the recipient address es relate to address es that have been deactivated. In this example validation module determines that an address of mobile device relates to a subscriber who has opted to receive messages associated with VAS application whereas an address of mobile device either relates to a subscriber who has opted not to receive messages associated with VAS application or relates to a deactivated address. As part of blocking VAS application from messaging opted out subscribers and or deactivated addresses validation module may remove corresponding addresses from the messaging request such as removing the recipient address associated with mobile terminal from a corresponding informational element of the messaging request. In step messaging gateway transmits a messaging request response e.g. an MM7 messaging request response to VAS application informing VAS application of the status of the submission of the messaging request. Similar to the messaging request the messaging request response may be based on a SOAP message including attachments whereby HTTP S is utilized as the transport protocol between networking elements. As before these informational element s may be provided as one or more XML tags. Accordingly a messaging request response may include one or more informational elements in the SOAP envelope to inform VAS application of the status of the submission of the messaging request. An exemplary list of informational elements that may be included within an MM7 messaging request response as well as corresponding descriptions and locations within an MM7 messaging request response are provided in TABLE 11.

At step messaging gateway forwards the messaging request or modified messaging request to messaging service center that in exemplary embodiments may be an SMSC MMSC or any other suitable messaging service center. In turn messaging service center responds to messaging gateway with a messaging request response per step . Based on one or more of the informational elements of the messaging request such as date and time earliest delivery time delivery condition etc. messaging service center delivers one or more messages e.g. SMS messages MMS messages etc. to the intended recipient s provided in the recipient address informational element of the messaging request. It is noted that the one or more messages or content for generating the one or more messages may be provided in the content informational element of the messaging request. Additionally or alternatively the content informational element may specify addressing information such as a uniform resource locator URL IP address MAC address etc. that messaging service center can utilize to retrieve one or more messages or messaging content from for example message content repository or any other suitable storage location or memory of or accessible to messaging service center . As such messaging service center may generate one or more of the message s based on received and or retrieved message content. It is noted that messaging service center may store the one or more messages to for instance message content repository or any other suitable storage location or memory of or accessible to messaging service center before delivering the message s to the intended recipient address es . Thus per step messaging service center delivers the message s to the intended recipient address es . That is messaging service center transmits the message s over one or more of networks and to one or more user devices and . In this example messaging service center only delivers a message to mobile device and as such a subscriber associated with mobile device does not have to be burdened by an unsolicited or otherwise unwanted message from VAS application

At step mobile device transmits an acknowledgement to messaging service center acknowledging the message was received. Alternatively messaging service center may receive delivery status information from one or more networking nodes e.g. routers switches etc. of network and or concerning delivery of the message s to intended recipient s such as mobile device . It is contemplated that this delivery status information may be used by messaging service center to ensure or guarantee delivery. That is when a delivery attempt fails due to for instance a temporary network failure messaging service center may monitor for or request notification when intended recipient s become available or otherwise accessible so that delivery may be re initiated. Accordingly messaging service center may utilize information received in the acknowledgement or the delivery status information to generate a delivery report per step . Exemplary informational elements that may be included within a delivery report are provided in TABLE 12.

At step messaging service center transmits the delivery report to messaging gateway . Messaging gateway per step transmits an acknowledgment to messaging service center acknowledging receipt of the delivery report. At step messaging gateway via for example event data interface stores the delivery report or information provided therein to event data repository . It is noted that this information may be utilized for billing purposes. In step the delivery report is forwarded to VAS application by messaging gateway . Accordingly VAS application transmits an acknowledgment to messaging gateway acknowledging receipt of the delivery report per step .

According to various exemplary embodiments subscribers may also be enabled to opt out of receiving messages associated with one or more value added services. are sequence diagrams of processes for unsubscribing users to a value added service according to exemplary embodiments. For illustrative purposes the processes are described with reference to . It is noted that the steps of the processes may be performed in any suitable order as well as combined or separated in any suitable manner. In particular illustrates an exemplary sequence diagram for unsubscribing a user to a value added service based on the exchange of one or more SMS messages. At step mobile device submits an SMS message to SMSC to opt out of receiving messages associated with for instance VAS application . That is a user of mobile terminal formulates an SMS message for delivery to a particular VASP that in exemplary embodiments may be identified by a short code included in a header of the SMS message. The SMS message may further include in a body portion a short code and or textual comment or command for unsubscribing the user to a particular VAS associated with the short code provided in the body and thereby associated with the VASP identified in the header of the SMS message. For instance the user may formulate an SMS message for delivery to a particular VASP that is identified by short code 98765 in a header of the SMS message and that includes Cancel 45654 in a body of the SMS message. It is contemplated that other textual commands may be alternatively or additionally utilized such as remove opt out unsubscribe etc.

At step SMSC forwards the opt out message to messaging gateway as for example an MM7 delivery request and messaging gateway responds with an MM7 delivery request response. Exemplary lists of informational elements that may be included within the MM7 delivery request and MM7 delivery request response are respectively provided in TABLES 1 and 2. Accordingly messaging gateway via for example registration module may parse the delivery request for one or more commands comments or subjects as well as a sender address a VAS application identifier and or a VASP identifier. The commands comments or subjects enable messaging gateway to identify the messaging request as an opt out message delivery request. In this manner registration module may modify one or more preferences policies and or parameters of a user profile associated with the sender address i.e. address of mobile terminal to indicate that a user of mobile terminal has opted to terminate receiving messages associated with a particular VAS identified by the VAS application and or VASP identifiers i.e. VAS application of the particular VASP per step . It is noted that the one or more preferences policies and or parameters may be stored to location register or any other suitable storage location or memory of or accessible to messaging gateway . Updating the user profile enables messaging gateway to block unsolicited undesirable or unwanted messages associated with one or more value added services from being delivered to the user such as in instances when the value added service s impermissibly request for message delivery to the user.

In exemplary embodiments messaging gateway may also forward the SMS message to VAS application in for example an MM7 opt out message and VAS application may respond with an acknowledgment per step . An exemplary list of informational elements that may be included within the MM7 opt out message may be similar to the informational elements of an MM7 opt in message provided in TABLE 3. At step VAS application updates a distribution list based on one or more of the informational elements of the opt out message. For instance VAS application may parse the opt out message for a sender address and a VAS identifier to thereby modify a distribution list associated with the VAS identifier to exclude the sender address. It is noted that the distribution list may be stored to recipient list repository or any other suitable storage location or memory of or accessible to VAS application . Accordingly VAS application may transmit in step an opt out confirmation message to mobile device to confirm that the user was unsubscribed to the identified VAS. Again it is noted that a more detailed description of transmitting messages to user devices by VAS applications is provided with .

At step messaging gateway via for instance validation module may validate the opt out deregistration request based on one or more informational elements of the request. For instance validation module may parse the opt out deregistration request for one or more identifiers such as a VASP identifier and or a VAS application identifier and compare such identifier s to a plurality of permissible identifiers of VAS applications authorized to transmit messages via system . In this example validation module validates the opt out deregistration request and thereby causes registration module to update a user profile associated with the address es input to portal by the user per step . For instance registration module may modify one or more preferences policies and or parameters of a user profile associated with the address es to indicate that a user of one or more user devices corresponding to the address es has opted to terminate receiving messages associated with one or more of value added services identified by the short code s input to portal by the user. It is noted that the one or more preferences policies and or parameters may be stored to location register or any other suitable storage location or memory of or accessible to messaging gateway . As previously described updating the user profile enables messaging gateway to block unsolicited undesirable or unwanted messages even in instances when VAS applications impermissibly request message delivery. This also enables a service provider of the messaging services of system to effectively and efficiently manage the onslaught of SPAM without inadvertently affecting legitimate enterprise or intruding upon privacy rights.

According to exemplary embodiments messaging gateway may transmit an opt out confirmation to portal and portal may acknowledge receipt of the opt out confirmation by transmitting an opt out confirmation response to messaging gateway per step . It is noted that messaging gateway and portal can utilize an MM7 reference point for interfacing with one another. In this manner the opt out confirmation and the opt out confirmation response may be based on respective SOAP messages including attachments that are transported between networking elements e.g. between portal and messaging gateway utilizing HTTP S . The opt out confirmation and the opt out confirmation response may include one or more informational elements e.g. XML tags in a SOAP envelope to facilitate for instance notifying portal that the opt out deregistration request was validated and that one or more user profiles associated with the address es input by the user to portal were updated to prevent messages associated with the short code s input by the user to portal from being received. Exemplary lists of informational elements that may be included within an MM7 opt out confirmation and an MM7 opt out confirmation response as well as corresponding descriptions and locations within an MM7 opt out confirmation and MM7 opt out confirmation response are respectively provided in TABLES 13 and 14.

At step portal transmits an opt out confirmation to for instance computing device confirming the opt out deregistration to the one or more value added services associated with the short code s input by the user to portal . According to exemplary embodiments the opt out confirmation may be presented to the user via a GUI interface of portal . It is also contemplated that the opt out confirmation may be transmitted to one or more of the address es removed from the distribution list s by portal . In this manner messaging gateway may also provide an opt out confirmation to one or more of the address es that were input to portal . For instance messaging gateway may provide an opt out deregistration message such as an opt out SMS message to mobile terminal to inform a user associated with mobile terminal of a status e.g. completion of the opt out deregistration process. As such messaging gateway via for example registration module may submit a messaging request e.g. an MM7 messaging request to SMSC and thereby receive a messaging request response from SMSC indicating reception of the messaging request per step . As previously described the messaging request and messaging request response may utilize an MM7 reference point and therefore may include one or more informational elements in respective SOAP envelopes to facilitate for instance delivery of the opt out deregistration message to the user e.g. to mobile terminal . Exemplary lists of informational elements that may be included within an MM7 messaging request and an MM7 messaging request response as well as corresponding descriptions and locations within an MM7 messaging request and MM7 messaging request response are respectively provided in TABLES 6 and 7. Based on one or more of the informational elements of the messaging request such as date and time earliest delivery time delivery condition etc. SMSC delivers the opt out deregistration message to intended recipient address es provided in the recipient address informational element of the messaging request per step . It is noted that the opt out deregistration message or content for generating the opt out deregistration confirmation message may be provided in the content informational element of the messaging request by for example messaging gateway . Further SMSC may store the opt out deregistration confirmation message to for instance message content repository or any other suitable storage location or memory of or accessible to SMSC before delivery to recipient s .

According to certain embodiments addresses of user devices and may become deactivated such as when account subscriptions to the core services of system are terminated. To prevent subsequent users later receiving these addresses from receiving messages associated with value added service s that the subsequent users have not opted to receive system may also facilitate deactivating the addresses from the gateway services e.g. ensuring the addresses are removed from VAS distribution lists.

According to exemplary embodiments messaging gateway may also transmit one or more opt out deregistration requests to one or more VAS applications e.g. VAS application corresponding to the short code s determined by registration module and the VAS applications may provide one or more opt out deregistration request responses to messaging gateway per step . It is noted that the opt out deregistration request may include one or more commands codes instructions etc. to cause for instance VAS application to remove the deactivated addresses from one or more distribution lists stored to for example recipient lists repository or any other suitable storage location of or accessible to VAS application . In this manner the opt out deregistration request and opt out deregistration request response may utilize an MM7 reference point between messaging gateway and the VAS applications such that the opt out deregistration request and opt out deregistration request response may be respectively similar to the opt in registration request and opt in registration request response of . As such exemplary lists of informational elements that may be included within an MM7 opt out deregistration request and MM7 opt out deregistration request response may also be provided in TABLES 4 and 5. As such the VAS applications e.g. VAS application are responsible for removing the deactivated address es from their distribution list s per step . Once complete the VAS applications may transmit one or more confirmation messages to messaging gateway to inform messaging gateway that the deactivated address es have been removed from their distribution list s and messaging gateway may acknowledge receipt of the confirmation s in step .

The processes described herein for providing the messaging gateway services of system may be implemented via software hardware e.g. general processor Digital Signal Processing DSP chip an Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs etc. firmware or a combination thereof. Such exemplary hardware for performing the described functions is detailed below.

The computer system may be coupled via the bus to a display such as a cathode ray tube CRT liquid crystal display active matrix display or plasma display for displaying information to a computer user. An input device such as a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys is coupled to the bus for communicating information and command selections to the processor . Another type of user input device is a cursor control such as a mouse a trackball or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to the processor and for controlling cursor movement on the display .

According to an exemplary embodiment the processes described herein are performed by the computer system in response to the processor executing an arrangement of instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions can be read into main memory from another computer readable medium such as the storage device . Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory causes the processor to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory . In alternative embodiments hard wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement exemplary embodiments. Thus exemplary embodiments are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.

The computer system also includes a communication interface coupled to bus . The communication interface provides a two way data communication coupling to a network link connected to a local network . For example the communication interface may be a digital subscriber line DSL card or modem an integrated services digital network ISDN card a cable modem a telephone modem or any other communication interface to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of communication line. As another example communication interface may be a local area network LAN card e.g. for Ethernet or an Asynchronous Transfer Model ATM network to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links can also be implemented. In any such implementation communication interface sends and receives electrical electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information. Further the communication interface can include peripheral interface devices such as a Universal Serial Bus USB interface a PCMCIA Personal Computer Memory Card International Association interface etc. Although a single communication interface is depicted in multiple communication interfaces can also be employed.

The network link typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example the network link may provide a connection through local network to a host computer which has connectivity to a network e.g. a wide area network WAN or the global packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the Internet or to data equipment operated by a service provider. The local network and the network both use electrical electromagnetic or optical signals to convey information and instructions. The signals through the various networks and the signals on the network link and through the communication interface which communicate digital data with the computer system are exemplary forms of carrier waves bearing the information and instructions.

The computer system can send messages and receive data including program code through the network s the network link and the communication interface . In the Internet example a server not shown might transmit requested code belonging to an application program for implementing an exemplary embodiment through the network the local network and the communication interface . The processor may execute the transmitted code while being received and or store the code in the storage device or other non volatile storage for later execution. In this manner the computer system may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.

The term computer readable medium as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to the processor for execution. Such a medium may take many forms including but not limited to non volatile media volatile media and transmission media. Non volatile media include for example optical or magnetic disks such as the storage device . Volatile media include dynamic memory such as main memory . Transmission media include coaxial cables copper wire and fiber optics including the wires that comprise the bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic optical or electromagnetic waves such as those generated during radio frequency RF and infrared IR data communications. Common forms of computer readable media include for example a floppy disk a flexible disk hard disk magnetic tape any other magnetic medium a CD ROM CDRW DVD any other optical medium punch cards paper tape optical mark sheets any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia a RAM a PROM and EPROM a FLASH EPROM any other memory chip or cartridge a carrier wave or any other medium from which a computer can read.

Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in providing instructions to a processor for execution. For example the instructions for carrying out at least part of the exemplary embodiments may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem of a local computer system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device such as a personal digital assistant PDA or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory can optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.

While certain exemplary embodiments and implementations have been described herein other embodiments and modifications will be apparent from this description. Accordingly the invention is not limited to such embodiments but rather to the broader scope of the presented claims and various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements.
