Social networking has emerged to become a premium medium of communication for users in the electronic marketplace. Also social networking sites produce vast amounts of data. Accessing and processing the vast amounts of data in a meaningful manner capable of discernment remains problematic.

The present disclosure relates to accessing and processing social media content. Social networking has emerged to become a premium medium of communication for users in the electronic marketplace. For example users may voice their comments about products and or services whether positive or negative by writing and submitting posts available on one or more social networking sites. Similarly social networking sites may be used by customer service agents to identify communications relating to one or more items for sell in various marketplaces e.g. electronic marketplaces . For example customer service agents may use posts to identify feedback associated with services and or products as well as communicate with other customer service agents. As may be appreciated these types of social networking sites produce vast amounts of data. For example social networking sites may handle millions to hundreds of millions of posts in a given day. Accessing and processing the vast amounts of data in a meaningful manner capable of discernment remains problematic.

Accordingly it may be desirable to sort through vast amounts of social networking data to identify relevant information based on user defined extraction configurations all while ignoring irrelevant and or redundant information. Such user defined configurations may include search strings keywords social networking sites extraction times actions events notifications etc. as will be discussed in greater detail below.

In the following discussion a general description of the system and its components is provided followed by a discussion of the operation of the same.

With reference to shown is a non limiting example a graph comprising statistical information associated for example with social networking posts accessed based on an extraction configuration defined by a user of a site monitoring service. In the non limiting example of an extraction configuration defined by a user may comprise keywords social networks scrape durations and or other information to be used by a site monitoring service. Accordingly the site monitoring service may access the defined social networks or other defined sources at the defined scrape durations to search for the defined keywords .

As a non limiting example a merchant selling items via an electronic commerce application may sell for example electronic equipment under a mock XYZ brand. The merchant may desire to determine sentiment of buyers of the XYZ brand e.g. to determine whether to continue selling the XYZ products the quality of the XYZ products etc. . Accordingly the merchant may define a keyword and or search string of XYZ angry . The merchant may further define a social network site and a scrape duration . A site monitoring service may search the defined social network site or other defined source at the defined scrape duration for the search string provided by the merchant. The information defined by the user comprises at least a portion of an extraction configuration the extraction configuration to be utilized by the site monitoring service in extracting posts and or information associated with posts from one or more sources. A graph may be presented comprising the number of posts containing the string XYZ Tablet between a predefined range of time. As may be appreciated other information and or analytics associated with identified posts may be obtained and or shown.

Next a discussion of the computing environment is provided in which the information obtained from posts is determined followed by a discussion of the operation of the same.

With reference to shown is a networked environment according to various embodiments. The networked environment includes a computing environment a client device and one or more social networks which are in data communication with each other via a network . The network includes for example the Internet intranets extranets wide area networks WANs local area networks LANs wired networks wireless networks or other suitable networks etc. or any combination of two or more such networks.

The computing environment may comprise for example a server computer or any other system providing computing capability. Alternatively the computing environment may employ a plurality of computing devices that may be employed that are arranged for example in one or more server banks or computer banks or other arrangements. Such computing devices may be located in a single installation or may be distributed among many different geographical locations. For example the computing environment may include a plurality of computing devices that together may comprise a cloud computing resource a grid computing resource and or any other distributed computing arrangement. In some cases the computing environment may correspond to an elastic computing resource where the allotted capacity of processing network storage or other computing related resources may vary over time. Additionally some or all of the components of the computing environment may be used internally by an entity and or may be made available to third parties for example as a web service in response to a subscription.

Various applications and or other functionality may be executed in the computing environment according to various embodiments. Also various data is stored in a data store that is accessible to the computing environment . The data store may be representative of a plurality of data stores as can be appreciated. The data stored in the data store for example is associated with the operation of the various applications and or functional entities described below.

The components executed on the computing environment for example include an electronic commerce application a site monitoring service a natural language processor a sentiment determination service and other applications services processes systems engines or functionality not discussed in detail herein.

The electronic commerce system is executed in order to facilitate the online purchase of items and or services over the network . The electronic commerce system also performs various backend functions associated with the online presence of a merchant in order to facilitate the online purchase of items and or services as will be described. For example the electronic commerce system generates network pages such as web pages or other types of network content that are provided to clients for the purposes of selecting items for purchase rental download lease or other form of consumption as will be described.

The site monitoring service is executed to scrape and or extract information from sources e.g. web pages social networking sites blogs etc. based on an extraction configuration. An extraction configuration may comprise for example keywords search strings web page definitions social network site definitions blog definitions scrape and or extraction times actions to initiate events to occur notifications to be transmitted tickets to be created and or escalated and or any other information. The site monitoring service may communicate with the natural language processor and or the sentiment determination service in extracting and or interpreting information from the one or more posts. The site monitoring service may further communicate with the electronic commerce application in identifying items mentioned in the posts and or associating posts with users of the defined sources e.g. users of a social networking site . Moreover the site monitoring service may communicate with one or more social networks via an API or other means as will be discussed in greater detail below.

The natural language processor is executed to derive meaning from posts submitted by users of a social networking site or from a similar system by employing known heuristics and or derivation strategies. For example a user may have submitted a post stating I purchased a widget from Example.com. The natural language processor may derive that the author of the post claimed to have purchased an item the widget from an electronic commerce site Example.com .

Furthermore the natural language processor may employ machine learning to improve the derivation of meaning from posts. As may be appreciated human language is constantly changing and evolving. Accordingly the natural language processor may identify new terms e.g. slang terms and communicate with external services to define the new terms to be employed in future derivations. In addition to new words or phrases the natural language processor may employ known machine learning techniques to identify relevant from irrelevant posts. By employing machine learning future posts may have a higher degree of accuracy in being classified as relevant or irrelevant. Irrelevant posts may be ignored by the site monitoring service as may be appreciated.

The sentiment determination service is executed to derive sentiment from a meaning of a post determined by the natural language processor . To expand on the example above a user may have submitted a post stating I purchased a widget from Example.com and I love it Alternatively the user may have submitted a post stating I purchased a widget from Example.com and I hate it The sentiment determination service may identify that the word love or hate was used in the post. Accordingly the sentiment determination service may identify and associate a sentiment level with the post. As discussed above the site monitoring service may take action in response to an identified sentiment level. For example if a user disliked a purchased product the merchant may be notified of the user s dissatisfaction.

The data stored in the data store includes for example data associated with catalogs merchants orders accounts posts notifications extraction configurations statistics and potentially other data including social network data . Data associated with catalogs may include information related to a plurality of items offered for order through the electronic commerce application . An item may refer to a product good service software download multimedia download social networking profile or any combination bundle or package thereof that may be offered for sale purchase rental lease download and or any other form of consumption as may be appreciated. The various data associated with catalogs may include for example titles descriptions quantities conditions images options weights volumes customer reviews customer ratings keywords shipping restrictions prices tax classifications unique identifiers and any other data related to items.

Merchants may comprise any sellers and or vendors on the electronic commerce application as may be appreciated. Orders may comprise data associated with the sale purchase rental lease download and or any other form of consumption of any of the items offered via the electronic commerce application . Accounts may comprise data associated with any users of the electronic commerce application and or the site monitoring service . Accounts may further comprise data related to users of a social network as may be appreciated. Posts may comprise data associated with a post entry comment listing and or any other mode of speech made by a user on a source e.g. a blog social network web page item comments etc. .

Notifications may comprise data associated with notifications to transmit defined by a user in association with an extraction configuration . For example a user may desire to be notified immediately when a post is made comprising the keyword URGENT. Accordingly a notification may be made via e mail Short Message Service SMS phone call voicemail pop up message a modification of a network page and or any other medium of communication. Extraction configurations may comprise definitions for keywords social networks scrape durations actions to initiate notifications and or any other information via the site monitoring service to be utilized in extracting information from one or more sites. Statistics may comprise statistical information associated with one or more posts determined for example by site monitoring service and or a social networking site.

The client is representative of a plurality of client devices that may be coupled to the network . The client may comprise for example a processor based system such as a computer system. Such a computer system may be embodied in the form of a desktop computer a laptop computer personal digital assistants cellular telephones smartphones set top boxes music players web pads tablet computer systems game consoles electronic book readers or other devices with like capability. The client may include a display . The display may comprise for example one or more devices such as liquid crystal display LCD displays gas plasma based flat panel displays organic light emitting diode OLED displays LCD projectors or other types of display devices etc.

The client may be configured to execute various applications such as a client application and or other applications. The client application may be executed in a client for example to access network content served up by the computing environment and or other servers thereby rendering a user interface on the display . To this end the client application may comprise for example a browser a dedicated application etc. and the user interface may comprise a network page an application screen etc. The client may be configured to execute applications beyond the client application such as for example email applications social networking applications word processors spreadsheets and or other applications.

The one or more social networks may be network pages rendered by social networking applications. For example users of the social networks may have a profile comprising information and or posts associated with the users. In an alternative embodiment the social network may be one or more application programming interfaces API configured to provide data from the social networking applications typically data a social networking application makes publicly available. The social networks may be accessed by the computing environment as will be discussed in greater detail below.

Next a general description of the operation of the various components of the networked environment is provided. To begin one or more users of the site monitoring service may provide an extraction configuration comprising definitions for keywords social networks scrape durations actions to initiate events notifications and or any other information via the site monitoring service to be stored for future access in for example data store . The extraction configurations may be accessed and or received by the site monitoring service . As a non limiting example a merchant may have defined keywords to be searched for on defined social networks at defined scrape durations. The site monitoring service may have stored the definition in for example data store to be accessed at a later time.

In one embodiment actions to initiate upon the occurrence of condition may be defined as a numeric threshold of posts . For example if a significant portion of posts comprise one or more keywords phrases and or identifiers e.g. a hash tag and a keyword an action defined by the user may be initiated. Thus when a certain amount of post traffic meets or exceeds the threshold an occurrence of the defined action may be initiated by the site monitoring system .

The extraction configuration comprising the definitions is subsequently used to search for query and or extract data from posts . As a non limiting example a merchant may have defined a search to occur on a predefined social networking application repeated every half hour looking for XYZ Tablet. The definitions the social networking application the scrape duration and or the search string may be used to search the predefined social networking application. In the event no posts are found in the query an action may automatically be initiated. For example the merchant may have predefined the action of receiving an e mail when a search has been conducted resulting in no posts being found. The posts may be accessed by communicating with the social networks via an API and or extracting the information from a source of a network page encoded by the social network . Alternatively the posts may be accessed and or received in response to a push notification transmitted by the social network . The push notification may be made by predefining an extraction configuration with the social network as may be appreciated. The site monitoring service may identify a relevancy of a post based at least in part on the extraction configuration defined by the user.

Subsequently the natural language processor may employ natural language processing to the posts and or the information extracted from the posts . The natural language processor or a similar service may derive meaning from the posts by employing known heuristics and or derivation strategies. For example a user may have submitted a post stating I purchased a widget from Example.com. The natural language processor may derive that the author of the post claimed to have purchased an item the widget from an electronic commerce site Example.com .

The sentiment determination service may determine a sentiment level from the posts . For example a user may have submitted a post stating I purchased a widget from Example.com and I love it Alternatively the user may have submitted a post stating I purchased a widget from Example.com and I hate it The sentiment determination service may identify that the word love or hate was used in the post . Accordingly the sentiment determination service may identify and associate a sentiment level with each of the posts .

The site monitoring service may then determine whether one or more items available in the catalog is able to be identified from the posts . For example a user of a social networking application may have submitted a post stating I purchased an XYZ Tablet from Example.com. The XYZ Tablet item recognized by the natural language processor may be compared to the catalog to determine whether the item is sold for example through the electronic commerce application . In the event an item is identified the item may be associated with the post . Such association may be used later in determining the customer satisfaction of an item e.g. using the sentiment level determining what in the item could be improved etc.

Similarly the site monitoring service may determine whether one or more users of the electronic commerce application is able to be identified from one or more of the posts . For example a user of the electronic commerce application may have voluntarily linked his or her social networking account s with the electronic commerce application . The site monitoring service may determine that a user name associated with a post is the same as a user name previously linked to the electronic commerce application or similar system. In the event a user is identified the user may be associated with the post . Such association may be used later in for example suggesting items to the user identifying preferences associated with the user analyzing customer satisfaction verifying shipment of an item and or handling customer disputes.

It may be determined whether an action should be initiated based at least in part on the occurrence of a condition wherein the action to be initiated and or the condition are defined by the user and accessed by the site monitoring system . For example a merchant may have previously defined that the merchant is to receive an e mail in response to a certain number of posts comprising XYZ Tablet being found within a 24 hour interval. Alternatively the merchant may have defined that the price on an XYZ Tablet the merchant is selling via electronic commerce application is to be reduced or increased in the event the item is trending on one or more social networking sites. If a post is associated with a negative sentiment level and or contains information associated with an issue the post may be forwarded to a customer service agent.

The site monitoring system may then encode a user interface comprising the posts and or information about the posts . For example depicts a graph comprising analytics for the keywords XYZ Tablets found on two social networking sites i.e. Site and Site . The site monitoring system may then transmit the user interface to a client for rendering in a display.

Referring next to shown is an example social networking application comprising posts and or made by users in the form of a feed in a user interface . In the non limiting example of a social networking application may comprise a feed showing a multitude of posts from a multitude of users of the social networking application. A post typically comprises one or more messages and or as may be appreciated. Moreover various information may be displayed in association with a post . For example a name and or of the user creating and or sharing a post originally created by another user may be shown. Additionally timestamps and or showing the date and or time in which a post was created and or shared on the social networking application may be shown.

As shown in social networking application generally comprises features permitting other users to interact with a post . For example a user may comment on a post via a commenting feature and or . A user may also be able to share a post via a sharing feature and or . Moreover a feature permitting a user to express sentiment towards a post may be provided not shown . As a non limiting example a user may rate a post with one to five stars identifying the user s sentiment towards the post . As may be appreciated the various features permitting users to interact with a post may be identified to determine a general sentiment level of the post . The sentiment level may be a sentiment level reflecting other users sentiments towards the post as opposed to the author of the post s sentiment level. The site monitoring service may identify this distinction and store a sentiment level corresponding to other social networking users sentiments towards the post . In addition the site monitoring service may proceed with initiating an action e.g. transmitting a notification to a merchant selling an item in response to the identification of the sentiment levels.

As discussed above the site monitoring service may identify a post as well as the various information associated with the post from a social networking application. If the post comprises relevant information information associated with the post may be saved for example in data store . Moreover other comments identified relevant to a post may be analyzed in addition to the post itself.

Turning now to shown is an example user interface of a profile page displaying a profile corresponding to a user of a social networking application. A profile page may comprise various information volunteered and or submitted by the user. For example a profile page may contain information such as the age sex marital status location and or occupation of a user. In addition a profile page may contain posts made by a user.

As may be appreciated the site monitoring service may only access information made publicly available and or volunteered by the user and the social networking application in order to respect the privacy of the user. For example a user may volunteer information contained on his or her social networking profile in exchange for offers tailored to that user. Accordingly the publicly available information of a user may be associated with one or posts and or made by the user.

Moving on to shown is a non limiting example a user interface that may be accessed by a user of the site monitoring service . In the non limiting example of a dashboard is tailored to a merchant of an electronic commerce application . For example a merchant may desire to know sentiment levels of past or future buyers related to products and or services provided by the merchant. The merchant may define keywords social networks scrape durations and or other information to be used by the site monitoring service . Accordingly the site monitoring service may access the social networks defined by the merchant at the defined scrape durations to search for the defined keywords . The merchant s definitions may be provided to the merchant via a table to facilitate the addition modification and or removal of definitions from an extraction configuration .

As a non limiting example a merchant may sell electronic equipment under a mock XYZ brand. The merchant may desire to determine sentiment levels of buyers of the XYZ brand e.g. to determine whether to continue selling the XYZ products . Accordingly the merchant may define an extraction configuration comprising a keyword and or search string of XYZ angry . The merchant may further define a social network site and a scrape duration . The site monitoring service may search the defined social network site at the defined scrape duration for the keyword and or search string defined by the merchant.

In addition to sentiment levels various statistics and information may be derived from posts identified by the site monitoring service . For example a graph may be presented comprising the number of posts containing the string XYZ Tablet between a predefined range of time. As may be appreciated other information and or analytics associated with identified posts may be shown. A user may modify previously created extraction configurations by for example engaging a modify component . Similarly a user may create a new extraction configuration by for example engaging an add component . As discussed above with respect to a user may further define notifications to transmit and or actions to initiate upon detection of a user defined condition as will be discussed in greater detail below.

Referring next to shown is a non limiting example of the user interface of that may be accessed by a user of the site monitoring service . As discussed above with respect to a dashboard may be tailored to a merchant of an electronic commerce application . As discussed above with respect to a user may define notifications to transmit and or actions to initiate upon detection of a keyword and or search string defined by a user. For example a notification may take the form of an alert dialog rendered in the user interface although a notification may further comprise for example an e mail SMS message etc. A notification may comprise a message stating the purpose of the notification. In the non limiting example of a merchant or customer service management may be notified for example when the merchant has created an action to be notified when the keyword urgent is used in association with XYZ Tablet on a particular source i.e. Site .

Various features may be associated with a notification as may be appreciated. For example a notification may provide a URL link to view the post in for example the dashboard or via the site the post originated. The user may also be prompted with the ability to edit the defined action dismiss the defined action and or reassign the defined action e.g. to another merchant and or customer service agent . Moreover the user may be prompted to view the notification settings associated with the action and or notification.

Referring next to shown is an exemplary data structure that may be transmitted by a social networking application to the site monitoring service upon receipt of a request transmitted by the site monitoring service . In the non limiting example of a JavaScript Object Notification JSON data structure may be received by the site monitoring service from a defined source e.g. a social networking site . The JSON data structure may be parsed by the site monitoring service to obtain information made publicly available by the social networking application via the social networking application s API. Such information may comprise a message made in the post the social network API name a profile image URL a time zone of the post and or a location associated with the post e.g. a location where the post was made .

Although the non limiting example of depicts an exemplary JSON data structure other data interchange technologies and or web services may be employed. For example Representational State Transfer REST Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP Extensible Markup Language XML and or any other data interchange technology or web service may be employed.

Turning now to shown is an exemplary HyperText Markup Language HTML document that may be encoded by a social networking application. The site monitoring service may access the HTML document to access information within the HTML document for example in the event a web service is not provided by the social networking application. Similar to the JSON data structure the HTML document may be parsed by the site monitoring service to obtain information made publicly available by the social networking application. The HTML document may comprise one or more posts and or . Additionally the HTML documents may comprise information associated with the author of the posts . Although the non limiting example of depicts an HTML document other data interchange technologies and or web services may be employed as discussed above with respect to .

Moving on to shown is a flowchart that provides one example of the operation of a portion of the site monitoring service according to various embodiments. It is understood that the flowchart of provides merely an example of the many different types of functional arrangements that may be employed to implement the operation of the portion of the site monitoring service as described herein. As an alternative the flowchart of may be viewed as depicting an example of steps of a method implemented in the computing environment according to one or more embodiments.

Beginning with box an extraction configuration comprising definitions for keywords social networks scrape durations and or actions may be accessed and or received by the site monitoring service . As a non limiting example a merchant may have defined keywords to be searched for on defined social networks at defined scrape durations. The site monitoring service may have stored the definition in for example data store to be accessed at a later time.

In box the definitions are used to search for and or extract data from posts . For example a merchant may have defined a search to occur on a predefined social networking application repeated every half hour looking for XYZ Tablet. The definitions the social networking application the scrape duration and or the search string may be used to search the predefined social networking application in order to obtain extraction data from the one or more posts . In box it is determined whether the search was able to find any posts . In the event no posts are found in the query in box an action may be initiated. For example the merchant may have predefined the action of receiving an e mail when a search has been initiated resulting in no posts being found. If no posts are found no further analysis may be necessary.

In box natural language processing may be applied to the posts and or the information extracted from the posts . The natural language processor or a similar service may derive meaning from the posts by employing known heuristics and or derivation strategies. For example a user may have submitted a post stating I purchased a widget from Example.com. The natural language processor may derive that the author of the post claimed to have purchased an item the widget from an electronic commerce site Example.com .

In box a sentiment level may be determined from the posts by employing the sentiment determination service . For example a user may have submitted a post stating I purchased a widget from Example.com and I love it Alternatively the user may have submitted a post stating I purchased a widget from Example.com and I hate it The sentiment determination service may identify that the word love or hate was used in the post . Accordingly the sentiment determination service may identify and associate a sentiment level with each of the posts .

Next in box it may be determined whether an item available in the catalog is able to be identified. For example a user of a social networking application may have submitted a post stating I purchased an XYZ Tablet from Example.com. The XYZ Tablet item recognized by the natural language processor may be compared to the catalog to determine whether the item is sold for example through the electronic commerce application . In the event an item is identified in box the item may be associated with the post . Such association may be used later in determining the customer satisfaction of an item e.g. using the sentiment level determining what in the item could be improved etc.

Similarly in box it may be determined whether a user of the electronic commerce application is able to be identified. For example a user of the electronic commerce application may have voluntarily linked his or her social networking account s with the electronic commerce application . The site monitoring service may determine that a user name associated with a post is the same as a user name previously linked to the electronic commerce application or similar system. In the event a user is identified in box the user may be associated with the post . Such association may be used later in for example suggesting items to the user analyzing customer satisfaction verifying shipment of an item and or handling customer disputes.

In box it may be determined whether a condition previously defined by the user in association with an action has been identified. For example a merchant may have previously defined that the merchant is to receive a notification e.g. an e mail SMS etc. in response to a certain number of posts comprising XYZ Tablet being found within a 24 hour interval. Alternatively the merchant may have defined that the price on an XYZ Tablet the merchant is selling via electronic commerce application is to be reduced or increased in the event the item is trending on one or more social networking sites. In the event the condition has be identified the action previously defined by the user may be initiated in box .

In one embodiment a customer service agent may receive posts comprising issues and or problems experienced by customers. An action may be defined to resolve an identified issue in the post . For example if a user has stated in a post My XYZ Tablet operating system freezes when I turn it on the service monitoring system may transmit a notification to a customer service agent associated with the electronic commerce application .

In box a user interface comprising the posts and or extraction data extracted from the posts may be encoded. For example depicts a graph comprising analytics for the keywords XYZ Tablets found on two social networking sites i.e. Site and Site . In box the user interface may be transmitted to a client for rendering in a display .

Finally in box post processing may be conducted on the extracted data. Post processing may include for example generating statistics indexing data for improved performance applying machine learning processor to improve components of the system etc. Although depicted as a final step in post processing may occur asynchronously during execution of any of the components of the computing environment as may be appreciated.
