This application claims priority to and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 2012 0127793 filed on Nov. 13 2012 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for managing security contents using a virtual folder and more particularly to an apparatus and method for managing security contents using a virtual folder which may enable contents created in different environments to be controlled according to authority set in the contents or a user without separate operations in the different environments.

As cloud computing technology is widely used with the dissemination of smart phones and development of wireless communication technology a computing environment to create and browse contents such as documents pictures videos and the like is becoming diverse. However due to the difference between a content creation environment and a content browsing environment a case may occur in which the cloud computing technology is not properly utilized. In order to properly take advantage of the cloud computing technology it is necessary to support creation and browsing of the contents in the same environment without any content conversion. In particular in order to browse contents in different operating system OS environments it is necessary to create and browse the contents through a common environment. In order to support this it is necessary to establish a virtual environment suitable for each OS environment so that control related to creation browsing authority and the like of the contents may be possible. For example techniques that enable encoded contents created in a Microsoft s Windows MS Windows environment to be controlled according to authority of the contents without a separate operation in a Mac OS environment different from the MS Windows environment are required.

However as to techniques which have been proposed so far only technique that creates a separate virtual database that is accessible by a plurality of user terminals to thereby manage contents or creates a virtual folder in each user terminal using virtualization technology to thereby manage contents has been proposed but there is no technique that can accommodate the above mentioned requirements. In particular the technique that creates the separate virtual database accessible by the plurality of user terminals to thereby manage contents may vary whether contents are provided to each user and the usage policy of the provided contents through management of the authority policy on the contents but may not provide a scheme that can browse the contents without any conversion of the contents in different OSs.

The present invention is directed to an apparatus and method for managing contents using a virtual folder which may provide contents created in different environments to users based on authority information without any separate content conversion operation.

According to still another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for managing security contents including a receiving an authority policy on contents from a security content server and storing the received authority policy in a storage means b creating a virtual folder based on position information of a folder to be virtualized and path information of the virtual folder by driving a virtual folder creation module that is operated in a kernel mode and registering the created virtual folder in a filesystem and c hooking an input and output event for contents which have been recorded or are to be recorded in the virtual folder from the kernel mode providing contents corresponding to the hooked input and output event to a security processing unit and instructing the security processing unit to encode or decode the provided contents.

Hereinafter an apparatus and a method for managing security contents using a virtual folder according to embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings. is a diagram illustrating a configuration of an apparatus for managing security contents using a virtual folder according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the following description contents refer to electronic type files that can be browsed corrected or stored in an information processing apparatus such as a computer or a smart phone such as documents pictures videos and the like. For convenience of description contents may refer to a specific document file and the like. In addition the apparatus for managing security contents using a virtual folder according to an embodiment of the present invention may be a server a desktop computer a laptop a PAD a smart phone or the like.

Referring to the apparatus for managing security contents using the virtual folder according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a data control unit a security filesystem interface unit a security processing unit and a user interface unit .

The data control unit performs Inter Processing Communication IPC communication between individual execution files transmission and reception of security policy and information with a security content server content usage policy management and the like. For this the data control unit includes a central processing unit an IPC communication unit and a policy management unit . The central processing unit transmits and receives data to and from the security content server by supporting a variety of data transmission and reception protocols such as REST JSON or WebSocket while maintaining a session so that the function of each execution file can be performed. In addition the central processing unit provides policy information in response to a policy providing request for content security from the security processing unit . The policy information includes authority policy information and security policy information and these policies are set by a user or received from the security content server . In addition the central processing unit processes communication authority information and the like between execution processes such as a process having a user interface for authority control a system tray process an integrated viewer process etc. The IPC communication unit manages IPC communication between executed individual execution files. The policy management unit stores the policy information received from the security content server policy information set directly by a user with respect to individual contents or a security folder and the like in a separate storage means not shown. In addition the policy management unit transmits the stored policy information to the security content server as necessary or provides the policy information to the security processing unit in response to the policy providing request from the security processing unit .

The security filesystem interface unit is in charge of input and output of files for security contents monitors creation change browsing and the like of contents calls an integrated viewer in order to perform creation change browsing and the like of contents by an authenticated user and requests encoding or decoding of contents from the security processing unit . Such a security filesystem interface unit performs creation of the virtual folder and the above mentioned function by combining kernel extension file input and output hooking technique and FileSystem in USerspace FUSE technique.

Referring to when the apparatus for managing security contents using the virtual folder according to an embodiment of the present invention that is operated in a user mode is driven the security filesystem interface unit confirms a path in which the virtual folder is to be mounted and then scans folder information of the path. Next the security filesystem interface unit performs creation and management of the virtual folder by a virtual folder creation module that is operated in a kernel mode through a kernel control framework operated in the user mode. In this instance the security filesystem interface unit creates the virtual folder using scanning information of the folder through a function included in the virtual folder creation module and mounts the created virtual folder in a filesystem.

Next when the virtual folder is completely mounted in the filesystem the security filesystem interface unit determines a processing position i.e. user mode and kernel mode of the corresponding file by pulling up to the user mode input and output of a file incoming to the virtual folder and then establishes a communication channel with the kernel mode in order to notify the kernel mode of the determined result. By this process whether an event such as creation reading writing movement copy or the like of the file that enters the kernel mode is an operation required to be processed in the user mode may be determined and processed. An encoded file may be decoded so as to browse the corresponding file through authority management and a general file created in an encoded folder may be encoded. By this configuration the present invention has an advantage that may reduce system collision which occurs due to memory management and register processing using assembly when processing the corresponding file using an existing kernel mode thereby reliably processing the corresponding file.

Meanwhile the operation of the security filesystem interface unit may be largely divided into a file input and output management operation a packing operation and a linkage operation. The file input and output management operation is an operation of determining a processing position of the corresponding file by detecting an event for the file through interfacing with the kernel mode. The packing operation is an operation of providing the corresponding file to the security processing unit to request encoding and decoding when it is determined that the file determined to be processed in the user mode is required to be encoded or decoded. The linkage operation is an operation that is performed in conjunction with a legacy server through a legacy server framework.

The security processing unit encodes a file created in a specific folder e.g. virtual folder security folder or the like into the format of a new security file or decodes the security file. Such an operation of the security processing unit is requested by the security filesystem interface unit and the security filesystem determines whether to encode the corresponding file into the security file. In addition when encoding or decoding the corresponding file the security processing unit acquires policy information for file security from the data control unit thereby encoding or decoding the corresponding file.

The user interface unit provides a means of receiving processing commands creation browsing copy correction etc. for the corresponding file from a user or outputting the processing results to the user. The user interface unit performs processing of a pop up window according to clicking of a right button of a mouse driving of a viewer for supporting an OLE format in order to output DRM contents to the user and the like.

The apparatus for managing security contents using the virtual folder according to an embodiment of the present invention that has been described with reference to may be implemented in the form of an information processing apparatus including a communication function such as a computer a laptop a PDA a smart phone etc. which are equipped with an application. In this instance individual hardware modules may be implemented as corresponding software modules. The information processing apparatus includes a network interface device an input and output device a display device a processor a non volatile storage device a system memory and the like. The application for performing security content management using the virtual folder according to the present invention is installed on the system memory and is driven by a driving command of a user or at the time of booting of the information processing apparatus.

Referring to prior to performing the method for managing security contents using the virtual folder according to an embodiment of the present invention in operation a user installs a cloud service in the apparatus for managing security contents and sets a cloud account. Such an installation of the cloud service and setting of the account may be optional procedures but may be essential procedures when the present invention is operated in conjunction with the cloud service i.e. management of the file that is downloaded or uploaded through the cloud service . Next in operation the user installs a program required for managing security contents and sets an account of the user in the security content server . When such pre procedures are completed the user may use the security content management service.

First in operation an application e.g. scmac.app in a case of the Mac OS for managing the security contents may be executed according to setting of a start program at the time of booting of the apparatus for managing security contents or may be executed by the user s driving command. Next in operation S the apparatus for managing security contents determines a path defined in advance and a position of a folder to be virtualized and determines whether a storage means e.g. a file database whose security is maintained i.e. the locking of the file database using the user s login information is performed is present. This is a process of determining presence and absence of a physical storage means whose security is maintained and in this instance a security folder i.e. a virtual folder that is created using FUSE by the virtual folder creation module is not created.

Next in operation the apparatus for managing security contents performs a user authentication process in order to provide a security content service to the user. In this instance the apparatus for managing security contents stores user information in the storage means based on the login information received from the user through a user authentication screen and receives a DRM policy a user policy or a security folder policy when an existing security folder is present from the security content server . When the security content service according to the present invention is performed in conjunction with the cloud service a user authentication process for the cloud service by a cloud authentication token is performed together in this process. Next the apparatus for managing security contents stores in the storage means the DRM policy received from the security content server or updates the DRM policy previously stored in the storage means into a DRM policy newly received from the security content server .

Next in operation the apparatus for managing security contents searches for the security folder and initializes the searched security folder. This is a process of determining whether the security folder has been already present. The apparatus for managing security contents confirms the DRM policy corresponding to the user in the storage means and confirms a specific setting file i.e. a setting file including information for identifying the security folder in the folder to be virtualized thereby determining whether information stored in the corresponding setting file is the same as the information stored in the storage means.

Next in operation the apparatus for managing security contents separately displays the information that has been determined to be the security folder in an explorer e.g. Mac OS Finder . In this instance the apparatus for managing security contents creates using the FUSE the folder to be virtualized as the security folder provided in the form of the virtual folder to thereby mount the created folder in the filesystem and displays folder information mounted as the security folder in the favorites of the explorer. Next the apparatus for managing security contents transmits in the user mode the input and output of the corresponding file transmitted through a kernel file system using the function of the kernel control framework thereby monitoring whether to control the corresponding contents.

Next in operation S the apparatus for managing security contents receives setting information for the created security folder from the user stores the received information in the storage means and transmits the stored information to the security content server . For this the apparatus for managing security contents outputs a security folder setting screen to the user and stores an authority set by the user in the storage means. Next the apparatus for managing security contents transmits information of the security folder to the security content server .

When the security folder i.e. the virtual folder is created through the above described procedures the user may perform management operations such as storing contents in the security folder browsing the contents stored in the security folder changing setting information about the security folder confirming information of the file stored in the security folder inquiring a usage history about the file stored in the security folder and the like. For such management operations with respect to the security folder the apparatus for managing security contents may output a menu window including menus associated with the individual management operations and the output of the menu window may be implemented to be performed in conjunction with clicking of the right button of the mouse.

Referring to when a user selects storage of the contents in the security folder displayed on the explorer in operation S the security filesystem interface unit of the apparatus for managing security contents hooks the input and output of the file for the corresponding contents from the kernel mode and confirms whether the corresponding contents are to be encoded in operation S. In this instance whether the corresponding contents are to be encoded is confirmed based on the policy information provided from the data control unit . When it is confirmed that the corresponding contents are to be encoded the security filesystem interface unit transmits the corresponding contents to the security processing unit and the security processing unit encodes the corresponding contents based on the policy information provided from the data control unit and returns the encoded contents to the security filesystem interface unit in operation S. Next the encoded contents are stored in a physical position of the storage means and the security filesystem interface unit changes an extension of the corresponding contents e.g. the changed file name is userfile.scd when a file name of the corresponding contents is userfile.doc records the changed extension in the security folder and manages a file name of the corresponding contents in conjunction with the changed file name in operation S. In this instance in operation S the security filesystem interface unit records information related to the storage of the corresponding contents in the usage history of the security folder thereby updating the usage history of the security folder.

Unlike this when the user selects browsing of the contents stored in the security folder displayed on the explorer in operation S the security filesystem interface unit of the apparatus for managing security contents hooks the input and output of the file for the corresponding contents from the kernel mode and confirms whether the user is a user with authority to browse the corresponding contents based on the DRM policy received from the security content server in operation S. In this instance whether the user is the user with authority to browse the corresponding contents is confirmed based on the policy information provided from the data control unit . When the authority of the user is authenticated the security filesystem interface unit transmits the corresponding contents to the security processing unit and the security processing unit decodes the corresponding contents based on the policy information provided from the data control unit and returns the decoded contents to the security filesystem interface unit in operation S. The decoded contents are output to the user and the security filesystem interface unit records information related to the browsing of the corresponding contents in the usage history of the security folder thereby updating the usage history of the security folder in operation S.

Meanwhile other than the storage and browsing of the contents in the security folder which have been described with reference to other operations such as correction deletion etc. of the contents may be performed and in this instance whether authorities for individual operations i.e. whether correction of the corresponding contents is allowable or whether an authority to correct the corresponding contents is present are authenticated may be determined based on the policy information stored in the data control unit . The usage history of the security folder may be transmitted to the security content server whenever it is updated or at a predetermined period.

Referring to when a user selects the security folder displayed on the explorer and then clicks on a right button of a mouse the user interface unit of the apparatus for managing security contents outputs a menu window including menus in operation S. In this instance the right button of the mouse has been illustrated as a means for receiving an output command of the menu window from the user but this is merely an example. That is other types of input means may be employed. When the user selects a security folder setting menu in operation S the data control unit controls the user interface unit to output a screen for security folder setting in operation S. Next the data control unit stores in the storage means authority information for the security folder set by the user as user policy information and transmits the stored authority information to the security content server in operation S.

Next when the user selects a security folder change menu in operation S the data control unit confirms a user s authority and then controls the user interface unit to output a screen for security folder change in operation S. Next the data control unit updates the authority information for the security folder stored in the storage means into newly set authority information and transmits the updated authority information to the security content server in operation S.

Next when the user selects a security file information menu in operation S the data control unit reads encoding information about the security file stored in the security folder from file information stored in the storage means and outputs the read information to the user through the user interface unit in operation S.

Next when the user selects a usage history inquiry menu in operation S the data control unit requests from the security content server providing of the usage history i.e. information about creation of the security folder information about file storage in the security folder information about browsing of the file stored in the security folder etc. of the security folder of the corresponding user and outputs the usage history received from the security content server to the user through the user interface unit in operation S.

Next when the user selects a security folder cancellation menu in operation S the data control unit confirms a user s authority and then notifies notices in accordance with the security folder cancellation through the user interface unit in operation S.

Next the data control unit inquires whether the security file recorded in the security folder is decoded according to the security folder cancellation and decodes and stores the security file in a folder designated by the user according to the user s selection in operation S. In this instance decoding of the security file is performed by the security processing unit . Next the data control unit selectively transmits information about cancellation of the corresponding security folder to the security content server .

As described above according to the apparatus and method for managing security contents using the virtual folder according to the embodiments of the present invention it is possible to provide contents created in different environments to a user based on the authority information without any separate content conversion operation. In addition it is possible to reduce system collision which occurs due to memory management and register processing using assembly when processing the corresponding file using an existing kernel mode thereby reliably processing the corresponding file.

The method for managing security contents using the virtual folder according to the embodiments of the present invention may be implemented as a computer readable code in a computer readable recording medium. The computer readable recording medium may include all kinds of recording devices in which data that can be read by a computer system is stored. Examples of the computer readable recording medium include a ROM a RAM a CD ROM a magnetic tape a floppy disk an optical data storage device and the like and also include a carrier wave e.g. transmission through the Internet . In addition the computer readable recording medium is distributed in a computer system connected via a network so that the computer readable codes are stored and executed in a distributed manner.

It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications can be made to the above described exemplary embodiments of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus it is intended that the present invention covers all such modifications provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.
