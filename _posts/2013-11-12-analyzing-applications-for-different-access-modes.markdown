This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application 61 800 917 entitled Mobile Computing Device with Multiple Access Modes filed Mar. 15 2013. U.S. Provisional Application 61 800 917 is incorporated herein by reference.

In recent years mobile devices e.g. smart phones tablet computers have become very popular. One reason for their popularity is that they can be used nearly anywhere to perform a variety of different tasks. For instance many of these mobile devices allow their users to exchange emails make telephone calls purchase items online take photos share comments and photos through different social network platforms etc. These mobile devices are also very easy to share. In fact many people share their devices with family or friends to make phone calls to share games or applications etc.

While such mobile devices have proved to be very useful they often store private data e.g. contacts emails private photos or provide easy access to other sources e.g. a social network website an online bank that store private data. This presents a problem when a first person wants to share a game or application on his device with a second person but does not wish the second person to have access to his private data. This is especially problematic because the first person cannot always monitor the second person s use of his device or even if he can finds it awkward to do so.

The need to keep private data on a mobile device confidential is not the only motivation that prevents users from sharing their mobile devices with others. Many other reasons exist that make such sharing difficult. For instance kids often wish to play with the mobile devices of their parents. However while using their parents devices kids may inadvertently delete data e.g. delete photos emails etc. or initiate send communications e.g. initiate calls send e mails etc. .

In addition to the need to control another s access to one s mobile device one often needs to quickly access certain functionalities of one s device. In devices with touch screen controls such access is often delayed because of controls that are placed on the devices to prevent inadvertent operation of the devices. For example many devices place lock screen controls including passcode and or gesture controls that are needed to gain access to all or most of the applications of the device. Such controls slow down the user s access. Also in some cases the user has difficulty performing the operations necessitated by these controls. For instance a user may have such difficulty when the user is busy performing other tasks e.g. when the user is jogging biking etc. .

Some embodiments of the invention provide a mobile device with multiple access modes. The device in some embodiments has at least two access modes a primary access mode and a secondary access mode that provide different restrictions for accessing the applications and or data that are stored on the device. In some embodiments the primary access mode of the device provides unfettered access to all of the device s applications and or data that are available to a user while its secondary access mode provides access to a limited set of applications and or data that are stored on the device. In other words when the device is operated in its secondary access mode the user has access to a subset of applications and or data but cannot access applications and or data that are restricted during the secondary access mode.

In some embodiments three or more applications can be accessed in the secondary access mode of the device. The number of applications accessible in the secondary access mode 1 is pre defined and static in some embodiments 2 is pre defined but user customizable in other embodiments and 3 is purely user specified in still other embodiments. In addition to restricting access to certain applications in the secondary access mode the device also restricts access to data stored by such restricted applications to applications including the operating system of the device in some embodiments that are not restricted in the secondary access mode.

In some embodiments the secondary access mode is always enabled while in other embodiments it is a mode that can be enabled or disabled by a user of the primary access mode. There exist many reasons for enabling the secondary access mode. One reason is to allow the device s user to share his device with another without letting the other person access the user s private data or access services of the device that the user does not wish to share with that person. Another reason is to allow the device s user to share the device with children while restricting the children s access to certain applications or data e.g. photos documents emails etc. on the device. Still another reason is to allow the device s user to gain quick access to certain applications on the device without providing the input necessary to gain access to the device s primary access mode. Often such input slows access to the device because it requires a precise operation e.g. requires input of a precise passcode or gesture that might not be easy to perform in all circumstances.

Different embodiments provide different mechanisms for a user to enable secondary access mode and or to specify applications and or data that are available during the secondary access mode. In some embodiments the device s operating system provides a plurality of settings that can be toggled ON or OFF for enabling the secondary access mode and the applications available in this mode. Such settings are modeled as ON OFF affordances e.g. switches in some embodiments while they are modeled differently in other embodiments. The device s operating system in these or other embodiments provides controls for enabling in the secondary access mode groups of applications e.g. game applications communication applications social media applications etc. . The device s operating system in these or other embodiments further provides controls for enabling access to different pieces of content data e.g. to different pictures contacts etc. during the secondary access mode.

Different embodiments provide different mechanisms for directing the device to operate in the secondary access mode instead of the primary access mode. For instance in some embodiments the device is a touch screen device that requires the user to perform a first touch gesture on a first page e.g. a lock screen page of the device to gain access to the device s primary access mode or to a second page on which the user performs another operation e.g. enters a passcode or performs another touch gesture to gain access to the primary access mode. In some of these embodiments the device provides a second touch gesture that can be performed on the first page or on the second page to cause the device to operate in the secondary access mode.

In addition the device in some embodiments has fingerprint recognition technology that allows the user of the device to gain access to the primary access mode through fingerprint recognition. In some of these embodiments the device initiates operation in its secondary access mode when a user attempts to access the device through fingerprint recognition but the fingerprint recognition fails. Alternatively or conjunctively the device of some embodiments allows multiple fingerprints to be recorded for one user or multiple users and allows one or more fingerprints to be recorded for initiating the primary access mode operation of the device while allowing one or more fingerprints to be recorded for initiating the secondary access mode operation of the device. In these embodiments fingerprint recognition may launch the device in either the primary access mode or secondary access mode for different users. Some embodiments provide still other mechanisms for launching the device in the secondary access mode. Examples of these other mechanisms include voice commands motion based inputs multi tap inputs e.g. multiple taps on a soft or physical button of the device etc.

Different embodiments use different mechanisms to indicate that the device is operating in its secondary access mode. For instance when operating in its secondary access mode the device in some embodiments displays only the icons of the applications that are available in this mode. In some of these embodiments the device removes the icons of the applications that are not available in the secondary mode and re arranges the available icons on the displayed pages to remove any positions that are empty because of removed icons. The device in some of these embodiments displays a dock that contains icons for a few applications. The device of some embodiments only displays the dock in the primary access mode. In the secondary mode the device in these embodiments removes the dock and places inline with other icons on a page any dock icon of any application that is available in the secondary access mode. In some of these embodiments the device reserves the first few icon slots on the first page of the secondary access mode for the available application icons that are removed from the dock.

Instead of removing the icons of the applications that are not available in the secondary access mode the device of some embodiments provides a deprecated e.g. grayed out reduced in size etc. display of the icons of the unavailable applications and makes these icons non selectable items in its user interface. In the embodiments that restrict display or access to data in the secondary access mode the device uses similar techniques that either do not display the unavailable data or display this data in a deprecated unselectable form.

To provide additional indication that the device is operating in the secondary access mode some embodiments change the background image used for the pages displayed during the secondary access page or provide textual indication on these pages regarding the operation of the device in the secondary access mode. For instance in some embodiments the device uses a default background image during the secondary mode that is different from the background image s used during the primary mode. Instead of using a default background image during the secondary access mode the device of some embodiments might use in this mode a slightly or highly blurred and tinted version of the background image used in the primary access mode. Any background image used in the secondary mode might contain text or watermark text such as secondary access mode quick access mode shared mode guest mode or similar such words to provide further textual indication of the secondary access operation of the device.

The preceding Summary is intended to serve as a brief introduction to some embodiments as described herein. It is not meant to be an introduction or overview of all subject matter disclosed in this document. The Detailed Description that follows and the Drawings that are referred to in the Detailed Description will further describe the embodiments described in the Summary as well as other embodiments. Accordingly to understand all the embodiments described by this document a full review of the Summary Detailed Description and the Drawings is needed. Moreover the claimed subject matters are not to be limited by the illustrative details in the Summary Detailed Description and the Drawings but rather are to be defined by the appended claims because the claimed subject matters can be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit of the subject matters.

In the following detailed description of the invention numerous details examples and embodiments of the invention are set forth and described. However it will be clear and apparent to one skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the embodiments set forth and that the invention may be practiced without some of the specific details and examples discussed.

Some embodiments of the invention provide a mobile device with multiple access modes. The device in some embodiments has at least two access modes a primary access mode and a secondary access mode that provide different restrictions for accessing the applications and or data stored on the device. In some embodiments the primary access mode of the device provides unfettered access to all of the device s data and or applications that are available to a user while its secondary access mode provides access to a limited set of applications and or data. In other words when the device is operated in its secondary access mode the user has access to a subset of applications and or data but cannot access data and or applications that are restricted during the secondary access mode. In addition to restricting access to certain applications in the secondary access mode the device also restricts access to data stored by such restricted applications to applications including the operating system of the device in some embodiments that are not restricted in the secondary access mode.

As illustrated in these stages the device has a touch sensitive screen and two physical affordances i.e. the buttons and . The touch sensitive screen displays 1 one or more pages on which application icons can be arranged and 2 overlaying some or all of these pages a dock on which the icons of several key applications e.g. phone e mail browser and music applications can be arranged. Through this screen a user can touch select an application icon to open or switch to a previously opened application or can make other gestures to navigate between the pages of the device. The screen also presents the output display generated by an open application. The screen can be turned ON or OFF through the toggling of the physical button . In some embodiments the screen can also be turned ON by pressing the physical button . This button also allows the user to navigate between displays e.g. between pages and or applications presented on the screen when the screen is turned ON and to perform other functions e.g. open up a voice command interface for directing the device to perform certain operations .

The first stage presents the device while it is operating in its primary access mode. In this mode the user has access to all applications that execute on the device and that are available to a user of the device. The first stage illustrates twelve available applications eight of which are arranged in line on a page displayed on the screen and four of which are positioned in the dock . This stage also illustrates a user s finger engaging the ON OFF button .

This engagement turns off the screen as illustrated in the second stage . This stage also illustrates the user pressing the button which turns on the screen as illustrated by the third stage . The third stage illustrates a lock screen page of the device . This page provides a limited set of information and offers a limited set of functionalities of the device. Specifically it illustrates the time and date and the remaining charge on the device s battery. This page also presents three affordances e.g. UI controls for directing the device to perform three actions. The first affordance is shown as an unlock slider for unlocking the device to gain access to the primary mode of the device. This unlock slider is part of the device s lock screen protections that are meant to prevent its touch screen from inadvertently being activated. This slider works with the ON OFF screen controls enabled by the buttons and and the limits on available lock screen functionalities to establish the lock screen protections of the device.

The second affordance is shown as camera unlock icon that can be swiped with a touch screen gesture to launch a camera application of the device. The third affordance is shown as secondary access mode control that can be swiped with a touch screen gesture to direct the device to operate in the secondary access mode. The third stage illustrates such a gesture.

The fourth stage illustrates the device after it has been launched in its secondary access mode as a result of the swiping gesture of the third stage. Specifically this stage illustrates that when operating in its secondary access mode the device displays only the icons of the applications that are available in this mode and removes the icons of the applications that are not available in the secondary mode. The device re arranges the available icons on the displayed pages to remove any positions that are empty because of removed icons. The device also removes the dock and places on the displayed page the icon of any available application that was previously positioned in the dock. In some of these embodiments the device reserves the first few icons slots on the first page of the secondary access mode for the available application icons that are removed from the dock.

Accordingly in the example illustrated in the icons of the applications eleven and twelve that were shown in the dock in the first stage are moved to the first and second icon locations of the first page of the secondary access mode illustrated in the fourth stage . These two icons are followed by icons of the third sixth and eight applications while the icons of the fourth fifth and seventh applications have been removed from the page as these applications are not available in the secondary access mode. The icons for the eleventh twelfth third sixth and eight applications are placed in a contiguous icon arrangement that replaces icons of available applications for icons of unavailable applications while moving the icons of the available applications that were previously in the dock to the first few positions.

To provide additional indication that the device is operating in the secondary access mode the device changes the background image used for the pages displayed during the secondary access page and provides textual indication on these pages regarding the operation of the device in the secondary access mode. Specifically in this example the background image of the secondary mode illustrated in the fourth stage is shown as a grey image while the background image of the primary mode illustrated in the first stage is shown as a white image to illustrate the use of different page background images to indicate different modes of operation. Also in this example the text Secondary Access Mode appears in place of the dock in the fourth stage in order to provide additional textual indication of the device s operational mode.

While illustrates one manner of providing an indication of the operational mode of the device other embodiments use other manners to provide this indication. For instance instead of using default background image during the secondary access mode the device of some embodiments might use in this mode a slightly highly blurred and or tinted version of the background image used in the primary access mode. Also in place of the textual indication in the location left empty by the removal of the dock some embodiments might not provide any textual indication or might provide a different textual indication e.g. may provide text that appears as a watermark across the background image or provide different text quick access mode shared mode guest mode kids mode etc. Instead of removing the icons of the applications that are not available in the secondary access mode the device of some embodiments also provides a deprecated e.g. grayed out reduced in size etc. display of the icons of the unavailable applications and makes these icons non selectable items in its user interface. Several such alternative approaches to providing indication of the secondary access mode operation will be further described below.

Also while illustrates one manner for directing the device to operate in the secondary access mode other embodiments use other manners to direct the device to operate in the secondary access mode. For instance in some embodiments the device requires the user to perform a first touch gesture on a first lock screen page to gain access to a second page on which the user can enter a passcode or gesture to gain access to the primary access mode or performs another touch gesture to gain access to the secondary access mode. In addition the device in some embodiments has fingerprint recognition technology that allows the user of the device to gain access to the primary access mode through fingerprint recognition. In some of these embodiments the device initiates operation in its secondary access mode when a user attempts to access the device through fingerprint recognition but the fingerprint recognition fails. Alternatively or conjunctively the device of some embodiments allows multiple fingerprints to be recorded for one user or multiple users and allows one or more fingerprints to be recorded for initiating the primary access mode operation of the device while allowing one or more fingerprints to be recorded for initiating the secondary access mode operation of the device. In these embodiments fingerprint recognition may launch the device in either the primary access mode or secondary access mode for different users. Some embodiments provide still other mechanisms for launching the device in the secondary access mode. Examples of these other mechanisms include voice commands motion based inputs multi tap inputs e.g. multiple taps on a soft or physical button of the device etc. Several such alternative approaches to initiating the secondary access mode operation will be further described below.

The secondary access mode illustrated in has several benefits. One benefit is that it allows the device s user to share his device with another without letting the other person access the user s private data or access services of the device that the user does not wish to share with that person. Another benefit is to allow the device s user to share the device with children while restricting the children s access to certain applications or data e.g. photos documents emails etc. on the device. Still another benefit is to allow the device s user to gain quick access to certain applications on the device without providing the input necessary to gain access to the device s primary access mode. Often such input slows access to the device because it requires a precise operation e.g. requires input of a precise passcode or gesture that might not be easy to perform in all circumstances. For example a user may wish to quickly open a notepad application with a grocery list when grocery shopping or open a map application when traveling without the hassle of entering the owner s passcode. The secondary access mode operation of the device facilitates such quick access of the device.

In some embodiments three or more applications can be accessed in the secondary access mode of the device. The number of applications accessible in the secondary access mode 1 is pre defined and static in some embodiments 2 is pre defined but user customizable in other embodiments and 3 is purely user specified in still other embodiments.

In some embodiments the secondary access mode is always enabled while in other embodiments it is a mode that can be enabled or disabled by a user of the primary access mode. Different embodiments provide different mechanisms for a user to enable secondary access mode and or to specify applications and or data that are available during the secondary access mode. illustrates one manner of enabling the secondary access mode and applications that are accessible in this mode. This figure illustrates the performance of these tasks in terms of six operational stages of the mobile device that was described above by reference to .

The first stage illustrates the device operating in its primary access mode and displaying a page that contains eight application icons and an overlaid dock with four application icons. This stage also shows the user s touch selection of an icon to launch the settings menu of the device s operating system.

The second stage illustrates an example settings menu of the device . The settings menu includes several different affordances e.g. menu items . For example the menu includes a first affordance e.g. a control for turning on or off airplane mode a second affordance e.g. a wireless network selectable item for navigating to a sub menu for setting wireless network connection e.g. Wi Fi network connection a third affordance e.g. a notification selectable item for navigating to a sub menu for specifying various notification policies and a fourth affordance e.g. a privacy selectable item for navigating to a sub menu for specifying various privacy policies. The second stage shows the user s touch selection of the fourth affordance to navigate to the privacy sub menu.

The third stage shows that this selection causes the device to display the privacy sub menu menu which in this example includes various affordances e.g. controls related to the secondary access mode. One of these affordances is represented as an ON OFF switch that can turn the secondary access mode feature on or off. When the device transitions to the third stage from the second stage the switch is off. While this switch is off the device cannot be operated in the secondary access mode. When this switch is turned on the secondary access mode feature is available. A user however still has to direct the device to operate in the secondary access mode e.g. by performing the sequence of operations illustrated in .

In some embodiments the default position of this switch is off because the user has to affirmatively enable the secondary access mode feature while in other embodiments the default position of this switch is on. Near this switch the privacy menu in some embodiments includes text that describes that the user can choose below different applications that are accessible in the secondary access mode. Alternatively the description may indicate that the user can choose different applications that are inaccessible in the guest mode. In some embodiments this text is only presented when the user turns the switch on in order to turn on the secondary access mode feature.

In addition to the switch the third stage illustrates a list of applications that can be enabled disabled for the secondary access mode and an enabling switch for enabling each listed application to operate in the secondary access mode. In some embodiments a user can scroll the privacy menu up and down to see all the applications that are in this list. In some embodiments applications that are enabled in this list for inclusion in the secondary access mode form a whitelist of applications that can be accessed during this mode while the applications that are disabled in this list form a blacklist of applications that cannot be accessed during this mode and cannot have their data accessible to any applications on the whitelist.

In the example illustrated in the enabling affordances e.g. switches are not selectable in the third stage because the switch is turned off and the secondary access mode feature has not been enabled. In other embodiments these affordances might not even be displayed when the switch is turned off. In still other embodiments these affordances are displayed and are selectable even when the switch is turned off.

The third stage shows the user turning on the secondary access mode feature. In this example the turning on of the secondary access mode feature makes the enabling affordances e.g. switches for the applications selectable. The fourth and fifth stages and then illustrate the user toggling off the switch for a first application and toggling on the switch for a third application. The sixth stage then shows the resulting list of applications that are enabled and disabled for the secondary access mode. In this example the sixth stage shows the first and second applications as being disabled i.e. restricted from the secondary access mode while the third and fourth applications are enabled for this mode.

While the example illustrated in is described with a particular set of details one of ordinary skill in the art will realize that other embodiments provide other mechanisms or affordances for turning on the secondary access mode feature and or for including applications in this mode. For instance in the example above switches are the affordances for turning on the secondary access mode feature and for including applications in this mode. Other embodiment however use other touch screen affordances i.e. controls for some or all of these operations e.g. utilize buttons checkboxes etc. or use other controls altogether i.e. voice controls etc. for some or all of these operations. Yet other embodiments provide controls for enabling in the secondary access mode groups of applications e.g. game applications communication applications social media applications etc. . The device s operating system in these or other embodiments further provides controls for enabling access to different pieces of content data e.g. to different pictures contacts etc. during the secondary access mode.

In addition to these manual controls for a user some embodiments employ heuristics to intelligently determine whether each application that is installed on the computing device should be accessible in the secondary access mode or should be kept private. This may entail identifying rating information and or identifying the description of the content associated with the application. In conjunction with the automatic determination the device of some embodiments allows a user to define a whitelist that contains a list of applications that are accessible in the secondary access mode. Several such alternative embodiments are further described below.

Different embodiments provide different mechanisms for exiting the secondary access mode of the device. illustrates one approach for exiting the secondary access mode of the device. In this approach the user can exit the secondary access mode by turning off the screen and then providing the user s passcode the next time the user accesses the device. This figure illustrates this approach in terms of five stages of operation and of the device of . The first stage corresponds to the above described fourth stage of . In the first stage the device operates in its secondary access mode as indicated by the textual indication of Secondary Access Mode in place of the dock . The first stage also shows the user pressing the ON OFF button to turn off the screen.

The second stage illustrates the device after its screen has been turned off. It also shows the user pressing the home button to turn the screen back on. The third stage shows that in response to the pressing of the button the device turns on its screen and presents its lock screen display which is similar to the lock screen display described above by reference to the third stage of . The third stage also shows the user sliding the slider to unlock the device.

The fourth stage then shows the passcode screen is presented to the user upon the sliding of the slider affordance towards unlock position. In some embodiments the user has to provide this passcode in order to direct the device to launch its operation in its primary access mode. This stage also shows the user entering his passcode which launches the operation of the device in its primary access mode as illustrated by the fifth stage . As shown in the fifth stage the primary access mode has the dock and the icons arranged as in the first stage of .

One of ordinary skill in the art will realize that instead of employing this passcode other embodiments allow the user to unlock the device with other custom touch or gesture operations. Instead of defining the screen unlock and passcode operations as two separate operations that are performed through two separate screens other embodiments combine the unlock and primary access entry operations into one operation that is performed in one screen. For instance the unlock operation can be a touch gesture operation that follows a particular pattern on the touch code screen and this operation allows the user to gain access to the primary access mode.

The five states are a screen off state a screen on state a primary access mode PAM state a secondary access mode SAM state and a SAM configuration state . The screen off state represents the set of processes running on the device while the screen of the device is OFF. These processes in some embodiments include processes for 1 handling input while the device is in its lower powered mode e.g. a sleep mode associated with the screen off state 2 handling notifications from other applications running on the device and 3 handling real time communications through the device while the screen is locked.

In some embodiments the device transitions from the screen off state to the screen on state when the user engages either of the buttons and of when the device receives a communication e.g. a call or when the device provides a notification e.g. of a meeting or a received communication such as an e mail text message etc. . The screen off state represents the set of processes running on the device while the screen of the device is ON but the screen is locked and requires a passcode or gesture to unlock. These processes in some embodiments include a subset of the processes running during the screen OFF state.

From the screen ON state the process transitions back to the screen OFF state 1 when the user engages one of or either of the buttons and or 2 after a period in which the screen has been ON without any user input. From the screen ON state the process also transitions to the PAM state when the device receives input from a user to gain access to the primary access mode. In some embodiments this input is a combination of the sliding operation followed by the passcode operation illustrated in stages and of . In other embodiments this input is just a touch gesture operation e.g. a simple swipe a combination of swipes or a touch contact that follows a particular pattern etc. that unlocks the device s PAM operation. In some embodiments the passcode or touch gesture operation are operations only known to the primary user of the device or a few users in addition to the primary user who have been approved e.g. by the primary user to have access to the primary mode of the device.

It should be noted that in some embodiments the device might or might not have enabled a lock screen protection that requires a passcode or pass gesture operation. In these embodiments the device transitions to the PAM state directly from the screen OFF state when the user engages either of the buttons and when the device receives a communication e.g. a call and or when the device provides a notification e.g. of a meeting or a received communication such as an e mail text message etc. . However this transition is not illustrated in as it is as relevant to the secondary access mode configuration or operation of the device in some embodiments because in these embodiments the secondary access mode is only enabled when the device has some mechanism e.g. passcode or pass gesture to ensure that it is locked when it is not in use.

The PAM state represents all the processes that the unlocked device performs when it is not in the secondary access mode and it is not configuring the secondary access mode. Accordingly all PAM operations that do not turn off the screen and do not configure the SAM settings keep the device in the primary access state . When the screen turns off through an affirmative action of the user or through the expiration of a timer that measures the device s period of inactivity the device transitions from state to the screen OFF state .

On the other hand when the device receives input to review or adjust its SAM settings while it is operating in the PAM state the device transitions to SAM configuration state . This input can be in the form of selections illustrated in the stages and of or it can be through other input received through touch voice etc. input interface as further described below. The SAM configuration state in some embodiments is part of the PAM operation of the device. However in it is shown separate from the PAM state to highlight the specific SAM configuration state of the primary access mode.

Once the device is in the SAM configuration state the user can review and adjust SAM configuration values. In some embodiments the device remains in this state after each adjustment to these values. The device leaves this state and returns to the PAM state when it receives input e.g. touch input voice input etc. indicating that the review and or configuration of the SAM state has been completed. Alternatively the device returns to the screen off state when the screen turns off through an affirmative action of the user or through the expiration of a timer that measures the device s period of inactivity.

As mentioned above the device can transition to the screen OFF state and the primary access mode state from the screen ON state . From this state the device can also transition to the secondary access mode state when it receives input to gain access to the secondary access mode. As mentioned above by reference to the transition to the secondary access mode can be facilitated by an affordance on the same ON screen that displays the affordance or one of the affordances for gaining access to the primary access mode of the device.

Once in the SAM state the device remains in this state for all operations performed in this state by the user except for the screen OFF operation. When the user turns off the screen or after the expiration of a timer that measures the period of inactivity during the secondary access mode the device returns to the screen OFF state .

One of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the state diagram simplifies the operation of the device for purposes of the highlighting the SAM configuration and operation of the device. Other states of the device are not shown in this diagram. For instance this diagram does not show the OFF state of the device that can be directed in any one of five states illustrated in through user input e.g. touch input key input voice input etc. . From the OFF state the device transitions to the screen ON state in some embodiments when it is turned on. One of ordinary skill in the art will also realize that the device in other embodiments has different states or different state transitions as it operates differently.

As mentioned above different embodiments provide different mechanisms for directing the device to operate in the secondary access mode instead of the primary access mode. For instance in some embodiments the device is a touch screen device that requires the user to perform a first touch gesture on a first page e.g. a lock screen page of the device to gain access to the device s primary access mode or to a second page e.g. a passcode page on which the user performs another operation e.g. enters a passcode or performs another touch gesture to gain access to the primary access mode. In some of these embodiments the device provides a second touch gesture that can be performed on the first page or on the second page to cause the device to operate in the secondary access mode. Several examples of these different mechanisms will now be described by reference to .

In the first stage the user performs a touch gesture to unlock the device to the secondary access mode. Specifically the user places the user s finger on the slider affordance for entering the secondary access mode and swipes or slides the user s finger vertically on the device s touch sensitive screen . The touch gesture in turn causes the lock screen page to slide up with the affordance .

As the lock screen page slides up a preview of the secondary access mode interface is shown. Specifically as the lock screen slides up the secondary access mode interface starts to become visible along the bottom of the display s touch sensitive screen and continues to be more and more visible until it is fully visible when the sliding operation ends. One primary reason for receiving such a touch gesture e.g. swipe gesture on the lock screen page is that it is more difficult to replicate than a tap gesture. That is the touch gesture prevents the device from unlocking to the secondary access mode when the touch sensitive screen has been inadvertently tapped. One of ordinary skill in the art would realize that the gesture shown in stage is just one example gesture and different touch gestures can be performed to gain access to the device in the secondary access mode.

The second stage illustrates the device after it has been launched in its secondary access mode as a result of the touch gesture of the first stage . Specifically this stage illustrates that when operating in its secondary access mode the device of some embodiments displays only the icons of the applications that are available in this mode and removes the icons of the applications that are not available in the secondary access mode. As mentioned above the device of some embodiments re arranges the available icons on the displayed pages to remove any positions that are empty because of removed icons. The device may also remove the dock and place on the displayed page the icon of any available application that was previously positioned in the dock.

In the first stage the device is displaying the lock screen page on its touch sensitive screen . To place the device in the secondary access mode the user selects the slider affordance and performs a touch based gesture on the slider affordance e.g. by tapping and holding a slider handle with the user s finger and dragging the finger across the screen such that the handle is moved along a slider bar from one end to the other end . As illustrated in the second stage the input of the touch based gesture causes the device to be unlocked to the secondary access mode .

In the previous two examples the user gains quick access to a mobile device through an affordance on a first page e.g. a lock screen page of the device. The user does not have to enter a touch code e.g. a passcode a pattern code to unlock the device. That is the quick access mode of some embodiments allows the user to bypass security e.g. user authentication or touch code entry . Instead the user can simply select an affordance to unlock the device and use the device as it operates in the secondary access mode e.g. with a limited number of applications .

Alternatively or conjunctively with the first page access the mobile device of some embodiments allows the user gain access to the device in the secondary access mode using a second page. In some embodiments the second page is a passcode page that allows the user to enter a passcode or perform another touch gesture to gain access to the device in the secondary access mode. Several examples of second page access will now be described by reference to .

The first stage of presents the device while the lock screen page is being displayed on the device s display screen . In the first stage the user performs a touch gesture on the slider affordance that is shown on the lock screen page to navigate to the passcode page . The gesture input causes the device to display the passcode page as illustrated in the second stage .

The second stage illustrates the passcode page of the device . The passcode page is labeled with a heading that instructs the user to enter a passcode. The page includes a code panel for inputting passcode. The page also shows different fields that are populated with each input. These fields provide a visual indication of the number of entry that the device has received but do not reveal the codes i.e. the passcode values . For example each field is populated when the device receives one key input through the code panel . In the second stage the user inputs the passcode using the panel. As shown in the third stage the input of the correct passcode i.e. the secondary access mode passcode results in the device being unlocked to the secondary access mode .

The first stage illustrates the device displaying its lock screen page. Here the user performs a touch gesture on the slider affordance that is shown on the lock screen page to navigate to the passcode page . The gesture input causes the device to display the passcode page as illustrated in the second stage . The passcode page includes an affordance to gain access to the device in the secondary access mode. In this example the affordance is shown as a selectable item e.g. a button .

The second stage also illustrates the selection of the affordance . As a result of the selection the device is unlocked in the third stage to the secondary access mode. Similar to previous examples the device s screen displays only the icons of the applications that are available in this secondary mode and removes the icons of the applications that are not available in the secondary mode.

In some embodiments the device provides a secondary access mode lock screen. This lock screen is only shown after the device has been placed in the secondary access mode and then locked. This screen is particularly useful because it forces the user to passcode out of the secondary access mode session. It also prevents access to the device in the primary access mode in cases where the device is associated with a passcode grace period. For example a device can be associated with a grace period e.g. 1 minute 30 minutes 1 hour etc. in which the passcode is not required. When that device has been unlocked to a secondary access mode session and then locked and the grace period has not passed since the last time the device was unlocked to the primary access mode any person can access the device in the primary and the secondary access mode. Accordingly this secondary lock screen forces a person to input a passcode in order to access the device in the primary access mode.

In the first stage the user selects the affordance to unlock the device and place it in the secondary access mode. The second stage illustrates the device operating in the secondary access mode. Here the user selects the affordance e.g. the power button to lock the device. The third stage illustrates the device after it has been locked. The selection of the affordance causes the device s screen to be turned off as illustrated in the third stage. This stage also illustrates the user pressing the home button which turns the device s screen back on as illustrated by the fourth stage .

The fourth stage illustrates a secondary access mode lock screen page of the device . This lock screen is similar to the one shown in the first stage . However the affordances e.g. the secondary access mode control and the unlock slider are now inverted or switched in the secondary access mode. That is the slider affordance is now used to unlock the device to the secondary access mode and the affordance the primary access mode control is used to show the passcode page to gain access back to the primary mode.

In addition to the affordances that are switched the secondary access mode lock screen page provides a visual indication that the lock screen is for the secondary access mode. In this example the visual indication is a secondary access mode label . However the device of some embodiment might provide one or more other visual indications. In the fourth stage the user also slides the slider affordance to turn the device on in the secondary access mode.

The fifth stage shows the device operating in the secondary access mode. It also shows that the user is pressing the affordance to turn the screen back off. In the sixth stage the user again pushes the home button to gain access to the lock screen of the device. However this time in the seventh stage the user tries to gain access to the primary access mode by touch selecting the affordance instead of the slider. The eighth stage illustrates the result of the selection and sliding up of the affordance . As illustrated in this stage the passcode screen is displayed on the device s screen for the user to enter the primary access passcode and gain access to primary access mode.

In the example described above the secondary access mode lock screen forces a person to input a passcode in order to gain access to the device in the primary access mode. Therefore the device is secure regardless of the passcode grace period. Instead of the secondary mode lock screen the device of some embodiments automatically resets the grace period when the device is unlocked to the secondary access mode or locked from the secondary access mode. Similar to the secondary access mode lock screen this forces a person attempting to access the device in the primary access mode to supply a passcode. In some embodiments the device of some embodiments provides an affordance to exit the secondary access mode. For example the home screen page may include a selectable item that when selected causes the device to exit the secondary access mode.

In several of the examples described above the mobile device is unlocked to the secondary access mode through an affordance on a first page e.g. the lock screen page or a second page e.g. the passcode page of the device. In some embodiments the device has fingerprint recognition technology that allows its user to gain access to the primary access mode through fingerprint recognition. In some of these embodiments the device initiates operation in its secondary access mode when a user attempts to access the device through fingerprint recognition but the fingerprint recognition fails.

Alternatively or conjunctively the device of some embodiments allows multiple fingerprints to be recorded for one user or multiple users and allows one or more fingerprints to be recorded for initiating the primary access mode operation of the device while allowing one or more fingerprints to be recorded for initiating the secondary access mode operation of the device. In these embodiments fingerprint recognition may launch the device in either the primary access mode or secondary access mode for different users. Several examples of accessing the device in the primary or secondary access mode through fingerprint recognition will now be described by reference to . In these examples the fingerprint sensor or scanner is provided as part of a physical button . However the sensor may be provided as a part of a different component or its one separate component.

Three operational stages of the mobile device are shown in . The first stage illustrates the device displaying its lock screen page. Here the user performs a touch gesture on the slider affordance that is shown on the lock screen page to navigate to the passcode page . The gesture input causes the device to display the passcode page as illustrated in the second stage .

The second stage illustrates the user placing the user s finger on the button . This causes the sensor on the button to capture a pattern of the fingerprint of that finger. The captured pattern is then compared with a previously stored pattern to determine if the two patterns match. Different embodiments use different matching methods. For instance the input fingerprint pattern may be compared with the stored fingerprint pattern to identify a same or similar characteristic. Examples of such characteristics include the arch whorl or loop of the fingerprints.

The third stage illustrates the device after authenticating the user through fingerprint recognition. Specifically the matching of the fingerprint patterns has allowed the user to gain access to the device in the primary access mode. As mentioned above in some embodiments the primary access mode of the device provides unfettered access to all of the device s applications and or data that are available to the user.

Three operational stages of the mobile device are shown in this figure. In the first stage the mobile device displays the lock screen page on its touch screen display. To display the passcode page the user selects the slider and performs a touch based gesture on the slider affordance e.g. by dragging the slider handle with the user s finger at least partially across to the end of the slider bar . The second stage illustrates the user placing the user s finger on the button . Different from the previous figure the fingerprint of this finger has not been previously recorded with the device .

The third stage illustrates that the device of some embodiments allows the user to gain access in the secondary access mode when the fingerprint recognition fails. In the alternate stage the device of some embodiments denies access to the user. Here the stages illustrate that the device does not update its display in response to user placing the finger on the button . The same passcode page is shown on the touch screen display. In some embodiments the input of an incorrect fingerprint pattern may cause the device to show a previous page e.g. the lock screen or cause it to show a visual or textual indication that the fingerprint could not be recognized. In some embodiments the device provides a menu option to specify whether an input of an incorrect fingerprint pattern results in it being unlocked to secondary access mode or remaining locked.

In the previous two examples the fingerprint recognition operation is performed after navigating from the first page e.g. the lock screen page to the second page e.g. the passcode page . In some embodiments the device s operating system allows a user to access the device on the first page without having to navigate to the second page. provide illustrative examples of the fingerprint recognition operations that are performed at the lock screen page. Specifically illustrates an example of gaining access to the primary access mode of the device through fingerprint recognition when the device s touch screen display shows the lock screen. This is followed by which illustrates two alternate operations that the device perform when a user attempts to access the device through fingerprint recognition but the fingerprint recognition fails.

Three operational stages of the mobile device are shown in . The first stage illustrates the device displaying its lock screen page. The user then performs a combination of gestures to unlock the device to the primary access mode. Specifically the user places the user s finger on the button . In the second stage while holding the button with one finger the user selects the slider affordance with another finger and performs a touch based gesture e.g. by dragging the slider handle with the user s finger at least partially across to the end of the slider bar . The combination of the two gestures causes the button s sensor to capture a fingerprint pattern of that finger. The captured pattern is then compared with one or more previously stored fingerprint patterns to determine if the patterns match.

The third stage illustrates the device after authenticating the user thorough fingerprint recognition. Specifically the fingerprint recognition has launched the device in the primary access mode because the captured fingerprint pattern matched a previously stored fingerprint pattern.

In the first stage the user places the user s finger on the button . The fingerprint of this finger has not been previously recorded with the device . The user then performs a combination of gestures to gain access to device. As shown in the second stage the user performs a touch based gesture while holding the button with the user s finger. This is the same combination gesture that has been described above by reference to stage of .

The third stage illustrates that the device of some embodiments allows the user to gain access in the secondary access mode when the fingerprint recognition fails. In the alternate stage the device of some embodiments denies access to the user. Here the stages illustrate that the device does not update its display in response to user placing the finger on the button . The same passcode page is shown on the touch screen display. In some embodiments the input of an incorrect fingerprint pattern may cause the device to show a previous page e.g. the lock screen or cause it to show a visual or textual indication that the fingerprint could not be recognized.

The two previous examples illustrated bypassing the passcode page through fingerprint recognition and gaining access to the device in either the primary or secondary access mode. The examples also illustrated a combination gesture to gain access to the device. Specifically these examples show selecting the physical button with one finger and performing a touch gesture on the slider affordance with another finger to unlock the device.

Different from the previous examples multiple fingerprints have been recorded and stored for one particular user. That is in this example at least one fingerprint has been recorded to gain access to the device in the primary access mode and at least one other fingerprint has been recorded to gain access to the device in the secondary access mode. Two operational stages and of the device are shown in .

The first stage illustrates the device displaying its lock screen page. To initiate the fingerprint recognition the user places the user s finger on the device s button . The placement of the finger causes the device to scan that finger for a fingerprint pattern. The scanned pattern is then compared with one or more stored fingerprint patterns. If the fingerprint recognition passes the device s operating system allows the user to gain access to the device.

The second stage illustrates the device after it has passed the fingerprint recognition test. Since the fingerprint pattern matched a stored pattern and the stored pattern was to authorize the user to the primary access mode the second stage shows that device has been unlocked to the primary access mode.

The second stage illustrates the device after it has passed the fingerprint recognition test. Since the fingerprint pattern matched a stored pattern and that stored pattern was to authorize the user to the secondary access mode the second stage shows that device has been unlocked to the secondary access mode.

In the examples described above one user 1 gains access to the mobile device in the primary mode through one finger and 2 gains access to the mobile device in the secondary mode through another finger. The device of some embodiments allows multiple fingerprints to be recorded for multiple users. In some such embodiments fingerprint recognition may launch the device in either the primary access mode or secondary access mode. If a user is granted access to the secondary mode the device may launch a mode that is specific for that user. This means that different users can have their own personal secondary access modes. For example a first user may have access to one set of applications while a second different user may have access to another set of applications. In addition the first guest user might have different data access privileges e.g. write access read access etc. than the second guest user.

The stage illustrates user 1 attempting to access the device through the user s fingerprint. The fingerprint of user 1 has been previously recorded with the device as one that should be allowed access to the device in the primary access mode. Accordingly in the stage the device is unlocked to the primary access mode.

The stage illustrates user 2 attempting to access the device . The fingerprint of user 2 has been previously recorded with the device as one that should be allowed access to the device in the user 2 s secondary access mode. Accordingly in the stage the device unlocks to user 2 s personal secondary access mode. As it is illustrated in this stage the applications that are accessible to user 2 are less than the applications that are accessible to user 1 in the primary access mode.

The stage illustrates user 3 attempting to access the device . The fingerprint of user 3 has been previously recorded with the device as one that should be allowed access to the device in the user 3 s secondary access mode. Accordingly in the stage the device unlocks to user 3 s personal secondary access mode. As it is illustrated in this stage the applications that are accessible to user 3 are even less than the applications that are accessible to user 2 even though both of these users have access to secondary access mode. In some embodiments the device provides menu options to specify which applications are available to different users. For example with such menu options the owner of the device can specify different applications for different users or groups of users e.g. friends family children etc. .

The stage illustrates user 4 attempting to access the device . The fingerprint of user 4 has not been previously recorded with the device. Accordingly in the stage the selection of the affordance e.g. the button causes the device to display the passcode page . In some embodiments when the fingerprint recognition fails the device unlocks to a default secondary access mode account instead of a personal secondary account such as the ones illustrated in stages and .

The first set of operations illustrates user 1 attempting to access the device in the primary access mode. The fingerprint of user 1 has been previously recorded with the device as one that should be allowed access to the device in the primary access mode. As shown in stage the user holds down the user s finger over the button. This causes the device to initiate the finger print recognition operation. For example the user s finger may be scanned when the device detects the user s finger over the scanner. The stage illustrates the user pressing the button to open the device. The stage illustrates the device unlocking to the primary access mode. This stage also illustrates the device playing a sound to indicate that the fingerprint recognition has passed. In conjunction with the sound or instead of it the device of some embodiments provides a different indication e.g. the device might vibrate if the feature has been turned on .

The second set of operations is similar to the first set of operations. However the sound is played prior to the user pressing the button. Therefore in this set of operations the fingerprint recognition occurs immediately after the user holds down the finger over the button at stage . If the fingerprint recognition has passed the device then plays a sound. This is shown in the stage . In stage the user then presses the button to unlock the device to the primary access mode. The primary access mode is shown in stage .

The third set of operations illustrates user 2 is attempting to access the device in the secondary access mode. This set of operations is identical to the first set in that the sound is played after the user presses the home button. The fourth set of operations illustrates that user 2 is attempting to access the device in the secondary access mode. This set of operations is identical to the second set in that the sound is played prior to the user pressing the home button.

Various different examples of entering a primary access mode or a secondary access mode have been described above by reference to . One of ordinary skill in the art would realize that the various embodiments shown in these figures and described herein are not necessarily mutually exclusive combinations of features and can be combined in different ways. For example the secondary access passcode feature of can be combined with any one or more of the fingerprint recognition features of . As another example illustrates a different combination. In particular this figure shows four different sets of operations that are performed on the device to gain access to the device in either the primary access mode or the secondary access mode.

The first set of operations illustrates an example of a touch gesture that can be performed on the lock screen page to unlock the mobile device and place it in the secondary access mode . This set of operations is described above by reference to .

The second set of operations illustrates an example of inputting a passcode through the passcode page to gain full access to the device in the primary access mode. Specifically the figure illustrates switching to the passcode page using the slider affordance on the lock screen page . The user then uses the passcode page to input a passcode. Lastly the device is unlocked to the primary access mode upon receiving the correct passcode through the passcode page.

The third and fourth sets of operations and illustrate that fingerprint recognition features can be combined with any other operations for accessing the device. Here the examples are similar to the ones describe above by reference to . Specifically theses sets of operations show that one user can gain access to the device in the primary mode using one finger and gain access to the device in the secondary access mode using a different finger.

In several examples that are described above the device of some embodiments displays a passcode page to grant access to the device. In addition depending on the passcode input the device is directed to operate in either the primary or the secondary access mode. Instead of the passcode input the mobile device of some embodiments allows a user to access the device through a different touch code such as a pattern code. illustrate unlocking a mobile device to different modes by drawing different patterns.

In the second stage the user drags the user s finger over several of the affordances to input a pattern. The input pattern matches a previously stored pattern that grants access to the device in the primary access mode. As such in the third stage the device is shown as being unlocked to the primary access mode . In this mode the user has access to all applications that execute on the device and that are available to a user of the device. The example of the third stage illustrates seven applications i.e. App 1 7 that are arranged in line on the device s screen.

Some embodiments provide still other mechanisms for launching the device in the secondary access mode. Examples of these other mechanisms include motion based inputs multi tap inputs e.g. multiple taps on a soft or physical affordance of the device voice commands etc. Several of these mechanisms do not require the user to navigate to a particular page e.g. the lock screen page the passcode page . Instead the user can input a command on any page to direct the device to operate in one mode or another. For example when the device has already been unlocked to the primary access mode the user can input a gesture or a command to quickly switch the device from operating in the primary access mode to the secondary access mode. These embodiments can be used alone in combination with one another or with any one or more of the other techniques described above by reference to .

In the previous example the user taps on the affordance e.g. the physical button multiple times to direct the device to switch to the secondary access mode. The secondary access mode however may be activated differently in some embodiments. For example the secondary access mode may be activated through a selection e.g. a single tap a double tap of a touch screen affordance e.g. a soft share button or an icon on the screen . In some embodiments the device allows the user to activate the secondary access mode through a press pattern. An example of such a press pattern includes a short press of the affordance followed by a long press of that same affordance. The device of some such embodiments includes a menu option to record one or more press patterns. The recorded patterns can then be used direct the device to operate in the secondary access mode.

The first stage illustrates the mobile device opening in the primary access mode. The second and third stages and illustrate the selection and rotation of the mobile device . In the second stage the user grabs or holds the device with the user s hand to rotate it in a particular direction. As shown in the third stage the device is then rotated to place it in the secondary access mode. Specifically the device is rotated in a clockwise direction several times e.g. two or three times . However the device may be rotated in any direction e.g. counter clockwise direction for any number of times e.g. one two three to place it in the secondary access mode. The fourth stage illustrates the mobile device after it has transitioned to the secondary access mode.

In the example described above the user rotates the mobile device to place it in the secondary access mode. The rotate motion gesture is just one of many different motion gestures that can be used to activate or deactivate the secondary access mode. Examples of other motion gestures include placing the mobile device face down shaking tilting or flipping the device or any other motion gestures that can be detected through one or more motion detecting components of the mobile device such as a gyroscope or an accelerometer.

Two operational stages and of the mobile device are shown in . The user in the first stage selects the affordance e.g. the button . In this example the user holds the affordance with the user s finger for a short period of time e.g. a pre defined time period . As shown the gesture causes a prompt to be displayed on the device s screen. In this example the prompt indicates to the user that it is waiting for the user s voice command. In some embodiments the program plays a sound e.g. speaks to the user indicating that the program has been activated and that it is awaiting input of a voice command.

As shown in the first stage the user inputs a voice command through the microphone of the mobile device to gain access to the device in the secondary access mode. In this example the voice command is shown as being secondary access mode . However the voice command may be any word or combination of words capable of being recognized by the voice recognition program. The second stage illustrates that the input of the voice command has caused the device to operate in the secondary access mode e.g. unlocked and placed in the secondary access mode .

Having described many different examples of entering the secondary access mode several examples of the device indications during the secondary mode will now be described below by reference to . As mentioned above the mobile device of some embodiments provides one or more visual indications that it is operating in the secondary access mode rather than the primary access mode. To provide such indications the device in some embodiments changes the background image that is used for the pages displayed during the secondary access mode or provides textual indication on these pages regarding the operation of the device in the secondary access mode. When operating in its secondary access mode the device of some embodiments displays only the icons of the applications that are available in this mode. Instead of removing the icons of the applications that are not available in the secondary access mode the device of some embodiments provides a deprecated e.g. grayed out reduced in size etc. display of the icons of the unavailable applications and makes these icons non selectable items in its user interface.

As shown in the page herein after the home screen page represents the device operating in the primary access mode. In this mode the home screen page is shown with a user specified background image e.g. wallpaper . This figure also illustrates different example home screen pages when the device is operating in the secondary access mode. Specifically the home screen page illustrates that the device of some embodiments uses a default background image during the secondary mode that is different from the background image s used during the primary mode. Examples of such a default background image include a generic wallpaper and an out of box wallpaper.

As shown by the home screen page the device of some embodiments might use in the secondary mode a slightly or highly blurred or tinted version of the background image used in the primary access mode. To display such background image the device may perform one or more different filtering operations on the current background image.

In some embodiments any background image used in the secondary mode might contain text or watermark text such as secondary access mode quick access mode shared mode guest mode or similar such words to provide further textual indication of the secondary access mode of the device. In the example of the background image of the home screen page contains a watermark which states that the device is operating in the shared mode. The example of the home screen page shows that the label can also be rotated about an axis. The home screen page shows that the dock has been removed and a label has been placed at or near the previous position of the dock. The home screen page shows a similar label on the status bar .

As mentioned above when operating in the secondary access mode the device of some embodiments displays only the icons of the applications that are available in this mode. Instead of removing the icons of the applications that are not available in the secondary access mode the device of some embodiments provides a deprecated e.g. grayed out reduced in size etc. display of the icons of the unavailable applications and makes these icons non selectable items in its user interface.

The home screen pages and illustrate examples of hiding icons of applications that are not accessible in the secondary access mode. One reason for hiding the icons over changing the icon s appearance is that the device looks less broken. That is with icons that are functionless and appear different from other icons the user of the device may believe that the device is malfunctioning. Another advantage of hiding the icons is that some users do not want anyone to know what applications that they have installed on their devices.

Referring to as shown by the home screen page the device of some embodiments retains the dock in the secondary access mode. The home screen page also illustrates that the icons are aligned e.g. center aligned on the dock. As shown by home screen page the device of some embodiments removes the dock and places any remaining icons inline with other icons on the page. In some of these embodiments the device reserves the first few icons slots on the first page of the secondary mode for the available application icons that are removed from the dock.

In addition to removing icons the mobile device of some embodiments rearranges icons. That is the mobile device re arranges the available icons on the displayed pages to remove any positions that are empty because of the removed icons. When there are folders with multiple icons in the primary access view the device of some embodiments may move folder s icons that are accessible in the secondary access mode to a displayed page. In some embodiments an icon will only be moved from the folder to the displayed page when that icon is the only one left in that folder. For example if two icons are left in a folder as a result of entering the secondary access mode that folder will remain in the secondary access mode with those two icons.

The first stage presents the device while it is operating in its primary access mode. In this mode the user has access to all applications that execute on the device and that are available to a user of the device. The first stage illustrates thirty available applications twenty six of which are arranged in line across multiple pages and four of which are positioned in the dock . Here the page A is the first page that is visible on the device touch sensitive screen while the page B represents the second page that is not currently displayed on the screen. In some embodiments the user can place the user s finger on the touch sensitive screen and perform a gesture e.g. a swipe gesture to switch between pages e.g. switch to next or previous pages depending on the direction of the swipe gesture .

Along with different icons the first stage illustrates that the home screen pages include multiple different folders. Specifically the two pages include five different folders with varying numbers of icons in them. The first folder in the first page includes three icons the second folder in the first page includes two icons the third folder in the first page includes one icon the fourth folder in the second page includes two icons and the fifth folder in the second page includes four icons. The user can select any one of these folders to view its content and make selections of the different icons. The user can also add one or more icons to a folder by selecting an icon and dragging it into that folder.

The second stage illustrates the device after it has been launched in the secondary access mode. Specifically this stage illustrates that when operating in the secondary access mode the device displays only the icons of the applications that are accessible in the secondary access mode and removes the icons of the applications that are not available in the secondary access mode. The device has also removed the dock and placed on the displayed page the icons of any available applications that were previously positioned in the dock i.e. App 1 .

Accordingly in the second stage of the example illustrated in the thirty icons of different applications that are available in the primary access mode have been reduced to twelve icons. The device has also removed any folder that contains only one icon and placed that icon on the displayed page. For example Folder 3 that contained only the icon of the seventeenth application is not shown in the secondary access mode. Instead the icon of the seventeenth application is now on the displayed homepage in the secondary access mode.

The second stage also illustrates that the device does not have an associated second page in the secondary access mode. This is because the remaining icons and folders can fit in the available slots on the first page and the icons have been compacted to that first page. Specifically the icons have been compacted following their natural order with any remaining icons from the dock taking the first few positions on the first row of the first page. Accordingly the one remaining icon from the dock is the first icon on the first page.

The second stage illustrates the device operating in the secondary access mode. This stage is similar to the second stage of the previous figure. However the folder is carried over to the secondary access mode from the primary access mode. This is because the folder has at least one item in it i.e. application icon that is still accessible in the secondary access mode. If a folder does not contain any items in the secondary access mode e.g. its items are not accessible in the secondary access mode that folder is not carried over from the primary access mode to the secondary access mode.

In the examples described above the icons have been compacted following their ordering in the primary access mode with any remaining icons from the dock taking the first few positions on the first row of the first page. In some embodiments the ordering of different item e.g. the icons folder is not carried over from the primary access mode to the secondary access mode. For example during a secondary access mode session the icons of different applications can be rearranged. However when the primary access mode session is started the arrangement of icons and or folders will remain the same as the previous primary access session.

Having described examples device indications during the secondary access mode an example process will now be described. conceptually illustrates a process that some embodiments perform to change the device s appearance and make applications inaccessible. In some embodiments the process is performed by a set of access modules associated with the device s operating system when it is instructed to place the device in the secondary access mode.

As shown in the process begins by determining at whether the device should generate a secondary access interface. Many examples of placing a device in the secondary access mode have been described above. For instance the secondary access mode can be activated through a touch gesture on an affordance on a particular page e.g. the lock screen page the passcode page of the device through a motion gesture e.g. rotating the device through a voice command etc. If the process determines that the secondary access mode interface should be generated the process proceeds to which is described below. Otherwise the process displays at the primary access mode interface.

The process makes at the private applications inaccessible. This may entail making icons of private applications functionless and changing the icons appearances or hiding them. By making icons of applications functionless the process makes the icons of the private applications incapable of launching their associated applications upon selection. For example the touch input selection of an icon of a private application is ignored when the device is operating in the secondary access mode. In some embodiments the process simply hides those icons thereby making them inaccessible to the end user. In changing the appearance of the icons the process may visually distinguish the icons of the private applications from the other icons of other applications that are available in the secondary access mode. As mentioned above the process may grey out the icons e.g. change the opacity of the icons and or change their size e.g. make them appear smaller larger or in a different depth plane .

At the process moves any remaining application icons from a dock e.g. taskbar to a row on a page e.g. the home screen page . In some embodiments the remaining icons of the dock are placed on the first row of the first page. However in other embodiments they can be placed elsewhere such as at the end of the first page at the end of the last page if there are more than one page etc. The process then removes at the dock.

As shown the process rearranges at the remaining available icons on one or more pages. The process may rearrange the available icons on the displayed pages to remove any positions that are empty because of removed icons. Examples of rearranging icons are described in detail above by reference to . The process then generates a display of a secondary access mode label . This label provides a visual indication to the user that the mobile device is operating in the secondary access mode. As mentioned above the label may be placed in a number of different places including the status bar watermarked on the background at the place where the dock used to be etc.

At the process modifies the background image that is used for the pages displayed during the secondary access mode. For instance the process might set the background image to a default image e.g. out of box wallpaper generic wallpaper . Instead of using a default background image during the secondary access mode the process of some embodiments might use in this mode a slightly highly blurred and or tinted version of the background image used in the primary access mode. Alternatively or conjunctively with the background image the process might select a particular color for the background in the secondary access mode or specify a pattern based on a selected background image. The selected background image can also be scaled to fit a portion of one page all of one page etc.

Some embodiments perform variations of the process . The specific operations of the processes may not be performed in the exact same order shown and described. The specific operations may not be performed in one continuous series of operations and different specific operations may be performed in different embodiments. For example if the process does not hide icons then there may be no reason to arrange icons. Furthermore the process could be implemented using several sub processes or as part of a larger macro process.

Having described several example device appearances during the secondary access mode several example device behaviors will now be described below by reference to . In some embodiments the secondary access mode specifies different restrictions for accessing the applications of the devices services e.g. operating system services and or data stored on the device. For instance during the secondary access mode the device might 1 not allow the user to access data that is normally available in the primary access mode 2 allow the user access the data but prevent that user from modifying the data and or 3 allow the user access a filtered or condensed version of the data.

Three operational stages of the device in the primary access mode are shown in . The first stage shows several available applications including a web browser that is represented on the dock with the icon . To launch the web browser the user performs a touch gesture e.g. by tapping the user s finger on the icon . The selection of the icon causes the web browser to be opened as illustrated in the second stage .

The second stage illustrates that the browser has been opened to the user homepage. This is a custom homepage set by the user. In this second stage the user selects an affordance e.g. a bookmark button to direct the web browser to show any saved bookmarks. As shown in the third stage the selection results in the display of the bookmarks page . The bookmarks page lists different bookmarks. In this example the bookmarks include a couple of user specified bookmarks and and a couple of other default bookmarks and . The default bookmarks are those that are not set by the end user but are preset by the developer.

As shown in the third stage the bookmarks page also includes an affordance e.g. the history tab . The user can select this affordance to show a history page that contains a list of webpages the user has visited recently and other associated data e.g. page title and time of visit . The associated data may be recorded webpages for a specified period of time.

As shown in the second stage the selection of the icon causes the web browser to be opened. Different from the second stage of the second stage here illustrates that the web browser has been opened to a default homepage. In some embodiments the web browser presents the same homepage as the one selected for the primary access mode or presents a blank webpage. Alternatively the default homepage may be any webpage that has been previously set e.g. by the end user for the secondary access mode or by the developer .

In this second stage the user selects the affordance e.g. a bookmark button to direct the web browser to show the saved bookmarks. As shown in the third stage the selection results in the display of the saved bookmarks. The third stage also illustrates that the user bookmarks are kept private in the secondary access mode. Specifically the user bookmarks and that are shown in the third stage of the previous figure are not shown in this third stage . The default bookmarks are still shown in the third stage . However the web browser may not be associated with any default bookmarks in some embodiments. In the secondary access mode the history page not shown that contains a list of recently visited webpages may appear blank. In other words similar to the bookmarks the history data may be kept private in the secondary access mode.

In the example described above the user data that is normally available in the primary access mode is not available in the secondary access mode. To facilitate such private data restrictions the application of some embodiments is associated with multiple data stores for different users or different modes. For example the user may be associated with one or more folders or directories that store user files for the primary access mode. In some embodiments the data that is available in the secondary access mode is persistent across different secondary access mode sessions. For example if the user saves a bookmark in one secondary access mode session then that same bookmark may be shown in another subsequent secondary access mode session.

In the example of the affordance the history tab to show the history page is not shown. This allows the history to be completely hidden in the secondary access mode. Otherwise one guest could see a previous guest s browsing history. Alternatively the data that is available in the secondary access mode may not persist across different sessions but may be cached and cleared with each session.

The second stage illustrates that the map application has opened a map . The map application includes a search bar with an affordance e.g. a bookmark button . The affordance can be selected to display any saved bookmarks. Here the user selects this affordance. The selection results in the map application presenting the bookmarks page as illustrated in the third stage . As bookmarks data is kept private in the secondary access mode the bookmarks page does not list any bookmarks that have been saved in the primary mode.

Along the bottom of the bookmarks page is a bar with affordances and e.g. a Bookmarks tab and a Recents tab to switch between displaying bookmarks and recent searches e.g. locations places . In the third stage the user selects the affordance to direct the application to show the Recents page. The fourth stage illustrates that the selection results in the display of the Recents page . As history data is kept private in the secondary access mode the Recents page does not list any recent searches performed in the primary access mode.

In several of the previous examples when the device is operating in the secondary access mode the user cannot access data that would normally be accessible in the primary access mode. In addition to securing data or instead of it the secondary access mode of some embodiments places restrictions on one or more services e.g. operating system services . In some embodiments the device restricts access to a particular service when a corresponding application is set as being private in the secondary access mode. That is when there is a one to one mapping between an application and a service and that application is set to be private in the secondary access mode the device of some embodiments sets that service to be disabled in the secondary access mode as well. For example if a photo application is set to be disabled in the secondary access mode all other applications that have access to the photos in the primary access mode will be denied access to those photos in the secondary access mode. Other examples of such mappings include a contacts application to a contacts service a calendar application to a calendar service a reminders application to a reminders service etc. In some embodiments when an application that has access to a service is running in memory and a secondary access mode session has been started the device force quit the application and restarts it so that it does not have access to that service.

The first stage illustrates the device operating in the secondary access mode. In this secondary access mode the email application and the contacts application are inaccessible. Specifically the icons and of the contacts application and the email application have been made functionless and those same icons have been made to appear different from the icons of applications that are accessible in the secondary access mode. As shown by the icon the phone application remains accessible in the secondary access mode. In the first stage the user performs a touch gesture e.g. by tapping the user s finger on the icon .

As illustrated in the second stage the selection of the icon in the previous stage causes the phone application to be opened. Here the keypad page is shown on the display screen of the device. The keypad page is overlaid by a bottom bar that includes several affordances to switch between different pages e.g. favorites recent contact keypad voicemail . To display the contacts page the user selects the affordance the contacts tab .

The third stage illustrates the device showing the contacts page of the phone application on its display screen. Specifically it illustrates that the contacts page does not include any contacts. This is because the contacts application has been previously disabled for the secondary access mode. Accordingly the phone application cannot access the contact service through which it receives contact data e.g. the list of contacts . In some embodiments the services may still be available but may return a null set e.g. a list with no contacts . In the example described above an empty contacts page is shown when the user selects the affordance e.g. the contacts tab . In some embodiments instead of showing an empty contacts page the selection of the affordance causes a message to be displayed. The message may indicate that the user does not have access to contacts in the secondary access mode. In this manner the device does not appear broken or the phone application does not appear as if it cannot access the contacts data.

The first stage illustrates the device operating in the secondary access mode. Similar to the previous example the email application and the contacts application are inaccessible. As shown by the icon the social network application remains accessible in the secondary access mode. In the first stage the user performs a touch gesture e.g. by tapping the user s finger on the icon .

As illustrated in the second stage the selection of the icon results in the social network application being opened. The application has been opened to its menu. The menu includes an affordance that can be selected to find people that are in the user s contact directory. In particular this feature accesses the contacts service to retrieve the contacts associated with the user and determines whether those contacts have been registered with the social network. The application then displays a page that includes a list of all the people in the contacts directory that have been registered with the social network.

In the second stage the user selects the affordance . The selection causes a pop up window to be displayed as illustrated in the third stage . The pop up window includes a message that indicates that the contacts services have been disabled. In this example the third stage shows that the window also includes an affordance to exit the secondary access mode and an affordance to close the window and return to the page.

In several of the example described above when operating in the secondary access mode the device of some embodiments restricts access to data and or services associated with different applications. conceptually illustrates a software architecture of a data access framework of some embodiments. In some embodiments the data access framework is a service for controlling access to data by applications operating on a mobile device with multiple access modes. Different embodiments of the data access framework are implemented differently. For instance in some embodiments the data access framework is implemented as a stand alone service. The data access framework of some embodiments is a service that is integrated into another application while the data access framework of other embodiments might be implemented as a service within an operating system e.g. iOS provided by Apple Inc. .

Furthermore in some embodiments the data access framework is provided as part of a server based solution. In some such embodiments the data access framework is provided via a thin client. That is the data access framework runs on a server while a user interacts with the data access framework via a separate machine remote from the server. In other such embodiments the data access framework is provided as a thick client. That is the data access framework is distributed from the server to the client machine and runs on the client machine.

As shown the data access framework includes an application identifier a data access manager and a data class identifier . The data access framework also includes data class access list storage and application data storage . In some embodiments the data class access list storage stores different data class access lists for different access modes e.g. a primary access mode a secondary access mode etc. of the mobile device. Each data access list specifies different data classes that are accessible by different applications for the corresponding access mode. Different embodiments specify data classes any number of different ways. For instance some embodiments specify data classes based on applications e.g. an address book data class a photo data class a calendar data class etc. based on types of data for a particular application e.g. a bookmark data class for a web browsing application a phone number data class for an address book application a search history data class e.g. recent searches for a web browsing or mapping application etc. and or based on any other type of criteria for defining data classes etc.

In some embodiments some applications operable on the mobile device are each associated with a corresponding service. For instance a contacts application is associated with an address book service a calendar application is associated with a calendar event service a photo application is associated with a media asset service etc. In some embodiments when one such application is kept private for a secondary access mode of the mobile device the mobile device also prevents any application from accessing the service associated with the application by ensuring that the data class access list for the secondary access mode does not contain any entries or records that specify data classes associated with the application or the service associated with the application. For instance when a contacts application is kept private for the secondary access mode the mobile device prevents any application from accessing the address book service associated with the contacts application by ensuring that the data class access list for the secondary access mode does not contain any entries or records that specify an address book data class.

The application data storage stores the data of different applications that are operable on the mobile device. In some embodiments the storages and are implemented in one physical storage while in other embodiments the storages and are implemented on separate physical storages. Still in some embodiments some or all of the storages and are implemented across several physical storages.

The data access manager is responsible for controlling access to the application data stored in storage by Applications 1 N. In some embodiments the data access manager receives requests e.g. via application programming interface API calls from any one of the Applications 1 N for access to application data in storage . When the data access manager receives such a request the data access manager utilizes the application identifier and data class identifier to identify 1 the requesting application and 2 the data class of the requested data. The data access manager then accesses the storage to retrieve the data class access list that corresponds to the access mode in which the mobile device is operating.

Based on the data class access list the identified application and the identified data class the data access manager determines whether to allow the requesting application access to the requested data. As described above each data access list specifies different data classes that are accessible by different applications for a corresponding access mode. As such the data class manager identifies any entries and or records in the data class access list that specify the identified application. If an entry exists that specifies the identified data class of the requested data the data access manager retrieves the data and returns the data to the requesting application. Otherwise the data access manager returns an empty or null data to the requesting application. In some embodiments the data access manager has full access permissions e.g. create read write and delete permissions to the data access lists stored in the storage only when the mobile device is operating in the primary access mode. When the mobile device is operating in a non primary access mode e.g. a secondary access mode the data access manager has only read access to the data access lists stored in the storage . That is while in the non primary access mode the data access manager is prevented from creating modifying and or deleting data access lists stored in the storage .

The application identifier handles the identification of an application e.g. application 1 application 2 application 3 application N etc. making a request for access to application data. In some embodiments the application identifier receives such a request from the data access manager which the data access manager received from one of the applications 1 N . When the application identifier receives the request the application identifier determines the application making the request and returns this information to the data access manager . In some embodiments the application identifier determines the identity of the requesting application based on information e.g. metadata sent along with the request that uniquely identifies the application.

The data class identifier identifies the data class of data that is requested for access. In some embodiments the data class identifier receives a request for data from the data access manager which the data access manager received from one of the applications 1 N . When the data class identifier receives the request the data class identifier determines the data class of the requested data and returns this information to the data access manager . The data class identifier of some embodiments determines the data class of the requested data based on information e.g. metadata sent along with the request that specifies the data class of the requested data.

While many of the features in this example have been described as being performed by one module e.g. the data access manager one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the functions might be split up into multiple modules. Similarly the functions described as being performed by multiple different modules in this example might be performed by a single module in some embodiments e.g. the application identifier might be part of the data access manager .

When operating in the secondary access mode the mobile device of some embodiments allows a user to access filtered versions of data associated with applications operable on the mobile device. For instance in some embodiments a notification feature of the mobile device provides a summary of alerts also referred to as notification messages from different application operating on the mobile device. A user of the mobile device may designate the applications of which alerts are displayed in the notification feature and the manner in which the alerts appear in the notification feature in some embodiments. While the mobile device is operating in the secondary access mode the mobile device presents a modified version of alerts in order to prevent sensitive and or private information from being displayed to users of the mobile device.

The first stage illustrates the lock screen page of the mobile device that is presented while the mobile device is in a primary access mode. As shown the lock screen page presents several notification messages. In particular the lock screen page shows a notification message indicating a missed phone call was received from Mary Jones at telephone number 123 456 7890 a notification message indicating a text message was received from John Jones and a portion of the content of the text message and a notification message indicating an email was received from Jim Jones and a portion of the content of the email.

The second stage illustrates the lock screen page of the mobile device that is presented while the mobile device is in a secondary access mode. At the second stage the lock screen page presents a condensed version of the notification messages illustrated in the first stage in order to suppress sensitive and or private information in the notification messages. As shown in the second stage the lock screen page shows a summary of a total number of current notification messages a notification message indicating a missed phone call was received a notification message indicating a text message was received and a notification message indicating an email was received.

The first stage illustrates the notification page of the mobile device that is presented while the mobile device is in a primary access mode. As shown the notification page presents several notification messages. In particular the notification page shows a notification message indicating a missed phone call was received from Mary Jones at telephone number 123 456 7890 a notification message indicating a text message was received from John Jones and a portion of the content of the text message and a notification message indicating an email was received from Jim and a portion of the content of the email.

The second stage illustrates the notification page of the mobile device that is presented while the mobile device is in a secondary access mode. At the second stage the notification page presents a modified version of the notification messages illustrated in the first stage in order to suppress sensitive and or private information in the notification messages. As illustrated in the second stage the notification page shows a summary of a total number of notification messages a notification message indicating a missed phone call was received a notification message indicating a text message was received and a notification message indicating an email was received.

The shared mode UI manager of different embodiments is implemented differently. For instance in some embodiments the shared mode UI manager is implemented as a stand alone application. The shared mode UI manager of some embodiments is integrated into another application while the shared mode UI manager of other embodiments might be implemented within an operating system e.g. iOS provided by Apple Inc. .

In some embodiments the shared mode UI manager is provided as part of a server based solution. In some such embodiments the shared mode UI manager is provided via a thin client. That is the shared mode UI manager runs on a server while a user interacts with the shared mode UI manager via a separate machine remote from the server. In other such embodiments the shared mode UI manager is provided as a thick client. That is the shared mode UI manager is distributed from the server to the client machine and runs on the client machine.

As shown in the shared mode UI manager includes a user interface UI module an access mode manager a notification manager a primary mode layout generator and a secondary mode layout generator . The shared mode UI manager also includes layout data storage and notification data storage .

The layout data storage stores information rules templates etc. defining different layouts for different access modes background images for different access modes icons to display in different access modes different appearances of icons for different access modes etc. The notification data storage stores notification messages for display in a notification feature of the mobile device. In some embodiments the storages and are implemented in one physical storage while in other embodiments the storages and are implemented on separate physical storages. Still in some embodiments some or all of the storages and are implemented across several physical storages.

The UI module manages the display of the UI and outputs this display information to the display screen of the mobile device. In some embodiments the UI module receives 1 layout information e.g. the arrangement of icons the appearance of the icons the appearance of a background etc. from the access mode manager for the home screen page s and for various tasks e.g. video conferencing making and receiving telephone calls etc. performed on the mobile device 2 notification information e.g. notification messages to display the content of the notification messages the appearance of the notification messages etc. from the notification manager for display in a notification feature of the mobile device etc. in order to display the UI.

The access mode manager manages the different layouts to display based on the access mode in which the mobile device is operating. For instance when the mobile device is operating in a primary access mode the access mode manager directs the primary mode layout generator to generate a layout and then provides the layout to the UI module for display on the display screen of the mobile device. When the mobile device is operating in a secondary access mode or other non primary access modes the access mode manager directs the secondary mode layout generator to generate a layout and then passes the layout to the UI module for display on the display screen of the mobile device.

The notification manager is responsible for managing notification messages for display in a notification feature of the mobile device. In some embodiments the notification manager interfaces with the access mode manager to receive information from the access mode manager that indicates the access mode in which the mobile device is operating. The notification manager provides the UI module different formats of the notification messages based on the access mode in which the mobile device is operating. For instance in some embodiments the notification manager formats the notification messages according to the manner specified by the user of the mobile device when the mobile device is operating in the primary access mode and provides the notifications to the UI module for display in the notification feature.

When the mobile device is operating in the secondary access mode or other non primary access modes the notification manager formats the notification messages according to a defined shared mode format irrespective of the manner specified by the user of the mobile device . For instance in some embodiments the notification manager removes information of the content e.g. the content of emails text messages social media messages etc. to which the notification messages relate and includes only information about the applications with which the notification messages are associated and the number of notification messages associated with each of the applications. In other words the notification manager in some such embodiments generates a filtered version of the notification messages with sensitive and or private information redacted so that such information is not presented to users when the mobile device is operating in the secondary access mode. Examples of such filtered notification messages are above by reference to . In some embodiments when the mobile device is operating in the secondary access mode or other non primary access modes the notification manager suppresses the display of the notification messages in the notification feature by sending the UI module an empty or null set of data and or information indicating that notification messages are being suppressed.

The primary mode layout generator of some embodiments generates layouts for the primary access mode of the mobile device. In some embodiments the primary mode layout generator accesses the layout data storage for information and data to specify the arrangement of icons the appearance of the icons the background image etc. for the primary access mode layout.

In some embodiments the secondary mode layout generator generates layouts for the secondary access mode or other non primary access modes of the mobile device. The secondary mode layout generator of some embodiments accesses the layout data storage for information and data to specify the icons in the layout the arrangement of icons the appearance of the icons the background image visual textual indications that the mobile device is in the secondary access mode etc. for the secondary access mode layout.

The secondary mode layout generator of some embodiments generates layouts for various tasks performed on the mobile device. For the layout of some tasks the secondary mode layout generator filters information that would otherwise be displayed in the primary access mode. For instance when the secondary mode layout generator generates layouts for receiving a telephone or video conference call while the mobile device is in the secondary access mode the secondary mode layout generator suppresses the telephone number and or contact information e.g. name of contact location of contact etc. of the party from which the mobile device is receiving the call.

While many of the features in this example have been described as being performed by one module e.g. the notification manager one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the functions might be split up into multiple modules. Similarly the functions described as being performed by multiple different modules in this example might be performed by a single module in some embodiments e.g. the primary mode layout generator might be part of the secondary mode layout generator .

In several of the examples described above the mobile device performs a filtering operation to present data in the secondary access mode. In some embodiments the mobile device allows a user to access data associated with an application but does not allow the user to modify that data. For example when transitioning to the secondary access mode the device of some embodiments changes the attribute of the data to be read only data. This read only data cannot be deleted or modified during the secondary access mode session. Several examples of such read only data will now be described by reference to .

As illustrated in the second stage the selection of the icon results in the photos application being opened. Specifically the application has been opened to an album page . The album page displays thumbnail representation of stored images. Unlike the bookmarks and history data of certain applications the images are accessible in the secondary access mode. Here the thumbnail images are arranged in a grid like format. For example the page shows four thumbnail images on the first grid row and three addition thumbnail images on the second grid row. The user can select any one of these thumbnail representations to show a higher resolution version of that stored image.

In the second stage the user performs a touch gesture e.g. by tapping the user s finger on the thumbnail image . As shown in the third stage the gesture causes the photo application to present a higher resolution version of that image on the page . The page is overlaid by a bar that includes several affordances including an affordance to delete the image .

In the third stage the user selects the affordance e.g. the delete button to delete the image . However the selection does not result in the image being deleted. This is because the image has been specified to be read only in the secondary access mode. In the example of the affordance e.g. the delete button has been grayed out to indicate that the delete operation cannot be performed on the image. Similarly an affordance e.g. the edit button has also been grayed out to provide a visual indication that the image cannot be edited or modified during the secondary access mode session.

As illustrated in the second stage the selection of the icon results in the music application being opened. Specifically the application has been opened to a playlist menu page . The menu page displays a list of different playlists. The user can select any one of the playlists to show a listing of audio tracks or audio files associated with the selected playlist.

In the second stage the user selects the playlist from the playlist menu . As shown in the third stage the selection of the playlist causes the music application to navigate to a playlist page . This page lists the different audio tracks associated with the playlist. Any one of the tracks can be selected to play the associated audio file. When playback ends for that file the music player may play some other audio tracks such as the next audio track.

As shown the page is overlaid by a bar that includes several affordances including an affordance to edit the playlist e.g. change the order of the tracks an affordance to clear the playlist and an affordance to delete the playlist. In the third stage the user selects the affordance to clear the playlist. However the selection does not result in the playlist being cleared. This is because the playlist data has been specified to be read only during the secondary access mode session. In the example of the affordance has been grayed out to indicate that the clear operation cannot be performed on the playlist. Similarly the other two affordances and e.g. delete button edit button on the bar have been grayed out to provide a visual indication that the playlist cannot be edited or deleted during the secondary access mode session.

In some embodiments the device prevents modification to other data associated with an application. For example the music application may keep track of a play count for each audio track during the primary access code session. The play count is incremented each time that track reaches its end in playback. The primary access user can also use the play count to devise a listening strategy such as creating a favorites playlist based on the number of play counts. During the secondary access mode session the device of some embodiments prevents updates to the play count. In other words if a track is played in full the play count of that track will remain the same and will not affect the listening strategy of the primary access mode s user. As another example a video application may keep track of the position of the playback for a video during a primary access mode session. In some embodiments similar to the play count data the position data cannot be updated during the secondary access mode session.

In several of the examples described above the device of some embodiments denies access or allows read only access to data associated with an application. The device of some embodiments requires the user to supply password for an application e.g. an email application in order to have that application open to the right data file the right e mail account . This feature in some embodiments can be used in conjunction with or in place of the secondary access mode feature.

The first stage illustrates the device operating in the primary access mode. The user selects the email application icon . As shown in the second stage the selection results in the email application displaying a pop up window. The pop up window displays different email accounts. Here the user selects an account from the pop up window.

The third stage shows that the selection of the account results in the display of a password window . This window includes a field to input a password for the chosen account. The selection also results in the display of a keyboard e.g. the virtual keyboard . As shown the user uses the keyboard to input the account password. The fourth stage illustrates the email application interface after inputting the correct account password. Specifically this stage illustrates that the email application has been loaded and opened to the chosen email account.

During a secondary access mode session the device of some embodiments prevents the user from modifying one or more of its settings. In other words during a secondary access mode session the settings menu will not be accessible or the settings menu will contain a limited number of modifiable settings. This allows the owner of the device to control one or more device services that are available in the secondary access mode. For example the owner can specify a particular setting in the primary access mode. Thereafter when the device is directed to operate in the secondary access mode the setting carries over from the primary access mode to the secondary access mode. This feature is particularly useful for parents that let their children borrow their devices as it prevents the children from accessing particular devices services such as internet service phone service etc. illustrates an example of a user specifying a setting in the primary access mode that carries over to the secondary access mode. Eight stages of the mobile device are shown in this figure.

The first stage illustrates the device operating in the primary access mode. The user selects the settings icon to open the settings menu. The second stage illustrates an example settings menu of the device . The settings menu includes several different menu items including an affordance e.g. a switch to turn on or off airplane mode. The airplane mode can be turned on or off to suspend or activate some or all of the device s signal transmission capabilities. Turning the airplane mode on for instance causes the device incapable of placing and receiving phone calls exchanging text messages browsing the Internet etc.

The second stage illustrates that the airplane is on its default settings which is off. At this position the device s transmission capability is not disabled. To turn on the airplane mode the user selects the affordance e.g. the switch to set it on position as illustrated in the third stage . This in turn causes the airplane mode to be activated. As shown in the third stage the device also displays a visual indication that the airplane mode has been activated. Specifically an icon e.g. an airplane icon is now shown on the status bar of the device.

The fourth stage illustrates that the device is back in a standby mode and the device s screen is off. The mobile device of some embodiments transitions to standby mode when a user pushes physical button . The fourth stage also illustrates that the user is pressing the physical button to transition the device back to active mode and to turn the device s screen back on.

In the fifth stage the device s screen is turned back on and the lock screen page is displayed in response to the user pressing the home button in the previous stage. In this stage the user performs a touch gesture to unlock the device to the secondary access mode. Specifically the user places the user s finger on the affordance e.g. a soft button for entering the secondary access mode and swipes or slides the user s finger vertically up on the device s touch sensitive screen. The touch gesture in turn causes the lock screen page to slide up with the affordance .

The sixth stage illustrates the device operating in the secondary access mode. As shown the settings menu is inaccessible in the secondary access mode therefore the icon of the settings menu is hidden from the user. Instead of removing the icon the device of some embodiments changes the appearance of this settings icon and makes it a non selectable item in the secondary access mode. The sixth stage also illustrates that the user is selecting Game application by a tap gesture on the application icon .

In the seventh stage in response to the user tapping on the application icon a game application screen is opened. The game application has different menu items one of which is being selected by the user through a tap gesture on the menu item . Selecting this menu item will activate a multiplayer game which requires access to the Internet services.

The eighth stage illustrate how the airplane mode setting has been carried over from the primary access mode to the secondary access mode and how it affects the services rendered by the device. In this stage even though the user has selected multiplayer game which requires access to the Internet the selection does not result in gaining access to the Internet. Instead a message box pops up which indicates the airplane mode is turned on and that there is no connection to the Internet.

In the example described above the airplane mode setting is carried over from the primary access mode to the secondary access mode. One of ordinary skill in the art would realize that this setting is an example setting and that other settings may be carried over from one mode to another mode. For example the device s menu might include different options to turn on or off the Internet e.g. Wi Fi options 3G or 4G wireless internet options . The settings menu might include an option to prevent other people from making and or receiving phone calls with the device. In some embodiments the menu includes settings that enable Internet access for all applications a group of applications e.g. educational applications games etc. Similar to the airplane mode setting the device of some embodiments carries these settings from the primary access mode to the secondary access mode.

Having described several example device behaviors several different manners of specifying applications for the secondary access mode will now be described below by reference to . Specifically illustrate tools that allow user to manually specify several applications for the secondary access mode. These figures are followed by that illustrate how some embodiments employ heuristics to intelligently determine whether each application that is installed on the computing device should be accessible in the secondary access mode or should be kept private.

As mentioned above in some embodiments a limited number of applications can be accessed in the secondary access mode of the device. The number of applications accessible in the secondary access mode is 1 pre defined and static in some embodiments 2 pre defined but user customizable in other embodiments and 3 purely user specified in still other embodiments. The secondary access mode is always enabled in some embodiments while in other embodiments it is a mode that can be enabled or disabled by a user of the primary access mode. Different embodiments provide different mechanisms for a user to enable secondary access mode and or to specify applications and or data that are available during the secondary access mode. illustrates one manner of enabling the secondary access mode and applications that are accessible in this mode. This example is similar to the example described above by reference to . However the example of the present figure shows a shared menu that can be used to define a whitelist of shared applications. In some embodiments the device maintains an access list that lists different private applications.

The first stage illustrates the device operating in its primary access mode and displaying a page that contains three application icons and an overlaid dock with four application icons. This stage also shows the user s touch selection of an icon to launch the settings menu of the device s operating system.

The second stage illustrates an example settings menu of the device . The settings menu includes several different menu items. For example the menu includes a control for turning on or off airplane mode a wireless network selectable item for navigating to a sub menu for setting a wireless network connection e.g. Wi Fi network connection a notifications selectable item for navigating to a sub menu for specifying various notification policies and a share item for navigating to a sub menu for defining a whitelist of applications that are accessible in the secondary access mode. The second stage shows the user s touch selection of the share option .

The third stage shows that this selection causes the device to display the secondary access sub menu which in this example includes various controls related to the secondary access mode. One of these controls is an ON OFF switch that can turn the secondary access mode feature on or off. When the device transitions to the third stage from the second stage the switch is off. While this switch is off the device cannot be operated in the secondary access mode. When this switch is turned on the secondary access mode feature is available. A user however still has to direct the device to operate in the secondary access mode e.g. by selecting an affordance on the lock screen or the passcode page.

The third stage shows the user turning on the secondary access mode feature. In this example the turning on of the secondary access mode feature makes the enabling switches for the applications selectable. The fourth and fifth stages and then illustrate the user toggling on the switch for a game and toggling on the switch for a phone application. The sixth stage then shows the resulting list of applications that are enabled and disabled for the secondary access mode. In this example the sixth stage shows the social network and the email applications as being disabled i.e. restricted from the secondary access mode while the game and the phone application are enabled for this mode.

The first stage illustrates the device operating in its primary access mode and displaying a page that contains three application icons and an overlaid dock with four application icons. This stage also shows the user s touch selection of an icon to launch the settings menu of the device s operating system.

The second stage illustrates an example settings menu of the device . The settings menu includes several different menu items. In this example the menu items include a configure privacy item for navigating to a sub menu for specifying whether applications are accessible or not accessible in the secondary access mode. The second stage shows the user s touch selection of the privacy option .

The third stage shows that this selection causes the device to display the edit mode sub menu which in this example mirrors the device s home screen page. Specifically the edit mode sub menu shows the home screen page with the different icons. The icons of the applications that are accessible in the secondary access mode appear different from the icons of the applications that are not accessible in the secondary access mode. In the example of the third stage the edit mode shows that the social network application the phone application the email application and the game application are not accessible in the secondary access mode while the web browser and the music application are accessible in that mode.

The third and fourth stages and then illustrate the user selecting the icons and from the edit mode page to specify that the game and the phone application are accessible in the secondary access mode. The fifth stage then shows the resulting applications that are enabled and disabled for the secondary access mode. In this example the fifth stage shows the social network and the email applications as being disabled i.e. restricted in the secondary access mode while the game phone web and music applications are enabled for this mode. To save the access mode setting the user then selects the affordance e.g. the save button .

In some embodiments the device s operating system provides controls for enabling groups of applications e.g. game applications communication applications social media applications etc. in the secondary access mode. The device s operating system in these or other embodiments further provides controls for enabling access to different pieces of content data e.g. to different pictures contacts etc. during the secondary access mode.

The first stage shows the device displaying the secondary access sub menu which is similar to the one described above by reference to . In this example the sub menu includes several affordances e.g. switches . Each of these affordances can be selected to specify whether a group of applications which are categorized under a same category are accessible or not accessible in the secondary access mode. To simplify the discussion only two affordances for two different genres are shown in . Specifically the menu includes a first affordance for specifying whether games are accessible in the secondary access mode and a second affordance for specifying whether photo and video applications are accessible in that same mode.

The first stage illustrates the user selecting the affordance to switch each game application from being inaccessible to being accessible in the secondary access mode. As shown in the second stage the selection of the affordance causes the affordances and associated with the game applications Game and Game to be set to the On position. This provides a visual indication to the user that these game applications will now be accessible in the secondary access mode.

One of ordinary skill in the art would realize that the categories listed in are just example categories and that different embodiments might provide different categories. Examples of such categories include books education entertainment finance food drink games health and fitness news and music. In some embodiments the share menu might provide affordances for different sub categories such as action games role playing games sports games etc. In addition the share menu of some embodiments provides one affordance for multiple different categories. For example the menu might include one affordance that encompasses both the music category and the entertainment category.

In some embodiments the categories are based on how the applications are categorized in a content distribution system e.g. categorized for an online app store . For example a developer of an application might submit the application to the content distribution system and specify that the application belong in a particular category. The content distribution system may then associate the category to the application as application metadata. The content distribution system may also verify the categorization and re categorize the application if the categorization is incorrect. In some embodiments the device s operating system has access to this application metadata to make the application accessible or not accessible based on user input.

In addition to category metadata or instead of it the device s operating system of some embodiments provides controls to uniformly select a group of applications based on different metadata. An example of such metadata includes application rating application content etc. provides an illustrative example of a slider affordance that is associated with different application ratings to uniformly adjust the access mode settings for multiple different applications. Three operational stages of the mobile device of some embodiments are shown in this figure. In this example each application is associated with a particular rating based on the application s content. In some embodiments this particular rating determines the age group for which the application is appropriate.

The first stage shows the device displaying the secondary access sub menu which is similar to the one described above by reference to . In this example the sub menu includes a slider affordance to set different applications accessible based on an age group. In this example the slider affordance is shown with different age groups e.g. children teen and adults . However the affordance may be labeled differently e.g. with numbers that identifies different ages .

In the first stage the slider affordance is set to children. Accordingly the application that is associated with a 4 age rating is set to be accessible in the secondary access mode. In the second stage the slider affordance is set to teen. This in turn causes the application and the game that are associated with the age 12 rating to be set as being accessible in the secondary access mode. Lastly in the third stage the slider affordance is set to adult which in turn causes the application and the games that are associated with a 17 rating to be set as being accessible in the secondary access mode. That is in this stage all applications are set to be accessible in the secondary access mode.

The previous example illustrated using content ratings to uniformly specify whether groups of different applications are accessible or not accessible in the secondary access mode. One of ordinary skill in the art will realized that the different age groups described in the above example are set forth as examples and the numbers for different age groups can be set differently in different embodiments.

In the first stage the slider affordance is set to children. Accordingly the application with the content description that is associated with no objectionable material is set to be accessible in the secondary access mode. In the second stage the slider affordance is set to teen. This in turn causes the application associated with the cartoon violence description and the game associated with the strong language description to be set as being accessible in the secondary access mode. Lastly in the third stage the slider affordance is set to adult which in turn causes the games that are associated with the descriptions realistic violence and drug use to be set as being accessible in the secondary access mode.

In the previous two examples the different slider affordances are designed based on age e.g. age group . For instance each different position along the slider affordance represents a particular age group such as age 1 to 4 13 to 18 etc. In some embodiments the share menu provides an affordance that can uniformly set access settings for different applications based on a different criterion. One example of such a criterion is a relationship criterion or different groups of people. For example a set of different applications may uniformly be set as being accessible if the person using the device in the secondary access mode is an acquaintance a friend or a family member.

In the first stage the slider affordance is set to acquaintance. Accordingly the music application is set to be accessible in the secondary access mode. Here the music application may be set to being accessible because it is an application that is least likely to be abused by an acquaintance. For example if the phone application has been set to be accessible for an acquaintance then the acquaintance might make different phone calls without the owner s permission.

In the second stage the slider affordance is set to friends. This in turn causes the web browser and the phone application to become accessible in the secondary access mode. Finally in the third stage the slider affordance is set to family which in turn causes the photo application to be set as being accessible in the secondary access mode.

In several of the examples described above a single affordance is used to set the access mode settings for different groups of applications. provides an illustrative example of multiple affordances that can be used to granularly set access level for different applications based on multiple different factors. Three operational stages of the mobile device are shown in this figure. In this example each application may be associated with one or more pieces of data e.g. metadata that corresponds to a setting of an affordance e.g. the slider affordance or .

In the first stage the slider affordances and are set as acquaintance and children respectively. Accordingly the game is the only application that is set to be accessible in the secondary access mode. In the second stage the slider affordances and are set as friend and children. However the access settings of the different applications have not changed. This is because none of the other applications that are set as private is appropriate for children based on the data associated with those applications. Finally in the third stage the slider affordances and are set to friends and teen which in turn causes the music application and the phone application to be accessible in the secondary access mode.

In some embodiments the device allows a user to select one or more applications during a primary access mode session and then based on the selection immediately places the device in the secondary access mode. This feature is particularly useful because it allows the user to quickly select a few applications to share and immediately place the device in secondary access mode e.g. without having to lock the device . Several such examples will now be described below by reference to .

For some embodiments of the invention provides an illustrative example of making an application accessible in a secondary access mode on a mobile device . Three operational stages of the mobile device are illustrated in this figure. Specifically the three stages show selecting an application and activating the secondary access mode in order to share only the selected application. Here the mobile device is a smart phone. However the mobile device can be any device e.g. a tablet a desktop computer a laptop a smart television a digital media receiver capable of executing different applications.

As shown in the mobile device is displaying a home screen of its operating system OS . Two icons and are shown on the screen . These icons correspond to a game and a social network application respectively. The screen is also displaying an overlaid dock . Several other icons are arranged along the dock. Specifically the icons include 1 an icon for a phone application to make phone calls 2 an icon for an email application to view and write emails 3 an icon for a web browser to browse the Internet and 4 an icon for a music player to play music. To simplify the description only six icons are shown in the figure. However there may be many more representations of other programs e.g. applications folders etc. that execute on the mobile device .

In addition to the icons the mobile device includes several other selectable items. Namely it includes a home button and a power button . The home button can be used for several different purposes. For instance when an application is open a single selection of the home button causes the OS s home screen also referred to as a desktop in some devices to be displayed. The home button can also be used to quickly switch between different applications e.g. through a double tap operation and to open up a voice recognizing personal assistant application e.g. through a tap and hold operation . Different from the home button the power button can be used to lock the device and or place it in a standby mode. If the power button is pressed for a set period of time a user interface item e.g. a slider for turning off the device is shown on the screen in some embodiments. In the example of the home button and the power button are physical buttons. However in some other embodiments they are provided as selectable user interface items or soft buttons.

Having described the elements of the operations of making an application accessible in secondary access mode will be described by reference to the three operational stages that are shown in the figure. These operational stages will be described in conjunction with which conceptually illustrates a process that some embodiments employ to make one or more applications accessible in the secondary access mode. In some embodiments the process is performed by the privacy tools that are associated with the device s OS.

The process of begins when it receives at a touch gesture to enter the secondary access mode. The process then receives at a selection of one or more icons of applications to be available in secondary access mode. Referring back to the first stage of the mobile device is displaying the game icon the social network icon the phone icon the email icon the web browser icon and the music player icon .

The device s user can select any one of these icons to launch its corresponding application. To make the game accessible in secondary access mode the user places and holds the user s finger e.g. left thumb on the game icon . One of ordinary skill in the art would realize that the selection made with a particular finger e.g. the left thumb index finger etc. in this and other examples that are described above and below are just example selections and that the same selection can be made using any other fingers or some other selection tools e.g. stylus cursor controller remote control .

The second stage illustrates completion of the touch gesture to enter the secondary access mode. In particular the user taps or taps and holds the home button with the user s right thumb while holding or maintaining selection of the icon with the left thumb. As illustrated in the third stage the touch gesture causes the device to immediately enter the secondary access mode.

The third stage illustrates the mobile device after it has been placed into the secondary access mode. The user has let go of the game icon and the home button . In the secondary access mode only the game is exposed and every other application has been made inaccessible. Any user can open the game application by selecting the game icon now in the secondary access mode. However the remaining applications have been made private or inaccessible. For instance a person can select the social network icon but its selection will not cause the social network application to open. Similarly the person cannot launch the web browser by selecting the web browser icon from the dock .

Returning to the process creates at a private list for unselected applications that need to be protected. This may entail identifying a list of applications that are installed on the mobile device and defining a redacted list that lists applications that should be protected. In some embodiments the private list is automatically defined based on one or more applications that the device s user selects when activating the secondary access mode. For instance the user might identify several applications to share by selecting their representations e.g. application icons . The process then defines a private list that includes a group of other applications e.g. all other remaining applications that are accessible on the device .

In some embodiments the private list is defined according to the user input. That is the user of the device can choose e.g. from a list of applications which applications to keep private. For example the privacy tools of some embodiments provide a privacy settings menu that lists different applications to manually choose any number of different applications to keep private. Examples of manually defining a private list using such a privacy settings menu was described above in details by reference to . Instead of or in conjunction with the user input the private list may be a pre defined list that includes several different applications that are likely to contain private information. As an example the privacy tools of some embodiments may always retain an email application the settings menu or some other application in that private list.

After creating the private list the process hides or changes at the appearance of icons of the applications in that private list. The process then ends. In the example illustrated in the third stage of the icons of the private applications are not hidden. Instead the icons are displayed differently from the icon of the shared game application. The icons are grayed out while the icon remains the same. The grayed out icons provide a visual indication to a person that the corresponding applications are inaccessible.

In the example described above the user activates a secondary access mode through a touch gesture. The secondary access mode allows access to the shared game but prevents access to several other applications. In some embodiments the privacy tools provide a list of applications based on a different touch gesture e.g. double tapping on the selectable item while holding the application icon . The user can then use the list of applications to choose one application or multiple different applications to share. In some embodiments the user can manually create a private list that lists different applications that should be protected and then turn on the secondary access mode at any time to prevent access to the applications listed in that private list.

Also in the example described above the device on which the operating system executes has a touch screen through which a user can interact in order to make one or more applications accessible in secondary access mode. However one of ordinary skill in the art will realize that cursor controllers or some other input mechanisms can be used to make these applications accessible in secondary access mode on devices e.g. desktop computer laptop with cursors and cursor controllers or other input mechanisms e.g. remote control motion sensor .

As mentioned above the privacy tools of some embodiments allow a user of a mobile device to select one or more applications and then place the device in a secondary access mode. Several more examples of sharing applications will now be described by reference to . In particular show examples of selecting one or more applications to share using a list of applications. show examples of selecting applications to share using an affordance such as a selectable item that is displayed at least partially over each application representation.

The first stage illustrates the mobile device displaying the device s home screen page . The mobile device is the same as the one described above by reference to . The screen includes the social network icon and game icon . The screen is also overlaid by the dock . Several other icons are arranged along the dock. Specifically the icons include the phone icon the email icon the web browser icon and the music player icon .

As shown in the first stage the device s user places and holds the user s finger e.g. left thumb on the social network icon . The second stage illustrates selection of a selectable item to display the list of applications. In particular the user double taps on the home button with the user s right thumb while holding the icon with the left thumb.

The third stage illustrates the mobile device after inputting the touch gesture. The touch gesture causes the device to display the list of applications . Specifically the selection of the icon and the home button causes the screen to slide up towards the top of the screen. A representation of the list of applications then slides up into view along the bottom of the screen. In the example illustrated in the list presents each application with its application name and icon. The different applications are also presented side to side. The user can perform a touch gesture e.g. swipe the user s finger across the bottom of the screen along the area showing the list to scroll through different applications. The user can also select one or more of applications to share by tapping the user s finger on the application icons.

The third and fourth stages and illustrate selections of several applications from the list of applications . In the third stage the user taps the user s finger e.g. right index finger on the game icon to share the game application. To provide a visual indication of the selection the game icon is highlighted in the list. As shown in the fourth stage the user then taps the same finger on the phone icon to share the phone application. This causes the phone icon to be highlighted in the list. At any time the user can deselect the game or the phone applications by tapping the user s finger on the corresponding icon or .

The fifth stage illustrates the mobile device after the user has selected the applications that the user would like to share. The icons and of the selected applications are highlighted in the list of applications . To place the device in the secondary access mode the user then taps the home button with the user s finger e.g. right thumb .

The sixth stage illustrates the mobile device in the secondary access mode. Here the game and the phone applications are accessible while the social network application the email application the web browser and the music player are inaccessible. The OS provides a visual indication that the private applications are inaccessible by graying out the corresponding icons and . Instead of changing the icons appearance the privacy tools of some embodiments hide these icons.

In the example described above the list of applications is shown along the bottom of the device s screen. One of ordinary skill in the art would understand that this is just an example representation that can be presented in any number of different ways. For instance the list can be shown anywhere on the screen or even in its own window. The list can also be presented with or without the application icons. The list may also include different affordances e.g. user interface items such as check boxes buttons switches to select different applications.

In the example described above the privacy tools provide a list of applications. The user then chooses several applications to share using that list. conceptually illustrates a process that some embodiments use to display the list receive selection of applications to share from the list and place the mobile device in secondary access mode after receiving the selection. In some embodiments the process is performed by the privacy tools that are associated with the device s OS. The process starts when it receives at selection of an application. The process then receives at selection of a selectable item to display the list of applications. In the example described above by reference to the user first taps and holds any application icon. The user then taps the home button while holding the application icon. This causes the device s OS to generate a display of the list of applications.

As shown in the process receives at selection of one or more applications from the list of applications. The process then places at the mobile device in a secondary access mode. In this mode the selected applications remain accessible while several other applications are made inaccessible e.g. the remaining unselected applications in that list of applications . In the example described above by reference to the secondary access mode is started immediately after closing the list of applications.

Some embodiments perform variations of the process . The specific operations of the process may not be performed in the exact order shown and described. The specific operations may not be performed in one continuous series of operations and different specific operations may be performed in different embodiments. Furthermore the process could be implemented using several sub processes or as part of a larger macro process.

Also in the example described above the device on which the operating system executes has a touch screen through which a user can interact with to share one or more applications. However one of ordinary skill in the art will realize that cursor controllers or some other input mechanisms can be used share applications on devices e.g. desktop computer laptop with cursors and cursor controllers or other input mechanisms e.g. remote control motion sensor . In other words while the example of shows touch input through a touch sensitive screen the same or similar sharing functionality can be extended beyond a mobile device with the touch sensitive screen. For example instead of receiving selection of an application icon the process might simply receive selection e.g. a cursor click of an item e.g. a share button to display the list of applications. The user can then select applications from that list and close the list to activate the secondary access mode.

In the previous example the device s user selects multiple applications to share using a list of applications. The privacy tools of some embodiments provide affordances that can be used to choose one or more applications. provides an illustrative example of selecting multiple applications using such affordances. In this example the affordances e.g. context menu items are shown through a touch gesture e.g. when a device s user taps and holds any application icon for a set period . Five operational stages of the mobile device are illustrated in this figure. The mobile device is the same as the one described above by reference to .

The first stage illustrates the mobile device displaying the home screen . The screen includes the social network icon and game icon . The screen is also overlaid by the dock . Several other icons are arranged along the dock. Specifically the icons include the phone icon the email icon the web browser icon and the music player icon .

As illustrated in the first stage the user taps and holds the user s finger e.g. left index finger on the social network icon . The second stage shows the device after the user has held the icon for a set period of time. The touch gesture causes one or more affordances e.g. selectable items to appear near or at least partially over each application icon. For instance the game icon is displayed with a delete affordance e.g. delete button for deleting the game application and a share affordance e.g. share button for sharing the game application. In the example of the phone icon the email icon the web browser icon and the music player icon are each shown with only the share affordance and not the delete affordance . This is because these applications are pre installed applications that come with the device s OS. That is they are not applications installed by an end user of the mobile device.

The second and third stages and illustrate selections of several applications to share. In the second stage the user taps the user s finger e.g. right index finger on the share affordance that is associated with game icon . To provide a visual indication of the selection the game icon is shown as being highlighted on the screen. As shown in the third stage the user then taps the same finger on the share affordance that is associated with phone icon . This causes the phone icon to be highlighted. At any time the user can deselect the game or the phone application by tapping the user s finger on the corresponding share affordances once again.

The fourth stage illustrates the mobile device after the user has selected the applications that the user would like to share. The icons and of the selected applications are highlighted. To place the device in the secondary access mode the user then taps the home button with the user s finger e.g. right thumb .

The fifth stage illustrates the mobile device in the secondary access mode. Here the game and the phone applications are accessible while the social network application the email application the web browser and the music player are inaccessible. The OS provides a visual indication that the private applications are inaccessible by greying out the corresponding icons and . Instead of changing the icons appearance the privacy tools of some embodiments hide these icons.

In the example described above the affordances e.g. context menu items are shown when a device s user presses any application icon for a set period of time. One of ordinary skill in the art would realize that such selectable items might be shown using other gestures or other means. For example a context menu item for an application may be displayed with a single selection e.g. right cursor click in a cursor based system of the application s icon. The share affordance e.g. share buttons may be shown through a toolbar button through a menu bar item and or through a shortcut key or hotkey.

In some embodiments this method of selecting multiple different applications to share using different affordances is provided in conjunction with the feature of selecting a single application to share that is describe above by references to . That is the privacy tools of some embodiments combine these two features to provide the device s user with an option to quickly activate the secondary access mode by selecting one application or multiple different applications. In conjunction with the single application selection feature or instead of it the privacy tools of some embodiments provide different options for the user to choose multiple different applications. This provides the user with a choice in selecting multiple different applications.

The preceding example described how the privacy tools of some embodiments provide affordances that can be used to choose applications to share. conceptually illustrates a process that some embodiments employ to display such affordances e.g. context menu items receive selection of different applications using the affordances and place a device in secondary access mode after receiving the selection. In some embodiments the process is performed by the privacy tools that are associated with the device s OS.

The process begins when it receives at selection of a selectable item to display the share affordance. The process then displays at the share affordance or share tool. In the example described above by reference to the share affordance is a context menu item that is shown at least partially over each application icon. The context menu item appears over each application icon when the user taps and holds any application icon for a set period of time.

As shown in the process receives at selection of one or more applications to share using the secondary access tool. The process then places at the mobile device in the share mode. In this mode the selected applications remain accessible while several other applications are made inaccessible e.g. the remaining unselected applications in that list of applications . In the example described above by reference to the secondary access mode is started immediately after the device s user selects a selectable item e.g. the home button .

Some embodiments perform variations of the process . The specific operations of the processes may not be performed in the exact order shown and described. The specific operations may not be performed in one continuous series of operations and different specific operations may be performed in different embodiments. Furthermore the process could be implemented using several sub processes or as part of a larger macro process.

In the preceding examples and embodiments various methods that a user can select to make an application or a set of applications accessible in secondary access mode were described. Alternatively the privacy tools of some embodiments make applications available only in secondary access mode by moving the application icons to a particular folder e.g. Shared folder on the screen and only make those applications available via the particular folder.

Three operational stages of the mobile device are illustrated in this figure. The first stage presents the device while it is operating in its primary access mode. The first stage illustrates that a user has selected application icon and made it moveable. In order to make an application icon moveable in some embodiments a user places and holds the user s finger on the application icon for a set period of time. Here in the first stage the user has placed and held the user s finger in the home screen page on the application icon for a set period of time.

The second stage illustrates that the application icon has become moveable by indicating a delete sign on the top left corner of the icon. This second stage also illustrates that the user is dragging the application icon into the Shared folder in order to make the application accessible in the device s secondary access mode.

The third stage shows the mobile device operating in its secondary access mode. As shown in this stage the selection and placement of the application icon in the Shared folder has made this application along with the other two applications and accessible in the device s secondary mode.

As described above the mobile device of some embodiments allows a user of the mobile device to specify the applications that the user wants to share and the applications that the user wants to keep private when the mobile device is operating in a secondary access mode. Users often install many applications on a mobile device and thus the users are overwhelmed with iterating through each application and deciding whether to share or keep private the application for the secondary access mode. In some embodiments the mobile device automatically determines the applications to share and the applications to keep private in the secondary access mode by analyzing the applications information related to the applications and or a setting of a parameter specified by the user.

In some embodiments the secondary access mode is only accessible after the main user e.g. the owner of the device has been authenticated. Thereafter the secondary access mode can be accessed until the mode becomes inaccessible. The secondary access mode of some embodiments becomes inaccessible based on any one or more of the following the device is explicitly turned off the device is re authenticated the device is locked and the device is locked and a timeout has passed.

The second stage shows the device after the user has been authenticated. The device is displaying a home screen page on the device s touch screen display. The home page screen includes a number of icons to open different applications. The home screen page also includes an icon to open a settings menu. In the second stage the user performs a tap gesture with the user s finger on the touch screen display over the icon . The tap gesture causes the settings menu to be opened as illustrated in the third stage .

The third stage shows the device displaying a main page of the settings menu. The page includes a number of affordances to navigate to different pages e.g. sub menus . In the example of the third stage the user selects a share tab to navigate to a page with several share mode options. The fourth stage shows the page with the shared mode options. Particularly the page includes an affordance to turn on the secondary access mode. The page also includes several affordances to choose different applications to share when the secondary access mode has been turned on.

In the fourth stage the user turns on the shared mode by tapping or swiping the user s finger on or across the device s touch screen display over the affordance . As shown in the fifth stage the touch gesture causes the device to display the passcode page . The user then inputs the passcode to authenticate the user and turn on the second access mode feature. The sixth stage illustrates the device after the user has inputted the correct passcode. Specifically the affordance on the menu page shows that the secondary access mode has been turned on. The user can now select one or more of the other affordances to choose different application to share in the secondary access mode.

In the example described above the user is authenticated using a passcode. The device of some embodiments authenticates the user through any one or more of the following username and password a touch code a pattern code voice recognition and fingerprint recognition. Also in the example described above the authentication occurs both when the user unlocks the device and when the user turns on the secondary access mode feature. In some embodiments the authentication only occurs once e.g. when the device is unlocked or when the secondary access mode feature is turned . Thereafter the device can be used to access shared mode until the device is explicitly turned off the device is re authenticated the device is locked and or the device is locked and a timeout e.g. a passcode timeout has passed.

The first stage is similar to the first stage described above by reference to except the first stage shows a slider affordance for controlling a parameter that is used to determine the applications to share and the applications to keep private when the device is operating in a secondary access mode.

As shown the first stage illustrates an example of sharing a set of applications based on a parameter setting of parameter A. For this example setting 1 is used as a default setting for parameter A. In some embodiments the device analyzes the applications and the applications metadata based on the default setting of parameter A in order to determine 1 the applications to share and 2 the applications to keep private for a secondary access mode of the device . Different embodiments use any number of different techniques to determine the applications to share and the applications to keep private for the secondary access mode of the device . For example some embodiments employ a heuristic analysis technique to determine the applications to share and the applications to keep private. An example of such a technique will be described below by reference to . As shown in the first stage the device has determined to keep the music application the photos application and the phone application private and to share the web application when parameter A is set at setting 1.

The second stage illustrates an example of sharing a different set of applications based on a different parameter setting of parameter A. In this example the user has selected and moved the slider affordance e.g. by touching and dragging the slider affordance in order to modify the setting for parameter A. As shown at this stage the user has adjusted the setting for parameter A from setting 1 to setting 2.

When the device receives the modification of the setting for parameter A the device analyzes the applications and the applications metadata based on the setting of parameter A in order to determine 1 the applications to share and 2 the applications to keep private for a secondary access mode of the device . In some embodiments the same or similar techniques described above by reference to the first stage are used to make such a determination. As illustrated in the second stage the device has determined to keep the music application and the phone application private and to share the web application and the photos application when parameter A is set at setting 2.

The third stage shows another example of sharing a different set of applications based on a different parameter setting of parameter A. For this example the user has selected and moved the slider affordance e.g. by touching and dragging the slider affordance in order to modify the setting for parameter A. As illustrated at the third stage the user has adjusted the setting for parameter A from setting 2 to setting 3.

When the device receives the modification of the setting for parameter A the device analyzes the applications and the applications metadata based on the setting of parameter A in order to determine 1 the applications to share and 2 the applications to keep private for a secondary access mode of the device . In some embodiments the same or similar techniques described above by reference to the first stage are used to make such a determination. As shown in the third stage the device has determined to keep the web application private and to share the music application the photos application and the phone application when parameter A is set at setting 3.

The application distribution server is responsible for distributing applications to the client devices . The application distribution server of some embodiments is a component that is integrated with other servers that provide other functions and or services. For instance the application distribution server is integrated in some embodiments with an online digital media store e.g. iTunes provided by Apple Inc. . In some embodiments the application distribution server is implemented on a single computing device while in other embodiments the application distribution server is implemented across multiple computing devices e.g. several servers .

In some embodiments the application distribution server hosts applications that are installable on the client devices . In some embodiments the applications that the application distribution server hosts include first party applications second party applications third party applications etc. The application distribution server in some embodiments provides a service that allows users of the client devices to browse search and download applications hosted on the application distribution server .

In addition conceptually illustrates different client devices downloading different applications from the application distribution server through the network . As shown the client device is downloading Application G client device is downloading Application R client device is downloading Application A and client device is downloading Application D. Although shows the client devices downloading the respective Applications A D G and R one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the client devices may download the respective applications at the same overlapping or different times.

While shows mobile devices and tablet computing devices as client devices in an application distribution system one of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the application distribution system is not limited to such devices. For instance in some embodiments the application distribution system facilitates the distribution of applications to any number of additional and or different types of computing devices e.g. desktop computers notebook computers server computers etc. .

In addition to applications that are downloaded to the mobile device through an application distribution system the mobile device of some embodiments have applications that are pre loaded on the mobile device as part of an initial configuration of the mobile device e.g. installation of an operating system on the mobile device . In some embodiments the mobile device analyzes these applications and the applications metadata to generate additional metadata which is used for determining the applications to share and the applications to keep private for a secondary access mode of the mobile device.

In some embodiments the shared mode configurator is provided as part of a server based solution. In some such embodiments the shared mode configurator is provided via a thin client. That is the shared mode configurator runs on a server while a user interacts with the shared mode configurator via a separate machine remote from the server. In other such embodiments the shared mode configurator is provided as a thick client. That is the shared mode configurator is distributed from the server to the client machine and runs on the client machine.

As illustrated in the shared mode configurator includes an application distribution client an application manager an application ranking module a metadata preprocessor and a dynamic metadata processor . The shared mode configurator also includes applications storage application metadata storage and application rankings storage .

The applications storage stores applications that are operable on the mobile device and may be shared or kept private for a secondary access mode of the mobile device. The application metadata storage stores metadata e.g. genres to which applications are classified age restrictions for the applications rating operating requirements version information file size of the application reviews entitlements that the applications utilizes etc. that describes the applications stored in the storage . In some embodiments the application s metadata includes metadata specified by a developer of the application. The application rankings storage stores rankings for the applications that is used by the shared mode configurator in determining the applications to share and the applications to keep private for the secondary access mode of the mobile device.

In some embodiments the storages are implemented in one physical storage while in other embodiments the storages are implemented on separate physical storages. Still in some embodiments some or all of the storages are implemented across several physical storages.

The application distribution client handles applications that the user of the mobile device downloads to and installs on the mobile device. In some embodiments the application distribution client interfaces with an application distribution server e.g. the application distribution server described above and below by reference to and receives the applications that the user specifies to be downloaded to and installed on the mobile device.

The application manager is responsible for managing applications for the shared mode e.g. a secondary access mode of the mobile device. In some embodiments the applications that the application manager manages include applications that are downloaded to and installed on the mobile device which the application manager receives from the application distribution client as well as applications that are pre loaded on the mobile device as part of an initial configuration of the mobile device e.g. installation of an operating system on the mobile device .

To manage applications for the shared mode of the mobile device the application manager of some embodiments uses the metadata preprocessor the application ranking module and the dynamic metadata processor to facilitate in initial processing of application metadata dynamic processing of application metadata and ranking of applications. Such processing of the applications and the application metadata allow the shared mode configurator to determine the applications to share and the applications to keep private for the shared mode of the mobile device.

The metadata preprocessor processes the applications metadata. In some embodiments the metadata preprocessor is directed by the application manager to perform an initial processing of the applications metadata when the application manager receives the applications which the application manager receives from the application distribution client . The initial preprocessing of some embodiments for a particular application includes identifying metadata from the application metadata of the particular application analyzing the metadata and or the particular application itself to generate additional metadata for the particular application and storing in the application metadata storage the identified metadata and any additional metadata generated for the application. In some embodiments the metadata preprocessor analyzes a subset of the particular application s metadata while in other embodiments the metadata preprocessor analyzes all of the particular application s metadata in order to generate additional metadata for the particular application.

Different embodiments of the metadata preprocessor use any number of different techniques to generate additional metadata for applications that the shared mode configurator uses to determine which applications to share and which applications to keep private for the secondary access mode of the mobile device. For instance in some embodiments the metadata preprocessor generates additional metadata for an application by 1 analyzing the application to identify defined linked libraries e.g. libraries associated with key chains data encryption or any other type of security features that the application uses and 2 generating metadata for the application indicating that the application uses such linked libraries. Another technique that the metadata preprocessor of some embodiments uses to generate additional metadata involves 1 analyzing the application to identify defined classes of data encryption and or encryption levels that the application uses for managing data and 2 generating metadata for the application indicating that the application uses such classes of data encryption and or encryption levels. Additional and or different techniques are used in some embodiments.

The dynamic metadata processor handles the processing of application metadata for applications after the metadata preprocessor performs an initial processing of the applications metadata. In some embodiments the application manager directs the dynamic metadata processor to processing applications metadata at defined interval e.g. once every hour day week month etc. . Alternatively or in conjunction with processing application s metadata at defined intervals the application manager of some embodiments directs the dynamic metadata processor to processing applications metadata based on defined events and or conditions. Examples of events and or conditionals include when applications are updated modifications or changes to certain metadata of applications etc.

In some embodiments the dynamic metadata processor processes metadata of a particular application by analyzing the existing metadata of the particular application generating additional metadata for the particular application based on the analysis and storing with the existing metadata of the particular application in the application metadata storage any additional metadata generated for the application.

The dynamic metadata processor of different embodiments uses any number of different techniques to generate additional metadata for applications that the shared mode configurator uses to determine which applications to share and which applications to keep private for the secondary access mode of the mobile device. In some embodiments the dynamic metadata processor uses the techniques described above by reference to the metadata preprocessor to generate additional metadata for an application. That is the dynamic metadata processor of some embodiments generates additional metadata for an application by 1 analyzing the application to identify defined linked libraries e.g. libraries associated with key chains data encryption or any other type of security features that the application uses and 2 generating metadata for the application indicating that the application uses such linked libraries and or by 1 analyzing the application to identify defined classes of data encryption and or encryption levels that the application uses for managing data and 2 generating metadata for the application indicating that the application uses such classes of data encryption and or encryption levels. Additional and or different techniques are used in some embodiments.

The application ranking module ranks the applications in order to assist the shared mode configurator in determining the applications to share and the applications to keep private in the shared mode of the mobile device. In some embodiments the application ranking module ranks the applications based on the applications metadata and analysis of the applications. An example technique for ranking applications is described below by reference to . Once the application ranking module ranks the applications the application ranking module stores the rankings in the application rankings storage .

An example operation of the shared mode configurator will now be described by reference to which conceptually illustrates a process of some embodiments for processing applications for a shared mode. In some embodiments the shared mode configurator performs the process when the shared mode configurator performs processing of metadata for an application e.g. when the application distribution client receives an application when the application manager determines to process metadata for an application at a defined interval or upon defined events and or conditions etc. .

The process begins when the application manager identifies at an application and the application metadata. In some embodiments the application manager identifies the application when the application manager receives the application from the application distribution client e.g. due to the user of the mobile device specifying the application to download to and install on the mobile device or when the application manager determines to process metadata for an application at a defined interval or upon defined events and or conditions.

Next the application manager determines at whether to preprocess the application metadata of the application. In some embodiments the application manager determines to preprocess the application s metadata when the application is received at the shared mode configurator and the application has not been processed by the shared mode configurator e.g. the application manager receives the application from the application distribution client .

When the application manager determines to preprocess the application s metadata the application manager directs the metadata preprocessor to preprocess at the application s metadata. Otherwise the application manager determines at whether to dynamically process the application metadata of the application. In some embodiments the application manager determines to dynamically process the application s metadata based on a defined interval or upon defined events and or conditions as described above.

When the application manager determines to dynamically process the application s metadata the application manager directs the dynamic metadata processor to process at the application s metadata and then proceeds to . Otherwise the application manager proceeds to .

At the application manager instructs the application ranking module to rank the application. In some embodiments the application ranking module ranks the applications based on the application s metadata and analysis of the application. An example technique for ranking applications is described below by reference to .

Finally the application ranking module stores at the rankings in the application rankings storage and the metadata preprocessor and or the dynamic metadata processor stores the application s metadata in the application metadata storage .

While many of the features in this example have been described as being performed by one module e.g. the application manager the application ranking module etc. one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the functions might be split up into multiple modules. Similarly the functions described as being performed by multiple different modules in this example might be performed by a single module in some embodiments e.g. the metadata preprocessor might be part of the dynamic metadata processor .

Different embodiments of the application ranking module are implemented differently. For instance the application ranking module of some embodiments is implemented as a stand alone application. In some embodiments the application ranking module is integrated into another application e.g. the shared mode configurator described above by reference to while in other embodiments the application ranking module might be implemented within an operating system e.g. iOS provided by Apple Inc. .

In some embodiments the application ranking module is provided as part of a server based solution. The application ranking module of some such embodiments is provided via a thin client. That is the application ranking module runs on a server while a user interacts with the application ranking module via a separate machine remote from the server. In other such embodiments the application ranking module is provided as a thick client. That is the application ranking module is distributed from the server to the client machine and runs on the client machine.

As shown in the application ranking module includes an application ranking manager a heuristics engine and application attribute processors . The application ranking module also includes applications storage application metadata storage and application rankings storage . In some embodiments the storages are similar to the corresponding storages described above by reference to . In other words the applications storage stores applications that are operable on the mobile device and may be shared or kept private for a secondary access mode of the mobile device the application metadata storage stores metadata e.g. genres to which applications are classified age restrictions for the applications entitlements that the applications utilize etc. that describes the applications stored in the storage and the application rankings storage stores rankings for the applications that is used e.g. by the shared mode configurator described above by reference to to determine the applications to share and the applications to keep private for the secondary access mode of the mobile device.

Similarly the storages of some embodiments are implemented in one physical storage while the storages of other embodiments are implemented on separate physical storages. Still in some embodiments some or all of the storages are implemented across several physical storages.

In some embodiments the application ranking manager is responsible for managing the rankings of applications which are used for determining the applications to share and the applications to keep private for the secondary access mode of the mobile device. The applications of which the application ranking manager manages the ranking include the applications that are managed by the application manager described above by reference to . That is these applications include applications that are downloaded to and installed on the mobile device and applications that are pre loaded on the mobile device as part of an initial configuration of the mobile device e.g. installation of an operating system on the mobile device .

The application ranking manager of some embodiments employs the heuristics engine in ranking the applications. In some embodiments the application ranking manager 1 receives heuristic measures from the heuristics engine for a particular application for which the application ranking manager is determining a ranking and 2 uses the heuristic measures to determine a ranking for the application. In some embodiments a ranking e.g. a score or value for an application represents a likelihood that the application is shared or kept private. For instance applications that have high rankings are more likely to be shared compared to applications that have low rankings A ranking for an application in some embodiments represents a likelihood that the application is shared or kept private relative to other applications based on the rankings of the other applications. For example if all the applications have high rankings the applications that have higher rankings among those high ranking applications are more likely to be shared compared to the applications that have lower rankings among those high ranking applications.

In some embodiments the application ranking manager determines different rankings for each application to use for different approaches e.g. the approaches described above by reference to of specifying and or determining applications to share and applications to keep private for a secondary access mode. For instance in some embodiments the application ranking manager determines for each application a general ranking e.g. used for the approaches described above by reference to a ranking based on an age group parameter e.g. used for the approaches described above by reference to and a ranking based on a relationship closeness parameter e.g. used for the approaches described above by reference to .

The heuristics engine determines heuristic measures for applications when the heuristics engine receives requests from the application ranking manager to provide heuristics measures to the application ranking manager . In some embodiments the heuristics engine receives a request from the application ranking manager that specifies an application for which to determine heuristic measures and in some cases a setting for a parameter on which to determine the heuristic measures for the application.

Based on the specified application the heuristics engine accesses the application in the applications storage and the application s metadata in the application metadata storage . The heuristics engine then uses some or all the application attribute processors to 1 process metadata related to different attributes of the application and or the application itself and 2 provide attribute information for the heuristics engine . When the heuristics engine receives attribute information back from the application attribute processors the heuristics engine determines heuristic measures for the application based on the processing information and passes the heuristic measures for the application to the application ranking manager .

The application attribute processors generate attribute information based on attributes of an application. In some embodiments the attribute information includes a heuristic measure e.g. a set of scores or values that represents the likelihood that users might want to share the application based on the attribute of the application for which the application attribute processor is generating information.

In this example the application attribute processor generates attribute information based on genres to which the application is classified the application attribute processor generates attribute information based on age restrictions for the application the application attribute processor generates attribute information based on entitlements that the applications utilizes the application attribute processor generates attribute information based on linked libraries that the application uses the application attribute processor generates attribute information based on classes of data encryption and or encryption levels that the application uses to manage data and the application attribute processor generates attribute information based on other attribute s of the application.

In some embodiments each of the application attribute processors generates corresponding attribute information based on the application s metadata that is related to the attribute other metadata of the application and or the application itself. For instance the genre processor of some embodiments generates genre information related to an application based on metadata specifying the genre to which the application belongs and metadata specifying the age restriction of the application since users might want to share some genres of applications and keep other genres of applications private e.g. share games and keep private finance applications and share some applications within a genre restricted for one age group and keep private some applications within the genre for another age group e.g. share games for ages 5 and up and keep private games for ages 21 and up .

An example operation of the application ranking module will now be described by reference to which conceptually illustrates a process of some embodiments for ranking an application based on heuristics. In some embodiments the application ranking module performs the process when the application ranking module determines a ranking for an application.

The process starts when the application ranking manager determines a ranking for an application by identifying at 1 the application for which the application ranking manager is determining a ranking and 2 the application s metadata. As explained above when the application ranking manager determines a ranking for an application the application ranking manager of some embodiments sends a request to the heuristics engine that specifies the application for which to determine heuristic measures and in some cases a setting for a parameter on which to determine the heuristic measures for the application.

When the heuristics engine receives the request from the application ranking manager the heuristics engine identifies at the parameter setting for the parameter specified in the request. In cases where the request does not specify a setting for a parameter the process proceeds to .

Next the heuristics engine identifies at an application attribute to process. In some embodiments the heuristics engine selects an attribute for which one of the application attribute processors is generating information and passes the application s metadata that is related to the attribute other metadata of the application and or the application itself to the application attribute processor that is responsible for generating information for the application attribute.

The application attribute processor then determines at a heuristic measure for the application attribute based on the information received from the heuristics engine e.g. the application s metadata other metadata of the application and or the application itself and the parameter settings in cases where a parameter setting is specified in the request. The application attribute processor generates the heuristic measure using any number of the techniques described above and returns the heuristic measure to the heuristics engine .

Next the heuristics engine determines at whether any application attribute is left to process. When the heuristics engine determines that an application attribute is left to process the heuristics engine returns to to continue processing any remaining application attributes. Otherwise the heuristics engine returns the heuristic measures to the application ranking manager .

Finally the application ranking manager determines a ranking for the application based on the heuristic measures that the application ranking manager received from the heuristics engine . Different embodiments of the application ranking manager use any number of different methods to determine a ranking for the application based on the heuristic measures. For instance in some embodiments the application ranking manager uses an average of the heuristic measures a weighted average of the heuristic measures etc.

While many of the features in this example have been described as being performed by one module e.g. the application ranking manager one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the functions might be split up into multiple modules. Similarly the functions described as being performed by multiple different modules in this example might be performed by a single module in some embodiments e.g. the application attribute processors might be part of the heuristics engine .

Different embodiments of the application distribution server are implemented differently. For instance in some embodiments the application distribution server is implemented as a stand alone application. The application distribution server of some embodiments is integrated into another application while the application distribution server of other embodiments might be implemented within an operating system. In addition the application distribution server of some embodiments is implemented on a single computing device while the application distribution server of other embodiments is implemented across several computing devices e.g. several servers .

In some embodiments the application distribution server is provided as part of a server based solution. In some such embodiments the application distribution server is provided via a thin client. That is the application distribution server runs on a server while a user interacts with the application distribution server via a separate machine remote from the server. In other such embodiments the application distribution server is provided as a thick client. That is the application distribution server is distributed from the server to the client machine and runs on the client machine.

As illustrated in the application distribution server includes a metadata identifier a metadata manager and a metadata processor . The application distribution server also includes applications storage and application metadata storage .

The applications storage stores applications that the application distribution server hosts and distributes to client devices The application metadata storage stores metadata e.g. genres to which applications are classified age restrictions for the applications rating operating requirements version information file size of the application reviews entitlements that the applications utilizes etc. that describes the applications stored in the storage . In some embodiments the application s metadata includes metadata specified by a developer of the application. In some embodiments the storages and are implemented in one physical storage while in other embodiments the storages and are implemented on separate physical storages. Still in some embodiments some or all of the storages and are implemented across several physical storages.

The metadata manager handles the management of metadata for applications stored in the applications storage . In some embodiments the applications for which the metadata manager manages metadata include applications developed by first party developers second party developers and third party developers. To manage metadata for applications the metadata manager of some embodiments uses the metadata identifier and the metadata processor to facilitate in identifying metadata for applications and processing the applications metadata.

The metadata identifier is responsible for identifying metadata associated with an application. In some embodiments when the metadata identifier receives the application and the application s metadata from the metadata manager the metadata identifier examines the application s metadata identifies all or a subset of the metadata in the application s metadata and stores the identified metadata in the application metadata storage .

The metadata processor processes applications metadata. In some embodiments when the metadata processor receives a request to process metadata for an application from the metadata manager the metadata processor analyzes the application s metadata and or the application itself to generate additional metadata for the application and stores in the application metadata storage any additional metadata generated for the application. In some embodiments the metadata processor analyzes a subset of the application s metadata while in other embodiments the metadata processor analyzes all of the application s metadata in order to generate additional metadata for the application.

An example operation of the application distribution server will now be described by reference to which conceptually illustrates a process of some embodiments for processing applications and application metadata. In some embodiments the application distribution server performs the process when the application distribution server receives an application and the application s metadata.

The process starts when the metadata manager receives an application and the application s metadata by identifying at 1 the application for which the metadata manager is processing metadata and 2 the application s metadata. The metadata manager passes the application s metadata to the metadata identifier .

Next the metadata identifier identifies at defined metadata from the application s metadata. As mentioned above the metadata identifier of some embodiments identifies all or a subset of the metadata from the application s metadata. The metadata identifier then passes the identified metadata to the metadata manager which in turn passes the identified metadata to the metadata processor .

The metadata processor then processes at the identified metadata in order to generate additional metadata for the application. In some embodiments the metadata processor processes the identified metadata by analyzing the identified metadata and or the application itself to generate additional metadata for the application. Once the metadata processor processes the application s metadata the metadata processor sends to the metadata manager the application s metadata and any additional metadata generated for the application.

Next the metadata manager associates at the additional metadata with the application and then stores at the application s metadata and the additional metadata in the application metadata storage . The process then ends.

While many of the features in this example have been described as being performed by one module e.g. the metadata manager one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the functions might be split up into multiple modules. Similarly the functions described as being performed by multiple different modules in this example might be performed by a single module in some embodiments e.g. the metadata identifier might be part of the metadata processor .

In some embodiments the processes described above are implemented as software running on a particular machine such as a computer or a handheld device or stored in a machine readable medium. conceptually illustrates a software architecture of the privacy tools of some embodiments. In this example the privacy tools are implemented within an operating system OS . However the privacy tools may be part of their own standalone application or are integrated into another application.

The user interaction components are different frameworks that manager how a person can interact with the mobile computing device. That is they are the interface via which different commands are received from users through different input devices e.g. keyboard trackpad touchpad mouse accelerometer gyroscope etc. . The user interaction components may include a touch framework for receiving different types of touch gestures and a motion framework for receiving different types of motion based gestures. For example the present application illustrates the use of a finger in the graphical user interface to control e.g. select move objects in the graphical user interface. However in some embodiments objects in the graphical user interface can also be controlled or manipulated through other controls such as cursor control. In some embodiments touch control through finger input is implemented through an input device that can detect the presence and location of touch on a display of the device. An example of such a device is a touch screen device. In some embodiments with touch control a user can directly manipulate objects by interacting with the graphical user interface that is displayed on the display of the touch screen device. For instance a user can select a particular object in the graphical user interface by simply touching that particular object on the display of the touch screen device. As such when touch control is utilized a cursor may not even be provided for enabling selection of an object of a graphical user interface in some embodiments. However when a cursor is provided in a graphical user interface touch control can be used to control the cursor in some embodiments.

In some embodiments the privacy tools allow the user to share one or more applications using voice commands. For example the device may be placed into the secondary access mode with the user stating aloud through the device s microphone the name of the voice control application and the command to enter the share mode. As another example the user can say the name of the voice control application followed by a command to share one or more applications share phone share map and phone . Upon detecting such command the device is then immediately placed in the secondary access mode with those one or more applications being accessible and several other applications being inaccessible. To facilitate such voice interaction the user interaction components of some embodiments includes one or more voice control components. The voice control components may be a part of a speech recognition program. The speech recognition program of some embodiments executes on the mobile computing device to act as an intelligent personal assistant for the user. In some embodiments the speech recognition program identifies certain keywords or terms such as its name and the word share enter share mode etc. The speech recognition program then navigates through its knowledgebase to either place the device in the secondary access mode or place the device in the secondary access mode with one or more applications stated aloud by the device s user.

The home screen manager is responsible for the presentation of different applications. The home screen manager of some embodiments manages organizing different application icons on the screen changing of background wallpaper color or pattern and launching applications. For example the home screen manager may analyze one or more directories e.g. application lists to display applications on the home screen e.g. including the dock .

The private list creator manages creation and modification of a private list. The private list may be created dynamically based on the device s user interaction with different selectable items. When the secondary access mode has been activated the access controller iterates through the private list to identify applications that need to be protected. The access controller then interfaces with the home screen manger to make the identified application inaccessible. For example the access controller may interface with the home screen manger to make the corresponding application icon functionless. That is the selection of such an icon will not cause the corresponding application to be opened. The access controller may also interface with the home screen manager to change the of the application icons or hides those icons.

When the secondary access mode has been activated the access controller iterates through the private list to identify applications that need to be made accessible. The access controller then interfaces with the home screen manger to make the identified application accessible. The access controller may also interface with the home screen manager to restore the appearance of the application icons or unhide those icons.

While many of the features of privacy tools have been described as being performed by one module e.g. the home screen manager the access controller one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the functions described herein might be split up into multiple modules. Similarly functions described as being performed by multiple different modules might be performed by a single module in some embodiments.

In many of the examples described above the device s user performs a touch gesture to select different applications to share or protect. The user also directs the device to operate in the secondary access mode through a touch gesture or a motion based gesture. For example the user taps and holds an application icon to display a context menu item for sharing the corresponding application. Alternatively the user taps and holds the application icon and then taps a selectable item e.g. the home button to open the list of applications. In other examples the user rotates the mobile computing devices or presses e.g. triple taps the selectable item to direct the device to operate in the secondary access mode. One of ordinary skill in the art would understand that these are just example gestures and that other gestures can be used to perform the same functions. For example instead of rotating the computing device the device can be placed face down or face up on a surface the device can flipped or any other motion based gestures that can be detected through one or more orientation motion detecting components of the computing device such as a gyroscope and an accelerometer. In addition the different touch gestures e.g. single tap double tap single tap tap and hold i.e. press drag pinch stretch press rotate etc. can be interchanged to provide similar functionality. For example instead of triple tapping the home button a secondary access mode session may be initiated through a different touch gesture that can be detected through the device s touch screen.

Also in many of the examples above the device on which the operating system executes has a touch screen through which a user can interact with to share applications. However one of ordinary skill in the art will realize that cursor controllers or other input devices can be used to interact with the controls shown in these examples for other embodiments that execute on devices with cursors and cursor controllers or other input mechanisms e.g. voice control remote control motion sensor . For instance instead of pressing an application icon to display the context menu item the privacy tools might allow the user to right click on the icon. The privacy tools of some embodiments might allow the user to use a keyboard in combination with a cursor controller. For instance instead of selecting only the application icon the privacy tools of some embodiments might allow the user select the icon in combination with a hotkey or a shortcut key. Also the mobile computing device may have a motion sensing input component that tracks movement of objects e.g. the person s hand in the real world through infrared projector and camera or some other means.

Furthermore many of the examples described above refer to controls e.g. soft buttons that are part of the mobile computing device s operating system or physical controls e.g. the home button the power button that are attached to the computing device. One of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the different types of controls can be interchanged to provide the same functionalities. For example the home button or the power button may be provided as a soft button that is shown on the OS s home screen dock and or taskbar. Similarly a new share button to enter the share mode may be provided as either or both a physical button or a soft button.

Many of the above described features and applications are implemented as software processes that are specified as a set of instructions recorded on a computer readable storage medium also referred to as computer readable medium . When these instructions are executed by one or more computational or processing unit s e.g. one or more processors cores of processors or other processing units they cause the processing unit s to perform the actions indicated in the instructions. Examples of computer readable media include but are not limited to CD ROMs flash drives random access memory RAM chips hard drives erasable programmable read only memories EPROMs electrically erasable programmable read only memories EEPROMs etc. The computer readable media does not include carrier waves and electronic signals passing wirelessly or over wired connections.

In this specification the term software is meant to include firmware residing in read only memory or applications stored in magnetic storage which can be read into memory for processing by a processor. In addition in some embodiments multiple software inventions can be implemented as sub parts of a larger program while remaining distinct software inventions. In some embodiments multiple software inventions can also be implemented as separate programs. Finally any combination of separate programs that together implement a software invention described here is within the scope of the invention. In some embodiments the software programs when installed to operate on one or more electronic systems define one or more specific machine implementations that execute and perform the operations of the software programs.

The peripherals interface is coupled to various sensors and subsystems including a camera subsystem a wireless communication subsystem s an audio subsystem an I O subsystem etc. The peripherals interface enables communication between the processing units and various peripherals. For example an orientation sensor e.g. a gyroscope and an acceleration sensor e.g. an accelerometer is coupled to the peripherals interface to facilitate orientation and acceleration functions.

The camera subsystem is coupled to one or more optical sensors e.g. a charged coupled device CCD optical sensor a complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS optical sensor etc. . The camera subsystem coupled with the optical sensors facilitates camera functions such as image and or video data capturing. The wireless communication subsystem serves to facilitate communication functions. In some embodiments the wireless communication subsystem includes radio frequency receivers and transmitters and optical receivers and transmitters not shown in . These receivers and transmitters of some embodiments are implemented to operate over one or more communication networks such as a GSM network a Wi Fi network a Bluetooth network etc. The audio subsystem is coupled to a speaker to output audio. Additionally the audio subsystem is coupled to a microphone to facilitate voice enabled functions such as voice recognition digital recording etc.

The I O subsystem involves the transfer between input output peripheral devices such as a display a touch screen etc. and the data bus of the processing units through the peripherals interface .
