Embodiments disclosed herein are related to systems and methods for checking a user into a location using a specific sequence of packets that may include information identifying the location.

Due to the increase in use of mobile devices and the improved networking and online capabilities of these mobile devices merchants having physical brick and mortar storefronts may also have mechanisms for delivering advertisements and other information to the mobile devices while a user of the mobile device is in the merchant store. Some merchants may take advantage of platforms and services that allow a user to check in to the merchant or other location that they are in to deliver advertisements specials and other information. This allows the merchant to know that the user is at the store and provide specials and other information to the user. If the user is checking in via a social network the user may also provide feedback about the merchant which may be useful or helpful for the merchant. If the user is checking in via a payment processing service such as provided by PayPal Inc. or San Jose Calif. the user may be provided with options for selecting ordering and paying for items through the payment processing service when checking in providing convenience for both the user and the merchant. In theory checking provides benefits for both the user and the merchant. However the users may have to perform the tedious process of checking in every time that they visit the merchant. And if the user does not check in on every visit then neither the user nor the merchant are fully benefits from checking in.

In the following description specific details are set forth describing certain embodiments. It will be apparent however to one skilled in the art that the disclosed embodiments may be practiced without some or all of these specific details.

In some embodiments to reduce the number of packet sequences needed to cover each location the packet sequences may correspond to a particular geographic location such as a square mile zone improvement plan ZIP code city country time zone and the like. Consequently for each geographic location every location or merchant in that geographic location having beacon that may be used to automatically check in user having client computing device has a unique and specific packet sequence. In such embodiments a global positioning system GPS transceiver or other location determining component in client computing device could be used to determine a fine or rough location of client computing device and the geographic location of the location or merchant that user is at and this location could be sent to remote server along with the check in request so that remote server identifies the location for checking in based on the packet sequence and the geographic location. Similarly other ways of partitioning locations to reduce the number of packet sequences needed may be used. In some embodiments the flow shown in may be repeated for each location having beacons that transmit a specific and unique packet sequence such that client computing device may check in to each location based on the received packet sequence.

Once remote server has checked user in to the location remote server may provide an identity of the merchant associated with beacon for user to review to ensure that they are checking in to the desired merchant or location. User may then send a confirmation to remote server . When remote server receives the confirmation any actions associated with the check in may be completed. Such actions may include authorizing payments to a merchant or location with such payments being processed by remote server . Such actions may also include receiving offers specials coupons and the like for use at the merchant or location at which beacon is installed or otherwise associated with. In some embodiments the flow shown in may be repeated for each location having beacons that transmit a specific and unique packet sequence such that client computing device may be prompted to check in to a location in each location based on the received packet sequence.

Once remote server has checked user in to the location remote server may provide an identity of the merchant associated with beacon for user to review to ensure that they are checking in to the desired merchant or location. User may then send a confirmation to remote server . When remote server receives the confirmation any actions associated with the check in may be completed. Such actions may include authorizing payments to a merchant or location with such payments being processed by remote server . Such actions may also include receiving offers specials coupons and the like for use at the merchant or location at which beacon is installed or otherwise associated with. Remote server may then send client computing device a message requesting permission for automatically checking user in whenever user is at the location. When user accepts or enrolls in an automatic check in remote server may send the specific sequence of packets that correspond to the location to client computing device . Client computing device may then store the specific sequence of packets in any of memory . Consequently the next time user having client computing device arrives at or enters the same location when client computing device receives the specific sequence of packets sent by beacon processing component of client computing device may match the received sequence to the specific sequence stored in any of memories and automatically execute a check in protocol to send a check in request to remote server when the received sequence matches the stored sequence. In some embodiments the flow shown in may be repeated for each location having beacons that transmit a specific and unique packet sequence such that any of memories of client computing device may store a specific and unique sequence for each location enabling user having client computing device to automatically check in to each location based on the received packet sequence.

When processing component determines that the received packet sequence matches a stored packet sequence network interface component of client computing device may execute a check in protocol and send a check in request . When processing component determines that the received packet sequence does not match a stored packet sequence client computing device may execute a check in protocol and send a check in request . In some embodiments the packet sequence may have instructions that may be executed by processing component of client computing device and may cause client computing device to perform an action such as executing a check in protocol sending a check in request and or executing check in application . In some embodiments the check in request may be sent to remote server . Client computing device may receive an identification of the location that they are checking in to allowing user to confirm or deny the check in request. When user does not confirm the location to which they are attempting to check in process may terminate or end . When user confirms the location client computing device may send a confirmation to remote server . Client computing device may then receive a notification that an action has been completed . In some embodiments the completed action may be a successful check in and or the authorization of a payment completion of a transaction a receipt of an offer and the like. Moreover the completed action may be additional location specific features such as previously described.

After the action has been completed client computing device may receive a request for permission to automatically check in at the location on future visits . When user grants permission client computing device may send a permission grant . Client computing device may then receive a packet sequence that is specific to that location and store the location specific packet sequence in one of memories . Consequently the next time user visits that location with client computing device user may receive a packet sequence from beacon and automatically execute a check in protocol and send a check in request . In some embodiments beacon as referred to with respect to process may refer to a BLE beacon. Moreover information sent from and received at client computing device in process may be information sent in response to instructions executed by processing component and sent from and received by at least one of network interface component and wireless transceiver .

Processing component of remote server may attempt to match the received packet sequence to a particular location and check user in to the location based on a matching packet sequence . In some embodiments particular locations may have a packet sequence that identifies that particular location and may be saved in account database and or databases . Processing component may attempt to match the received packet sequence to one of the saved locations and check user in to the matching location. Remote server may then send an identity of the location or merchant for confirmation purposes . When remote server does not receive a confirmation process may end or terminate . When remote server receives a confirmation remote server may complete an action . In some embodiments completing an action may include processing a payment or authorizing a payment checking user in to the location or merchant or sending an offer and the like to client computing device . Information sent from and received at remote server in process may be information sent in response to instructions executed by processing component and sent from and received by at least one of network interface component and wireless transceiver .

However when user is not automatically enrolled in automatic check ins at this location remote server may send a request for permission to automatically check in at the location . When user does not grant permission remote server may proceed to match the received sequence to the particular location and check user in at the location . However when user grants permission and enrolls in automatic check ins at the location remote server may send a specific packet sequence to client computing device . In some embodiments the packet sequence may comprise a sequence of packets having a small packet size which in some embodiments may be 32 bits having a predetermined time therebetween and may include instructions for execution by processing component of client computing device . The packet sequence may also include information in the packets that is specific to the location and may be used to identify the location. Moreover the packet sequence may be stored by client computing device and may be used to automatically check in at a location as the packet sequence may match a packet sequence transmitted by a BLE beacon at that location. Information sent from and received at remote server in process may be information sent in response to instructions executed by processing component and sent from and received by at least one of network interface component and wireless transceiver .

Software in accordance with the present disclosure such as program code and or data may be stored on one or more machine readable mediums including non transitory machine readable medium.
