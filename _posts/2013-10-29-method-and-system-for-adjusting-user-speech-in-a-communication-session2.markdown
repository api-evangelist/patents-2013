The subject disclosure relates to a method and system for adjusting user speech in a communication session.

Communication systems are utilized for providing content to end user devices during communication sessions. The content can be of various types such as voice video and or data and can be of various formats. These formats can depend on a number of different factors including device capability and network capability. Not every one of the formats is suitable for each user and users often have preferences as to how content is to be presented.

The subject disclosure describes among other things illustrative embodiments of systems and methods for providing accessibility adjustments for one or more users via adjustments to content such as various user input including user speech images and or text as well as other content. The accessibility adjustments can be based on detected or determined impairments e.g. hearing vision speech cognitive motor skill and so forth and or can be based on other factors such as user preferences. In one or more embodiments user preferences and accessibility requirements can be identified e.g. in the Core Network via accessibility profile tools. In other embodiments media can be dynamically adapted to satisfy or address other issues such as environmental conditions. In one or more embodiments communications occur between users and a multimedia accessibility platform e.g. an application server in the core network such as an IMS core network can adapt content to meet user s desires. The adapted content can then be provided to the end user device for presentation to the user as part of the communication session.

In one or more embodiments the communication session can be monitored to detect unclear words in user speech so that all or a portion of the unclear word can be adjusted so that the adjusted unclear word is clear to the intended recipient during the communication session. The identification of the unclear word can be performed utilizing speech recognition. In one or more embodiments user profiles can be accessed to facilitate the identification of unclear words such as profile information indicating a user s propensity to drop syllables from the ends of words or a user s accent. In one or more embodiments categories of problematic words sounds letters vowels consonants and so forth for a user can be identified in the user s profile to facilitate determining the unclear words. As an example a user s profile can identify that the user has a speech impairment resulting in a difficult time pronouncing the letter s. This impairment information can be used in conjunction with the speech recognition to identify unclear words in which the user was unable to sufficiently pronounce the s letter. In one embodiment libraries that are customized for speech impairments can be accessed such as a library that maps audio with a dropped syllable or with an unpronounced s letter to the corresponding word.

In one or more embodiments adaptation functions can take into consideration network capabilities and device capabilities and or network conditions. In one or more embodiments an API can be provided to expose functionality to 3rd party developers. In one or more embodiments the multimedia accessibility platform architecture can be based on a USP platform. The adaptation functionality can be provided on its own or in an existing application server e.g. TAS or PS . Various accessibility adjustments can be performed including all or a portion of an unclear word being replaced e.g. by synthesized or recorded speech selective speech frequency amplification e.g. a hearing aid in the cloud speech to text conversion speech to sign language conversion sign language to speech conversion text adaptation e.g. enlargement font change color change and so forth text to speech conversion closed captioning auditory amplification in the range of music frequencies color blindness adaptation physical interfacing adaptation epilepsy triggering prevention modifications e.g. removal of selected stimuli from the content that is associated with an epilepsy trigger input output device capability enhancements core network intelligence considerations. In one or more embodiments multiple adaptations can be performed for individuals on both the transmitting and receiving sides of a communication session or connection. For example a user could be provided with speech amplification in addition to closed captioning.

The processor can present the adjusted user input at the first end user device.

Server can determine accessibility requirements or desires of one or both the users . Server can execute various processing functions e.g. text audio video and so forth to implement accessibility adaptation. The accessibility adaptation can include adjustment of the multimedia content adjusting the presentation of the multimedia content or otherwise making adjustments associated with the presentation of the multimedia content to facilitate the accessibility by the user to the content. In one or more embodiments adjustments to the content e.g. user speech music graphics and so forth can be made and provided to the end user device in a timely manner as part of the communication session so that any conversation or communication exchange is not disrupted.

As one example the server can monitor for and identify unclear words during a communication session and replace all or a portion of the unclear word with audio content e.g. synthesized and or recorded speech as part of the communication session. The replacement of the unclear word or a portion thereof can be performed in a timely fashion so that the communication session is uninterrupted. Server can also use a combination of adjusting a portion of an unclear word along with replacing an entire unclear word. The identification of the unclear word can be based on speech recognition that can take advantage of personalized libraries associated one or more of the users. In one or more embodiments previous communication sessions of a user can be monitored and data can be collected to identify a propensity of the user to speak unclear words. For instance speech impairment information can be collected for a user that indicates words syllables letters and so forth that the user has difficulty pronouncing.

As another example the server can access one or more profiles associated with one or more of the first user the second user and or one or both of the end user devices. These profiles can include various profile information and or profiling tools associated with speech auditory visual and or cognitive information or data for the user s . In one or more embodiments the server can also access user preferences for one or both of the first and second users so that the preferences can be utilized in the accessibility adaptation.

Server can address a number of different accessibility impairments or issues including mild hearing loss e.g. via speech frequency amplification severe hearing loss e.g. via speech to text or speech to sign language graphics speech impairment e.g. sign language to speech or text to speech mild vision impairment e.g. via text adaptation severe vision impairment e.g. via text to speech and or cognitive disability e.g. adjusting vocabulary . Server can also facilitate the exchange of voice video or data in a communications session in other ways such as by utilizing closed captioning music frequency amplification color blindness adaptation physical interfacing adaptation epilepsy triggering prevention modifications e.g. via stimuli removal addressing apraxia motor planning disorder such as speech related language translation for cognitive disabilities e.g. based on educational level dyslexia cerebral palsy epilepsy and so forth and or smart adaptation e.g. device limitations presentation environment and so forth .

In one or more embodiments the server can determine a first impairment associated with first user of first end user device and can receive user input captured at second end user device during a communication session between the first and second end user devices. The server can store instructions for executing a group of adjustment techniques for modifying the user input where the group of adjustment techniques includes amplifying selective frequencies translating the user input into sign language images and or modify all or a portion of an unclear word with audio content e.g. synthesized speech or recorded speech . The server can select an adjustment technique from among the group of adjustment techniques. The server can adjust the user input according to the adjustment technique to generate adjusted user input. The server can provide the adjusted user input to the first end user device during the communication session.

In one or more embodiments the server can determine a degree of impairment for the first impairment where the selecting of the adjustment technique from among the group of adjustment techniques is according to the degree of impairment for the first impairment. The server can access an impairment profile for the first user where the adjusting of the user input to generate the adjusted user input is according to the impairment profile. The amplifying of selective frequencies can be utilized for a first degree of impairment. The translating of the user input into sign language images can be utilized for a second degree of impairment where the second degree of impairment is more severe than the first degree of impairment.

In one or more embodiments the server can include or otherwise be in communication with an application programming interface accessible by a remote device that is operated by a third party that is different from a service provider operating the server where at least a portion of the instructions for executing the group of adjustment techniques are received from the remote device.

In system the server can utilize the audiogram data to selectively amplify portions of speech of user during the communication session. The server can provide the adjusted user speech to the end user device of user for presentation. The timeliness of the amplification and the providing of the adjusted content can enable the communication session to continue uninterrupted. As an example certain frequencies identified in the audiogram as being frequencies that are difficult for the user to hear can be amplified by the server and can be provided to the end user device of the user to be presented as adjusted speech content. In one or more embodiments the implementation of selective frequency amplification as an adjustment technique can be based on user preferences such as indicated in the profile although in other embodiments the use of selective frequency amplification can be initiated based on other factors such as user input at the beginning of a communication session.

In one or more embodiments the server can store locally and or remotely instructions for executing a group of adjustment techniques for modifying user input e.g. user speech . The group of adjustment techniques can include amplifying selective frequencies as well as other adjustment techniques such as translating the user input into sign language images or modifying all or a portion of unclear words with synthesized or recorded speech. In one embodiment the selection of the particular technique among the group can be based on user preferences. In another embodiment the selection of the technique from among the group of techniques can be based on a degree of user impairment. For example the use of selective frequency amplification can be for a first degree of impairment and the translation into sign language images can be for a second degree of impairment where the second degree of impairment is more severe than the first degree of impairment. In one embodiment the amplification of selective frequencies can be performed in combination with identifying and modifying unclear words in whole or in part using synthesized or recorded speech.

Various libraries can be utilized as part of the speech recognition process including natural language libraries. In one or more embodiments the libraries utilized for the speech recognition can be selected based on an identification of one or both of user . For instance user can be identified as speaking with a particular accent and a library corresponding to that accent can be utilized.

In one or more embodiments the system can generate or otherwise obtain replacement audio content that can be stored at a database or other storage device s . In one embodiment the replacement audio content can be generated by the server from an end user device of a user and then stored in the database for use in communication sessions later for that user. For example speech can be recorded at the end user device and identified as a clear word to be used in a subsequent communication session to replace an unclear word. In another example a third party can provide speech which is recorded and stored in the database for subsequent use to replace all or a portion of an unclear word. In yet another example speech can be digitally generated including all or a portion of certain words e.g. words that are frequently mispronounced words where syllables are frequently dropped and so forth .

At user input can be captured during the communication session. The user input can be user speech sign language images of the user or other content e.g. text graphics music and so forth . At an adjustment technique can be selected for adjusting the user input. In one embodiment the adjustment technique can be selected from among a group of adjustment techniques. In one embodiment the selection can be according to the degree of the impairment. In one embodiment instructions can be stored for executing the group of adjustment techniques for modifying the user input where the group of adjustment techniques includes amplifying selective frequencies for a first degree of impairment and translating the user input into sign language images for a second degree of impairment and where the second degree of impairment is more severe than the first degree of impairment.

At the user input can be adjusted according to the selected adjustment technique and the impairment profile to generate adjusted user input. At the adjusted user input can be provided to the end user device during the communication session. The providing of the adjusted user input can be in place of the original user input e.g. replacing original user speech with modified user speech in which selected frequencies have been modified . In one or more embodiments the adjusted user input is being provided as part of the communication session in real time or near real time or otherwise without a user noticeable delay.

Various libraries can be utilized as part of the speech recognition process including natural language libraries. In one or more embodiments the libraries utilized for the speech recognition can be selected based on an identification of one or more parties that are involved in the communication session. For instance a user can be identified as speaking with a particular accent and a library corresponding to that accent can be utilized. Other information such as age educational background nationality geographic location and so forth of one or more of the parties to the communication session can be used as criteria in selecting libraries for identifying words in the user speech via speech recognition.

At the user speech can be adjusted to generate adjusted user speech by replacing all or a portion of the unclear word with replacement audio content. In one embodiment only a portion of the unclear word e.g. a dropped syllable at the end of the unclear word is replaced with the audio content without replacing a remainder of the unclear word e.g. the beginning portion of the word . At the adjusted user speech can be provided from the server or other device s operating as the accessibility adjustment platform to the first end user device during the communication session. The adjustment of the unclear word can be performed in a timely manner so as to enable a smooth conversation between the users of the communication session.

Communication system can comprise an HSS a tElephone NUmber Mapping ENUM server and other network elements of an IMS network . The IMS network can establish communications between IMS compliant communication devices CDs Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN CDs and combinations thereof by way of a Media Gateway Control Function MGCF coupled to a PSTN network . The MGCF need not be used when a communication session involves IMS CD to IMS CD communications. A communication session involving at least one PSTN CD may utilize the MGCF .

IMS CDs can register with the IMS network by contacting a Proxy Call Session Control Function P CSCF which communicates with an interrogating CSCF I CSCF which in turn communicates with a S CSCF to register the CDs with the HSS . To initiate a communication session between CDs an originating IMS CD can submit a Session Initiation Protocol SIP INVITE message to an originating P CSCF which communicates with a corresponding originating S CSCF . The originating S CSCF can submit the SIP INVITE message to one or more application servers ASs that can provide a variety of services to IMS subscribers.

For example the application servers can be used to perform originating call feature treatment functions on the calling party number received by the originating S CSCF in the SIP INVITE message. Originating treatment functions can include determining whether the calling party number has international calling services call ID blocking calling name blocking 7 digit dialing and or is requesting special telephony features e.g. 72 forward calls 73 cancel call forwarding 67 for caller ID blocking and so on . Based on initial filter criteria iFCs in a subscriber profile associated with a CD one or more application servers may be invoked to provide various call originating feature services.

Additionally the originating S CSCF can submit queries to the ENUM system to translate an E.164 telephone number in the SIP INVITE message to a SIP Uniform Resource Identifier URI if the terminating communication device is IMS compliant. The SIP URI can be used by an Interrogating CSCF I CSCF to submit a query to the HSS to identify a terminating S CSCF associated with a terminating IMS CD such as reference . Once identified the I CSCF can submit the SIP INVITE message to the terminating S CSCF . The terminating S CSCF can then identify a terminating P CSCF associated with the terminating CD . The P CSCF may then signal the CD to establish Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP communication services thereby enabling the calling and called parties to engage in voice and or data communications. Based on the iFCs in the subscriber profile one or more application servers may be invoked to provide various call terminating feature services such as call forwarding do not disturb music tones simultaneous ringing sequential ringing etc.

Upon reviewing the aforementioned embodiments it would be evident to an artisan with ordinary skill in the art that said embodiments can be modified reduced or enhanced without departing from the scope of the claims described below. For example the accessibility adjustments can be performed for more than two users involved in a communication session. As an example a conference call amongst three or more users at three or more different end user devices can result in various user input adjustments being made and delivered to the respective user based on an impairment of that user. For instance the first user may desire selective frequency amplification of user speech the second user may desire a speech to text conversion and the third user may desire a speech to sign language conversion. In this example the server or other device performing the accessibility adjustment would perform multiple adjustments on the same user input to satisfy the desires of the recipients.

In another embodiment there may be multiple users utilizing a single first end user device that is in a communication with a second end user device. In this example the server or other device performing the accessibility adjustment would determine the adjustments to be made which would satisfy the desires of the multiple users at the single device. For example if one of the first users has a mild hearing impairment and another of the users has a severe hearing impairment then the server may select a speech to text conversion of the user speech. In other embodiments multiple conversions can be performed to satisfy both impairments such as delivering both adapted user speech e.g. amplifying selected frequencies based on an audiogram and sign language images to the single first end user device.

In one or more embodiments the conversion of the user input e.g. user speech may not be verbatim. For instance words or phrases can be changed based on a number of factors such as education level of the recipient. In another embodiment certain words may be changed to account for other impairments such as trying to avoid certain words based on detecting a recipient user that has dyslexia.

In one or more embodiments the user input can be content that is obtained from another source rather than captured at the device. For example a first user may download and transmit a color image to a second user where colors can be modified in color image by server to account for a detected color blindness of the second user.

In one or more embodiments cognitive impairments can be addressed. As an example a user with limited reading ability e.g. in a developing country may rent or otherwise temporarily obtain a cell phone. The user may speak his or her name which is recognized and authenticated. The user may be provided with an icon based interface that minimizes reading dependency. The user s personal Enhanced Address Book EAB can be downloaded from server to the end user device. The user can see images of friends their communication capabilities and or social presence information of the user s contacts e.g. RCS functionality . The user can tap on a video icon by a friend s image and a video call can be established. In this embodiment iconography can be implemented by the server to facilitate the communication session based on a detected or determined cognitive impairment of the user. Other accessibility adjustments can also be performed including language translations.

In one or more embodiments end user devices can be automatically provisioned e.g. at the time of purchase of the device with information and software to make use of the accessibility adjustment functionality of server . Other embodiments can be used in the subject disclosure.
