title: Application certification and search system
abstract: In one embodiment, a method searches a plurality of application marketplaces for applications where each application marketplace includes a plurality of applications available for download to a mobile device. The method then compares a set of applications in different marketplaces to determine certified instances of applications and uncertified instances of applications. Information is stored for the certified instances of the applications that are found in different marketplaces in a database. The method indexes the information for the certified instances of the applications in the database and stores an index based on the indexing. The index is used to provide a search result for a search query for an application.
