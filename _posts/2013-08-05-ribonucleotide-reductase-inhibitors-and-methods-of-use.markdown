This invention was made with Government support under grant number CA127541 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The Government has certain rights in this invention.

Ribonucleotide diphosphate reductase RR is a highly regulated enzyme in the deoxyribonucleotide synthesis pathway that is ubiquitously present in human bacteria yeast and other organisms Jordan 1998 . RR is responsible for the de novo conversion of ribonucleotide diphosphate to 2 deoxyribonucleotide diphosphate a process that is essential for DNA synthesis and repair Thelander 1986 Jordan 1998 Liu 2006 . RR is directly involved in tumor growth metastasis and drug resistance Yen 1994 Zhou 1995 Nocentini 1996 Fan 1998 Zhou 1998 .

The proliferation of metastatic cancer cells requires excess dNTPs for DNA synthesis. Therefore an increase in RR activity is necessary as it helps provide extra dNTPs for DNA replication in primary and metastatic cancer cells. Because of this critical role in DNA synthesis RR represents an important target for cancer therapy. However there has been little progress in the development of RR inhibitors for use in cancer treatment. The three RR inhibitors currently in clinical use hydroxyurea 3 aminopyridine 2 carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone 3 AP and GTI2040 each have significant drawbacks. Therefore there is a need in the art for more effective compositions and methods for targeting and treating RR based cancers.

In certain embodiments a novel set of compounds including COH4 COH20 and COH29 as well as various chemical derivatives thereof are provided. Also provided are compositions and pharmaceutical formulations comprising these compounds.

In certain embodiments methods are provided for inhibiting RR activity in a cell by contacting the cell with one or more of the compounds provided herein including COH4 COH20 and or COH29.

In certain embodiments methods are provided for inhibiting the growth or proliferation of a cell expressing RRM2 by contacting the cell with a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the compounds provided herein including COH4 COH20 and or COH29.

In certain embodiments methods are provided for treating cancer in a subject in need thereof by administering a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the compounds provided herein including COH4 COH20 and or COH29. In certain embodiments the cancer may be characterized by RRM2 overexpression and in certain embodiments the cancer may be resistant to treatment with hydroxyurea.

In certain embodiments methods are provided for inhibiting proliferation of a stem cell expressing RRM2 by contacting the stem cell with a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the compounds provided herein including COH4 COH20 and or COH29.

In certain embodiments methods are provided for the synthesis and or purification of various compounds disclosed herein including COH4 COH20 and or COH29. In certain embodiments methods are provided for synthesizing and or purifying COH29 or various COH29 synthesis intermediates. In certain of these embodiments the synthesis methods provided herein utilize veratrole as a starting material and in certain of these embodiments COH29 synthesis is accomplished via 1 3 4 dimethoxyphenyl 2 phenylethanone 4 3 4 dimethoxyphenyl 5 phenylthiazol 2 amine and N 4 3 4 dimethoxyphenyl 5 phenylthiazol 2 yl 3 4 dimethoxybenzamide intermediates. In certain of these embodiments synthesis of COH29 proceeds via the following synthesis pathway 

The following description of the invention is merely intended to illustrate various embodiments of the invention. As such the specific modifications discussed are not to be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various equivalents changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention and it is understood that such equivalent embodiments are to be included herein.

The following abbreviations are used herein 3 AP 3 aminopyridine 2 carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone DCM dichloromethane DMF dimethylformamide dNTP deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate HU hydroxyurea RR ribonucleotide reductase RRM1 ribonucleotide reductase large subunit RRM2 ribonucleotide reductase small subunit.

The phrase therapeutically effective amount as used herein refers to an amount of a compound that produces a desired therapeutic effect. The precise therapeutically effective amount is an amount of the composition that will yield the most effective results in terms of efficacy in a given subject. This amount will vary depending upon a variety of factors including but not limited to the characteristics of the therapeutic compound including activity pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics and bioavailability the physiological condition of the subject including age sex disease type and stage general physical condition responsiveness to a given dosage and type of medication the nature of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or carriers in the formulation and the route of administration.

For additional guidance see Remington The Science and Practice of Pharmacy Gennaro ed. 20edition Williams Wilkins Pa. USA 2000 .

 Treating or treatment of a condition as used herein may refer to preventing or alleviating a condition slowing the onset or rate of development of a condition reducing the risk of developing a condition preventing or delaying the development of symptoms associated with a condition reducing or ending symptoms associated with a condition generating a complete or partial regression of a condition curing a condition or some combination thereof. With regard to cancer treating or treatment may refer to inhibiting or slowing neoplastic and or malignant cell growth proliferation and or metastasis preventing or delaying the development of neoplastic and or malignant cell growth proliferation and or metastasis or some combination thereof. With regard to a tumor treating or treatment may refer to eradicating all or part of a tumor inhibiting or slowing tumor growth and metastasis preventing or delaying the development of a tumor or some combination thereof.

A cancer characterized by overexpression of RRM2 as used herein refers to any cancer type that expresses RRM2 at either the mRNA or protein level at a level greater than that of a corresponding normal cell or tissue. For example a prostate cancer cell line is a cancer characterized by overexpression of RRM2 if it expresses RRM2 at either the mRNA or protein level at a level greater than that observed in a corresponding normal prostate cell. A cancer characterized by overexpression of RRM2 as used herein also refers to any cancer type in which RRM2 inhibitors exhibit additional or selective effects compared to normal untransformed cells or tissues. For example a cancer type is a cancer characterized by RRM2 overexpression if it has a greater dependency on the nucleotide pool because of a difference in mitotic indices with normal cells making it more sensitive to RRM2 inhibition.

dNTP production in eukaryotes is tightly regulated by RR which catalyzes the rate limiting step in deoxyribonucleotide synthesis Jordan 1998 . RR consists of a large subunit and a small subunit. In humans one large subunit RRM1 also referred to as M1 and two small subunits RRM2 also referred to as M2 and p53R2 have been identified Tanaka 2000 Liu 2006 . The small RR subunits form two equivalent dinuclear iron centers that stabilize the tyrosyl free radical required for initiation of electron transformation during catalysis Ochiai 1990 Cooperman 2003 Liu 2006 .

RRM1 is a 170 Kd dimer containing substrate and allosteric effector sites that control RR holoenzyme activity and substrate specificity Cory 1983 Wright 1990 Cooperman 2003 Liu 2006 .

RRM2 is an 88 Kd dimer containing a tyrosine free radical and a non heme iron for enzyme activity Chang 1979 . p53R2 contains a p53 binding site in intron 1 and encodes a 351 amino acid peptide with striking similarity to RRM2 Tanaka 2000 . RRM2 and p53R2 have an 80 similarity in amino acid sequence Tanaka 2000 .

p53R2 has been identified as a transcriptional target of p53 Nakano 2000 Tanaka 2000 Yamaguchi 2001 while RRM2 is transcriptionally regulated by cell cycle associated factors such as NF Y and E2F Filatov 1995 Currie 1998 Chabes 2004 Liu 2004 . Therefore expression of p53R2 but not RRM2 is induced by ultraviolet UV light gamma irradiation or Doxorubicin Dox treatment in a p53 dependent manner Lozano 2000 Tanaka 2000 Guittet 2001 . In p53 mutant or deleted cells RRM2 can replace p53R2 in the DNA repair process for cells exposed to UV irradiation Zhou 2003 Liu 2005 . P53R2 has been found to have a stronger reducing capacity than RRM2 which may provide a chaperone effect in stabilizing p21 Xue 2007 .

It has been observed that the RB tumor suppressor suppresses RR subunits as a mechanism for regulating cell cycle progression Elledge 1990 . RB inactivation often observed in tumors leads to increased dNTP levels and a concomitant resistance of tumor cells to drugs such as 5 fluorouracil 5 Fu and HU Angus 2002 . While overexpression of the RRM2 subunit promotes transformation and tumorigenic potential via its cooperation with several activated oncogenes Fan 1998 overexpression of the RRM1 subunit suppresses malignant potential in vivo Fan 1997 . Increased expression of RRM2 has been found to increase the drug resistant properties of cancer cells and to increase invasive potential whereas RRM2 suppression leads to the reversal of drug resistance and results in decrease proliferation of tumor cells Zhou 1995 Huang 1997 Zhou 1998 Goan 1999 Chen 2000 Nakano 2000 Kuschak 2002 . Normal cells express very low levels of RR in non proliferative status whereas most neoplastic cells overexpress RR thereby supplying dNTP pools for DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Thus specific inhibition of RRM2 is likely to provide antineoplastic benefits.

Although RR represents an important target for cancer therapy there are only three RR inhibitors in clinical use hydroxyurea HU 3 aminopyridine 2 carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone 3 AP Triapine and GTI2040. HU which blocks DNA synthesis by reducing the tyrosyl free radical has been marketed as a cancer therapeutic for over 30 years and is the only RR inhibitor that is commercially available Nocentini 1996 . However resistance to HU treatment is a common problem Lassmann 1992 Nyholm 1993 Le 2002 . 3 AP a small molecule iron chelator inactivates RR has been found to cause hypoxia respiratory distress and methemoglobulin of red blood cells. In addition 3 AP selectively targets p53R2 instead of RRM2. GTI2040 an antisense molecule has thus far been ineffective in human trials. Other issues relating to these three RR inhibitors are incomplete RR blocking short half life and regeneration of RR. In addition mutation of p53R2 results in hereditary mitochondria depletion syndrome but not cancer and p53R2 knockout mice demonstrate kidney tubule disorder but no obvious cancer growth Kimura 2003 . These observations suggest that RRM2 is responsible for tumor proliferation and metastatic potential whereas p53R2 induced by DNA damage signals for DNA repair. Therefore an ideal RR inhibitor for use in cancer therapy would have greater potency than HU less iron chelating ability than 3 AP and specific targeting of RRM2.

As disclosed herein RRM2 has been validated as an anti cancer target. Suppression of RRM2 via siRNA was found to decrease tumor growth in mice implanted with human HepG2 liver cancer cells. Expression of RRM2 was determined to be significantly higher in cancer cells than in corresponding normal cells. In addition human KB and PC3 cells transfected with RRM2 exhibited increased invasive potential versus their non transfected counterparts suggesting that RRM2 enhances the invasive potential of cancer cells.

A diverse compound library from NCI Developmental Therapeutics Program DTP was screened to identify compounds that inhibit RR. Three of the four compounds identified in this screen that inhibited RRM1 RRM2 activity by 80 of more shared a similar structural scaffold NCI 3. NCI 3 has the structure 

Initial hits from the screening process were synthetically and rationally optimized to obtain the RR inhibitors COH1 COH2 COH4 COH20 and COH29 the structures of which are set forth below.

Each of these compounds exhibited the ability to inhibit RR to a significant degree and COH20 and COH29 both exhibited the ability to inhibit cancer cell growth across a wide range of cancer cell types. Accordingly in certain embodiments the present application discloses novel RR inhibitors compositions formulations and kits comprising one or more of these inhibitors and methods of using these inhibitors to inhibit RR inhibit cell growth or proliferation treat cancer and or inhibit stem cell proliferation.

COH20 consists of three basic structural units a pharmacophore for inhibition of RR activity a binding group for selectivity and a linking group to connect the pharmacophore and the binding group. As disclosed herein COH20 exhibited low micromolar range inhibition of both recombinant and intracellular RR in vitro and caused a decrease in dNTP pools. Biochemical analysis revealed that COH20 targets RRM2. Upon binding the RRM1 RRM2 complex COH20 appears to reside at the V shaped pocket at the interface between RRM1 and RRM2 and block the free radical transfer pathway though a novel catechol radical stabilization mechanism. Considering the size and chemical composition of COH20 and the distance to the dinuclear iron center the bound ligand in this pocket does not appear to be susceptible to iron chelation as with 3 AP or involved in the direct quenching of the initially formed tyrosyl free radical as with HU. COH20 was found to inhibit growth of the human leukemia cell lines REH and MOLT 4 the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and the human oropharyngeal cancer cell line KB in vitro at a concentration of less than 10 M while exhibiting less cytotoxicity towards normal fibroblast cells than HU. COH20 also exhibited greater cytotoxicity towards the HU resistant cell line KBHURs than 3 AP indicating that it is capable of overcoming HU drug resistance. COH20 exhibited cytotoxicity towards KBMDR cells at lower concentration than 3 AP or HU 80 M versus 200 M and 1000 M respectively indicating that COH20 circumvents MDR more effectively than 3 AP. In addition COH20 had very low toxicity when administered to mice with no evidence or iron chelation or methemoglobulin.

As disclosed herein COH29 showed promising growth inhibitory effects on a wide range of human cancer cell lines including 

In certain embodiments COH29 showed a GI50 of less than about 10 M for the NCI 60 human cancer cell lines except colon cancer cell line HT29 melanoma cancer cell line UACC 257 ovarian cancer cell line NCI ADR RES and renal cancer cell line CAKI 1. In addition pharmacokinetic studies of COH29 showed a dose dependent manner when COH29 was administered by i.v. bolus.

COH4 COH20 and COH29 represent unique RR inhibitors with high antitumoral activity that provide significant advantages over previously disclosed RR inhibitors. Specifically COH20 offers a unique mechanism and target specificity that interferes with the radical transfer pathway at the RRM1 RRM2 interface with greater potency than HU and amelioration of the iron chelation related side effects observed with 3 AP. Therefore provided herein in certain embodiments are small molecule RR inhibitors and methods of using these inhibitors to inhibit RR and to treat cancer. The inhibitors disclosed herein are capable of overcoming HU resistance a common obstacle to cancer therapy and are also capable of overcoming multidrug resistance.

In certain embodiments a novel RR inhibitor as disclosed herein is COH1 COH2 COH4 COH20 or COH29 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt solvate stereoisomer or prodrug derivative thereof.

The RR inhibitors disclosed herein specifically target RRM2 inhibiting the interaction between RRM1 and RRM2 and inhibiting the activity of the RR complex. Therefore these inhibitors may be used to certain cancers including cancers associated with the overexpression of RRM2 or for which there exists a suitable therapeutic index.

The following examples are provided to better illustrate the claimed invention and are not to be interpreted as limiting the scope of the invention.

One skilled in the art may develop equivalent means or reactants without the exercise of inventive capacity and without departing from the scope of the invention.

An RRM2 luciferase fusion construct pR2Luc was administered alone or in combination with an RRM2 siRNA siR2B 5 by hydrodynamic tail vein injection HPTV plasmid 0.25 mg kg siRNA 1.25 mg kg to female BALB c mice implanted with human HepG2 liver cancer cells. In vivo bioluminescence imaging revealed potent down regulation within mouse liver cancer cells over multiple weeks . Mice receiving RRM2 in combination with RRM2 siRNA exhibited a significant decrease in tumor growth versus mice receiving RRM2 alone or in combination with control siRNA siCONTROL . These results suggest that RRM2 plays critical role in cancer growth and validates it as a therapeutic target.

RRM2 mRNA expression levels were measured by RT PCR in 35 human fresh frozen breast cancer biopsies and corresponding normal tissue samples. Optimal PCR primer and probe concentrations of RRM2 and actin housekeeping gene were determined to reach maximum efficiency during the amplification. The PCR reaction was performed in a 20 l final volume adding 1 l cDNA from each sample using Taqman PCR mix Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. . A significant increase in RRM2 expression was observed in breast cancer tissue versus corresponding normal tissue p

Human oropharyngeal cancer KB wild type p53 and human prostate cancer PC3 truncated p53 cells were transfected with sense RRM2 KBM2 and PC3M2 respectively and control vector and the resulting overexpression of RRM2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Transfectants were applied to the upper layer of Matrigel in a Borden chamber. After 72 hours cells that invaded to the lower layer were fixed with alcohol stained with methylene blue and counted and examined. RRM2 transfected cells exhibited increased invasive potential in comparison to non transfected cells .

A diverse compound library from NCI Developmental Therapeutics Program DTP was subjected to a virtual screening process to identify potential RR inhibitors. The DTP library contains 2 000 different compounds. A novel ligand binding pocket on human RRM2 identified from the X ray crystal structure PDB 2UW2 was selected to identify potential inhibitor compounds that were in close proximity to the RRM1 RRM2 interface but distant from the dityrosyl diiron center in order to avoid iron chelating side effects. This ligand binding pocket which consists of 32 amino acid residues conserved among human and mouse RRM2 protein families is in close proximity to the RRM1 RRM2 interface. The structure of the ligand binding pocket is set forth in . The pocket consists of helices 7 8 and 10 at the C terminal domain. The narrow interior end of the V shaped pocket is lined up with hydrophobic residues near the back of dityrosyl diiron cluster center. Polar residues such as D271 R330 and E334 that are located near the open end of the pocket may potentially interact with the flexible C terminus. The pocket is lined mostly with interior hydrophobic residues with charged residues exposed to the surface.

Compounds that docked into the ligand binding pocket were identified using the TRIPOS FlexX docking tool and ranked using an embedded consensus docking score. The top 80 RR inhibitor candidates that exhibited a binding affinity equal to or greater than that of 3 AP in the virtual screen were subjected to an in vitro screen using a known semi high throughput holoenzyme based assay for determining the potency and subunit selectivity of small molecule inhibitors Shao 2005 . The assay utilized recombinant RRM1 RRM2 or RRM1 RRM2 complex and measured H CDP reduction activity i.e. CDP to dCDP by HPLC. Ten compounds exhibited the ability to inhibit native RRM1 RRM2 activity by greater than 50 in vitro and four of these compounds inhibited enzyme activity by 80 or more. Three of the four compounds exhibiting 80 inhibition shared a similar structural scaffold NCI 3 NSC 659390 and NSC 45382 and also showed better solubility and lower toxicity than the other tested compounds. NCI 3 dihydroxyphenylthiazole DHPT has the following structure 

A series of NCI 3 analogs were synthesized using the strategy set forth in . An additional 24 NCI 3 analogs were developed by attaching a variety of R groups to the aminothiazole group. Compounds generated in this manner included COH1 COH2 COH4 COH20 and COH29.

The ability of NCI 3 and the NCI 3 analogs synthesized in Example 2 to inhibit RR activity was tested using the in vitro holoenzyme assay described above. COH4 exhibited significant RR inhibition. COH20 was even more effective causing 90.2 inhibition of the recombinant RRM1 RRM2 complex in vitro . IC50 results for various compounds are set forth in Table 1.

In striking contrast to 3 AP inhibition of RR by COH20 was virtually unaffected by the addition of iron Table 2 .

Site directed mutagenesis Biacore analysis and NMR Saturation Transfer Difference STD analysis were carried out to validate the binding pocket and ligand protein interaction between COH20 and RRM2. RRM2 point mutants were generated by mutating certain key residues in the binding pocket. These residues included Y323 D271 R330 and E334 each of which are charged and reside on the surface of the binding pocket and G233 which sits deep in the pocket. Attenuation of inhibition in these mutants confirmed involvement of the mutated residues in ligand binding and validated the binding pocket. Interestingly the only mutation that did not attenuate inhibition was G233V. This suggests the presence of a hydrophobic pocket that is stabilized by introduction of a valine side chain.

To confirm that the ability of COH20 to inhibit RR activity was not specific to recombinant RR an assay was performed testing the effect of COH20 on intracellular RR. KB cells treated with 10 M COH20 were lysed and protein was extracted in a high salt buffer and passed through a G25 Sephadex column to remove small molecules such as dNTP. The eluate was mixed with H CDP in reaction buffer to monitor RR activity. Treatment with COH20 decreased intracellular RR activity by approximately 50 . Treatment with COH20 had no effect on RRM2 protein levels as measured by Western blot indicating that the effect of COH20 on RR activity is not due to a decrease in RRM2 expression.

dNTP pools from KB cells were measured by polymerase template assay following treatment with 10 M COH20. Pre and post treatment cell pellets were mixed with 100 l of 15 trichloroacetic acid incubated on ice for ten minutes and centrifuged at high speed for five minutes. Supernatants were collected and extracted with two 50 l aliquots of Freon trioctylamine 55 45 to neutralize the trichloroacetic acid. After each addition the samples were centrifuged at high speed and supernatant was collected. Two 5 l aliquots one for each duplicate of each sample were used to check dATP dCTP dGTP and dTTP concentrations. The reaction mixture in each tube contained 50 mM Tris HCL pH 7.5 10 mM MgCl 5 mM DTT 0.25 mM template primer 1.25 M H dATP for dCTP assay or H dTTP for dATP assay and 0.3 units of Sequenase 2.0 in a total volume of 50 L. DNA synthesis was allowed to proceed for 20 minutes at room temperature. After incubation 40 l of each reaction mixture was spotted onto a Whatman DE81 ion exchange paper 2.4 cm diameter . The papers were dried for 30 60 minutes at room temperature washed with 5 NaHPO 3 10 minutes and rinsed once with distilled water and once more with 95 ethanol. Each paper was dried and deposited in a small vial and 5 ml of scintillation fluid was added to each vial. Tritium labeled dNTPs were counted using liquid scintillation counter and compared to standards prepared at 0.25 0.5 0.75 and 1.0 pmol L of dNTPs. For comparison duplicate sets of reactions were carried out with freshly added inhibitors. COH20 was found to decrease dATP dCTP dGTP and dTTP pools in KB cells indicating that inhibition of RR results in a concomitant decreased in dNTP production . Similar experiments will be performed using other cell lines.

The in vitro cytotoxicity of COH4 and COH20 towards human leukemia REH and MOLT 4 cells human prostate cancer LNCaP cells human oropharyngeal cancer KB cells and normal fibroblast NHDF cells was evaluated using an MTT assay. 5 000 cells were seeded on six well plates for 72 hours with various concentrations of drug. COH20 was cytotoxic to the cancer cell lines at less than 10 M while causing less cytotoxicity to normal cells than 3 AP. The results are summarized in Table 3. Results for LNCaP KB and NHDF are set forth in . Based on the broad range of cancer cell types against which COH20 exhibits cytotoxicity COH20 is expected to be cytotoxic to a variety of additional cancer cell types including colon cancer breast cancer lung cancer melanoma leukemia and lymphoma cells.

In vitro cytotoxicity assays were repeated using KBHURs an HU resistant clone derived from KB cells that overexpresses RRM2. COH20 was cytotoxic to KBHURs at significantly lower concentrations than the other RR inhibitors tested confirming that COH20 is capable of overcoming HU resistance . In addition COH20 was found to be cytotoxic to KBMDR a KB clone that overexpresses the MDR pump on the cell membrane at lower concentrations than 3 AP or HU . A real time proliferation assay confirmed that COH20 also inhibits cell proliferation in KBMDR cells . Similar experiments will be repeated using the gemcitabine resistant cell line KBGem which also overexpresses RRM2. Based on the results with other cell lines it is expected that COH20 will also exhibit cytotoxicity and growth inhibition towards KBGem.

The in vitro cytotoxicity of COH29 towards a panel of human cancer cell lines was tested using the MTT assay described above. COH29 significantly inhibited growth across a broad range of cancer cell types with an ICof less than about 10 M in all cell types tested except for colon cancer HT29 melanoma UACC 257 ovarian cancer NCI ADR RES and renal cancer CAKI 1 . Representative results are summarized in Table 4.

Flow cytometry and annexin staining were performed on KB cells treated with COH20 at 9 or 27 M or 3 AP at 3 M for 24 hours. These results showed that COH20 treatment arrests cells in S phase in a dose dependent manner upper panel . After treatment with COH20 for 72 hours annexin staining showed significant cell death indicating apoptosis lower panel . COH20 induced apoptosis with approximately the same potency as 3 AP.

COH20 was injected into three male rats at 1 mg kg for single dose pharmacokinetic evaluation. Elimination of COH20 from plasma was found to be tri exponential with a rapid initial decline phase possible tissue distribution or liver uptake followed by an intermediate phase combined distribution and elimination and a slower terminal phase elimination . The terminal half life T was approximately 5.5 hours. More detailed pharmacokinetic studies will be performed with various dosages of COH20 to establish parameters such as clearance bioavailability and tissue plasma partition coefficients.

Pharmacokinetic evaluation was performed on COH29 using the same techniques with COH29 administered at a dosage of 25 mg kg. Results from triplicate analysis are summarized in Table 5. Area under the curve AUC calculations showed COH29 acting in a dose dependent manner when administered by i.v. bolus .

In order to determine the maximal tolerated dose of COH20 COH20 was administered to mice intravenously at dosages ranging from 10 to 160 mg kg. Other than one mouse that died in the 160 mg kg group body weight remained stable for all treatment groups indicating that COH20 is a tolerable compound with minimal toxicity . There was no evidence of lethal iron chelation or induction of methemoglobulin further indicating that COH20 has no significant iron chelation side effects.

A Biacore T100 instrument was used to study the ligand protein interaction between COH20 or 3 AP and RRM2. Wild type RRM2 was isolated and immobilized onto CM4 sensor chips using standard amine coupling methods at 25 C. and a flow rate of 10 L minute. Specifically the carboxymethyl dextran surfaces of the flow cells were activated with a 7 min injection of a 1 1 ratio of 0.4 M N ethyl N0 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide EDC and 0.1 M N hydroxysuccinimide NHS . RRM2 was diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5 to 25 g ml and injected over target flow cell for target immobilization 8000 RU. 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5 buffer was injected into the reference flow cell for blank immobilization. The remaining activated surface was blocked with a 7 min injection of 1M ethanolamine HCl pH 8.5. Phosphate buffered saline PBS was used as a running buffer during immobilization. COH20 and 3 AP were dissolved in DMSO to prepare 100 mM stock solutions. The compounds were then diluted serially in running buffer PBS 1.5 DMSO 10 fold carboxymethyl dextran 0.002 Methyl 6 O N heptylcarbamoyl D glucoyranoside to the appropriate running concentrations. Samples were injected over the reference flow cell and target flow cell with immobilized RRM2 at a flow rate of 60 L min at 25 C. Association and dissociation were measured for 180 seconds and 60 seconds respectively. All compounds were tested in triplicate at five different concentrations. Concentration series for each compound were done at least twice. Within a given compound concentration series the samples were randomized to minimize systematic errors. Between samples the sensor chip was regenerated by injection of 0.3 SDS for 30 seconds. The results showed a significant interaction between COH20 and RRM2 but not between COH20 and 3 AP .

The Biacore T100 was also used to analyze the ability of COH20 to interfere with binding of RRM2 to RRM1. Fixed concentrations of RRM1 1 M in the absence and presence of a two fold dilution concentration series of COH20 3.125 M were injected over a reference flow cell and a target flow cell with immobilized RRM2 at a flow rate 30 L min at 25 C. Association and dissociation were measured for 90 seconds and 60 seconds respectively. Duplicates runs were performed using the same conditions. Between samples the sensor chip was regenerated by injection of 0.3 SDS 0.2 M NaCOfor 30 seconds. COH20 was found to interrupt the RRM1 RRM2 interaction at the interface .

The cytotoxic efficacy of COH20 will be tested in vivo using a mouse xenograft model. Xenograft tumor models will be created using human cancer cell lines such as KB KBHURs and KBGem. For establishment of the KB xenograft model 1 5 10KB cells in a volume of 0.1 ml saline will be injected into the right hind flank of 5 6 week old nude female mice. Tumor volume will be monitored twice weekly using digital calipers. When tumor volume reaches approximately 100 160 mm mice will be divided into groups of ten such that the median and mean body weight and tumor volume are roughly the same for all mice within a group. COH20 will be administered either 1 alone in a single dose to determine effective dosage 2 alone at various intervals for a scheduling study or 3 in combination with known cancer therapeutics such as chemotherapeutics. During a monitoring period of approximately four weeks changes in tumor cell growth body weight organ dysfunction and iron chelating side effects will be analyzed at various timepoints. Following the monitoring period mice will be euthanized and tissue tumor and plasma will be analyzed by visual and histological examination. Based on the cytotoxicity of COH20 towards various cancer cell lines in vitro it is expected that mice treated with COH20 will exhibit higher survival rates decreased tumor growth and fewer tumor related side effects e.g. weight loss organ dysfunction .

The structure of NCI 3 analogs such as COH20 and COH29 may be refined and optimized by generating various analogs and analyzing their binding to RRM2 and the RRM1 RRM2 complex using site directed mutagenesis studies Biacore analysis and NMR STD experiments. X ray crystallography studies may be performed to determine the three dimensional structure of the COH20 RRM2 complex. Using these tools additional RR inhibitors may be generated with higher potency greater selectivity and lower toxicity.

As shown above the RRM2 mutant G233V enhanced COH20 inhibitor activity. Additional hydrophobic interactions between the valine side chain and the bound ligand are believed to contribute to enhanced binding and inhibition suggesting that an additional hydrophobic side chain extending from COH20 could optimize binding affinity. Therefore COH20 analogs that contain these hydrophobic side chains e.g. COH1 COH2 COH4 COH29 compounds having Structure I and compounds selected from Group I are also likely to be RR inhibitors.
