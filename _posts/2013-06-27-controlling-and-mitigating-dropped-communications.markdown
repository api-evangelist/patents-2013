title: Controlling and mitigating dropped communications
abstract: Aspects relate to temporarily disabling a message or a set of messages based on the detection that an uplink transmission power is reaching maximum power or is at maximum power. The detection can be based on observing that one or more uplink transmissions are near, or at, the maximum power. The message or set of messages that are disabled can be a non-call critical message(s), such as a non-signaling radio bearer related message(s). Disabling the message or set of messages can conserve resources, which can be utilized for call critical messages, which can include signaling radio bearer related messages, call maintenance messages, voice communications, and so forth. Disabling the message or set of messages can also mitigate the chances of a call being disconnected due to power demands that exceed the maximum power available.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 154 137 filed Jun. 6 2011 and entitled CONTROLLING AND MITIGATING DROPPED COMMUNICATIONS the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The subject disclosure relates to wireless communications and more particularly to controlling and mitigating dropped communications.

As the uses and complexity of wireless devices have evolved so has the wish for improved reliability of such wireless devices. For example as wireless devices are used the wireless devices are moved. During the movement a first base station or network that was servicing the wireless device might no longer be able to service the wireless device due to limitations of the geographic area covered by the first base station. In this situation the wireless device is handed off from the first base station to a second base station. The handoff between base stations generally allows for seamless transition of the device from the first base station to the second base station.

In some circumstances however the communication can be at risk due to the device using a large amount of transmission power in order to continue the communication. For example when the device is at the edge of coverage a transmission power of the device can be at maximum level. When this occurs the probability of a communication e.g. a call being dropped or a disconnection occurring can become relatively high. Thus the unreliability of the device and or the network can frustrate a user as well as cause other problems e.g. an important communication being lost .

The above described deficiencies of today s wireless communication systems are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with conventional systems and corresponding benefits of the various non limiting embodiments described herein may become further apparent upon review of the following description.

Various embodiments are configured to enable detection of a device maximum power state or near maximum power state and disable uplink reporting status information and or other non call critical messages that would otherwise be sent during the maximum or near maximum power state. Since fading can be rapid a single maximum power state detection during a first period can be utilized to place the device in a maximum power state . The single maximum power state detection can allow for more rapid detection of maximum power. Subsequently in the maximum power state the reporting status messages and or other non call critical messages can be disabled in the uplink. This also allows to device to not need additional power in the uplink. Further power resources can be conserved and or the resources can be devoted to maintain existing speech and or critical control messages. The disclosed aspects can also alleviate the issue of additional power being needed for other message and can mitigate the probability of call disconnection due to power demands in excess of the maximum power available.

In an example embodiment a method comprises detecting that an uplink power level during a wireless communication by a mobile device meets a condition with respect to a pre specified power level and disabling transmission of a non call critical message on an uplink in response to the uplink power level meeting the condition with respect to the pre specified power level.

In another example embodiment an apparatus comprises an analyzer component configured to determine that uplink transmit power levels during a wireless communication by a mobile device meet a condition with respect to maximum transmit power levels for an uplink transmission during a first period. The apparatus also includes a manager component configured to temporarily disable transmission of a message that is not related to call maintenance in response to a determination by the analyzer component that the uplink transmit power levels meet the condition.

In another example embodiment a system comprises an analyzer component that detects an uplink transmit power during a wireless communication by a mobile device is near a maximum transmit power during a first period. The system also includes a manager component that selectively suspends a message in response to detection by the analyzer component that the uplink transmit power is near the maximum transmit power during the first period and a processor that utilizes a resource conserved by suspension of the message by the manager component.

In various wireless data networks e.g. UMTS Universal Mobile Telecommunications System LTE Long Term Evolution and so forth such as network illustrated in downlink coverage is generally greater than the uplink coverage . The downlink coverage is the coverage from a base station to a user equipment and the uplink coverage is the coverage from the user equipment to the base station . For purposes of simplicity only a single base station and a single user equipment are illustrated however network can include more than one base station and or more than one user equipment.

The disparity in the downlink and uplink coverage is due in part to downlink DL data rates being larger than uplink UL data rates . However in the case of voice only e.g. speech transmission where the uplink data rates and the downlink data rates are substantially the same the difference can be an issue since the uplink will be the limiting case for the voice coverage. Therefore the downlink can have a coverage margin when the uplink has no margin. Thus when the downlink is still active e.g. since it has coverage margin the uplink may be at maximum power e.g. limit of coverage . Maximum power is utilized herein to refer to the instantaneous power reaching maximum over the smallest measurement interval used.

If the downlink e.g. base station is actively transmitting data acknowledgement messages ACKs are expected to be sent to the base station from the uplink e.g. user equipment according to conventional techniques. However since the uplink is already at maximum transmission power this situation can result in disconnection of the link once or at substantially the same time as the ACKs are transmitted.

For example in the case of multiple Radio Access Bearer mRAB when there are packets of data speech and Signalling Radio Bearers SRBs in the buffers the various packets are transmitted in the same frame even though all of the packets might not be necessary to maintain the communication. Since sending additional messages especially non critical data messages would utilize additional device power there might not be enough power left to transmit critical signaling messages reliably and therefore the call can drop when the network consistently does not receive reliable signaling messages. This procedure is allowed by the 3GPP UMTS standards for example. This situation can occur at cell boundaries and can also occur during in building situations which can happen at relatively close range to the base station.

Further some conventional systems allow the user equipment to rapidly lower the uplink data rate to a zero rate but downlink response messages and measurement report messages still are allowed in the uplink which can exacerbate the device transmission power issue e.g. maximum power level being reached and can result in call disconnection. Although there is no limit on how long a device can transmit at peak power without dropping to a lower power the condition exacerbates the call drop probability the data throughput and so forth.

Thus it would be beneficial to mitigate the transmission of the acknowledgement messages and or other messages e.g. non call critical messages when the user equipment is at or near a maximum transmission power level.

An aspect relates to a method that includes detecting that an uplink power level during a wireless communication by a mobile device meets a condition with respect to a pre specified power level. The method also includes disabling transmission of a non call critical message on an uplink in response to the uplink power level meeting the condition with respect to the pre specified power level.

In an implementation disabling the non call critical message includes disabling a non signaling radio bearer related message. In another implementation disabling the non call critical message includes disabling a set of messages. Further to this implementation disabling the set of messages includes disabling a session.

In some implementations detecting the uplink power level includes evaluating the uplink power level for a defined number of uplink transmissions and determining the uplink power level meets the condition with respect to a maximum power level for a subset of the defined number of uplink transmissions as a function of the evaluating. Further to this implementation evaluating the uplink power level includes analyzing the uplink power level during a period of time.

According to an implementation disabling transmission of a non call critical message includes conserving a power resource. Further to this implementation the method includes mitigating a power resource of non call critical control signals and using the mitigated power resource for a critical message signal. In another implementation disabling transmission of a non call critical message includes conserving a power resource. Further to this implementation the method includes mitigating a power resource of non critical data signals and using the mitigated power resource for critical data signals.

According to some implementations disabling transmission of the non call critical message includes conserving a power resource and the method includes pushing bit duration energy from a speech signal to increase corresponding bit durations of call critical signaling messages. Further to this implementation the method includes increasing a gain of a code carrying the call critical signaling messages and mitigating the gain of non call critical control signals. In some implementations the method includes increasing a signal amplitude and a bit energy of the call critical signaling messages by taking the signal amplitude and the bit energy from non critical call signals and bit energies. In other implementations disabling transmission of the non call critical message further includes conserving a power resource and the method further includes pushing bit duration energy from a speech signal to increase corresponding bit durations of call critical data signals.

In some implementations disabling transmission of a non call critical message is during a first period. Further to this implementation the method includes reviewing the uplink power level during a second period and enabling a transmission non call critical message on the uplink during the second period in response to a result of reviewing the uplink power level.

According to a further implementation disabling transmission of a non call critical message is during a first period. Further to this implementation the method includes reviewing the uplink power level during a second period and continuing to disable the non call critical message on the uplink during the second period in response to a result of reviewing the uplink power level.

According to some implementations disabling transmission of the non call critical message includes temporarily disabling the non call critical message on the uplink. In some implementations the method includes receiving the pre specified power level as a dynamic update over the air. In other implementations the method includes monitoring an uplink power level during a wireless communication by a mobile device.

Another aspect relates to an apparatus that includes an analyzer component configured to determine that uplink transmit power levels during a wireless communication by a mobile device meet a condition with respect to maximum transmit power levels for an uplink transmission during a first period. The apparatus also includes a manager component configured to temporarily disable a message that is not related to call maintenance in response to a determination by the analyzer component that the uplink transmit power levels meet the condition.

In an implementation the manager component is configured to temporarily disable a session in response to the determination by the analyzer component. In another implementation the analyzer component is further configured to review the uplink transmit power levels during a second period and the manager component is further configured to continue to disable the transmission of the message in response to a result of the review. In a further implementation the analyzer component is further configured to review the uplink transmit power levels during a second period and the manager component is further configured to enable the transmission of the message in response to a result of the review.

In some implementations the manager component is further configured to temporarily disable a session. In an implementation the message that is not related to the call maintenance is a non signaling radio bearer related message. In an implementation the apparatus is a mobile handset.

A further aspect relates to a system that includes an analyzer component that detects an uplink transmit power during a wireless communication by a mobile device is near a maximum transmit power during a first period. The system also includes a manager component that selectively suspends a message in response to a detection by the analyzer component that the uplink transmit power is near the maximum transmit power during the first period. Also included in the system is a processor that utilizes a resource conserved by the suspension of the message by the manager component.

According to an implementation the message is a non signaling radio bearer related message and the processor utilizes the resource for a signaling radio bearer related message. In some implementations the analyzer component reviews the uplink transmit power during a second period and the manager component enables the message in response to a result of the review. In an implementation the analyzer component the manager component and the processor are included in a wireless communication device.

Herein an overview of some of the embodiments for control of call drop by disabling one or more uplink transmissions has been provided above. As a roadmap for what follows next various exemplary non limiting embodiments and features for control and or disabling at least temporarily uplink transmissions are described in more detail. Then some non limiting implementations and examples are given for additional illustration followed by representative networks and environments in which such embodiments and or features can be implemented.

By way of further description with respect to one or more non limiting ways to provide control of uplink transmissions to mitigate call drop a high level block diagram of an exemplary communication network is illustrated generally by .

Included in network are a user equipment illustrated as a mobile device and a base station . The mobile device communicates to the base station over an uplink and the base station communicates to the mobile device over a downlink .

Mobile device includes an observation component configured to monitor an uplink power level during a wireless communication. For example the observation component can be configured to monitor the uplink power level during one or more time periods and or can continuously monitor the uplink power level during the wireless communication.

An analyzer component is configured to detect if the uplink power level meets a condition with respect to a pre specified power level. In an example the pre specified power level can be a threshold power level. For example the analyzer component can detect whether the uplink power level is at or near a maximum power level during at least one time period. In some aspects the detection by analyzer component is based on the uplink power level being at or near a maximum power level for at least a subset of a defined number of uplink transmissions. In an example a single uplink transmission is a single signaling message. In accordance with some aspects analyzer component is associated with or includes a radio frequency RF circuit that is configured to measure the transmit power of the mobile device . For example code in a RF chip set can be changed according to an aspect.

Also included in mobile device is a manager component configured to selectively disable at least one message in response to the detection by analyzer component that the uplink power level meets the condition with respect to the pre specified power level. For example the manager component can be configured to selectively disable the one or more messages during the device maximum power condition. At about the same time as the device is no longer in the maximum power condition manager component can selectively enable one or more messages that were previously disabled. In accordance with some aspects the manager component can be configured to disable at least one non call critical message on the uplink .

For example the base station might be actively communicating with the mobile device on the downlink . In response to the downlink communications the mobile device might be expected to reply on the uplink with various messages such as acknowledgement messages report information status information as well as other non call critical messages and or call critical messages. However the mobile device might be in a situation where the mobile device is at maximum transmission power. Thus if the mobile device attempts to transmit information in response to the downlink messages while operating at or near maximum power it can result in disconnection of the communication link. Such disconnection can negatively impact a user experience. For example the disconnection can result in a dropped call which can be frustrating to the user and can result in communications being missed. The dropped call scenario can be devastating in the case where the communication was related to an emergency situation e.g. a 911 emergency call .

To help control the amount of power consumed by the mobile device during a communication an observation component is configured to monitor an uplink power level . For example the observation component can include a timer configured to track different intervals or periods. While the intervals or periods are described herein with respect to time for purposes of simplicity other manners of distinguishing intervals or periods can be utilized. For example the timer can be configured to divide the communication into a first period a second period through an N period where N is an integer. In an aspect the last period of the communication e.g. N period is not an entire period because the timer does not know the duration of the communication while the communication is in progress.

The observation component is configured to monitor the uplink power level during one or more periods tracked by timer . In accordance with some aspects the periods can be during a single transmission time interval. However according to some aspects the periods can encompass more than one transmission time interval. In other aspects the periods can include at least a portion of one or more transmission time intervals. In some aspects the observation component is configured to continuously monitor the uplink power level during the wireless communication.

An analyzer component is configured to detect if the uplink power level meets a condition with respect to a pre specified power level . For example the uplink power level can have limitations due to the type of mobile device capabilities of the mobile device and or other parameters. Based on the various limitations there is a maximum uplink power level that mobile device can utilize for transmission of data voice other messages and or information. Operating at or near the maximum uplink power level can quickly consume mobile device resources including battery power and transmission power. In some aspects a threshold power level is utilized by analyzer component as the pre specified power level . For example the threshold power level can be a power level that is a percentage e.g. 75 80 95 and so forth of the maximum uplink power level . In other aspects the pre specified power level is substantially the same as the maximum power level is utilized.

In an aspect the analyzer component includes an assessment module that is configured to evaluate the uplink power level for a defined number of uplink transmissions referred to as M transmissions where M is an integer. In some aspects the M transmissions can be defined with respect to each period e.g. first period second period through N period . For example the M transmissions can be a subset of the total number of uplink transmissions e.g. less than all uplink transmissions less than substantially all uplink transmissions and so on during each period. In another example the M transmissions can be one uplink transmission. In a further example the M transmissions can be five uplink transmissions and so forth. In some aspects the number of M transmissions can be configurable and or can be varied manually e.g. by a user by a network and so forth and or dynamically e.g. based on historical data related to the mobile device and so forth .

A decision module is configured to determine the uplink power level is at or near the maximum uplink power level or meets a condition with respect to the pre specified power level for at least a subset of the defined number of uplink transmissions e.g. M transmissions as a function of the evaluation by assessment module . For example if the uplink power level is at or near the maximum uplink power level or meets the condition for the pre specified power level for M transmissions decision module can conclude that the mobile device is operating at or substantially at maximum power and action by a manager component should be taken.

Manager component is configured to selectively disable at least temporarily at least one message. For example manager component or another component can divide the various messages and or data into non call critical messages or call critical messages . For example after analyzer component and or decision module conclude that the device is operating at or near the maximum uplink power level manager component can evaluate the messages. However if it has not been determined that mobile device is operating at or near the maximum uplink power level manager component might not distinguish the messages which can conserve mobile device resources and or power . However according to some aspects the messages are identified as non call critical messages or call critical messages regardless of the transmission power utilized by the device.

In an example a non call critical message is a non signaling radio bearer related message. Both the base station and the mobile device can be aware of the messages that are signaling radio bearer related as well as the messages that are non signaling radio bearer related. In another example the non call critical message is a message that includes user data. In still another example the non call critical message is an acknowledgement message in reply to a downlink message . In a further example the non call critical message includes report information. In another example the non call critical message includes status information. In a further example the non call critical message is a message that is not needed for call maintenance.

In an example the call critical message is a signaling radio bearer related message. In another example the call critical message is a voice communication. In a further example the call critical message is a critical control message.

As a result of the determination whether the message is a non call critical message or a call critical message the manager component selectively enables or disables transmission of the message. For example if the message is a call critical message manager component allows the message to be transmitted on the uplink when the mobile device is in the maximum power state . However if the message is a non call critical message the manager component can disable at least temporarily transmission of the message. In such a manner power from the non call critical messages or signals that are not transmitted can be applied to the critical signals for example. In another example a power resource can be conserved and applied to a critical control message. In still another example the power resource can be conserved and applied to a voice communication. In yet another example the power resource can be conserved in order to dynamically control network parameters such as rate matching power offset of physical channels and so forth wherein the power resource can be utilized to provide more power to the signaling radio bearer.

In another example disabling transmission of the non call critical message includes conserving a power resource. Further a power resource of non call critical control signals can be mitigated and the mitigated power resource can be used for a critical message signal and or can be used for critical data signals. In yet another example disabling transmission of the non call critical message includes conserving a power resource. Further to this example bit duration energy from a speech signal can be pushed to increase corresponding bit durations of a call critical signaling message. The pushing of energy from the speech signal can be performed without appreciably degrading the speech signal according to an aspect.

As another example manager component can be configured to conserve energy by temporarily disabling non critical messages and can further be configured to improve the energy into the critical signaling messages. For example manager component can increase a gain of a code carrying the call critical signaling messages and can mitigate the gain of non call critical control signals.

In another example a signal amplitude and a bit energy of the call critical signaling messages can be increased by taking the signal amplitude and the bit energy from non critical call signals and bit energies.

In a further example disabling transmission of the non call critical message can include conserving a power resource and a bit duration energy can be pushed from a speech signal to increase corresponding bit durations of call critical data signals.

In accordance with some aspects information related to one or more of the pre specified power level the maximum uplink power level other criteria related to the power level identification of non call critical messages and identification of call critical messages can be updated dynamically. For example the various information can be provided to the device over the air according to an aspect. Although dynamic updating over the air may utilize more signaling such updating can be advantageous in some cases e.g. limited device processing capabilities rapidly changing conditions parameters or criteria and so forth .

Included in apparatus is an observation component configured to review a transmit power level during an uplink communication. Also included in apparatus is an analyzer component configured to evaluate the transmit power for a defined number of uplink transmissions over a first period. A manager component is configured to selectively suspend at least temporarily one or more messages if the evaluation by analyzer component indicates that the apparatus is operating at or near a maximum transmit power level. For example manager component can selectively suspend one or more non call critical messages which can be a non signaling radio bearer related message. In some aspects manager component is configured to temporarily suspend a set of messages. In an example disabling the set of messages includes disabling a session. A session as utilized herein refers to a condition where there is more than one non critical message. For example the session can be a packet switched session. In an aspect if the session is disabled re initiation of the session is not attempted at least while the apparatus is operating at or near a maximum power level .

In an aspect the manager component includes an enable module and a disable module . The enable module is configured to allow call critical messages to be transmitted by a communication component even though the apparatus is operating at or near maximum transmit power for one or more uplink transmissions. The disable module is configured to at least temporarily disable transmission of one or more non call critical messages on an uplink if the apparatus is operating at or near maximum transmit power for one or more uplink transmissions.

In accordance with some aspects the transmit power evaluated by analyzer component is during a first period. If in response to the evaluation disable module or manager component temporarily disables at least one message from being transmitted the analyzer component is configured to review the uplink power level during a second period. If the apparatus is no longer transmitting at full or near full power the enable module is configured to enable transmission of the message that was previously disabled. However if the apparatus is still transmitting at full or near full power the disable module can continue to disable the messages during the second or a subsequent period.

According to some aspects information related to power level parameters and or identification of critical and non critical signaling messages can be updated dynamically such as over the air. For example communication component can be configured to receive one or more parameters and or identification and convey such information to the analyzer component the manager component and or other components for further analysis and implementation. Although the dynamic signaling over the air uses more signaling it can be advantageous in the case where processing capabilities of the apparatus are limited or where conditions warrant the dynamic updating for example.

In accordance with some aspects apparatus can include memory and a processor . The processor can be coupled to the memory according to some aspects. Although shown as being internal to apparatus either or both the memory and the processor can be external to apparatus. Processor can be configured to execute instructions related to monitoring an uplink power level in order to detect whether apparatus is operating at or near maximum transmit power. Processor can also be configured to execute instructions related to selectively disabling and or enabling the transmission of one or more messages that are not related to signaling and or that are not call critical messages.

In accordance with some aspects processor is configured to utilize power resources which are made available when the message s are selectively disabled for other functions. For example processor can utilize the conserved power resource for a voice communication. In another example processor can utilize the conserved power resource for a critical control message. In a further example processor can utilize the conserved power resource for a signaling radio bearer related message. For example processor can be configured to increase a gain of a code carrying the call critical signaling messages and mitigate the gain of the non call critical control signals. In another example process can increase a signal amplitude and a bit energy of the call critical signaling messages by taking the signal amplitude and the bit energy from non critical call signals and bit energies. In another example the processor can push bit duration energy from a speech signal while not degrading the speech signal appreciably to increase corresponding bit durations of call critical data signals.

Memory can be configured to store information related to transmit power ranges a maximum transmit power available a defined and or configurable number of M uplink transmissions historical transmission power levels location information as well as other parameters associated with transmit power ranges and or transmit power levels.

In accordance with some aspects memory is configured to retain information e.g. historical information related to call drops. For example memory can be configured to retain information related to previous call drop situations diagnosis of reasons why the call was dropped which can be based on information received by communication component or based on analysis by processor or another component of apparatus . In accordance with some aspects memory is configured to retain information related to parameters and or thresholds that were utilized in the past to correct a call drop situation.

According to some aspects machine learning and reasoning is utilized to leverage historical information for improving communication reliability. Machine learning and reasoning can employ principles of probabilistic and decision theoretic inference and rely on predictive models constructed through the use of machine learning procedures. Logic centric inference can also be employed separately or in conjunction with probabilistic methods. For example machine learning and reasoning can infer whether a condition is such that a call drop is likely to occur by obtaining knowledge about the similar conditions e.g. previous call drop situations and the outcome of the similar conditions in the past. Based on this knowledge machine learning and reasoning can make an inference based on which actions to implement e.g. based on diagnosis of a similar condition based on how the condition was corrected in the past which signaling messages to temporarily disable how long to disable the signaling messages and so forth.

The various aspects e.g. in connection with controlling call drop disabling one or more signaling messages and so forth can employ various artificial intelligence based schemes for carrying out various aspects thereof. For example a process for determining if a particular situation resulted in a call drop and a similar situation is once again occurring can be enabled through an automatic classifier system and process.

A classifier is a function that maps an input attribute vector x x1 x2 x3 x4 xn to a confidence that the input belongs to a class that is f x confidence class . Such classification can employ a probabilistic and or statistical based analysis e.g. factoring into the analysis utilities and costs to prognose or infer an action that should be automatically performed e.g. temporarily disabling one or more signaling messages .

A support vector machine SVM is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hypersurface in the space of possible inputs which hypersurface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non triggering events. Intuitively this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near but not identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches include for example na ve Bayes Bayesian networks decision trees neural networks fuzzy logic models and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.

As will be readily appreciated from the subject specification the one or more aspects can employ classifiers that are explicitly trained e.g. through a generic training data as well as implicitly trained e.g. by observing conditions related to communications that were dropped in the past receiving extrinsic information and so forth . For example SVM s are configured through a learning or training phase within a classifier constructor and feature selection module. Thus the classifier s can be used to automatically learn and perform a number of functions as described herein.

At an uplink power level is monitored during a wireless communication. An uplink power level that meets a condition with respect to a pre specified power level is detected at . For example the uplink power level might be at or above the threshold level when a mobile device is at the edge of coverage. In this case the device transmission power can be at a maximum or near maximum power level. When this occurs the chances of a call being dropped or disconnected can become relatively high.

In response to detection that the uplink power level meets the condition transmission of at least one message is disabled at . In some aspects the at least one message that is disabled is a non call critical message on the uplink. According to some aspects the at least one message is an acknowledgement message. In another aspect the at least one message includes report information. In a further aspect the at least one message includes status information. In other aspects the at least one message is a non signaling radio bearer related message. Disabling the transmission of the at least one message at can be temporary wherein transmission of the at least one message can be selectively enabled when the transmission power level is once again lower than the threshold level.

At it is determined that the uplink power level meets the condition with respect to the pre specified power level for a subset of the defined number of uplink transmissions as a function of the evaluation. At transmission of a non signaling radio bearer related message is temporarily disabled.

According to some aspects the evaluation at includes analyzing at the uplink power level during a first period. Further to this aspect the disabling includes conserving a power resource s at . The power resource s can be used for a critical control message and or a voice communication at .

In accordance with some aspects method can include mitigating a power resource of non call critical control signals and sing the mitigated power resource for a critical message signal. According to another aspect method can include mitigating a power resource of non critical data signals and using the mitigated power resource for critical data signals.

In some aspects method include pushing bit duration energy from a speech signal to increase corresponding bit durations of call critical data signals. According to some aspects method can include pushing bit duration energy from a speech signal to increase corresponding bit durations of call critical signaling messages. Further to this aspect method can include increasing a gain of a code carrying the call critical signaling messages and mitigating the gain of non call critical control signals. Additionally or alternatively method can include increasing a signal amplitude and a bit energy of the call critical signaling messages by taking the signal amplitude and the bit energy from non critical call signals and bit energies.

According to some aspects disabling the at least one message includes disabling a non call critical message. The non call critical message can be a non signaling radio bearer related message. In accordance with some aspects the disabling includes disabling transmission of a set of messages. In an aspect disabling the set of messages includes disabling a session.

In accordance with some aspects detecting the uplink power level is at or above a threshold level at is during a first period. Thus at the uplink power level is reviewed during a second period. A determination is made at whether the uplink power is still at or above the threshold level.

If the determination at is that the uplink power is still at or above the threshold level YES continuation of the disabling of the message or set of messages continues at . This can be recursive such that the message or set of messages is disabled until the uplink power level is below the threshold level or when the communication is no longer in process.

If the determination at is that the uplink power is below the threshold level NO at the message or set of messages is enabled for the second period or a subsequent period . Monitoring of the uplink power level can continue at .

In accordance with some aspects information related to power level parameters and or identification of critical and non critical signaling messages can be updated dynamically such as over the air. Further to this aspect method is configured to receive one or more parameters and or identification and perform further analysis of the parameters and or identification and implement an action based on the analysis. Although the dynamic signaling over the air uses more signaling it can be advantageous in the case where processing capabilities are limited or where conditions warrant the dynamic updating for example.

As discussed herein the disclosed aspects can control call drop by selectively disabling uplink transmissions. In some cases fading can be rapid and therefore detection of a maximum power state during a first period can be utilized to place the device in a maximum power state .
