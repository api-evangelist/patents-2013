This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 604 742 filed Feb. 29 2012 under 35 U.S.C. 119. U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 604 742 is incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.

This invention was made with government support under contract No. DE SC0001826 awarded by the Department of Energy and contract No. R21 CA135736 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The Government has certain rights in this invention.

A field of the invention is gamma ray and neutron detectors. Particular applications include nuclear medicine security and astrophysics applications.

Gamma ray radiation detection gamma ray detection is desirable for various applications. As one non limiting example methods such as single photon emission computed tomography SPECT and positron emission tomography PET detect gamma ray radiation for biomedical imaging.

One method of gamma ray detection employs one or more scintillator detectors that emit a flash of light in response to a gamma ray interaction with the detector. This flash of light is typically detected using photomultiplier tubes PMTs which convert the flash of light to electrons for processing by a readout system having suitable circuitry. PMTs however can be quite large. This limits portability or availability of some gamma ray detection systems. Further large amounts of shielding e.g. lead shielding of 500 pounds or more for some imaging applications may be required.

On the other hand solid state detectors increasingly are being used for gamma ray detection. Solid state detectors include a material that directly converts gamma rays to electrons which electrons can be processed by readout systems coupled to the solid state detectors. Example materials for solid state gamma ray detection include detectors that can convert gamma rays to electrons at room temperature such as cadmium zinc telluride CdZnTe or CZT cadmium telluride CdTe and others. CZT and CdTe detectors have been widely used for biomedical imaging applications for instance.

Such solid state detectors have the potential to offer the combination of excellent energy resolution good spatial resolution and at least adequate detection efficiency for gamma rays emitted by common single photon emitters such as I 125 Tc 99m I 123 In 111 and TI 201. In recent years the use of small pixel CZT or CdTe based imaging sensors to replace scintillation detectors for high resolution SPECT imaging applications has been evaluated in the art. There has also been extensive effort in the art towards building positron emission tomography PET systems based on CZT and CdTe detectors.

However certain problems can occur with small pixel CZT and CdTe detectors designed for ultrahigh resolution gamma ray imaging applications. One problem is that charge electron collection efficiency is severely degraded by charge loss and charge sharing effects when the physical dimension of anode pixels approaches the size of the electron cloud created by gamma ray interactions typically a few hundred microns . These effects depredate the accuracy of energy depth of interaction DOI and timing information that can be obtained from the small anode pixels.

Another problem is that as future detectors are pushing for higher spatial resolutions smaller and smaller pixels have to be used. This typically leads to a very large number of pixels to be read out and requires highly complex readout circuitry to extract the energy spatial and timing information needed for gamma ray imaging applications.

A gamma ray detector apparatus is provided by example embodiments of the invention. An example gamma ray apparatus comprises a solid state detector that includes a plurality of anode pixels and at least one cathode. The solid state detector is configured for receiving gamma rays during an interaction and inducing a signal in an anode pixel and in a cathode. An anode pixel readout circuit is coupled to the plurality of anode pixels and is configured to read out and process the induced signal in the anode pixel and provide triggering and addressing information. A waveform sampling circuit is coupled to the at least one cathode and is configured to read out and process the induced signal in the cathode and determine energy of the interaction timing of the interaction and depth of interaction.

An example embodiment of the invention provides among other things a gamma ray radiation detector apparatus. The detector apparatus includes at least one solid state gamma ray detector having one or more anode pixels and one or more cathodes. Preferably the gamma ray detector is highly pixelated e.g. having at least a few hundred m pitch size . A hybrid pixel waveform HPWF readout system is provided to read out signals from the one or more anode signals and the one or more anodes. Particularly the HPWF readout system receives and processes signals from the one or more anode pixels to determine an interaction location and in coincidence receives and processes a waveform from the one or more cathodes to determine energy timing and or depth of interaction DOI . The solid state gamma ray detector can be made of a semiconductor material such as a room temperature semiconductor material. Example semiconductor materials for the solid state gamma ray detectors include CdZnTe CdTe HgI and other semiconductor detector materials.

An example HPWF readout system uses a pixel readout circuit coupled to the one or more anode pixels which receives signals from the anode pixels and provides a pixel address. The pixel readout circuit works in coincidence with a waveform sampling circuit coupled to the one or more cathodes to sample a cathode waveform and provide at least one of energy timing and depth of interaction DOI information.

The combination of pixel readout electronics and high speed waveform sampling circuit for reading out semiconductor detectors is believed to be unique. An example embodiment can provide an effective relatively simple solution for room temperature semiconductors for imaging applications.

Preferred embodiments will now be discussed with respect to the drawings. The drawings include schematic figures that are not to scale which will be fully understood by skilled artisans with reference to the accompanying description. Features may be exaggerated for purposes of illustration. From the preferred embodiments artisans will recognize additional features and broader aspects of the invention.

The example detection apparatus includes a solid state gamma ray detector solid state detector which in an example embodiment includes one or more detector hybrids such as crystals four are shown in formed of semiconductor material and preferably of room temperature semiconductor material. An example crystal thickness is about 1 5 mm though this can vary. In an example embodiment the semiconductor material for the crystals is CZT or a high resistivity p type CdTe. A two dimensional array or other arrangement of anode pixels embodied in metal contacts for instance is disposed at a first side anode side of the solid state detector on surfaces of the crystals . In an example embodiment a steering grid is not provided between anode pixels but in other embodiments a steering grid may be provided. A cathode side is disposed at the opposing side of the solid state detector and includes a cathode for each of the crystals . The cathode can be embodied in for instance a thin metal contact such as gold or other suitable metals. Collimators not shown can be provided as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art.

An example anode pixel array for the solid state detector includes 32 64 pixels having a pixel pitch size of 0.35 mm 0.35 mm though the number of pixels and or the pitch can be greater or smaller and in a particular example embodiment the anode pixels are 300 m 300 m pixels with 50 m gaps between adjacent pixels. The anode pixels sense X Y positions of gamma ray interactions with the solid state detector . Ohmic contacts not shown can be coupled to both the anode side and the cathode side for coupling the anode pixels and the cathodes to readout channels for 32 64 anode pixel array 2048 readout channels . A bias voltage e.g. 200 V though this can be higher or lower can be applied to the cathode side . The Zdirection represents a depth of interaction DOI between the anode side and the cathode side .

During an individual gamma ray interaction a gamma ray which may be but need not be one of a coincidence pair impinges on the solid state detector generating charge clouds and causing a charge Q Q to drift. This induces a signal amplitude on a corresponding anode pixel and a signal on a corresponding cathode .

A readout system is coupled to the solid state detector. For reading out the anode pixels an example readout system includes an anode pixel readout circuit for instance embodied in one or more application specific integrated circuits ASICs eight are provided in that is configured for energy resolved photon counting ERPC . Accordingly a particular example anode pixel readout circuit can also be referred to as an ERPC ASIC though other suitable pixel readout circuits can also be used. The readout system further includes a waveform sampling circuit for reading out signals e.g. waveforms from the cathodes . This waveform sampling circuit can be for instance provided in a readout circuit printed circuit board PCB which can also be configured for reading out the output of the anode pixel readout circuit or can be a separate PCB . The readout system thus is configured for reading anode pixel signals using the anode pixel readout circuit and reading waveforms of the cathodes using the waveform sampling circuit . Accordingly the example readout system provides a hybrid pixel waveform HPWF readout system. The readout system can be connected to a host computer such as but not limited to a personal computer PC not shown via universal serial bus USB not shown or other suitable interface.

The anode pixel readout circuit can be but need not be a highly simplified pixel circuit e.g. with only triggering and addressing capability though other functions could also be provided . Such pixel circuitry can be extended to handle a larger number of small pixels e.g. 

In a particular embodiment the anode pixel readout circuit includes two dimensional 2 D multi pixel circuitry that generally align with and are electrically coupled to the anode pixels e.g. via bump bonds such as indium or other material bump bonds that couple to ohmic contacts on the anode pixels though other electric couplings can be used to provide channels that determine the X Y positions of interactions. Wire bonding pads including control signals power feeds and output signals can be but need not be disposed on one side of the anode pixel readout circuit as shown in and as taught in L. J. Meng et al. A particular example anode pixel readout circuit has dimensions of approximately 22 mm 11 mm and includes 2048 readout channels arranged in an array of 32 64 CMOS pixels . A particular example pixel pitch size is 0.35 mm 0.35 mm which matches the example anode pixel configuration of the solid state detector . The dimensions arrays and or pitch size can vary however.

Each channel e.g. coupled to each anode pixel can include an amplifier e.g. an AC coupled charge sensitive amplifier which is coupled to a peak hold circuit a comparator discriminator and a counter such as but not limited to a multi function counter that is used for both photon counting and A to D conversion. A non limiting example amplifier has a shaping time of 1 s.

In an example embodiment the anode pixel readout circuit can be simplified for instance being configured for providing essentially triggering and addressing capability. However other anode pixel readout circuits can also be configured for other functions. As shown in the anode pixel readout circuit can also include or be coupled to various logic units such as but not limited to coincidence logic disposed on the readout PCB in and address decoding as well as logic for controlling and for selection between readout modes not shown . A control unit such as but not limited to a field programmable gate array FPGA not shown on board computer etc. can control readout operation.

The waveform sampling circuit can be disposed on the readout PCB as shown in or alternatively may be incorporated into a circuit board with all or part of the anode pixel readout circuit . Suitable signal couplings such as but not limited to wire bonds can be provided to couple signals between the board including the anode pixel readout circuit and the readout PCB . An example waveform sampling circuit includes a high speed digitizer coupled to each of the cathodes such as via wire bonds a cathode signal out to read out the pulse waveform induced on each cathode. The digitized cathode waveform can provide precise timing energy and DOI information for gamma ray interactions. A non limiting example high speed digitizer for the waveform sampling circuit is U1084A from Agilent Technologies.

Coupled between each of the cathodes and the waveform sampling circuit is a front end . The front end includes an amplifier such as a discrete pre amplifier a non limiting example of which is Amptek A 250. The amplifier can be integrated on the PCB containing the waveform sampling circuit or on a separate PCB. An output of the pre amplifier can be coupled to an additional amplifier such as a high bandwidth amplifier a non limiting example of which is LNA 2000 RF Bay. The example high bandwidth amplifier which can but need not be integrated on the PCB or a separate PCB amplifies the output of the pre amplifier by for instance a factor of twenty though this amount can be larger or smaller . The digitizer is coupled to the output of the high bandwidth amplifier . A comparator discriminator is also coupled to the output of the pre amplifier and the output of the comparator is fed to the coincidence logic .

In an example operation the anode pixel readout circuitry reads out and processes the anode pixel signals to determine a pixel address. In coincidence with the operation of the anode pixel readout circuitry the waveform sampling circuitry samples the cathode waveforms to determine interaction energy timing and depth of interaction DOI information. The coincidence logic processes both the anode pixel and cathode signals.

In an example processing method both the anode pixel readout circuit and the front end circuitry provide fast timing signal for the control unit to determine anode cathode signal pairs belong to the same gamma ray interaction. The amplified signals from the anode pixels provide X Y position of the interaction and the energy deposition. The waveform sampling circuit records the amplified cathode waveforms and uses digital waveform processing to provide the energy interaction timing information and also provide the depth of interaction DOI information by deriving the charge both electron and hole drifting time. The 3 D interaction location energy and timing information can be used to determine the energy deposition and precisely localize the gamma ray interactions. This information could be used in both spectroscopy and imaging applications.

Example configurations provide one or more benefits for ultrahigh resolution CZT and CdTe detectors used in high rate application. For example the example detection apparatus allows for the use of a highly simplified circuit e.g. only triggering and addressing capability for readout of the anode pixels which can be extended to handle a larger number of small pixels e.g. below 100 micron in dimension . Further using the cathode waveform provides an accurate estimate of the DOI without requiring precise signal amplitude information from the anode pixels . Additionally use of cathode waveforms allows timing information that can be more precise than analogue triggering on either the cathodes or the anode pixels .

The gamma ray detectors can be used alone or as modular detectors in devices such as but not limited to gamma cameras biomedical imaging devices and systems e.g. PET and SPECT systems radiation detectors and other devices. Multiple modular gamma ray detectors can be used in combination according to methods that will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. The example gamma ray detection apparatus can provide a highly effective yet relatively simple solution for room temperature semiconductors for imaging and detection applications.

While various embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described it should be understood that other modifications substitutions and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such modifications substitutions and alternatives can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention which should be determined from the appended claims.
