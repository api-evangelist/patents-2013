If the set top box device determines that the video content is not subject to a blackout or other restriction the method proceeds to block and the set top box device re directs the video content to the remote user device. In an illustrative embodiment the set top box device can send the video content to the remote user device or can instruct a video server or other server of the IPTV system or other video head end to send the video content to the remote user device.

In a particular embodiment if the set top box device determines that the video content is subject to a blackout or other restriction the method advances to block and the set top box device receives location data indicating a location of the remote user device from the IPTV system or other video head end. Continuing to decision node the set top box device determines whether the remote user device is located within a market zone or other location or region where the set top box device is located. If the set top box device determines that the remote user device is located within the market zone of the set top box device for example the method proceeds to decision node and the set top box device determines based on the data received with the video content whether the video content is restricted within the market zone of the set top box device.

If the set top box device determines that the video content is not restricted within the market zone of the set top box device the method proceeds to block and the set top box device can re direct the video content to the remote user device. Whereas in a particular embodiment if the set top box device determines that the video content is restricted within the market zone of the set top box device the method can move to decision node and the set top box device can determine whether the user purchases the video content. For example the set top box device can determine based on data received with the video content that the video content can be purchased and can send a payment interface to the remote user device. If payment information is received via the payment interface the method can proceed to block and the set top box device can re direct the video content to the remote user device. Conversely if payment information is not received the method proceeds to block and the set top box device enforces the blackout or other restriction for instance by not sending the video content to the remote user device by instructing a server of the IPTV system or other video head end to not send the video content to the remote user device by instructing a blackout enforcement application at the remote user device not to send the video content to a display or any combination thereof.

Returning to decision node if the set top box device determines that the remote user device is not located within the market zone or other location of the set top box device the method can proceed to decision node and the set top box device can determine whether the video content is subject to a blackout or other restriction at a location or within a region that includes the location of the remote user device. If the video content is not restricted at a location or within a region that includes the location of the remote user device the method proceeds to block and the set top box device re directs the video content to the remote user device.

Conversely in an illustrative embodiment if the video content is restricted at a location or within a region that includes the location of the remote user device the method can move to decision node and the set top box device can determine whether the video content is restricted at a location or within a region that includes the location of the set top box device. If the set top box device determines that the video content is restricted at a location or within a region that includes the location of the set top box device the method advances to decision node . On the other hand if the set top box device determines that the video content is not restricted or will not be restricted in the future at a location or within a region that includes the location of the set top box device the method can continue to block and the set top box device can record the video content.

Moving to decision node in a particular embodiment the set top box device can determine whether the remote user device is communicating with the IPTV system or other video head end via a private network of a video service provider. If the set top box device determines that the remote user device is not communicating via the private network the method proceeds to block and the set top box device can enforce the blackout or other restriction. On the other hand if the remote user device is communicating via the private network the method moves to decision node and the set top box device determines whether it receives payment information from the remote user device. If the set top box receives payment information the method continues to block and the set top box re directs the requested video content to the remote user device. If the set top box does not receive payment information the method proceeds to block and the set top box device enforces the blackout or other restriction. The method then terminates at .

Referring to a third particular illustrative embodiment of a method of restricting access to video content is illustrated. At block a video server or other server of an Internet Protocol Television IPTV system or other video head end receives video content from an acquisition source. Moving to decision node the server can determine whether the video content is subject to a blackout or other restriction. For example information sent with the video content can indicate whether the video content is subject to such a restriction. Alternatively the server or another server of the IPTV system or other video head end can store data associating certain video content with blackouts or other restrictions. If the server determines that the video content is not subject to a restriction the method can advance to block . Whereas in an illustrative embodiment if the server determines that the video content is subject to a restriction the method can proceed to block and the server can add data to the video content that includes codes or other information indicating market zones or other regions or locations within which the video content is subject to the restriction. The method continues to block .

At block the server receives a request for video content from a set top box device. Moving to block the server sends the requested video content to the set top box device. Continuing to decision node in a particular embodiment the server determines whether it has received a command or instruction to send the video content to a remote user device communicating with the set top box device. In an illustrative embodiment if the server receives such an instruction the method proceeds to block and the server sends the video content to the remote user device via a secure connection. The method terminates at .

In a particular embodiment the steps of the methods described herein can be executed in the order shown by the figures. In alternative embodiments some steps can be executed simultaneously or in alternative sequences.

In conjunction with the configuration of structure described herein the system and method disclosed restrict access to video content that is subject to a blackout or other restriction within one or more market zones or other regions or locations. In a particular illustrative embodiment a user computing device can send a request to a set top box device to receive video content. In an illustrative embodiment the set top box device can communicate with the user computing device via a video distribution network of an Internet Protocol Television IPTV system or other video head end.

The set top box device can request the video content from a video server or other server of the IPTV system or other video head end. In a particular embodiment the set top box device can receive one or more marked data packets related to the video content that include data header information or any combination thereof indicating whether the video content is subject to a blackout or other restriction one or more market zones within which the video content is subject to a blackout or other restriction or any combination thereof.

In an illustrative embodiment the set top box device can re direct the marked data packet s to the user computing device via a re director portion of the set top box device. A blackout enforcement application or other application stored at the user computing device can be adapted to determine whether the requested video content is subject to a blackout or other restriction based on blackout data included in the marked data packet s . In addition the application can be adapted to determine one or more market zones or other regions or locations in which the requested video content is restricted. If the video content is subject to a blackout or other restriction the application can be adapted to communicate with a location server of the IPTV system or other video head end to receive location data indicating a market zone or other location of the user computing device and to cause the user computing device to not display the video content when the video content is subject to a blackout or other restriction at a location or within a region that includes the location of the user computing device.

In another illustrative embodiment the set top box device re director or any combination thereof can determine whether the requested video content is subject to a blackout or other restriction based on the marked data packets. In addition the set top box device re director or any combination thereof can determine one or more market zones or other regions or locations in which the video content is subject to the restriction. Further the set top box device re director or any combination thereof can receive location data from the location server or another server of the IPTV system or other video head end that indicates a location of the user computing device.

The set top box device re director or any combination thereof can determine based at least partially on the marked data packets the location data or any combination thereof whether the video content is subject to a restriction at a location or within a region that includes the location of the user computing device. If the video content is not subject to a restriction at a location or within a region that includes the location of the user computing device the set top box device re director or any combination thereof can re direct the requested video content to the user computing device by sending the video content to the user computing device or instructing a video server or other server of the IPTV system or other video head end to send the video content to the user computing device. If the video content is subject to a restriction at a location or within a region that includes the location of the user computing device the set top box device re director or any combination thereof cannot re direct the requested video content to the user computing device. In an exemplary embodiment the set top box device re director or any combination thereof can send data to the user computing device indicating that the video content cannot be accessed or is unavailable.
