Mobile communication devices have become ubiquitous among people living in nations with developed economies. When a problem occurs a mobile communication device may be serviced by customer care representatives for example by a representative in a retail outlet that sells mobile communication devices. Information about the original manufacturing of the device the initial configuration of the device and or the current configuration of the device may desirably be determined to assist a representative in troubleshooting and or repairing the device. Some mobile communication devices provide such manufacturing and initial configuration information encoded in graphics for example bar codes that are affixed to the device for example inside a battery compartment and behind a battery of the device. Other information about the current configuration of the mobile communication device may be looked up or accessed from a data base via a work station operated by the representative for example by providing information identifying the subject device such as an electronic serial number ESN a mobile station identity MSID a phone number or other identifying information obtained from the graphics affixed inside the battery compartment and or provided by a user of the device.

A mobile communication device for example a mobile phone may pass through a number of states from initial manufacturing to termination of the device for example when melted down to harvest precious metals. A device may be provided to a first owner and activated for wireless communication services. The device may be deactivated and returned to a refurbishing center. The device may then be provided to a second owner and activated for wireless communication services possibly services associated with a different brand or service provider. The device may cycle through these states any number of times. Ultimately the device may be deactivated and terminated.

In an embodiment a mobile communication device is disclosed. The mobile communication device comprises a motherboard a cellular radio frequency transceiver an antenna a processor and a radio frequency identity RFID chip. The motherboard comprises a communication bus. The cellular radio frequency transceiver is communicatively coupled to the communication bus and the antenna is coupled to the cellular radio frequency transceiver. The processor is connected to the communication bus. The radio frequency identity chip is connected to the communication bus. The radio frequency identity chip is configured to operate in a first mode when receiving electrical power derived from a battery of the mobile communication device and to operate in a second mode when electrical power derived from a battery is not available and when receiving electrical power derived from a radio frequency power source.

In an embodiment a mobile communication device is disclosed. The mobile communication device comprises a motherboard a cellular radio frequency transceiver an antenna a processor and a radio frequency identity chip. The motherboard comprises a communication bus. The cellular radio frequency transceiver is communicatively coupled to the communication bus and the antenna is coupled to the cellular radio frequency transceiver. The processor is connected to the communication bus. The radio frequency identity chip is connected to the communication bus. The radio frequency identity chip comprises a memory is configured to provide wireless read access to the memory and is configured to provide write access to the radio frequency identity chip memory to the communication bus.

In an embodiment a radio frequency identity chip is disclosed. The radio frequency identity chip comprises an antenna an electrical power induction component a radio transceiver a memory a connector and a processor. The antenna is configured to receive and transmit information signals as well as to receive power radiated by a radio frequency power source. The electrical power induction component is coupled to the antenna and is configured to derive induced electrical power from the power received by the antenna. The radio transceiver is coupled to the antenna and is configured to transmit and receive radio signals via the antenna. The connector is coupled to the memory and is configured for coupling the radio frequency identity chip to a communication bus of a circuit board and for coupling the radio frequency identity chip to a battery derived source of power provided by the circuit board. The processor is coupled to the connector to the memory and to the radio transceiver. The processor is configured to read from the memory in response to a request received by the radio transceiver and to provide the information read from the memory to the radio transceiver for transmitting and to read from the connector and to write the information read from the connector to the memory. The radio frequency identity chip promotes reading from the memory via near field communications interaction with the antenna and radio transceiver and promotes writing to the memory via the connector.

These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.

It should be understood at the outset that although illustrative implementations of one or more embodiments are illustrated below the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented using any number of techniques whether currently known or not yet in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations drawings and techniques illustrated below but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.

Obtaining information about a mobile communication device may be desirable at numerous points in the life of the device. It is useful to be able to quickly and automatically identify and determine manufacturing information and configuration information about devices in a distribution center or order fulfillment center for example to quickly scan all the devices stored in a master carton on a palette in a warehouse. It is useful to be able to quickly and automatically identify and determine manufacturing information and configuration information about devices in a customer service environment for example in a retail store where wireless communication subscribers might take their device to have a problem diagnosed and repaired.

In the case of determining information about a device at a retail store devices in the past often provided some of this information in one or more bar codes under the removable battery. Devices however are evolving to non removable batteries that is not removable by an end user or a customer service representative in a retail store and providing a bar code behind the battery cover may not be useful to customer service representatives in determining this information under those circumstances. Putting the graphical information on an exterior of the device is not an aesthetically acceptable alternative. It is understood that quickly and automatically determining this information about mobile communication devices from a sizeable assemblage of devices in a shipping box on a palette in a warehouse may not be practicable using the bar coded information. Additionally even in the current system employing bar codes that are readily accessible the bar codes may be smudged or torn over time and hence may not be readable by a bar code scanner. When a store employee attempts to enter in the bar code number manually for example by typing the numbers in using a keyboard the employee may make errors. Even if no errors occur while entering the bar code number the process may be slow and tedious diminishing the customer satisfaction with the retail store and or the wireless service provider or brand associated with the mobile communication device.

The present disclosure teaches a new system for making this information about a mobile communication device easily and automatically available for scanning. Note that bar codes may continue to be provided in an interior of the mobile communication device notwithstanding the teachings of the present disclosure as a back up measure. The information may be stored in a radio frequency identity RFID chip coupled to the device. The information stored in the RFID chip may include information about the manufacturing of the device information about an initial configuration of the device as well as information about a current configuration of the device. In an embodiment the information stored in the RFID chip is not used to drive the behavior of the device as for example applications on the device reading from the RFID chip to select between different execution paths based on the read parameter values. It is contemplated that the applications instead will read parameters stored in conventional memory of the device to determine their execution paths and that the information stored in the RFID chip will be read by external scanners.

This information may be referred to as a biographical digest. As the device is modified for example as a new preferred roaming list PRL is configured into a mobile phone the RFID chip information may be correspondingly updated to remain current and accurate. The information stored in the RFID chip may be read by an appropriate scanning device even when the device is turned off when the battery of the device is depleted or when the battery of the device is not installed as for example when the device is stowed in its original shipping box and the battery is not installed prior to initial distribution to a user. For example a near field communication NFC scanner may radiate an energizing radio field from which the RFID chip may derive energizing power even when no power is provided to the RFID chip from a battery in the device. The information stored in the RFID chip brings together in one location information that may currently be stored in separate disparate memory locations in the mobile communication device and or distributed across multiple separate systems.

The RFID chip may be electrically coupled to the device for example wired to receive power from a battery of the device at least in some modes of operation and wired to be communicatively coupled to a processor of the device and or to a data bus to an address bus and or to a memory bus of the device. In an embodiment the RFID chip may be read from by an NFC scanner or other near field communication device and written to by the processor and or the data bus of the device. For example in an embodiment the processor may assert one or more addresses mapped to the RFID chip on an address bus of the device and write to memory storage within the RFID chip over a data bus of the device.

In an embodiment the RFID chip is connected to a communication bus of a motherboard of the mobile communication device. As used herein a communication bus provides communication among a plurality of components of the mobile communication device. The communication bus may be comprised of an address bus and a data bus. The communication bus may further be comprised of a control line or a plurality of control lines to command devices to read from the communication bus for example to read from the data bus or to write to the communication bus for example to write to the data bus. The communication bus may further be comprised of a strobe line or a plurality of strobe lines that may trigger a component that is identified by an address asserted on the address bus to read data asserted on the data bus when the strobe line is strobed for example when the state of the strobe line is changed toggled or cycled. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the teachings of the disclosure may be practiced and used advantageously using other methods and sequences of transmitting and receiving data via communication buses by and among components connected to the same motherboard.

The RFID chip connected to the motherboard is configured to operate on battery power when the mobile communication device provides battery power e.g. the battery is installed and is sufficiently charged and to operate on electrical energy induced in an antenna of the RFID chip by the NFC scanner when battery sourced power is unavailable. The RFID chip may promote writing to the RFID memory for example the biographical digest from the communication bus of the motherboard and promote reading from the RFID memory for example the biographical digest via a near field communication wireless communication link for example with the NFC scanner.

The RFID chip and or a processor of the RFID chip may enforce a rule or policy that only the communication bus of the motherboard may write to the biographical digest area of the RFID memory. The RFID chip and or processor of the RFID chip may enforce a rule or policy that only the communication bus of the motherboard may write to any area of RFID memory. In an embodiment writing to the biographical digest of the RFID chip is restricted to a write command and or data passing over the communication bus to the RFID chip. In an embodiment the write command and or data passed over the communication bus to the RFID chip may originate or be written by any component of the mobile communication device that is coupled to the communication bus.

By restricting write access to the biographical digest area of the RFID memory or possibly to all of the RFID memory to the communication bus of the motherboard of the mobile communication device it may be possible to achieve a higher level of security control over the biographical digest area of the RFID memory or possibly all of the RFID memory. The mobile communication device may execute security protocols as a precondition for allowing write access to the RFID memory. For example the operating system of the mobile communication device may invoke a trusted application executing in a trusted security zone of the mobile communication device to write to the address space corresponding to the RFID memory and or the biographical digest area of the RFID memory. Said in other words the operating system may invoke a proxy application to mediate write requests to the RFID memory and or the biographical digest area of the RFID memory where the proxy executes in a trusted security zone of the mobile communication device and where the proxy alone is permitted to write to the RFID memory and or to the biographical digest area of the RFID memory. Further details about trusted security zones are provided below.

Alternatively the RFID chip and or processor of the RFID chip may allow writing the RFID memory from either the communication bus or from the NFC scanner. In an embodiment the RFID chip may promote writing to a portion of memory on the RFID chip that is not associated with the biographical digest. The communication bus may be able to read from this non biographical digest portion of memory. The processor of the RFID chip may arbitrate between attempts to concurrently access the non biographical digest portion of memory.

The present disclosure further teaches a hybrid radio frequency identity tag substantially like that described above but used in different electronic devices. Said in another way the present disclosure teaches a radio frequency identity tag component. The radio frequency identity tag component is configured to draw electrical power from a battery source if available or to capture incident radio frequency energy to power itself. The radio frequency identity tag comprises a memory that is readable from an external NFC scanner and writeable from a communication connector of the RFID chip that may be connected to a communication bus of another device or system.

In an embodiment the information about the mobile communication device stored in the RFID chip is desirably partitioned into a static portion and a dynamic portion. The static portion contains information that does not change over the entire lifecycle of the device for example an identity of a manufacturer of the device a location of manufacturing of the device an initial hardware version of the device an initial software version of the device and the like. The dynamic portion contains information that may change over the lifecycle of the device for example a current hardware version of the device a current software version of the device a current preferred roaming list PRL of the device a phone number of the device a lifecycle state of the device and the like. At the end of the life of the device the dynamic portion may also be rendered non writeable to prevent further writing and or modification of the dynamic portion

The use of an RFID chip to store the information about the mobile communication device described in summary above can provide a number of advantages. A number of mobile communication devices may be scanned quickly and automatically through a master carton containing the mobile communication devices in their individual shipping boxes with no battery installed in the devices in a distribution center and or fulfillment center. A mobile communication device presented for service at a retail store can be quickly and automatically scanned to obtain information useful for providing customer service. When the mobile communication device is returned for refurbishment or for final disposal a device status of refurbish or terminate may be written to the RFID chip from an NFC scanner writer. Alternatively the device status of refurbish or terminate may be written to the RFID chip from the communication bus of the mobile communication device via the connector of the RFID chip. A mobile communication device having a terminate device status written in its RFID chip may be prevented from reactivation.

A trusted security zone provides chipsets with a hardware root of trust a secure execution environment for applications and secure access to peripherals. A hardware root of trust means the chipset should only execute programs intended by the device manufacturer or vendor and resists software and physical attacks and therefore remains trusted to provide the intended level of security. The chipset architecture is designed to promote a programmable environment that allows the confidentiality and integrity of assets to be protected from specific attacks. Trusted security zone capabilities are becoming features in both wireless and fixed hardware architecture designs. Providing the trusted security zone in the main mobile device chipset and protecting the hardware root of trust removes the need for separate secure hardware to authenticate the device or user. To ensure the integrity of the applications requiring trusted data such as a mobile financial services application the trusted security zone also provides the secure execution environment where only trusted applications can operate safe from attacks. Security is further promoted by restricting access of non trusted applications to peripherals such as data inputs and data outputs while a trusted application is running in the secure execution environment. In an embodiment the trusted security zone may be conceptualized as hardware assisted security.

A complete trusted execution environment TEE may be implemented through the use of the trusted security zone hardware and software architecture. The trusted execution environment is an execution environment that is parallel to the execution environment of the main mobile device operating system. The trusted execution environment and or the trusted security zone may provide a base layer of functionality and or utilities for use of applications that may execute in the trusted security zone. For example in an embodiment trust tokens may be generated by the base layer of functionality and or utilities of the trusted execution environment and or trusted security zone for use in trusted end to end communication links to document a continuity of trust of the communications. For more details on establishing trusted end to end communication links relying on hardware assisted security see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 532 588 filed Jun. 25 2012 entitled End to end Trusted Communications Infrastructure by Leo Michael McRoberts et al. which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Through standardization of application programming interfaces APIs the trusted execution environment becomes a place to which scalable deployment of secure services can be targeted. A device which has a chipset that has a trusted execution environment on it may exist in a trusted services environment where devices in the trusted services environment are trusted and protected against attacks. The trusted execution environment can be implemented on mobile phones and tablets as well as extending to other trusted devices such as personal computers servers sensors medical devices point of sale terminals industrial automation handheld terminals automotive etc.

The trusted security zone is implemented by partitioning all of the hardware and software resources of the mobile device into two partitions a secure partition and a normal partition. Placing sensitive resources in the secure partition can protect against possible attacks on those resources. For example resources such as trusted software applications may run in the secure partition and have access to hardware peripherals such as a touchscreen or a secure location in memory. Less secure peripherals such as wireless radios may be disabled completely while the secure partition is being accessed while other peripherals may only be accessed from the secure partition. While the secure partition is being accessed through the trusted execution environment the main mobile operating system in the normal partition is suspended and applications in the normal partition are prevented from accessing the secure peripherals and data. This prevents corrupted applications or malware applications from breaking the trust of the device.

The trusted security zone is implemented by partitioning the hardware and software resources to exist in a secure subsystem which is not accessible to components outside the secure subsystem. The trusted security zone is built into the processor architecture at the time of manufacture through hardware logic present in the trusted security zone which enables a perimeter boundary between the secure partition and the normal partition. The trusted security zone may only be manipulated by those with the proper credential and in an embodiment may not be added to the chip after it is manufactured. Software architecture to support the secure partition may be provided through a dedicated secure kernel running trusted applications. Trusted applications are independent secure applications which can be accessed by normal applications through an application programming interface in the trusted execution environment on a chipset that utilizes the trusted security zone.

In an embodiment the normal partition applications run on a first virtual processor and the secure partition applications run on a second virtual processor. Both virtual processors may run on a single physical processor executing in a time sliced fashion removing the need for a dedicated physical security processor. Time sliced execution comprises switching contexts between the two virtual processors to share processor resources based on tightly controlled mechanisms such as secure software instructions or hardware exceptions. The context of the currently running virtual processor is saved the context of the virtual processor being switched to is restored and processing is restarted in the restored virtual processor. Time sliced execution protects the trusted security zone by stopping the execution of the normal partition while the secure partition is executing.

The two virtual processors context switch via a processor mode called monitor mode when changing the currently running virtual processor. The mechanisms by which the processor can enter monitor mode from the normal partition are tightly controlled. The entry to monitor mode can be triggered by software executing a dedicated instruction the Secure Monitor Call SMC instruction or by a subset of the hardware exception mechanisms such as hardware interrupts which can be configured to cause the processor to switch into monitor mode. The software that executes within monitor mode then saves the context of the running virtual processor and switches to the secure virtual processor.

The trusted security zone runs a separate operating system that is not accessible to the device users. For security purposes the trusted security zone is not open to users for installing applications which means users do not have access to install applications in the trusted security zone. This prevents corrupted applications or malware applications from executing powerful instructions reserved to the trusted security zone and thus preserves the trust of the device. The security of the system is achieved at least in part by partitioning the hardware and software resources of the mobile phone so they exist in one of two partitions the secure partition for the security subsystem and the normal partition for everything else. Placing the trusted security zone in the secure partition and restricting access from the normal partition protects against software and basic hardware attacks. Hardware logic ensures that no secure partition resources can be accessed by the normal partition components or applications. A dedicated secure partition operating system runs in a virtual processor separate from the normal partition operating system that likewise executes in its own virtual processor. Users may install applications on the mobile device which may execute in the normal partition operating system described above. The trusted security zone runs a separate operating system for the secure partition that is installed by the mobile device manufacturer or vendor and users are not able to install new applications in or alter the contents of the trusted security zone.

Turning now to a system is described. In an embodiment system comprises a mobile communication device . The mobile communication device comprises a radio frequency identity RFID chip that comprises a biographical digest a near field communication NFC transceiver an RFID antenna and a logic processor . In an embodiment the RFID chip is connected or communicatively coupled to a mother board or circuit board of the mobile device and is connected or communicatively coupled to one or more of a memory bus a data bus and or an address bus of the mother board.

The mobile communication device may further comprise a memory a central processing unit CPU a cellular transceiver and a general purpose near field communication transceiver . The biographical digest may be abstractly considered to be part of the memory or part of the memory map of the mobile communication device because the biographical digest via the mediation of an application may be addressable on an address bus and readable via a data bus and or memory bus of the mobile communication device .

The general purpose NFC transceiver may be used for completing point of sale POS transactions for obtaining access to a building via a handshake with an electronic entry scanner for paying mass transit system fares and for other transactions or exchanges of confidential information associated with application layer functionality visible to a user of the device .

The cellular transceiver may communicate with a network via a wireless communication link that may be established with a base transceiver station that is communicatively coupled to the network . The wireless communication link may be established in accordance with any of a code division multiple access CDMA wireless protocol a global system for mobile communication GSM wireless protocol a long term evolution LTE wireless protocol a worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX wireless protocol or other cellular communication wireless protocol. The wireless communication link between the cellular transceiver and the base transceiver station may support voice communication and or data communication. These communication modes may include voice to voice communication short message service SMS communication multimedia message service MMS communication email communication HTTP communication such as retrieving hypertext markup language HTML content from a web server or other content server.

The network may comprise one or more private networks one or more public networks and or a combination thereof. It is understood that the system may comprise any number of base transceiver stations and any number of mobile devices . In an embodiment a service station such as a retail store clerk work station or a customer care work station may be communicatively coupled to the network . In an embodiment a server computer may be coupled to the network and able to communicate to the mobile communication device via the network and the base transceiver station .

In an embodiment a near field communication NFC scanner may be communicatively coupled to the network . The NFC scanner may provide an energizing radio field to activate and or provide power to the RFID chip and may read information from the RFID chip for example may read the biographical digest and or the information contained in the biographical digest from the RFID chip . The NFC scanner communicates with the RFID chip using near field communications. As used herein near field communications employed by the NFC scanner may be limited to relatively short distance for example less than about 20 inches or less than about 10 inches. At the same time the present disclosure contemplates use of a NFC scanner that may communicate using stronger fields that are effective over greater distances and or that are able to penetrate cardboard master shipping cartons and or individual shipping containers for mobile communication devices. Because the NFC scanner may provide the energizing radio field the RFID chip may be scanned by the NFC scanner even when the mobile communication device is turned off when a battery not shown of the device is not installed and or when the battery of the device is discharged. In an embodiment the NFC scanner may be able to write into a storage location of the RFID chip that is separate from the biographical digest and the application may read the information written into the storage location of the RFID chip by the NFC scanner .

In an embodiment the biographical digest comprises information about the mobile communication device for example a manufacturer identity a device model identity an initial hardware version identity an initial software version identity an initial preferred roaming list identity a current software version identity a current preferred roaming list identity and other information about the device . The biographical digest may comprise a static portion and a dynamic portion . The biographical digest may be stored in a memory portion of the RFID chip for example a semiconductor memory portion.

In an embodiment the memory area corresponding to the static portion may be physically separated from the memory area corresponding to the dynamic portion . Alternatively the static portion and the dynamic portion may not be physically separated but the write functionality of the static portion may be separately configured and or controlled from the write functionality of the dynamic portion . In either case the separation of the memory area corresponding to the static portion from the memory area corresponding to the dynamic portion may be referred to as bifurcated memory or a bifurcation of at least a portion of the memory storage of the RFID chip .

After the static portion is written to for example upon completion of the manufacturing cycle of the device the write functionality for the static portion may be disabled for example by blowing fuses in the write lines associated with the static portion while leaving intact the fuses in the corresponding write lines associated with the dynamic portion . The fuses in the write lines associated with the dynamic portion may be blown at an end of a lifecycle of the device for example when the device has transitioned to a dead or terminated status. Alternatively the writing to the static portion may be prevented by a biographical digest software layer and or application for example an application described further hereinafter that mediates write access to the static portion . In an embodiment the static portion may be partially written to after the initial writing for example in the case where some or all of the static information is stored in memory that has experienced a hardware failure. The hardware failure may be detected for example by an application described below and the static portion rewritten possibly mapped into a different portion of the static portion to avoid the failed memory locations.

In an embodiment information that is contained in the static portion remains constant and unchanged over the life of the mobile device while the information that is contained in the dynamic portion of the biographical digest may change for example as revised software firmware provisioning information and configuration information is installed on the mobile device . The contents of the biographical digest the static portion and the dynamic portion are discussed in more detail below with reference to .

An application may be stored in the memory and executed by the central processing unit to write to the dynamic portion of the biographical digest via one or more buses of the mobile device . The application may implement and or enforce rules for accessing and interacting with the biographical digest . The application may implement control rules and or a software layer for managing the biographical digest over the lifecycle of the device . The software layer may be implemented as an application as illustrated and or as functionality encapsulated in an operating system of the mobile communication device . For further details of a software layer for managing the biographical digest see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 857 138 filed Apr. 4 2013 entitled System for Managing a Digest of Biographical Information Stored in a Radio Frequency Identity Chip Coupled to a Mobile Communication Device by Kevin R. Cordes et al. which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In an embodiment the RFID chip and or the application may expect an authorization key or token as a precondition for writing to the dynamic portion of the biographical digest.

In an embodiment the processor may transmit data to the RFID chip to be written to the biographical digest for example to the dynamic portion over a data bus of the device . The processor may transmit data to the RFID chip by invoking and executing the application . The logic processor may receive the data from the data bus of the device and write it to the dynamic portion . In an embodiment the processor and or the application may parse the data to extract an authorization key and or authorization token validate the authorization key or token and provided the authorization key or token successfully validates write the data to the dynamic portion . Alternatively the logic processor may validate an authorization key or token before writing data to the dynamic portion .

Data that is written by the processor to the dynamic portion may be transmitted to the mobile device from a device coupled to the network via the base transceiver station . For example the service station may transmit data to the processor to write to the dynamic portion . The service station may transmit for example data that resets error codes encoded in the dynamic portion of the biographical digest . As another example a software update may be performed over the air and a remote management server not show of a wireless communication service provider that is coupled to the network may transmit data that revises a current software version of the dynamic portion of the biographical digest .

Data may be read from the RFID chip by the NFC scanner . The NFC scanner may parse the biographical digest into the static portion and or the dynamic portion and extract the information encoded and or encapsulated in the biographical digest . Alternatively the NFC scanner may provide the biographical digest intact to a computer not shown that is communicatively coupled to the NFC scanner and that computer may parse extract and analyze the biographical digest. The information obtained from the biographical digest may be used in a variety of ways as further illustrated with reference to use cases described below.

The mobile communication device may be any of a mobile phone a personal digital assistant PDA a media player a laptop computer a notebook computer a tablet computer a removable wireless interface component a head unit or telematics unit configured for installation into a vehicle or other mobile communication device. The service station and or the NFC scanner may be implemented as computers. Computer systems are described in detail hereinafter.

Turning now to and further details of the mobile communication device and of the RFID chip are described. In an embodiment the mobile communication device comprises a motherboard . As known by one skilled in the art a motherboard may also be known as a circuit board and may serve a variety of purposes in an electronic device. A motherboard may provide a structure to which components may be attached or coupled to secure them within a package and to protect the components from shock. A motherboard may provide electrical circuits and or couplings among components for example power distribution lines data buses address buses memory buses control lines control buses and the like. The motherboard provides an address bus and a data bus . In some contexts the buses may be referred to collectively as a communication bus. The cellular transceiver the processor the memory and the RFID chip may be secured or attached to the motherboard .

The cellular transceiver may be communicatively coupled to the buses . The cellular transceiver may be connected directly to the buses or connected indirectly to the buses for example communicatively coupled to the buses by a modulator demodulator component or other component.

The processor may be directly connected to the buses or indirectly connected to the buses for example connected via a socket connection to the buses . The memory may be directly connected to the buses or indirectly connected to the buses for example connected via a socket connection to the buses . The RFID chip may be directly connected to the buses or indirectly connected to the buses for example connected via a socket connection to the buses or by another connection. In an embodiment the RFID chip may be connected to the busses by surface mounting connector pins of the RFID chip by soldering to the busses . In embodiment the RFID chip may be interfaced to the busses by one or more adapter components not shown in the mobile communication device . For example an adapter component may mediate reading and writing access to the RFID chip memory to adapt between different processing speeds of the busses and the RFID chip . Additionally the adapter component may map a larger address space on the address bus to a smaller address space of the RFID chip memory . For example the adapter component may map address bits of the larger address space of the address bus to address bits of the smaller address space of the RFID chip memory . It is understood that different numbers of address bits for both the address bus and for the address space of the RFID chip memory than those used in the above example are consistent with the teachings of this disclosure.

The mobile communication device may comprise a battery that may provide power via a power distribution channel provided by the motherboard . In an embodiment the power sourced by the battery is conditioned by an electronic component not shown that delivers a relatively constant direct current voltage to components even as the terminal voltage of the battery drops as the energy capacity of the battery is discharged. The RFID chip further comprises an electric power induction component that derives power from radio frequency energy incident on the antenna for example radio frequency energy radiated by the NFC scanner . The RFID chip may be powered by the power derived from radiated radio frequency energy by the electric power induction component .

The RFID memory may comprise in addition to the static portion and dynamic portion described above a near field communication writable portion . This portion of the RFID memory may be writeable by the NFC scanner or other external NFC transceiver and may be readable from the buses for example by the application executing on the processor .

The RFID chip may further comprise a connector for coupling the RFID chip into a circuit board for example into the motherboard of the mobile communication device or into another electronic device. The connector may provide connections to the address bus to the data bus to a memory bus to a control line to a control bus to a strobe line to a battery sourced power line and to other functions. It is understood that the connector may be implemented in a variety of ways. The connector may comprise sockets configured for receiving pins or plugs to connect to external wires or communication lines for example to the address bus to the data bus to a memory bus to a control line to a control bus to a strobe line to a battery sourced power line and to other functions. The connector may comprise pins or plugs that are configured for insertion into sockets to connect to external wires or communication lines for example to the address bus to the data bus to a memory bus to a control line to a control bus to a strobe line to a battery sourced power line and to other functions. The connector may comprise wire leads configured for soldering or otherwise fusing to external wires or communication lines for example the address bus to the data bus to a memory bus to a control line to a control bus to a strobe line to a battery sourced power line and to other functions for example the connector may comprise wire leads suitable for using surface mount techniques to fuse the wire leads to wires or communication lines on the motherboard .

In an embodiment the RFID chip comprises a static portion write enable electrical or mechanical cutout and a dynamic portion write enable electrical or mechanical cutout . The write enable switch blocks can be used to disable and or to enable writing data to the respective portion of the RFID memory from the connector for example from the buses . In an embodiment the write enable electrical or mechanical cutouts may be implemented as fuses. When a write enable signal is asserted via the electrical or mechanical cutout the subject static portion or dynamic portion is enabled for writing. When no write enable signal is asserted via the electrical or mechanical cutouts the subject static portion or dynamic portion cannot be written to. If the subject electrical or mechanical cutout is implemented as a fuse and the fuse is blown the write enable signal cannot be asserted to the subject portion and hence data cannot be written to the static portion or dynamic portion as the case may be. Alternatively rather than fuses the electrical or mechanical cutouts may be implemented as other devices for example a device that can be set to hold a non volatile state until commanded changed.

Turning now to details of a possible embodiment of the RFID chip are discussed. In an embodiment the RFID chip may operate at a different processing speed and promote accessing the RFID memory at a different speed depending on whether the RFID chip is powered by electrical power derived from an external radiated radio frequency power field for example electrical energy captured by the antenna and derived by the electrical induction component or powered by battery derived power supplied from the motherboard via the connector . When the RFID chip is powered by battery derived power the processor may execute significantly faster e.g. generating a higher clock rate and executing more instructions per unit of time for example at least 100 times faster at least 1000 times faster or at least 10 000 times faster than when powered from the electrical induction component . Likewise the memory may be accessed at higher read and or write rates when the RFID chip is powered by battery derived power than when it is powered from the electrical induction component .

It is understood that the RFID chip may achieve these different rates of processing and or memory access in a variety of ways. illustrates one possible approach to implementing the RFID chip but it is understood other methods of providing different rates of processing and or memory access are also consistent with the teachings of the present disclosure. In an embodiment the processor may comprise a first processor that receives battery derived power from the connector and a second processor that receives power from the electrical induction component . The first processor is configured to operate at a first execution rate and the second processor is configured to operate at a second execution rate where the second execution rate is at least 100 times slower than the first execution rate. The processor may transmit information to and receive information from the NFC transceiver via a modem . In an embodiment the modem may comprise a first modem that receives battery derived power from the connector and a second modem that receives power from the electrical power induction component . The first modem is configured to operate at a third execution rate and the second modem is configured to operate at a fourth execution rate where the fourth execution rate is at least 100 times slower than the third execution rate.

When battery derived power is received from the connector a first switch is switched to connect the first modem to the NFC transceiver and to disconnect the second modem from the NFC transceiver . Additionally when battery derived power is received from the connector a second switch is switched to connect the first processor to the RFID memory and to disconnect the second processor from the RFID memory . When battery derived power is not received from the connector the first switch is switched to connect the second modem to the NFC transceiver and to disconnect the first modem from the NFC transceiver. Additionally when battery derived power is not received from the connector the second switch is switched to connect the second processor to the RFID memory and to disconnect the first processor from the RFID memory .

In this way the RFID chip may support different rates of processing and or different rates of accessing the RFID memory depending on what type of electrical power is available. It is understood that other implementations are contemplated by the present disclosure for providing these different rates of processing and or access to the RFID memory . For example in an embodiment a single processor may be configured to operate at different processing rates depending on the electrical power that it receives. Likewise in an embodiment a single modem may be configured to operate at different processing rates depending on the electrical power that it receives.

Turning now to details of an alternative embodiment of the mobile communication device are described. In an embodiment the mobile communication device provides a trusted execution environment and or a trusted security zone . Trusted execution environments and trusted security zones were described further above. That lengthy description will not be repeated here. The purpose of is to illustrate an embodiment of how the application may be executed as a trusted application. The application may be stored as application instructions in a trusted memory segment or partition and executed as application process thread task or other execution entity by a trusted security zone of the central processing unit . The central processing unit may also comprise a normal execution portion or a permissive zone where normal applications may execute. In this way the actions taken by the application may be assured to be secure.

Turning now to and further details of the biographical digest are described. The term biographical is employed to suggest that the information contained is biographical and tells a story about the device . This story comprises information about the current state of the device as well as about the birth or origins of the device . The information about the birth or origins of the device are stored in the static portion and is intended to remain constant fixed and unchanged over the life of the device . The information about the current state of the device are stored in the dynamic portion and is intended to be updated and modified as the state of the device changes for example as the software of the device is changed as the device is rebranded as the communication service associated with the device changes and as other like changes occur. The term digest is used to imply that the information may be combined or digested into a compact and or encoded form suitable for storing writing and reading efficiently.

In an embodiment the biographical digest may comprise from about 200 characters of information to about 500 characters of information. It will be appreciated however that the teachings of the present disclosure are applicable to a biographical digest of any size. As semiconductor manufacturing technology and radio frequency identity chip manufacturing technology evolve and improve it would be expected that the size of the biographical digest may increase with increased processing power and or increased memory storage capacity of the radio frequency identity chip state of the art.

In an embodiment the static portion may comprise information indicating one or more of a federal communications commission FCC identity a device model identity an initial hardware version identity a manufacturer identity a country of manufacturing identity e.g. the identity of the country in which the device was manufactured a date of manufacture an identity of a location of manufacture an initial software version identity an initial preferred roaming list PRL identity an original stock keeping unit SKU number or identity and or an original universal product code UPC . It is understood that other information associated with the initial state of condition of the device may also be stored in the static portion for example test results inspector identity assembly line identity and the like.

In an embodiment the static portion may comprise one or more initial security keys and or authorization keys for example a trusted security zone master key a secure element SE key or other security and or authorization keys. Such keys or tokens may be stored in an encrypted form. A trusted security zone may be installed on the mobile communication device to provide a hardware assisted security for example based on either separate processors or separate virtual processors.

The static portion may be writeable only during a manufacturing stage of the device . Upon completion of the manufacturing the write access to the static portion may desirably be blocked for example fuses in the data write lines coupled to the static portion may be blown thereby isolating the write inputs of the static portion . Alternatively the static portion may be disabled for writing in another way. In an embodiment the application may enforce the block on writing to the static portion . The manufacturing process may comprise writing to the static portion verifying the accuracy of the information written to the static portion and only then disabling writing to the static portion .

In an embodiment the dynamic portion may comprise information indicating one or more of a current software version identity a current preferred roaming list identity a current stock keeping unit identity or number a current universal product code a current device status a communication subscription service activation date a phone number a current mobile equipment identity MEID a current international mobile station equipment identity a current communication service provider identity a current communication service brand identity and other information about the current state and or configuration of the device and or its communication service plan.

The device status may assume a number of values such as new refurbished activated dead or terminated and or other values. The device status may be employed by the device to control operation modes of the device . For example if the device status has been set to dead or terminated the device may not allow itself to attempt to connect to the base transceiver station or to perform any other kind of radio communication. The device in the dead or terminated status may further prevent presentation on a display of the device or responding to inputs of any control input of the device . The device status may be associated with a lifecycle of the device described below with reference to .

In an embodiment the dynamic portion may further comprise error codes. For example as different processing errors or communications failures are experienced by the device the application may determine an error code associated with the condition and write this into an error codes portion of the dynamic portion . The error codes may comprise a concatenation of one or more error codes. For example an error code may comprise an error identity and optionally further information about the error. The error codes may be indefinitely extendable by adding more error codes as errors occur at the tail end of the error codes. In an embodiment a specific error code may be repeated in the error codes as often as the error has occurred. Alternatively a specific error code may only be allowed to appear once in the error codes.

Alternatively the error codes may comprise a vector where each element of the vector corresponds to a given error condition and if the element is set one or more instances of the corresponding specific error has been experienced by the device and if the element is not set no instance of the corresponding specific error has been experienced by the device . The error codes may be reset to an initial state indicating no errors have occurred for example by a customer service representative after reading the error codes. The error codes may be used by a customer service representative to promote troubleshooting and correcting any problems that the device may have.

In an embodiment the dynamic portion may comprise a counter that indicates how many times the dynamic portion and or the biographical digest has been written to. Some RFID chips may be specified as able to sustain a limited number of write cycles and the counter may be used to identify when the RFID chip may be reaching the end of its reliable life. When the counter indicates that the RFID chip has exceeded a threshold of reliable write cycles the application may present a notification to a user of the mobile communication device of the condition.

In an embodiment the biographical digest desirably may not contain any private information related to a user of the mobile communication device for example no personal address no name no identification number such as a social security number or employee number. The biographical digest may desirably be standardized for use across a plurality of different models of mobile communication devices to promote using common NFC scanning equipment and or common parsing software.

One of skill in the art will appreciate that the system described above may be applied in a variety of different and useful ways. Several particular use cases are now described to provide further insight into how the system may be applied but it is understood that the disclosure contemplates other applications that are not described here to avoid prolixity and to promote conciseness.

In an embodiment the system may be usefully applied in a distribution center and or an order fulfillment center. An order fulfillment center may receive mobile communication devices from several different original equipment manufacturers OEMs . The order fulfillment center may ship these same mobile communication devices to retail stores for selling to walk in customers to enterprises for distribution to their employees for use in their day to day work and to individuals who order a single mobile communication device for their personal use. The numbers and the mix of different models of mobile communication devices that may be shipped to these different categories of end users or in the case of the retail store an intermediate user may be different. In an embodiment a large order fulfillment center may handle between about 1 million to about 2 million mobile communication devices per month. Alternatively a smaller order fulfillment center may handle between about 100 000 to about 200 000 mobile communication devices per month. The processes for handling these large volumes of device may benefit from the use of aspects of the system .

For example when such large volumes of mobile communication devices are flowing through an order fulfillment center there may be problems with pilferage. The order fulfillment center may place NFC scanners proximate to exits to scan the biographical digests of mobile communication devices that are leaving the building. A computer coupled to the NFC scanners may analyze the identity of the mobile communication devices thus scanned and determine if any of the mobile communication devices are being stolen. It is noted that the NFC scanners may be able to interrogate the RFID chips associated with the devices even when the battery is not installed in the devices because the RFID chips can be energized by an energizing field radiated by the NFC scanner as described above.

It may happen that a manufacturing problem occurred and resulted in some mobile communication devices being flawed. The problem may affect only a selected number of mobile communication devices for example devices of a specific model manufactured on a specific assembly line at a specific manufacturing location on a specific date. By using a portable NFC scanner coupled to a portable computing device that can implement a filter to identify devices that have a biographical digest that is consistent with the criteria described above an order fulfillment center worker may more rapidly and conveniently identify the subject flawed devices . In the absence of the system described herein the order fulfillment center might otherwise be obligated to remove many devices from their shipping boxes scan the bar codes in their battery compartments to identify which devices match the described criteria. Alternatively perhaps the task to be performed is to identify one or more specific devices from among a number of other devices for fulfilling an order. Again the system can be applied to ease the order fulfillment process using the NFC scanner coupled to a portable computer implementing a filter to identify devices that have a biographical digest that matches the criteria. It is noted that the NFC scanners may be able to interrogate the RFID chips associated with the devices even when the battery is not installed in the devices because the RFID chips can be energized by an energizing field radiated by the NFC scanner as described above.

A customer retail store may offer mobile communication devices for sale as well as providing a first level of customer care. Customers may bring a mobile communication device that has one or more perceived problems to the retail store for diagnosis and or repair. The customer care representative may scan the customer s mobile communication device to read the biographical digest . This information may be transported to the service station or workstation that the customer care representative uses. Alternatively the customer may use the NFC scanner upon entering the store for example by tapping the device in at a customer care kiosk before being called by the customer care representative. The customer care representative based on the customer s description of his or her perceived trouble using the device and based on the information contained in the biographical digest may be able to quickly diagnose the cause of the perceived trouble and recommend a remedy or indeed fix the problem directly. It is noted that the NFC scanners may be able to interrogate the RFID chips associated with the devices even when the battery installed in the devices is depleted and or when the devices are turned off because the RFID chips can be energized by an energizing field radiated by the NFC scanner as described above.

As an additional use case the customer may complete a transaction for an accessory or other merchandise by tapping their mobile communication device on the NFC scanner for example at a transaction kiosk and transfer the cost of the purchase to his or her post paid communication service account or to deduct the cost of the purchase from his or her pre paid communication service account balance. The retail store may link the customer payment transaction at the payment kiosk with a NFC scanner at the exit to prevent customers leaving with unpaid for merchandise. It is noted that the NFC scanners may be able to interrogate the RFID chips associated with the devices even when the battery installed in the devices is depleted and or when the devices are turned off because the RFID chips can be energized by an energizing field radiated by the NFC scanner as described above.

The system may likewise be advantageously applied in returns and or repair centers. The NFC scanner can determine the status of the mobile communication device by scanning the biographical digest . It is noted that the NFC scanner may be able to interrogate the RFID chip associated with the device even when the battery installed in the devices is depleted and or the device is turned off because the RFID chips can be energized by an energizing field radiated by the NFC scanner as described above. The refurbishment and or repair of the device may be completed more quickly and or more efficiently than if a bar code in the battery compartment instead needed to be scanned.

Turning now to a lifecycle of the mobile communication device is described. Upon completion of the manufacturing process the device may be in the new status. This corresponds to device inception . The device may ship to a distribution or order fulfillment center before being provided to end users at . When the device is activated at the status of the device may be changed to activated status. When the device is returned at the device may be reactivated at under a different set of parameters for example the device may be rebranded from a first service brand to a second service brand pursuant to a change of wireless communication subscription service by a user. Alternatively the device may be set to the refurbish status and returned to a distribution or order fulfillment center. Ultimately the device may transition to the device termination and receive the status dead or terminated.

Turning now to a method is described. At block a biographical digest is stored in a radio frequency identity chip of a mobile communication device at the time of manufacture of the communication device wherein the biographical digest comprises a static portion and a dynamic portion. In an embodiment the static portion comprises an identity of a model of the device an identity of a manufacturer of the device an identity of a location where the device was manufactured and an identity of an initial software version of the device. The static portion is write disabled by the manufacturer of the device for example after writing the appropriate information to the static portion. In an embodiment the dynamic portion comprises an identity of a current software version of the device and an identity of a device status having a value of new. The dynamic portion is left write enabled by the manufacturer of the device.

At block the device is activated for wireless communication service. At block the dynamic portion of the biographical digest is optionally updated. For example a software version identity a preferred roaming list identity or other configuration information of the device is updated and the dynamic portion of the biographical digest is changed modified written and or overwritten to correspond with the change. One of skill in the art will appreciate that the processing of block may never occur for example if the device is never updated with different configurations or software. Likewise one of skill in the art will appreciate that the processing of block may occur two or more times for example when the device is repeatedly updated and or reconfigured.

At block the device may progress to block where the device is deactivated for wireless communication service for example when the device is returned by a user. From block the processing may proceed to block . At block if the device is transitioning to a terminated or dead status the processing proceeds to block . At block the device status of the dynamic portion of the biographical digest is written to a value of dead or terminated in the RFID chip of the device for example the RFID chip . After the device status of the dynamic portion is written to a terminated or dead status the dynamic portion of the biographical digest may be disabled for writing. One of skill in the art will appreciate that different mobile communication devices may take different paths through the flow chart illustrated in .

Turning now to a method is described. At block a biographical digest is read from a radio frequency identity chip of a mobile communication device by a near field communication NFC scanner. At block based on reading the biographical digest a computer system coupled to the near field communication scanner determines at least three items of information about the device selected from a location where the device was manufactured an initial software version installed in the device by the manufacturer a current preferred roaming list PRI stored in the device a current software version installed in the device an activation date of the device a phone number of the device an international mobile station equipment identity IMEI of the device and a mobile equipment identity MEID of the device. At block based on the at least three items of information about the device determined by the computer system customer service is provided to a user of the mobile communication device.

Turning now to a method is described. At block a plurality of items of biographical device information are combined into a biographical digest wherein the items of biographical information comprise at least three items of information selected from a federal communications commission FCC identity a model identity a hardware version identity a manufacturer identity a country of manufacture a date of manufacture a location of manufacture an initial software version identity an initial preferred roaming list PRL version identity a secure element SE key a trusted security zone master key an initial stock keeping unit SKU identity an initial universal product code UPC identity a current preferred roaming list identity a current software version identity a current stock keeping unit identity a current universal product code identity a device status a device activation date a phone number of the device a current international mobile station equipment identity IMEI of the device and a current mobile equipment identity MEID of the device.

At block write the biographical digest to a radio frequency identity RFID chip of the mobile communication device wherein a portion of the biographical digest is maintained in a static state in the radio frequency identity chip and a portion the biographical digest is maintained in a dynamic state in the radio frequency identity chip. At block read the biographical digest from the radio frequency identity chip of the mobile device by a near field communication NFC scanner device. For further details of a biographical digest of a radio frequency identity chip see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 857 141 filed Apr. 4 2013 entitled Digest of Biographical Information for an Electronic Device with Static and Dynamic Portions by Kevin R. Cordes et al. which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The DSP or some other form of controller or central processing unit operates to control the various components of the mobile device in accordance with embedded software or firmware stored in memory or stored in memory contained within the DSP itself. In addition to the embedded software or firmware the DSP may execute other applications stored in the memory or made available via information carrier media such as portable data storage media like the removable memory card or via wired or wireless network communications. The application software may comprise a compiled set of machine readable instructions that configure the DSP to provide the desired functionality or the application software may be high level software instructions to be processed by an interpreter or compiler to indirectly configure the DSP . One skilled the art will appreciate that the DSP or other processors may interact with and communicate with the various components via one or more address bus not shown and or one or more data bus not shown .

The DSP may communicate with a wireless network via the analog baseband processing unit . In some embodiments the communication may provide Internet connectivity enabling a user to gain access to content on the Internet and to send and receive e mail or text messages. The input output interface interconnects the DSP and various memories and interfaces. The memory and the removable memory card may provide software and data to configure the operation of the DSP . Among the interfaces may be the USB port and the infrared port . The USB port may enable the mobile device to function as a peripheral device to exchange information with a personal computer or other computer system. The infrared port and other optional ports such as a Bluetooth interface or an IEEE 802.11 compliant wireless interface may enable the mobile device to communicate wirelessly with other nearby handsets and or wireless base stations.

Another input mechanism may be the touch screen LCD which may also display text and or graphics to the user. The touch screen LCD controller couples the DSP to the touch screen LCD . The GPS receiver is coupled to the DSP to decode global positioning system signals thereby enabling the mobile device to determine its position.

It is understood that by programming and or loading executable instructions onto the computer system at least one of the CPU the RAM and the ROM are changed transforming the computer system in part into a particular machine or apparatus having the novel functionality taught by the present disclosure. It is fundamental to the electrical engineering and software engineering arts that functionality that can be implemented by loading executable software into a computer can be converted to a hardware implementation by well known design rules. Decisions between implementing a concept in software versus hardware typically hinge on considerations of stability of the design and numbers of units to be produced rather than any issues involved in translating from the software domain to the hardware domain. Generally a design that is still subject to frequent change may be preferred to be implemented in software because re spinning a hardware implementation is more expensive than re spinning a software design. Generally a design that is stable that will be produced in large volume may be preferred to be implemented in hardware for example in an application specific integrated circuit ASIC because for large production runs the hardware implementation may be less expensive than the software implementation. Often a design may be developed and tested in a software form and later transformed by well known design rules to an equivalent hardware implementation in an application specific integrated circuit that hardwires the instructions of the software. In the same manner as a machine controlled by a new ASIC is a particular machine or apparatus likewise a computer that has been programmed and or loaded with executable instructions may be viewed as a particular machine or apparatus.

The secondary storage is typically comprised of one or more disk drives or tape drives and is used for non volatile storage of data and as an over flow data storage device if RAM is not large enough to hold all working data. Secondary storage may be used to store programs which are loaded into RAM when such programs are selected for execution. The ROM is used to store instructions and perhaps data which are read during program execution. ROM is a non volatile memory device which typically has a small memory capacity relative to the larger memory capacity of secondary storage . The RAM is used to store volatile data and perhaps to store instructions. Access to both ROM and RAM is typically faster than to secondary storage . The secondary storage the RAM and or the ROM may be referred to in some contexts as computer readable storage media and or non transitory computer readable media.

Such information which is often represented as a sequence of instructions to be executed using processor may be received from and outputted to the network for example in the form of a computer data signal embodied in a carrier wave.

Such information which may include data or instructions to be executed using processor for example may be received from and outputted to the network for example in the form of a computer data baseband signal or signal embodied in a carrier wave. The baseband signal or signal embedded in the carrier wave or other types of signals currently used or hereafter developed may be generated according to several methods well known to one skilled in the art. The baseband signal and or signal embedded in the carrier wave may be referred to in some contexts as a transitory signal.

The processor executes instructions codes computer programs scripts which it accesses from hard disk floppy disk optical disk these various disk based systems may all be considered secondary storage ROM RAM or the network connectivity devices . While only one processor is shown multiple processors may be present. Thus while instructions may be discussed as executed by a processor the instructions may be executed simultaneously serially or otherwise executed by one or multiple processors. Instructions codes computer programs scripts and or data that may be accessed from the secondary storage for example hard drives floppy disks optical disks and or other device the ROM and or the RAM may be referred to in some contexts as non transitory instructions and or non transitory information.
