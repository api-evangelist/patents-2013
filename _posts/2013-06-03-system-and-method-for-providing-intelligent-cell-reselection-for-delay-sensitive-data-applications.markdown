title: System and method for providing intelligent cell reselection for delay sensitive data applications
abstract: A mobile station for receiving delay-sensitive data from a wireless communications network is provided with a data buffer and cell reselection controller. The data buffer receives data from the network and stores the data for communication to a delay-sensitive data application. The cell reselection controller selectively inhibits cell reselection in order to meet requirements of the delay-sensitive data application. By intelligently controlling cell reselection, delay sensitive data may be received in a more reliable fashion, thereby increasing performance of the data application.

The present invention relates generally to data communications in a wireless communication system and more particularly to systems and methods of providing intelligent cell reselection for delay sensitive applications.

In today s wireless communications environment data applications have become commonplace and widely used. Certain of these data applications such as real time and streaming applications are delay sensitive and have very strict requirements with respect to transfer data rate and jitter. If these requirements are not met the performance of the application may degrade substantially leading to for example interruptions of or dropouts in data e.g. audio or video streams.

If the radio transmission errors are recoverable a data buffer in the mobile station temporarily stores and retimes the received data packets resulting in a retimed burst with data packets resembling the transmitted data packets with no loss in data. However if the radio transmission errors exceed a capacity of the data buffer the resulting burst includes data packets and a missing data packet. . The radio transmission errors cause complications in the routing of data packets to the mobile station because lost data packets may need to be retransmitted by the network.

A problem with the cell reselection procedure of is that there may be an outage coincident with cell reselection. Because duration of the cell reselection process can take many seconds typically more than 2 seconds cell reselection can introduce operationally significant delays in data transmission leading to lost data packets and degradation of a delay sensitive data application running on the mobile station . Lost data packets may require re queuing of the data packets in the GGSN or SGSN or may result in dropped data packets e.g. missing frames of audio video for the delay sensitive data application. For example in real time video applications the cell reselection procedure may result in breaks in video feed and slow video updates.

A further problem with the cell reselection procedure of is that the mobile station makes a determination of whether to reselect the serving cell independently of the network i.e. the GGSN the SGSN and the cells . Because the cell reselection is independent of the network the network may be forced to rapidly respond to the mobile station in a new serving cell . This requires significant overhead in the network. The majority of existing wireless data transmission technologies such as GSM GPRS do not adapt the cell reselection algorithm to accommodate the requirements of delay sensitive applications.

The present invention provides a mobile station for receiving data from a wireless communication network which includes a cell reselection controller controller configured to control cell reselection in accordance with the requirements of a delay sensitive data application that executes either on the mobile station or on a computing device connected to the mobile station. The delay sensitive data application which may take the form of for example a Voice over IP VoIP or streaming application receives a flow of data from the network that is stored as data packets in a data buffer. The controller includes logic for determining whether cell reselection procedures in the mobile station should be selectively inhibited. The controller may accept as input any number of fixed and or measured parameters including without limitation data transfer rates required by the data application historical delay data data buffer states and data flow rates. In the event that the controller determines that cell reselection will have an adverse effect on application performance it executes actions to prevent cell reselection. The controller may be implemented in any suitable form including a software layer or application programming interface.

It will also be appreciated that the network of may deliver data to the mobile station via any of the serving cells depending upon the received signal strength measured at the mobile station as described herein. Further it will be appreciated that the process of cell reselection described below is performed between the mobile station a base station acting as a serving cell and one of a number of neighboring cells.

While embodiments of the patent invention are described herein with reference to their implementation in a conventional GSM GPRS system it should be appreciated that the present invention may be implemented in connection with any number of wireless data communication technologies including without limitation Cellular Digital Packet Data CDPD Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS WLAN EDGE and 3GPP. Furthermore while the present invention is described and depicted in the context of wireless communications between a mobile station and a fixed infrastructure network the present invention may also be applied to peer to peer communications i.e. communications that take place directly between two mobile stations .

The data application receives a flow of data organized into data packets for example a speech or audio video stream via a receive data buffer from a protocol stack. A conventional protocol stack may include a Real Time Transport Protocol User Datagram Protocol Internet Protocol RTP UDP IP layer a Logical Link Control LLC layer and a Radio Link Control Media Access Control RLC MAC layer . The function and operation of these layers are known in the art and need not be discussed herein. A transmit data buffer temporarily stores the data packets to be sent by the protocol stack to the base station subsystem . A lowermost physical layer corresponds to a physical connection over which the data packets are sent from the serving cell to the mobile station .

In one embodiment the mobile station is provided with a cell reselection controller controller that intelligently determines whether cell reselection will cause an unacceptable delay in reception of the data packets from the serving cell and if it so determines prevents initiation of cell reselection. In one embodiment the controller is implemented on a programmed general purpose computer. In other embodiments the controller is implemented on a special purpose computer a programmed microprocessor a microcontroller and peripheral integrated circuit elements an ASIC or other integrated circuit a digital signal processor a hardwired electronic or logic circuit such as a discrete element circuit or a programmable logic device e.g. a field programmable gateway array .

The controller is provided with appropriate logic for making the cell reselection determination based upon various inputs. The inputs may include application requirements data flow rates transmission rates receive data buffer and or transmit data buffer states and estimated cell reselection times. Exemplary application requirements may include implied human behavior e.g. pressing a button silence suppression or voice activity and or be based on parameters pertaining to the data application receive data buffer and or the transmit data buffer .

In one embodiment the controller interfaces to an application programming interface API not shown . The API is configured to signal the controller that the data application is delay sensitive. Information such as size of the receive data buffer size of the transmit data buffer content type e.g. voice video etc. or the like may be provided by the API to indicate that a particular data application is delay sensitive. In some embodiments the API is configured to query the data application to obtain information about an expected number of data packets that are to be received from the physical layer or sent to the protocol stack. The operation of the controller and the API will be discussed in further detail below in connection with the flowchart.

While the controller is depicted herein as a software layer which sits between RTP UDP IP and LLC those skilled in the art will recognize that the controller may be alternatively implemented in any number of forms including without limitation as an ASIC or other integrated circuit. It should be further recognized that the functional components of the controller may alternatively be integrated into the data application or into one or more layers of the protocol stack.

For some delay sensitive data applications cell reselection may result in data packet loss of greater than two seconds and may cause a significant load on the network for example caused by packet retransmission. Accordingly where cell reselection may cause loss of data packets the process of provides for maintaining the original transmission with the service cell while in an overlap region between neighboring cells depending on the nature of the data application as opposed to performing cell reselection. Accordingly in some embodiments the controller prevents cell reselection unless application metrics of the data application degrade sufficiently or a natural break is detected e.g. between data bursts rather than performing cell reselection in the middle of a burst transmission. The controller analyzes various inputs provided by the mobile station and or the base station subsystem and the associated network to make its determination. These inputs may include without limitation data transfer rates required by the data application present data flow and transmission rates application state data data burst length and delay times associated with packet reception provided or measured by either the mobile station or the network

In initial step the mobile station measures a received signal strength of a broadcast control channel of the serving cell and up to sixteen strongest neighboring cells. In another embodiment the mobile station measures the received signal strength of the broadcast control channel of the serving cell and any number of strongest neighboring cells. At stop the mobile station determines if the received signal strength of the serving cell s neighbor is sufficient for reselection. If the received signal strength of the serving cell s neighbor is not sufficient the mobile station continues to receive data packets from the serving cell. At step if the data application is not delay sensitive the controller may perform cell reselection in step . At step if the received signal strength of the serving cell s neighbor is sufficient and the data application is delay sensitive the controller determines if application metrics for the data application are below predetermined parameters or if a natural break is detected. If so then a cell change may occur in step .

In an alternative embodiment the delay sensitive data application communicates to the network a set of predetermined operational parameters that are to be satisfied for determining whether to perform cell reselection. The mobile station measures information of the received signal strength of the current serving cell and neighboring cells and transmits the information to the network upon consideration of applications requirements of the data application .

In some embodiments the controller or the network estimates an expected time duration of cell reselection and either the controller or the network determines to perform the cell reselection only if it can be performed without losing any data packets. For example network assisted cell selection may speed cell selection in the network . Accordingly the controller or the network determines whether to perform cell reselection based partially upon whether network assisted cell change is supported in the network and based upon an estimation of cell reselection duration.

In other embodiments cell reselection is based on real time i.e. computed parameters as determined by the mobile station . That is the mobile station may change cells only if the real time parameters or requirements are not being met. Real time parameters may include for example allowing streaming video to complete its data stream or allowing a burst to finish before performing cell reselection. For example sonic protocols transmit the length of the data stream e.g. the number of data packets before sending the data packets. Accordingly one embodiment includes a counter to track the number of data packets remaining to be received. In this embodiment cell reselection is delayed until either the entire number of data packets is received or the received signal strength of the current cell measured by the mobile station falls to such a level that errors are likely to occur in data packet reception.

In one embodiment the predetermined parameters relate to Quality of Service QoS requirements. The data application is programmed with an expected QoS and minimum QoS and predictions are performed by the controller to determine whether to perform cell reselection. The mobile station of this embodiment will change cells when QoS requirements are not being met. In alternative embodiments cell reselection occurs based on a combination of the real time and QoS parameters.

In a further embodiment the controller monitors a status of the receive data buffer and or the transmit data buffer . If either the receive data buffer and or the transmit data buffer stop receiving new data or if the rate at which data packets are transmitted to or received from the upper protocol layers substantially exceeds the rate at which new data packets are added to the receive data buffer and or the transmit data buffer the receive data buffer and or the transmit data buffer will start to empty. Accordingly the receive data buffer and or the transmit data buffer are examined along with other parameters to determine whether the number of remaining data packets is approaching a number that will trigger initiation of the cell reselection process. For example if the receive data buffer contains data packets corresponding to five seconds of data received by the mobile station to be streamed to the data application and cell reselection is predicted to take only three seconds then the mobile station will perform cell reselection because the receive data buffer will not empty during cell reselection. However if the receive data buffer contains only one second of data but cell reselection is predicted to take three seconds then the mobile station will remain in the current serving cell and perform cell reselection only if the QoS drops below a certain rate. This may involve real time monitoring of the receive data buffer and or the transmit data buffer state information i.e. whether data packets are being received or sent and the number of data packets currently queued . Alternatively and or additionally the controller may detect or predict emptying of the receive data buffer and or the transmit data buffer using measurements or estimates of data flow rates received by the data application and rates of reception of data packets into the receive data buffer and or the transmit data buffer .

One factor which may be used by the controller to determine if the cell reselection should be prevented is whether a natural break in the flow of data generated has occurred. A natural break is a temporary or permanent cessation of data flow associated with certain events or conditions that occur during normal operation of the data application . The natural break in data transmission may be for example a silent portion of the video a break in streaming video a button being released on the mobile station completion of a burst in a VoIP application completion of audio transmission and or any other natural break in transmission. The natural break may be defined by the delay sensitive data application and or any other higher or lower level application. The data application may alert the controller that a natural break has occurred by setting an appropriate flag. Alternatively the controller may monitor other aspects of the data application operation to detect natural breaks. In some situations and in certain data applications a natural break will have an associated duration sufficient to permit cell reselection without adversely affecting the performance of the data application .

The controller is configured with logic that encodes a set of rules for intelligently determining from analysis of its inputs whether cell reselection should be allowed or prevented. Implementations of these rules will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the considerations of the data application and the network performance. Generally speaking cell reselection should be inhibited where necessary to meet the data application data transfer requirements however excessive inhibition of cell reselection may require the serving cell to transmit at high power and may prevent other mobile stations from accessing the serving cell thereby adversely affecting overall network performance.

Those skilled in the art will recognize that various alternative methods may be available for preventing cell reselection. The method outlined above is presented by way of an illustrative example and the present invention should not be construed as being limited to that or any other method as the sole means for cell reselection. It should also be recognized that although the flowchart depicts steps as occurring in sequence certain of the steps may be performed concurrently.

It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that while the present invention has been described above in terms of preferred embodiments it is not limited thereto. Various features and aspects of the above invention may be used individually or jointly. Further although the present invention has been described in the context of its implementation in a particular environment and for particular applications those skilled in the art will recognize that is usefulness is not limited thereto and that the present invention can be beneficially utilized in any number of environments and implementations.
