This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 591 238 filed Jan. 26 2012 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was made with government support under the National Science Foundation Grant No. EEC 0552351 NIH Grant No. RD43HD058376 01 and VA Center of Excellence Grant No. B6789C. The government has certain rights in this invention.

The following information is provided to assist the reader in understanding technologies disclosed below and the environment in which such technologies may typically be used. The terms used herein are not intended to be limited to any particular narrow interpretation unless clearly stated otherwise in this document. References set forth herein may facilitate understanding of the technologies or the background thereof. The disclosure of all references cited herein are incorporated by reference.

Personal Mobility Devices PMDs such as electronic power wheelchairs EPW as illustrated in scooters as illustrated in and manual wheelchairs as illustrated in are very beneficial to the people with mobility impairments. As used herein the term personal mobility device or PMD refers to mobile devices to transport a person thereby increasing the mobility of the person. However those benefits come with some risks. One such risk lies in the stability of the PMD. A review of the US Food and Drug Administration s FDA s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience MAUDE database shows that one of the most frequent adverse events connected to these devices is their inclination to tip causing the user to be thrown from the device and injured sometimes severely. In a study done between 1975 and 1993 25.7 of the wheelchair safety incidents reported to the FDA were from a tip and or fall. R. Lee Kirby S. A. S. Wheelchair Safety Adverse Reports to the Food and Drug Administration 308 312 1995 .

To help prevent these injuries the US Department of Veterans Affairs VA the FDA and the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS require that PMDs are tested for stability issues and that the results then be published in the user manual. Testing the PMDs and reporting the results do not necessarily mean that they are stable. However the VA has become more proactive about requiring that PMDs be more stable. They have indicated in their requests for low cost EPW s that they are dynamically stable on a 6 slope.

It is a good idea to change the design of the PMDs to make them more stable however any design change may affect the performance of the device as well. Slowing the speed of the device reduces mobility and independence. Making a wider frame can limit access to narrow places. Stiff suspension reduces user comfort. Passive anti tip devices limit some safe maneuvers and can be ineffective if not properly adjusted to the user s specifications.

In one aspect a system for use with a mobile device includes at least one sensor to sense a variable related to tilting of the mobile device and at least one activatable system in operative connection with the sensor. The at least one activatable system increases stability of the mobile device upon actuation change in state thereof on the basis of data measured by the at least one sensor. A variable related to tilting includes variables that indicate concurrent actual tilting as described herein as well as variables predictive of imminent tilting. Activatable systems hereof change state upon actuation or activation to increase stability of the mobile device by reducing eliminating or preventing tilting. The system may further include a control system in operative connection with the at least one sensor and in cooperative connection with the at least one activatable system to control whether the at least one activatable system is activated on the basis of data measure by the at least one sensor.

The at least one activatable system may for example include at least one activatable damper system or at least one activatable brake system. In a number of embodiments the at least one activatable system is in operative connection with a suspension system of the mobile device. In a number of embodiments the at least one activatable system is in operative connection with at least one abutment member adapted to contact a surface upon which the mobile device is supported to increase or enhance stability or prevent instability.

In a number of embodiments the mobile device is a personal mobility device. The personal mobility device may for example be an electrically powered wheelchair or an electrically powered scooter.

Activatable systems in operative connection with at least one abutment member adapted to contact a surface upon which the mobile device is supported to increase or enhance stability or prevent instability may for example be used in connection with manually powered wheelchair or powered wheelchairs. In a number of embodiments the abutment member includes a wheel that moves up and down before activation of the activatable system but requires more force to move upon or down or is prevented from moving up or down upon activation of the activatable system. The wheel may for example be biased to remain in contact with a surface upon which the mobile is traveling when the activatable system in not activated.

In a number of embodiments the mobile devices or suspension systems thereof in some embodiment may operate independently of the activatable systems. The activatable systems hereof need not be formed integrally with systems upon manufacture thereof and are for example readily adapted to be attached to an existing mobile device.

In another aspect a method of operating a mobile device includes providing at least one sensor to sense a variable related to tilting of the mobile device in operative connection with the mobile device providing at least one activatable system in operative connection with the sensor and activating the at least one activatable system to increase stability of the mobile device on the basis of data measured by the at least one sensor. The method may further include providing a control system in operative connection with the at least one sensor and in cooperative connection with the at least one activatable system to control whether the at least one activatable system is activated on the basis of data measured by the at least one sensor. As described above the at least one activatable system may for example include at least one activatable damper system or at least one activatable brake system.

In another aspect a mobile system includes an anti tip system including at least one sensor to sense a variable related to tilting of the mobile system and at least one activatable system in operative connection with the sensor. The at least one activatable system increases stability of the mobile system on the basis of data measured by the at least one sensor.

The present devices systems and methods along with the attributes and attendant advantages thereof will best be appreciated and understood in view of the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

It will be readily understood that the components of the embodiments as generally described and illustrated in the figures herein may be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations in addition to the described example embodiments. Thus the following more detailed description of the example embodiments as represented in the figures is not intended to limit the scope of the embodiments as claimed but is merely representative of example embodiments.

Reference throughout this specification to one embodiment or an embodiment or the like means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. Thus the appearance of the phrases in one embodiment or in an embodiment or the like in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.

Furthermore described features structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. In the following description numerous specific details are provided to give a thorough understanding of embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize however that the various embodiments can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other methods components materials et cetera. In other instances well known structures materials or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obfuscation.

As used herein and in the appended claims the singular forms a an and the include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus for example reference to a sensor includes a plurality of such sensors and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art and so forth and reference to the sensor is a reference to one or more such sensors and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art and so forth.

In a number of represented embodiment hereof active stability devices ASD hereof are discussed for use in connection with personal mobility devices for personal transportation. Such personal mobility devices may be used to transport a human user either through manual control or autonomously. However the active stability devices hereof are suitable for use in connection with many mobile devices including personal mobility devices such wheelchairs both electric motor powered and manual and scooters as well as mobile robotic bases and others mobile devices.

In a number of embodiments hereof active stability devices or systems for use with mobile devices are provided that do not interfere with normal operation of the mobile device but activate only when a mobile device such as a wheelchair is in an unstable situation or is about to become unstable. Devices systems and methods hereof may for example be used to increase the stability of mobile devices including personal mobility devices such as wheelchairs. In a number of embodiments systems hereof include at least one sensor and at least one actuator. Under conditions where instability exists or is predicted the actuator activates in a manner to increase stability or reduce or prevent instability of the system. In general the term instability as used herein refers to tilting or tipping of a mobile device. Tilting or tipping occurs upon rotation about an axis for example a longitudinal axes or a latitudinal axes of the mobile device causes at least one wheel or other rotatable mobility elements of the mobile device to loose contact with a surface or plane upon which the mobile device is moving.

For example in a number of personal mobility devices a soft suspension on the device is used to increase ride comfort but can also make the device unstable under certain dynamic situations. To preserve comfort and increase stability of such wheeled personal mobility devices a representative embodiment of an active suspension system was developed and tested on the prototype hybrid power operated vehicle HyPOV chair. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 7 882 909 and Pearlman J. et al. Design development and testing of a low cost electric powered wheelchair for India. Disability and Rehabilitation 4 1 42 57 2009 the disclosures of which is incorporated herein by reference. In a number of embodiments the representative system included a stability sensor including a tilt switch an actuatable or activatable device or system including a magnetorheological MR damper and circuitry for the power supply.

Static stability and dynamic stability tests were conducted to see if the activatable system activated before the wheelchair tipped and to determine if the wheelchair would achieve a similar stability rating for the same test as the wheelchair received with the activatable MR Damper s fully engaged or stiffened. A low cost linear brake device or system was also developed as an activatable system for use as an alternative to or to work in cooperation with a damper such as the MR Damper. In a number of embodiments hereof activatable systems such as MR Dampers and or brake devices can be retrofitted to existing personal mobility devices and other mobile devices or systems.

Although the application of such a representative system hereof is ostensibly to stiffen suspension on a power wheelchair equipped with a soft or resilient suspension for example including one or more springs or other resilient devices or systems the applications are much broader. Applications of the sensor activatable systems hereof include both manual and electric powered wheelchairs mobile robotic bases and devices without suspension. In general stability of mobile devices is increase via a system including of at least one sensor to sense at least one variable related to or predictive of instability tilting or tipping and at least one actuator activatable system in operative connection with the sensor that can be actuated or activated to reduce the likelihood of or existence of instability. In other words under conditions where instability exists or is predicted then the actuator or activatable system would activate in such a way as to increase stability of the system.

A description of a representative embodiments of the activatable stability device or system for an electric powered wheelchair follows. One goal of the system was to develop and perform initial testing of a powered mobility active anti tip system. As described above a hybrid power operated vehicle HyPOV was used as a test bed for this system. The HyPOV wheelchair is a low cost electrically powered wheelchair which was originally developed for use for example where cost may be a determinative factor. Many powered and manual wheelchairs may become unstable for example under certain high speed turning situations.

The current design of wheelchair uses a centrally located drive or hub drive wheel to maneuver. The hub motor not shown may be fully enclosed within the hub of drive wheel . This allows for wheelchair to function with only one motor as opposed to other power chairs which usually require two motor.

Wheelchair which is similar to wheelchairs described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 882 909 includes a seat mounted on a generally rectangular frame system see . Frame system may for example be made from metal or another similar rigid material. Frame includes at least one rear rail and side rails on each side thereof. In the illustrated embodiment side rails are provided on each side and connect between rear rail and front wheel axle brackets. As described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 882 909 a solid axle joins two large freely spinning wheels via wheel axle brackets. The brackets and axle solidly connect the side frame rails to each other. Wheelchair further includes a foot platform connected to an extending member via a pivotable connection .

Seat is attached to side rails of frame via multiple sliding seat perches at least one seat perch see on each side rail . Seat can be mounted to face in either direction to be adaptable for various wheelchair user needs. Terms such as front rear forward rearward upper lower and like terms as used herein refer to the orientation of wheelchair in .

As also described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 882 909 a pivot connection piece not shown is attached near the midpoint of the front solid axle and pivots about the axle between the large wheels . An elongated center swing arm is rigidly attached to the pivot connection piece at one end and to a midpoint of front rail on the other end. This swing arm system houses the motor brake turning system generally . The pivot connection piece enables center swing arm to pivot about the front solid axle and to move parallel to the longitudinal axis of side frame rails according to the load balance on caster wheels and a drive wheel described below.

Drive wheel which may for example be a hub motor as described above is placed in a fork with a bearing not shown mounted near its topmost portion. Extending upwardly from the top of the bearing is a shaft . Shaft extends optionally through center swing arm and operatively connects to a steering mechanism including for example a tiller . Drive wheel fork bearing and shaft may connect to center swing arm so that they can be adjusted along the length thereof. This adjustment of the position of drive wheel permits the force on drive wheel to be increased or decreased as the force on casters wheels increases or decreases.

In the illustrated embodiment a suspension link systems includes upper link member U and lower link member L which are connected between frame and rotatable joints for caster wheels . In the illustrated embodiment a caster wheel connector is attached to and extends downwardly from each rotatable joint . Caster wheels are smaller than the two large wheels and are capable of rotating 360 degrees by means of the rotatable joint . Caster wheels are located on one end of wheelchair opposite large wheels . Large wheels can be located in the front of the wheelchair and caster wheels can be located in the rear as illustrated or vice versa depending on the user s preference.

In the illustrated embodiment each caster wheel connector is connected to center swing arm with separate upper link members U and lower link members L of suspension link systems . As also described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 882 909 upper link members U connect and pivot about an axle located inside rear frame rail . Lower link members L are fixed to for example a polymeric or metallic torsion spring not shown which links to center swing arm through an adjustable bracket system . Other suspension system including other types of resilient members for example coil springs or leaf springs can also be used. Such resilient members or elements allow vertical displacement of each caster wheel independently and transfer force to the drive wheel as caster wheels encounter obstacles bumps uphill or downhill surfaces or any other kind of terrain.

Wheelchair also includes activatable systems on each side thereof only one of which is shown in with the other being substantially identical . Activatable systems are connected at one end to lower link member U in the suspension system and to side rail via connecting bracket see at another end thereof. In embodiments hereof activatable systems hereof may for example decrease the travel distance of a suspension or a portion thereof stiffen dampers or shock absorbers to require more force for the suspension to travel lock motion of the suspension or a portion thereof etc. In a number of embodiments activatable systems included MR Magnetorheological dampers. An MR damper uses a fluid that has a variable yield strength controlled by a magnetic field. When a higher voltage is passed into the controller via for example a control system which is in operative connection with a sensor as described below the fluid stiffens which causes an increase to the damping force. However the damper does not completely stop the linear motion. It can slow it down but if there is enough force on the damper it will eventually become completely stretched out or compressed. Upon activation one of activatable systems including an MR damper vertical travel of the associated caster wheel is limited by the increased force required to overcome the resistance provided by the MR damper.

A number of activatable systems other than MR dampers are suitable for use herein. For example an activatable system including a linear brake was designed as an alternative or an addition to MR dampers. As described above MR dampers do not completely prevent the suspension from moving. MR damper only cause it to require more force to move the suspension at some speed. Moreover MR dampers are relatively costly for example approximately 400 . A lower cost device for use in the activatable systems hereof may be desirable in certain circumstance for example in a case in which a wheelchair or other mobile device is being retrofitted with activatable systems hereof . A device or system such as a linear brake which actually locks the suspension preventing movement thereof may be used and may be more effective at preventing the mobile device from tipping. An activatable brake system may for example be designed so that the dimensions are roughly the same as the MR dampers used in activatable systems with substantially less cost . In other embodiments a linear or rotary brake such as those that use electromagnets for actuation may be used to stiffen either suspension systems or other anti tip systems hereof to stabilize a mobile device such personal mobility device.

An embodiment of a linear brake system for use in the systems hereof is shown in . In linear brake system a wedge is be forced into a cone within a housing and which then causes wedge to apply a normal force to a rod . Wedge is forced into cone via the electromagnetic force of a coil which upon activation forces a plunger into wedge . Linear brake system operates in a manner similar to a solenoid. Operation of the system can be altered and or optimized via control of for example angles for wedge and cone the force needed and obtainable by coil and the maximum size allowable for the linear brake system . Linear brake system includes a connector upon a distal end of rod and a connector on another end linear brake system via which linear brake system may be attached to for example be connected at one end to lower link member U in the suspension system and to side rail L at another end thereof as described above in connection with activatable system .

In a number of studies hereof an OMRON Model D7E 3 tilt switch available from Omron Electronic Components of Schaumburg Ill. was used to sense instability. Examples of sensors that may be used in the systems hereof include but are not limited to tilt switches or sensors gyroscopes accelerometers camera microphones force sensors etc. Multiple sensors of different types may for example be used in a single system. Control thresholds may for example be based upon accelerations decelerations that are in a direction not aligned with travel or measures of roll pitch or yaw from for example a gyroscope. Alternatively one could measure the reaction force of each wheel and determine when if one was going to lose contact or has lost contact with the ground.

A platform or support see upon which a sensor such as a tilt sensor that is a sensor to detect orientation inclination or tilting may be supported was developed. Support included a generally U shaped bracket to which support member is connected. Sensor was attached to support member which may be angled with respect to a longitudinal orientation L of bracket to adjust the starting orientation or angle of sensor when no tilting is occurring . The specification sheet for one embodiment of a studied tilt sensor indicated that the sensor would switch at 40 degrees but the best angle at which wheelchair should be when the switch activates activatable system was unknown at the beginning of the studies hereof and may vary between different types of mobile devices. Therefore support was made to be adjustable. In that regard side members of bracket were formed with curves slots or extending passages formed therein. The position of connectors such as bolts used in connection slots may be varied as represented by arrow A in to vary the starting angle of sensor . In a number of embodiments tilt sensor could be placed at a starting angle in the range between 15 to 45 degrees.

A circuit illustrated schematically in for representative tilt switch sensor was developed to be used in connection with activatable systems including MR dampers. The circuit includes a subsystem or control system for example including a filter to selectively activate activatable system . Tilt switch sensor by itself might for example activate activatable system every time wheelchair hit a bump. Even worse tilt switch sensor might deactivate activatable system if wheelchair hit a bump while it was on an incline.

In the circuit of a low pass filter was used to selectively activate or actuate activatable system . The low pass filter circuit may for example result in activatable system being activated only if tilt switch sensor is on activated more than 50 of the time or if tilt switch sensor is on activated for longer than the rise time for the filter. In a number of embodiments actuation or activation would not occur unless tilt switch sensor is open for longer than approximately one second.

As illustrated schematically in a control system with appropriate logic is desirable to activate the activatable devices or systems hereof to for example stiffen or lock a suspension system in those situations or circumstances when desired or required. Circuitry may for example be replaced with mechanical systems. Moreover a processor for example a micro controller or micro processor may also or alternatively be used to integrate sensor signals and determine when an instability is occurring or is about to occur and in turn trigger activatable system .

ANSI American National Standards Institute and RESNA Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America 1 2 have specific tests that are to be conducted to determine how stable a personal mobility device is and to compare different personal mobility device to each other. To test the actively controlled suspension system of wheelchair three trials were completed with each test one with the softest possible suspension MR Dampers off one with the stiffest suspension MR Dampers fully engaged and one with the active anti tip system enabled. The ANSI RESNA tests that were selected to be done are shown Table 1 below.

The results of the static stability test are shown in Table 2 below. The results show that the performance of wheelchair with the actively controlled suspension system is statistically the same as the performance with the dampers fully powered.

The results of the dynamic stability tests show the same correlation except for the section 10.2 test. The result obtained in the 10.2 test is believed to be a result of the delay in the circuit being too long and wheelchair starting to tip before tilt switch sensor was activated. The time constant of the low pass filter may for example be decreased for wheelchair to pass this test. Table 4 summarizes how the tests and results were obtained.

The activatable stability devices systems and or methods hereof can improve the stability of mobile devices including personal mobility devices whether powered or manual without substantially effecting the normal operations. In a number of embodiments the activatable systems here prevent ratings of 0 or 1 or 0 1 or 2 as set forth in Table 4. In that regard in a number of embodiment either full tilting tipping or sticking resting on a static anti tip device of a mobile device or system including personal mobility devices is prevented or any tipping or tilting that does occur is transient. In other embodiments even transient tipping wherein in wheel loses contact with the surface is prevented.

Studies of anti tip suspensions including activatable stability devices or systems on a single side of the chair are discussed above. Use of activatable anti tip or stabilizing devices or systems hereof on each side of for example a wheelchair or other mobile device will provide improved performance. Dynamic stability tests may for example be used in connection with a particular type of mobile device to ensure that the one or more active stability systems activate only in desired circumstances and not in other circumstances for example during obstacle climbing . In the case of control systems including for example a low pass filter the low pass filter or other control system characteristics or stationary angle of the tilt sensor base may for example be readily adjusted to achieve improved performance. A potentiometer may for example be used to adjust sensitivity of the filter. Once again one or more processors for example micro controllers or micro processors may also be used to integrate sensor signals and classify whether instability is occurring or about to occur.

In a number of embodiments the activatable stability device systems and or methods hereof may for example be activated to decrease travel distance of a suspension or a portion thereof stiffen dampers or shock absorbers lock motion of the suspension or a portion thereof etc. as described above. The activatable systems hereof need not be formed integrally with the suspension system of a mobile device. Indeed the activatable system hereof are readily retrofitted onto mobile system such as personal mobility devices. In a number of embodiments such mobile systems include a suspension system comprising one or more resilient members such as springs.

Although representative embodiments of the use of activatable stability devices and or systems hereof in connection with a suspension system of a mobile device or system are discussed above the activatable stability devices systems or methods hereof may be used in connection with manual personal mobility devices for example manually operated wheelchairs and need not be used in connection with a suspension system. illustrate a representative embodiment of activatable stability systems hereof which includes two activatable devices attached to the rear of a manual wheelchair . Each of activatable systems is in operative connection with an abutment member or anti tip device which is rotatably or pivotably attached to wheelchair . In the non activated state as illustrated in activatable systems maintain abutment member in a first non activated or non actuated state in which abutment member are maintained at a suitable height to prevent interference with normal operation of wheelchair . In the activatable system have been activated or actuated via for example a sensor system and control system as described above to rotate or pivot abutment members to a lower position to increase stability and reduce the likelihood of or prevent tipping. In the illustrated embodiment abutment members are lowered and raised via actuatable or activatable cylinders which may for example be solenoids or hydraulic cylinders. Additional or alternative activatable devices and cooperating abutment members may for example be placed at other positions on the wheelchair for example on the front and or sides thereof .

The foregoing description and accompanying drawings set forth a number of representative embodiments at the present time. Various modifications additions and alternative designs will of course become apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing teachings without departing from the scope hereof which is indicated by the following claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes and variations that fall within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.
