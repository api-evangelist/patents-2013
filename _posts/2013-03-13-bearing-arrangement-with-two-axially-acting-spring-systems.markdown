This application is a U.S. National Stage Entry of International Patent Application Serial Number PCT EP2013 000748 filed Mar. 13 2013 which claims priority to German patent application no. 102012005932.9 filed Mar. 26 2012.

Bearing arrangements in particular bearing arrangements in steering systems for motor vehicles are subject to external influences. Such influences originate on the one hand from the vehicle specifically as a result of actuation of the steering arrangement by means of a steering wheel because the mounted components are moved as a result of the steering movement. On the other hand the bearings are subjected by the roadway surface to shocks vibrations oscillations and the like which are transmitted into the bearing via the steering system.

Bearings are therefore normally equipped with damping devices in order that firstly durability is ensured and secondly rattling noises caused by the bearing can be prevented. Such damping devices may act in an axial direction and in a radial direction.

For example DE 10 2010 029 266 has disclosed a recirculating ball gear which has an axially damped bearing. The spring elements described in said document are arranged between a bearing housing and the bearing wherein the spring elements are directly connected to a bearing outer ring or bearing inner ring. This however yields the disadvantage that the spring forces required for the damping of the bearing cancel one another out with damping only of the axially acting forces being realized.

Furthermore bearings are predominantly installed as a whole in bearing arrangements for example for ball screw mechanisms for which reason it is necessary to calculate tolerances already at the planning stage which tolerances are therefore extremely large.

It is therefore an object of the invention to further develop and provide a bearing arrangement of the type mentioned in the introduction in which bearing arrangement the two spring forces do not cancel one another out and also to propose a method for producing a bearing arrangement by which method the tolerances can be reduced to a minimum.

In an embodiment of the present disclosure a bearing arrangement in particular for a ball screw mechanism includes a bearing which is supported with respect to a bearing housing wherein spring elements are arranged between a housing and the bearing having at least one abutment which is movable in an axial direction of the bearing.

In a preferred embodiment of the invention it may be provided that the abutment at least partially surrounds the bearing wherein in particular a bearing outer ring and a bearing inner ring are arranged within the abutment.

Furthermore in one refinement of the invention it may be provided that at least one first spring element provided for the axial support of the bearing is arranged indirectly and or directly between the abutment and the housing.

It is advantageously possible for the first spring element to force the abutment against the housing in the axial direction of the bearing.

It is likewise possible in a likewise preferred refinement of the invention for at least one second spring element provided for the axial support of the bearing to be arranged between the abutment and the bearing.

It may advantageously be provided here that the second spring element forces the bearing in the axial direction against the abutment at the inner side.

In another refinement it is possible for a compensation means in particular a tolerance disk to be provided on a side situated opposite the first spring element wherein in particular the abutment is forced against the tolerance disk.

In a preferred embodiment the tolerance disk may be arranged with play in an intermediate space between the abutment and the housing.

In a further advantageous embodiment the abutment may circumferentially surround at least one bearing outer ring in substantially U shaped form wherein contact regions between the spring elements and the abutment are provided in the region of the bearing outer ring.

A method for achieving the object has the features of independent claim . According to said claim there is proposed a method for producing a bearing arrangement comprising at least one bearing a bearing housing and spring elements for the axial support of the bearing having the method steps 

In a preferred embodiment the compensation means can be adapted to tolerances of the further components.

In particular it may be provided that during the production process the further components are measured and provided with a marking for example in the form of a data matrix code wherein the dimension is recorded in the marking and that during the assembly process the compensation means is selected from a store of compensation elements of different dimensions such that during assembly with the further components a predetermined value for the installation tolerance is obtained can be adapted. Here it is for example possible for the compensation elements to be selected in steps of 0.1 mm.

An exemplary embodiment will be explained in more detail below with reference to the drawing figures of the present disclosure.

The bearing arrangement is part of a steering arrangement not otherwise illustrated of a motor vehicle. In the steering arrangement there is provided a threaded spindle on which a ball nut is arranged. The bearing arrangement is seated on the ball nut wherein the bearing arrangement supports the ball nut with respect to a housing . A housing thus at least partially surrounds the bearing arrangement and the ball nut. By rotation of the ball nut the threaded spindle can be moved in an axial direction or by rotation of the threaded spindle the ball nut can be displaced on the threaded spindle.

Via a connection of the steering arrangement and via wheels of the vehicle the steering arrangement is in contact with a roadway to be travelled on as a result of which shocks vibrations or the like are also transmitted into the steering system. In this way shocks are also transmitted in an axial direction to the threaded spindle and likewise to the ball nut and the bearing arrangement .

The bearing arrangement has a bearing with a bearing outer ring and a bearing inner ring wherein the bearing is supported with respect to the housing . To receive the bearing the housing has a recess region in which the bearing is at least partially arranged with a sleeve . The bearing itself is surrounded by an intermediate sleeve formed as an abutment for which reason the recess region is dimensioned accordingly.

The abutment circumferentially surrounds the bearing and lies at least partially against the bearing outer ring in the region thereof. An inner diameter therefore corresponds approximately to an outer diameter of the bearing. The intermediate sleeve has corresponding to the bearing at least one central opening through which the ball screw mechanism and the ball nut can extend.

Likewise arranged within the intermediate sleeve is a second spring element which is provided between the bearing and the abutment. Said second spring element supports the bearing with respect to the abutment. Therefore the abutment in the form of the intermediate sleeve is dimensioned correspondingly to a width made up of bearing spring element and a spring travel of the spring element . The corresponding width is indicated in in which an internal region of the intermediate sleeve has space for the bearing and the spring element plus corresponding spring travel. The second spring element extends over the entire width of the bearing as illustrated in . Here in the region of the bearing outer ring there is a first contact region between the second spring element and the abutment. Slightly further toward a center of the bearing there is a first contact region between the spring element and the bearing as illustrated in . Further contact regions or points are conceivable and provided.

On an outer side of the abutment the intermediate sleeve is supported with respect to the housing and or the sleeve . Depending on the embodiment of the bearing arrangement the sleeve may or may not be provided. If no such sleeve is provided the intermediate sleeve is supported directly with respect to the housing by way of a first spring element . There would otherwise be only indirect support by way of the first spring element via the sleeve . A corresponding space is provided for the arrangement of the first spring element between the intermediate sleeve and the housing or the sleeve wherein said space corresponds to a width of the first spring element plus a spring travel thereof. The first spring element is of the same design as the second spring element as a result of which the contact regions with the components to be supported in a radial direction of the bearing are the same.

The first spring element is arranged on an outer side of the abutment said outer side being situated opposite an inner side of the abutment on which the second spring element is provided. In this respect the two spring elements surround the bearing or the bearing outer ring at both sides in the axial direction.

On an outer side situated opposite the first spring element of the intermediate sleeve there is provided a compensation means in the form of a tolerance disk which is fitted in an intermediate space between abutment and housing. The tolerance disk forms a potential abutment surface with the abutment in an upper region situated in the region of the bearing outer ring . The intermediate space is dimensioned so as to be wider than the width of the tolerance disk in particular a gap a as illustrated in between tolerance disk and the intermediate sleeve corresponds to a spring travel of the first spring element .

Said gap a is however present only if the abutment is forced against the first spring element by external action. The first spring element which is otherwise of undulating form is illustrated in as being flat see also left illustration . The bearing is thus supported against the sleeve and or against the housing via the abutment and the first spring element .

When the bearing is in a rest or initial position the intermediate sleeve lies against the tolerance disk in a sealing position as shown in in the centered and right illustrations. From these it can also be seen that the gap a is small and substantially corresponds in fact to the spring travel of the first spring element .

In the rest or initial position the second spring element is also of undulating form such that the bearing can be held in a stable manner in one position within the intermediate sleeve . In said position the bearing is arranged in a sealing position against an inner side situated opposite the second spring element of the intermediate sleeve as a result of which said bearing is arranged in stable fashion in the abutment .

In the position of the bearing shown in in the right illustration the intermediate sleeve is forced at one side against the tolerance disk and at the other side the bearing within the intermediate sleeve is forced against the second spring element as a result of which said second spring element lies flat against the corresponding inner side of the abutment . On the opposite inner side in said position an intermediate space is formed between the bearing and the intermediate sleeve which intermediate space substantially corresponds in terms of its width to the spring travel of the second spring element .

It is thus clear that on the one hand the bearing is arranged movably in the axial direction in the intermediate sleeve and on the other hand the intermediate sleeve is arranged movably in the axial direction in the receptacle in the housing. In this way the two spring forces of the spring elements acting on the bearing are decoupled from one another. It must however be ensured that the gap a is provided on the outer side situated opposite the first spring element of the intermediate sleeve and thus the tolerance disk must not be overdimensioned.

For the production of the bearing arrangement the elements described above may be installed in the bearing housing at least partially in modular fashion. For the assembly process the first spring element is firstly inserted into the housing or into the sleeve . The intermediate sleeve can separately be assembled with the bearing and the second spring element . The bearing in the form of the bearing outer ring is inserted as a block into the intermediate sleeve followed by the second spring element which forces the bearing outer ring against the inner side of the abutment . The fully assembled abutment is then placed into the receptacle adjacent to the first spring element where it is pushed into a block state. This assembly process offers the advantage that the individual elements can be manufactured at different locations.

In the light of the individual measured tolerances of the respective elements and a predefined gap dimension a the width of the tolerance disk can be individually determined. The disadvantageous liberal dimensioning of the tolerances in advance is thus dispensed with and manufacturing and installation tolerances can therefore be better allowed for.

For this purpose the dimension B is stored in a data matrix code DMC for the bearing housing as well as the dimension A for a cover and the dimension C for a steering gear. During the assembly of the components in the production process the actual dimensions of the components are used and thus the dimension X for the tolerance disk is defined.

A particular advantage consists in the possibility of the bearing housing the cover and possibly other components that influence the installation tolerances being produced separately from one another. The components which are possibly even produced at different manufacturing locations are then measured and the actual dimensions are recorded in the data matrix code used for the marking of the component or in some other machine readable label directly on the component. Then during the assembly of the steering gear it is possible for each dimension of the components provided for assembly to be read and for the tolerance chain to be calculated. From a store of tolerance disks sorted by dimensions it is then possible to select precisely the suitable tolerance disk that provides the assembly with the required tolerance dimension. In the case of manual manufacture it may for example be the case that after the required dimension of the tolerance disk has been calculated only that box in a rack in which the required tolerance disk is stored needs to be opened in order to withdraw a tolerance disk. Possible assembly errors through the use of an unsuitable tolerance disk are thus reliably avoided.

Overall through the decoupling of the individual spring systems a tolerance chain can be reduced in size whereby said tolerance chain does not disadvantageously exceed the maximum admissible tolerance of the ball nut.

The invention relates to a bearing arrangement in which two spring systems are decoupled from one another. The invention also relates to a method for the assembly of a bearing arrangement in which a compensation means can be retroactively dimensioned.
