The present invention deals with the field of firestopping appliances positionable within an aperture located within a wall for firestop sealing around cables wires or other longitudinal members which would otherwise be required to extend through the wall area. Such firestopping fixtures include various types of sealing inserts within the outer shell of the firestopping member and the present invention provides a significant improvement in the design of such inserts.

Normally such a firestopping sleeve includes an outer shell defining an opening extending longitudinally therethrough with a sealing insert positioned therein for sealing between the interior wall of the outer shell which defines the longitudinal opening and the outer surface of the cables that extend therethrough. The present invention provides a means for enhancing engagement of the firestopping seal both with respect to the interior walls of the outer shell and also enhancing sealing thereof with respect to the cables extending therethrough for preventing the flow of fire smoke or heat through the wall in the area localized adjacent to the wall penetrating cables.

It is an object of the self adjusting firestopping sleeve with flexibly resilient supplemental constriction means of the present invention to increase the inwardly radially directed flexibly resilience of a sealing insert positioned within the outer shell of a firestopping device.

The present invention provides a self adjusting firestopping sleeve which includes an outer shell which can be either tubular or rectangular. Two different embodiments with rectangular or square cross sections are shown in and further examples showing tubular cross sectional embodiments are shown in and .

Each of these designs is for the purpose of sealing around wires or cables or other similar penetrating members which are positioned extending through a construction panel such as a wall floor or ceiling having an aperture therein for allow the penetrating members to pass therethrough for various reasons. The sleeve will define an access corridor defined extending completely longitudinally through the outer shell thereof. Each sleeve includes interior sleeve wall means which defines the outermost boundaries of the access corridor . In the rectangular or square version shown in the sleeve will define a first lateral sleeve wall and a second lateral sleeve wall against which the edges of the first and second firestopping pads and will preferably abut.

A firestopping pad is required to be positioned within the access corridor and can be of various configurations in order to facilitate sealing around cables or other penetrating members positioned extending therethrough in order to achieve firestop sealing between the sleeve interior walls and and the cables . This firestop sealing pad is for the purpose of preventing the flow of fire smoke or heat adjacent to penetrating members extending through any structural panel within a commercial or residential building such as when located within a wall floor or ceiling panel that is fire rated.

In one of the preferred constructions of the present invention as shown in the sleeve will be generally rectangular in shape and will have a square or slightly rectangular cross section. These configurations will preferably include a first firestopping pad means which is preferably arched and positioned within the upper area of the access corridor in the outer shell . A second firestopping pad will also preferably be arched such and will be positioned within the lower section of the longitudinal opening . In this manner the first firestopping pad and the second firestopping pad will be preferably slightly arched in a convex manner facing one another and will be opposed from one another such as to be gently biased into abutment with respect to one another along a pad abutment seam defined therebetween which also defined the confinement area for receiving cables extending longitudinally therethrough. This confinement area at the pad abutment seam will provide the location for placement of cables extending through the sleeve while also maintaining firestopping therearound. It should be appreciated that both of the two pads and need not be arched. Only one of these pads need to be arched or otherwise urged toward the other pad in order to form the confinement area such that it is capable of sealing against penetrating members .

There is a limited amount of inherent flexible resilience in the arched configuration of the first and second firestopping pads and since they are usually formed of a flexibly resilient foam material and will often include an intumescent component therewithin. However these pads can be of any commonly available material which includes a firestopping component and the magnitude of the inherent flexible resilience thereof can vary greatly. The flexible resilience of the pads themselves provides some amount of force for exerting the force needed for firestopping sealing about cables which pass through the confinement area defined therebetween. However the present invention provides an enhancement for the inherent flexible resilience of the first and second firestopping pads and by providing a flexibly resilient supplemental constriction means such as a banding means which extends around both opposed pads and enhances abutting sealing contact thereof with respect to the cables passing therebetween for sealing thereadjacent.

In the embodiment shown in the construction of the banding means comprises a single flexible resilient member preferably of rubber or another elastic material which extends around the first firestopping pad means and the second firestopping pad means in such a manner as to compress radially inwardly to seal against a penetrating member such as a cable or wire positioned within the confinement area located between the two firestopping pads along the pad adjustment seam defined therebetween.

The outer banding means can also possibly include an adjustment capability. This adjustment capability can be provided by various means depending upon the specific construction. For example banding means can be manufactured with various different magnitudes of flexible resilience or be of various sizes to provide an adjustability feature in the total magnitude of flexibly resilient supplemental constriction when initially installed. Alternatively the band can have an adjustment portion or section as shown in which extends outwardly through an adjustment slot defined in the outer shell of sleeve which can be pulled outwardly by installation personnel to increase the amount of constriction. The amount of constriction can be reduced by a user merely by reaching within the sleeve and expanding the pad slightly to pull the adjustment section to a less extended position. The ability to adjust the amount of supplementary flexibly resilient constriction force on the pad configuration shown in is one of the important characteristics of the present invention.

The basic concept of providing a flexibly resilient supplemental constriction means is usable with the apparatus of the present invention when using designs wherein the firestopping sleeve itself is of a circular oval or round configuration as shown in and . shows a configuration wherein a plurality of belting loops are included positioned on the external surface of the firestopping sealing pad means through which the outer banding means can extend to maintain contact thereof with respect to the outer surface of the sealing means for enhancing sealing. This belted configuration also maintains the longitudinal positioning of the band with respect to the firestopping pad at the preferred position which is equidistantly spaced between the first opening defined at the first end of sleeve and the second opening defined at the second end of sleeve . The first end and the second end are preferably defined at opposite ends of the sleeve with the first opening and the second opening in full fluid flow communication with respect to the access corridor defined in the interior of sleeve extending between first end and second end . In the central portion of the sleeve the sealing means will be constricted or biased radially inwardly somewhat by the positioning of the banding means extending through the loop means defined therewithin. This constriction will be localized to the central portion of firestopping pad and as such sealing abutment of the pad will still be maintained with respect to the interior wall of the outer shell immediately adjacent to the first end and second end while inwardly biased constriction in the most central area is maintained. Thus the portions of firestopping pad closest to the first end and the second end will maintain sealing abutment contact with respect to the sleeve interior wall while effective sealing around the cables will be enhanced in the central portion thereof adjacent to the loop means by the supplemental constriction means . This supplemental constriction will be provided by the flexible resilient banding means extending through these belting loops and constricting the central portion of the sealing means firmly and yet gently with respect to the cables or other penetrating members extending therethrough.

A further alternative configuration for the apparatus of the present invention is shown in wherein the banding means is formed in the shape of a spirally shaped band which spirals from a position in abutting engagement with respect to the sleeve interior wall inwardly radially around and toward the exterior surface of the firestopping pad for constricting thereof in the localized area central position into abutment with a cable or other penetrating member extending through confinement area at a position within the sleeve to provide a construction similar to that shown in but utilizing a different means for forming the constriction namely the use of a spiral band instead of a plurality of constriction pillows . This spiral band can be formed of a more rigid flexibly resilient material in order to provide a spiral flat spring means in order to firmly engage the interior wall of sleeve and the exterior surface of firestopping pad .

One of the important considerations of the apparatus of the present invention shown in is that when the firestopping sleeve is utilized without any type of a flexibly resilient supplemental constriction band the first firestopping pad means and the second firestopping pad means need to be of a lateral dimension slightly less than the laterally extending internal dimension between the first interior sleeve wall and second interior sleeve wall . This dimensional restriction is necessary in order to prevent binding of the first firestopping pad outer edge surfaces with respect to the first sleeve interior wall and the second sleeve interior wall in the upper portion of the sleeve as shown in . Similarly the second firestopping pad outer edge surfaces will tend to bind against the first sleeve interior wall and the second sleeve interior wall unless the second firestopping pad is sized slightly less than the distance between wall and wall . Both the first firestopping pad and the second firestopping pad initially were each sized slightly less than the distance between the wall and to prevent binding thereagainst so that completely sealing around the penetrating members in the confinement area is fully achieved. It should be appreciated that binding between the outer edges of the two firestopping pads and the first and second sleeve interior walls and tend to restrict the ability of the pads to engage and seal against penetrating members positioned within the confinement area . Thus slightly undersizing the lateral dimension of the opposed arched firestopping pads and provides a small amount of clearance between the outer edge surfaces and of each of the first and second pads and . These narrow openings provide more freedom for flexing movement of the pads and with respect to one another to enhance engagement with respect to the outer surfaces of cables extending therebetween in the confinement area . However this slight spacing between the outer edge surfaces and of the pads and the interior walls and of the sleeve provide some leakage for air smoke or heat to flow thereby which is clearly not desirable.

However when used with the novel construction of the present invention the firestopping pads are made wide enough to extend completely from the first sleeve interior wall to the second sleeve interior wall . This construction is possible because the flexibly resilient supplemental constriction means will be capable of overpowering any resistance to flexing of the pads and due to binding thereof with respect to the first sleeve interior wall and the second interior wall . Therefore the first and second firestopping pad means and can both be configured to be wider with the outer edge surfaces and thereof in abutting and sealing contact with respect to the sleeve interior walls and thus preventing the unwanted flow of any heat smoke or fire thereby between these walls and the adjacent edges of the firestopping pads and . The slight binding that may occur between the outer edge surfaces and and the sleeve interior walls and can be easily overcome by choosing a banding configuration having sufficient inwardly directed bias to compress the first and second firestopping pad means and against any penetrating members positioned extending through confinement area . Thus the use of the flexibly resilient supplemental constriction means of the present invention significantly enhances sealing between the firestopping pads and and the cables while also allowing enhanced securement between the outer edge surfaces and of the first and second firestopping pad means and the interior walls and thereadjacent. It should be appreciated that the lateral size of pads and could be configured to be greater than the distance between the first sleeve interior wall and the second interior wall to thereby exerted a predetermined bias against these two wall for sealing thereagainst. The added resistance to urging the first and second pads and created by this additional width can be easily overcome by choosing a Supplemental construction means having sufficient flexible resilient to move the pads and toward one another to create and effective firestopping seal against an penetrating members extending through confinement area .

It is important to appreciate that all of the constructions of the present invention provide for a very gentle means of forcibly enhancing the contact between the firestopping pad means and the penetrating cables extending through confinement area within sleeve . The flexibly resilient supplemental constriction means and various configurations disclosed herein each will gently urge the firestopping sealing pad means into contact with the external surface of the penetrating cable without creating any abrasion or scraping thereagainst which has heretofore been a problem since such laterally exerted forces can sometimes damage the cables extending therethrough or the outer insulation therearound. The present invention is designed specifically for minimizing any such lateral abrasion or friction against the cables because the firestopping pad is gently constricted thereagainst. Furthermore the construction of the present invention provides a self adjusting firestop sleeve which is self adjusting due to the flexible resilience of the pads themselves and of the flexibly resilient supplemental constriction means which will gently and effectively will form abutting contact and sealing between the firestopping sleeve and penetrating members extending through the confinement area defined therein.

While particular embodiments of this invention have been shown in the drawings and described above it will be apparent that many changes may be made in the form arrangement and positioning of the various elements of the combination. In consideration thereof it should be understood that preferred embodiments of this invention disclosed herein are intended to be illustrative only and not intended to limit the scope of the invention.
