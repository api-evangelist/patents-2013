The present Application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 649 457 filed on May 21 2012 in the name of Yiannis Tsiounis and entitled METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR FACILITATING A GAME COMPRISING PLACEMENT OF ELEMENTS IN A PREDETERMINED RELATIONSHIP. The entirety of Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 649 457 is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The present application relates to methods systems and articles of manufacture for facilitating an electronic e.g. online game in which according to some embodiments a user places elements on a game interface comprising a plurality of element positions each element comprising a numeral which i contributes to a score resulting from the placement and ii is evaluated to determine whether the placement of the element satisfies a rule of the game e.g. whether the numeral bears a predetermined mathematical relationship to the content of one or more adjacent elements .

Play of electronic games is growing in popularity. There is an ever present need for new and exciting games which will attract the time and attention of players. Applicant has recognized that games which are both simple for novice players yet complex enough for experienced players are ones which may be particularly likely to attract and maintain the time and attention of a significant number of players.

In accordance with some embodiments a process system or article of manufacture provides for facilitating the playing of an electronic game which comprises a game interface having a plurality of positions on which one or more game elements may be placed by one or more players. Each of such game elements may include thereon a representation of for example a numeral alphanumeric symbol and or other symbols other than letters and or may be blank. Scoring of the game may comprise in one example embodiment i determining the content e.g. the numeral indicated thereon of each of a game element placed on the game interface ii determining the particular position in which the game element was placed and any special scoring rule s associated with the position e.g. is it a double position which doubles the value of a game element placed thereon iii determining the content of related elements e.g. adjacent game elements elements within another predetermined positional relationship with respect to the subject game element being evaluated and or other game elements also placed on the game interface by the same player in the current move which is being evaluated iv determining whether the respective content e.g. numerals indicated on the subject game element and the related game elements satisfy a required mathematical relationship e.g. as a modulo 10 addition relationship and v if the respective content e.g. numerals indicated on the subject game element and the related game elements satisfy a required mathematical relationship calculating a score for the move based on the respective content. Thus in accordance with some embodiments for a given move in the game a single numeral on a given game element is used for the dual purpose of i determining whether the move is a valid move by determining whether the numeral when taken in the context of the numerals of the related game elements satisfies a required mathematical relationship and ii calculating a score for the move.

In embodiments involving numerals or alphanumeric sequences e.g. embodiments in which the content of elements comprises numbers and potentially also letters and or symbols which must be arranged in a predetermined mathematical relationship on the board the game may have educational value as it helps teach mathematical operations to the players. This can be as simple as teaching a player how to perform addition and subtraction and perform it fast and accurately to more complicated functions depending on the rules of the specific game.

It should be noted that the term numeral as used herein unless indicated otherwise may refer to number or a word letter symbol or figure or a group of any of the foregoing expressing a number. For example a numeral may comprise an Arabic numeral e.g. 8 a Roman numeral e.g. IV or a binary numeral e.g. 110 .

In some embodiments placement or arrangement of game elements on element positions on the game interface may be rejected by a processor facilitating the game if the content of the placed elements does not satisfy a predetermined rule specifying a predetermined relationship the content of the elements must bear to one another. One example predetermined relationship consistent with some embodiments comprises a predetermined mathematical relationship such as a modulo 10 addition relationship of a predetermined number of game elements in a predetermined positional relationship 3 game elements in a continuous vertical horizontal or diagonal line . Rejection of a placement or move by a processor may comprise for example i assigning a score of zero to the move ii disallowing further progress in the game pending the removal from the game interface of the offending game element s iii removing the offending game element s from the game interface on behalf of the player and or iv outputting a message indicating that the offending game elements do not satisfy a rule or requirement of the game or offend a restriction of the game and disallowing a further move or progress in the game pending removal of the offending game element s .

One advantage of some embodiments of the game is that it comprises only a few simple rules so it is easy to learn and start playing but at the same time there is a lot of strategy necessary to win including finding the sequence or arrangement that maximizes the score for a given move leaves the best possible elements available for the next move minimizes the probability that the other player s will be able to utilize a multiplier square and so on. Applicant has endeavored to provide at least some game embodiments which are relatively easy for everyone to learn and play but not boring for the expert player as mastering them may involve appreciation for and mastering of significant subtle nuances thus providing for wide appeal.

It should further be noted that a game consistent with embodiments described herein may be a single player or a multi player game. In one embodiment if a multi player game players may play their moves in sequence one after the other. Such moves may be done asynchronously in some embodiments and or at different times or with significant lags in time between moves of different players. In some embodiments of a single player game the goal is to maximize the score for a given move and the score for the whole game as well as to experiment with or be rewarded for interesting sequences. In some embodiments of a multi player game the goal is to win by achieving a higher score than the other players and or to create interesting sequences or plays. For example among a number of players one can be the overall winner but someone else may get bonus points or an honorary mention or some other incentive for achieving the highest single move score.

In accordance with some embodiments processes systems and or articles of manufacture provide for a setting up of the game which may include for example i determining the game interface to be used e.g. if more than one option is available ii the order in which the player s will play the game e.g. if there is more than one player iii determining generating or selecting a central pool of game elements from which game elements will be selected e.g. on a random basis and output to players participating in the game for placement on the game interface during the game and iv selecting and outputting a predetermined number e.g. seven of game elements from that central pool to each of the player s .

In accordance with some embodiments after the setup of a game processes systems and or articles of manufacture provide for i determining a move from a first player such move consisting of placing some of the player s game elements on the game interface ii verifying that the element positions and or the content of the elements bear a predetermined relationship to each other and or conform to some mathematical rules in order for the move to be accepted and iii if these verifications succeed accepting the move and computing a score for the move based on one or more predetermined rules. In accordance with some embodiments such processes systems and or articles of manufacture may further provide for i computing the total score for the player who has completed a move based on one or more predetermined rules and ii selecting new game elements if still available from the central pool to the player as needed so that the player maintains a certain number of game elements for the next move.

In accordance with some embodiments processes systems and or articles of manufacture provide for i rejecting a player s move if it does not satisfy a requirement of the game e.g. if any of the verifications performed in evaluating the move fail ii maintaining for the duration of a game and for each respective player participating in the game a list of the game elements available for placement on the game interface by a given player e.g. a list of the player s current list of available game elements output to the player from the central pool of game elements iii maintaining for the duration of a game a list of the elements remaining in the central pool iv tracking and updating the score for each respective player after each move of the player v storing for the duration of the game other potentially relevant information vi ending the game when certain conditions are satisfied e.g. less than a predetermined number of game elements remains available in the central pool less than a predetermined number or arrangement of element positions remains available on the game interface and or vii determining a winner or other result of the game e.g. in a multi player game determining the player s with the highest score to be the winner s .

In accordance with some embodiments the game may be played on a game interface comprising multiple positions for placement of elements such as an interface representing a grid or tiled board. The game interface may be for example rectangular in shape i.e. with the same number of squares horizontally and vertically but it can also be non rectangular. The board can be a two dimensional board or a three dimensional board or using certain mathematical and or graphical representations a four dimensional or higher dimensional board. The instantiation of the board can be a physical board or an electronic board the latter instantiated either via a process operating on a multi purpose computing device or on a single purpose computing device built for this game only. The board may also have the possibility to recognize the elements placed on it using a variety of methods such as RFID communication touch sensitive screen physical characteristics of the element itself or some other method. Such automated element recognition allows the board to determine the element give feedback as to its acceptance and placement and compute the score.

The apparatus comprises a processor operable to communicate with an output device an input device and a data storage device . Fewer or more components and or various configurations of the components and or may be included in the apparatus without deviating from the scope of embodiments described herein.

According to some embodiments the processor may be or include any type quantity and or configuration of processor that is or becomes known. The processor may comprise for example an Intel IXP 2800 network processor or an Intel XEON Processor coupled with an Intel E7501 chipset. In some embodiments the processor may comprise multiple inter connected processors microprocessors and or micro engines. According to some embodiments the processor and or the apparatus and or other components thereof may be supplied power via a power supply not shown such as a battery an Alternating Current AC source a Direct Current DC source an AC DC adapter solar cells and or an inertial generator. In the case that the apparatus comprises a server such as a blade server necessary power may be supplied via a standard AC outlet power strip surge protector and or Uninterruptible Power Supply UPS device.

In some embodiments the input device and or the output device are communicatively coupled to the processor e.g. via wired and or wireless connections and or pathways and they may generally comprise any types or configurations of input and output components and or devices that are or become known respectively.

The input device may comprise for example a keyboard that allows an operator of the apparatus to interface with the apparatus e.g. by a player an employee or other worker affiliated with either an online gaming company or other entity operating a system which provides games to players . In some embodiments the input device may comprise a mechanism configured to indicate to a remote server device an initiation or triggering of an event instance e.g. that a player has initiated a move or turn of a game or requested a new game such information being provided to the apparatus and or the processor . In such embodiments the input device may comprise a key on a keyboard of the apparatus . Other examples of input devices include but are not limited to a game controller and or gamepad a bar code scanner a magnetic stripe reader a pointing device e.g. a computer mouse touchpad and or trackball a point of sale terminal keypad a touch screen a microphone an infrared sensor a sonic ranger a computer port a video camera a motion detector a digital camera a network card a Universal Serial Bus USB port a GPS receiver a Radio Frequency Identification RFID receiver a RF receiver a thermometer a pressure sensor and a weight scale or mass balance.

The output device may for example comprise a display screen via which are output instructions guidance questions or information to a player of an online game. Examples of output devices that may be useful in some embodiments include a Cathode Ray Tube CRT monitor a Liquid Crystal Display LCD screen a Light Emitting Diode LED screen a printer an audio speaker an Infra red Radiation IR transmitter an RF transmitter and or a data port. According to some embodiments the input device and or the output device may comprise and or be embodied in a single device such as a touch screen monitor.

In some embodiments the apparatus may comprise any type or configuration of communication device not shown that is or becomes known or practicable. For example the apparatus may include a communication device such as a NIC a telephonic device a cellular network device a router a hub a modem and or a communications port or cable. In some embodiments the communication device may be coupled to provide data to a telecommunications device. The communication device may for example comprise a cellular telephone network transmission device that sends signals e.g. an initiation of an event instance to a server e.g. at least one of the user interface and the game production server in communication with a plurality of user devices .

For example the data storage device may according to some embodiments store a program for facilitating one or more of the embodiments described herein.

The program may for example be operable to facilitate the general functionalities of i game set up ii facilitating the execution of a move or turn by a player and iii determining a score and or winner for a game. Example and thus non limiting implementations of each of these general functionalities which may comprise sub modules or sub routines of program are briefly described below. For example in some embodiments before a game begins or upon a game beginning i the game interface e.g. game board is set up ii the elements and the rules of the particular game are selected determined or agreed upon and iii the players and the sequence with which they play are defined. This general preliminary process is one embodiment of a setup of the game. Following the setup is the playing of each move and finally when the game ends the winner or the score details if this is a single player game is announced. Of course in other embodiments a program of apparatus may comprise different or additional functionalities or sub modules. For example in a single player implementation the sequence of how players are to move is not necessary. In another embodiment in an implementation in which only a single type of game defined by a set of rules is available determining or selecting the rules for a particular game may not be necessary.

Turning now to an example implementation of what a setup subroutine may comprise in accordance with one embodiment at least one of the following parameters and in some embodiments a value for each such game parameter may be determined i the number of available symbol positions on a game interface e.g. the size of the board ii the type number and placement of available symbol positions having special scoring rules associated therewith e.g. the multiplier squares iii the type and number of elements or symbols to be used in the game e.g. the number of game elements to be made available in a general pool or set of elements from which particular elements for each user participating in the game are selected iv the number of elements each player holds for each move v the one or more rules in accordance with which the move is declared valid vi the one or more rules in accordance with which a score of each move and or of the whole game is calculated and vii the one or more rules for determining the winner of the game.

It should be noted that any of the foregoing factors and or values thereof may be determined by the processor in accordance with the program and or by mutual agreement among the players in embodiments comprising a multi player game . In one example of factor iii in the list above the type and number of elements to be used in the game could be finite e.g. a predetermined number in some embodiments while in other embodiments there may be no such limit. In still other embodiments the number of elements in such a pool may comprise a multiple of a set of predetermined element pools or it can refresh automatically based on certain predetermined conditions. The number of elements each player holds can similarly be fixed or variable based on certain rules.

In accordance with some embodiments the game elements utilized can be a combination of single digit numbers from 0 to 9 letters symbols and blank elements which can be turned into any number or letter or symbol by the player. In some embodiments every type of available game element is associated with a respective particular number of points score . In some embodiments the number of points or score value of a game element may also comprise the content e.g. numeral of the game element e.g. a 4 element scores 4 points which numeral is utilized to determine whether the placement of the element satisfies a rule defining valid moves in the game such as a required mathematical relationship of the element with numerals of other associated game elements e.g. elements within a predetermined positional relationship or elements placed or otherwise identified by the player as being for the current move . In other embodiments the content of the element used to determine whether the move is valid may be different from the point or score value of the element e.g. a 0 can score 0 points or 10 points . If the point or score value of an element is different than the numeral of the element used to determine whether placement of the element with other elements satisfies a required mathematical relationship then the element may include a second potentially smaller numeral or other symbol that indicates its point or score value. For example the blank element can score 0 points or a different number of points or its score can vary depending on the number the player determines the blank element to represent. Variations can be on elements that represent numbers within a specific modulo such as 0 9 for modulo 10 0 7 for modulo 8 0 9 plus A B C D E F for modulo 16 0 9 plus A Z plus some symbols for modulo 64 etc. In accordance with some embodiments the distribution of the elements and the score of each element may be decided based on certain rules which can be as complex as a function on the elements on the players hands and the elements already played in the board or as simple as selecting elements completely at random before every element selection or simply selecting at random from a fixed element distribution decided a priori.

As described above in some embodiments a setup subroutine of program or another module or program may comprise a determination of how many elements each player is to be provided as available for placement by the player during a move e.g. how many elements each player is to hold at the beginning of each move or turn . This may in some embodiments be a function of the player s previous moves or game history. In other embodiments the number of elements for a player may be determined on a random or pseudo random basis e.g. using a random number generator algorithm or may be a predetermined number defined by the rules of the game. For purposes of one illustrative example it may be assumed that each player is to be provided seven 7 elements and is to have seven 7 elements available for placement at the beginning of each turn or move such that any elements placed or used by the player during a particular move are replaced with additional elements at the end of the move or at the beginning of the next move. In this example it may further be assumed that seven 7 elements are selected or determined on a random or pseudo random basis and after every move where the player places N where N is less or equal to 7 game elements on the board the process selects N new game elements if the central pool still has N game elements available or all the remaining game elements in the central pool if less than N are available using the above element distribution to make available to the player for placement such that at the beginning of every move the player has 7 game elements available for placement e.g. until the game elements in the central pool are exhausted .

As described in some embodiments a subroutine of program or another module or program may comprise i determining and or utilizing one or more rules for determining a validity of a move and or ii determining and or utilizing one or more rules for scoring a move or turn or the whole game or session of the game. Some example rules for determining the validity of a move may comprise i determining whether the elements to be evaluated for a move e.g. elements placed by the player for a move and in some embodiments elements previously placed on the game interface to which the player has added one or more additional elements during a current move satisfy a requirement for the elements to be placed in sequence along a single horizontal or vertical line ii determining whether any newly placed element s create a contiguous sequence with elements previously placed on the game interface and iii determining whether at least one of the element s placed during a current move have been placed next to at least one element previously placed on the game interface e.g. during a previous move by the player of the current move or another player unless the present move is the first move of the game. Some example rules for determining a score may comprise taking into account i the position of the sequence of elements being evaluated for a current move ii the length of the sequence of elements being evaluated for a current move iii the number of elements being evaluated for the current move iv a score or point value associated with each element being evaluated for a current move v the sequence s modified by each element being evaluated for a current move vi the number of the moves already played by that player or all players in the current session or game and vii whether this is the first or the last move of this player or all players in the current session or game. It should be noted that not all of the example rules for determining a score may be utilized and any combination of the foregoing or other rules may be utilized in determining a score.

It should be noted that in accordance with some embodiments the elements evaluated for a current move to determine a validity of the move and or a score for the move may comprise not only elements placed by the player onto the game interface during the current move but other associated elements e.g. elements within a predetermined positional relationship to the element s placed by the player in the current move or elements indicated by the player as the ones to be evaluated for the current move .

For example as described herein in some embodiments the player whose turn it is to play a move selects the elements to play and places them on the board in a single horizontal or vertical line. In accordance with some embodiments the sequences generated as a result of element s placed by the player may be required to form a contiguous line in order to form a valid sequence which may be accepted and evaluated for a score. However in some embodiments it may be acceptable for a player to place elements to the left or to the right of elements previously placed on a game interface e.g. in a previous move by the same or a different player such that any elements placed by the player in the current move do not form a contiguous sequence by themselves but do form a contiguous sequence when evaluated with any intervening or connecting elements. For example assume the following three elements have previously been placed on a game interface in a vertical line e.g. in a vertical line of adjacent element positions of the game interface 

In accordance with some embodiments a player for a current move may add the elements 2 and 9 onto the game interface in a valid move which results in a contiguous sequence of elements in a horizontal line utilizing one of the previously placed elements already on the game interface 

Thus in some embodiments determining the validity of the current move and determining the score for the current move may comprise evaluating not only the element s placed by the player onto the game interface in the current move but also elements previously placed on the game interface the combination of the currently placed elements and the previously placed elements forming the set of elements evaluated for purposes of the current move. In the present illustrative example the sequence of the 2 7 and 9 may comprise the set of elements evaluated. Thus even though the two elements placed onto the game interface by the player in the current move the 2 and the 9 do not by themselves form a contiguous sequence in a straight line they do contribute to a valid sequence of elements in a contiguous and straight line and thus the move may be considered to be valid in accordance with some rules.

As also described in some embodiments a subroutine of program or another module or program may comprise one or more rules for determining whether or when the game is over e.g. the subroutine may comprise certain conditions which when satisfied cause the game to end . In accordance with some embodiments determining an end of the game may be a function of at least one of i the scores of the player s participating in the game ii the number of moves of one or more of the player s iii the number of elements remaining as available for output to player s in a pool or set of elements iv the number of elements remaining as available for use by one or more of the player s participating in the game v the number and or type of elements placed in total or by one of more of the player s . In accordance with some embodiments a game or session is determined to end or is ended upon a player placing all of their available elements on the game interface. In some embodiments a game or session is determined to end when there are no more available elements to select from a pool or set of elements for distribution to a player. In still other embodiments a game or session is determined to end when none of the players can place another element on the board e.g. none of the elements available to a player may be placed in any manner which would satisfy a required mathematical relationship with other elements for a valid move .

In accordance with some embodiments and as described herein a subroutine of program or another module or program may comprise determining and or utilizing one or more rules for determining a winner of the game. Such a subroutine may be particularly applicable in games which involve multiple players. In accordance with some embodiments determining a winner of a game may be based on at least one of the following factors i the highest scoring move ii the total final score for each player ii the creation of the longest sequence in the board. In some embodiments the winner is simply determined to be the player who has achieved the highest score during the game.

It should be noted that in some embodiments some of the determinations described above e.g. composition of the game interface e.g. size of the board number and placement of element positions associated with special scoring rules e.g. multiplier squares rule s for determining a validity of a move rule s for determining a score for a move or game an end of a game may be predetermined and programmed into the software or application module for facilitating the game and need not be determined anew for each game initiated by a player. Thus for example executing a determination or decision as described herein may comprise retrieving one or more rules pertaining to the game from a database or other memory or executing a subroutine of a game program. In some embodiments a game may allow for customization of one or more default configurations or rules which are implemented unless a player indicates otherwise.

It should be noted that although the term sequence is used herein to refer to an arrangement of elements other arrangements of elements would also be within the scope of the embodiments described herein and the term sequence is used merely for convenience. For example in some embodiments a player may be allowed to skip or leave a position blank when arranging elements on a board and yet still have the elements near the open position qualify for a given move or score. It should further be noted that although multiplier positions are described as examples of positions which may cause a benefit or bonus to be applied to a player s score other bonus schemes are also within the scope of the embodiments described herein. For example in some embodiments a certain position may cause a predetermined number of extra bonus points to be awarded to a player who places a qualifying element on that position rather than multiplying a number of points that would otherwise be awarded.

The game request application may comprise for example a subroutine program or software module operable to respond to requests for games from players. In some embodiments the game request application is a subroutine or module of program . For example in one embodiment the game request application may comprise code or instructions operable to facilitate or perform the initiation of a new game e.g. such as the game setup functionality described herein e.g. with respect to program . In one embodiment the game request application is launched or initiated upon a request for a new game from a player and comprises the game setup functionalities of determining at least one of i the number of available symbol positions on a game interface e.g. the size of the board ii the type number and placement of available symbol positions having special scoring rules associated therewith e.g. the multiplier squares iii the type and number of elements or symbols to be used in the game e.g. the number of game elements to be made available in a general pool or set of elements from which particular elements for each user participating in the game are selected iv the number of elements each player holds for each move v the one or more rules in accordance with which the move is declared valid vi the one or more rules in accordance with which a score of each move and or of the whole game is calculated and vii the one or more rules for determining the winner of the game.

Examples of such data include without limitation i a history of moves in the game ii an indication of which player is to make the next move iii an indication of elements available for distribution to player s participating in the game e.g. elements available in a pool or set of elements available for distribution to players iv an indication of score s achieved or determined during the game v an indication of elements distributed to player s and thus available for placement on the game interface vi an indication of elements placed on the game interface and the position of each such placed element and vii a composition of a game interface for the game e.g. number and configuration of element positions and any special scoring rules associated with any such element positions . In some embodiments a game may be playable over a relatively long period of time with periods of inactivity between moves. In such embodiments the data stored for a game may persist at least until the game is determined to have ended. In some embodiments a unique identifier may be determined or generated for each game as it is initiated and also stored in the game data database in association with the data defining the game. In some embodiments an identifier uniquely identifying each user participating in the game may also be stored.

The user data database may store data defining one or more users participating in or who have participated in one or more games facilitated by the apparatus or who have registered with an entity associated with the apparatus . For example for each user on which data is stored in the user data database at least one of the following may be stored i a unique identifier of a user e.g. an identifier generated or determined by the apparatus to internally uniquely identify a user ii an indication of past game s or score s of the user iii contact information for the user e.g. an e mail address mobile telephone number IP address of an associated user device etc. iv login credentials for accessing a website or application via which game s described herein may be played e.g. user name and password and v a current status of the user e.g. whether the user is currently engaged in an active game online logged in an active user a user of a certain player rating etc. . An example table of a user data database is provided below 

Either or both of the game data database and the user data database or any other databases described herein may comprise one or more databases and or tables which may be stored in a storage device distinct from the data storage device or in an apparatus distinct from apparatus . It should be noted that any or all of the exemplary instructions and data types described herein and other practicable types of data may be stored in any number type and or configuration of memory devices that is or becomes known. The data storage device may for example comprise one or more data tables or files databases table spaces registers and or other storage structures. In some embodiments multiple databases and or storage structures and or multiple data storage devices may be utilized to store information useful in various embodiments described herein. According to some embodiments the data storage device may be incorporated into and or otherwise coupled to the apparatus e.g. as shown in while in other embodiments it may simply be accessible to the apparatus e.g. externally located and or situated .

It should be noted that the apparatus may function as a computer terminal and or server of an online game provider or other entity operating to provide online games receive and or manage information related to online games.

In accordance with some embodiments the apparatus may comprise i a front tier server accepting the requests for the game play and communicating the information back to user devices ii a front tier server and iii a middle tier logical component of the server handling the user device to server communication and performing the logic of the game.

Turning now to illustrated therein are snapshots of an example game interface and with respect to the game elements placed thereon as play of a game progresses. In particular illustrates an example game interface as it may appear at the beginning of a game prior to any game elements being placed thereon. The game interface comprises in accordance with some embodiments a plurality of available element positions arranged in a 15 15 square grid or tile pattern. As described herein a game interface may comprise different types of element positions. In some embodiments each different type of element position may be indicated in a visually differentiable manner. In the particular embodiment of different types of element positions are depicted as either i white no background pattern type ii a diagonal striped background pattern iii a dotted background pattern and iv a grid background pattern . Of course any other manner of indicating to a player different types of element position may be used and the embodiments described herein are not dependent on any particular manner of depicting such differences. The different types of element positions may in some embodiments each be associated with a respective scoring rule. For example a white no background patter type may be associated with a scoring rule in accordance with which an element placed on such positions is counted simply as the face value point or value score indicated on the element or associated with the element. In another example a diagonal striped background pattern may be associated with a scoring rule in accordance with which a face value point or value score on an element placed on such position is doubled or has some other benefit applied to it .

In accordance with some embodiments one or more of the available symbol positions e.g. squares on a game interface may be marked to indicate that placement of elements on these positions qualifies the associated player for bonus points or higher scores or is otherwise associated with a special scoring rule e.g. the positions may be marked with notations such as 2E 2 3E 3 2S 2X and 3S 3X or similarly and may be color coded or otherwise visually differentiated to indicate that status . For example in accordance with some embodiments 2E or 2 means double element namely the score of the element placed in that position is counted twice. Similarly 3E and 3 may mean triple element . 2S and 2X may mean double sequence i.e. that the whole sequence of elements which includes the element in that position is counted twice. And similarly 3S and 3X may mean triple sequence . Variations can include for example 4E 4 4S 4X or higher multipliers or multipliers that get triggered only when a sequence of elements that is adjacent to or otherwise within some predetermined relationship to the multiplier position is modified or multipliers that are triggered both when a sequence of elements which includes the element on the multiplier position is created as well as when the sequence is modified e.g. additional elements are added to the subject sequence either by the same player or a different player . In the example interface of the dotted background pattern element position type comprises one associated with a 3X sequence multiplier scoring rule the grid background element position type comprises one associated with a 2X sequence multiplier scoring rule and the diagonal line background element position type is associated with a 2X game element multiplier scoring rule. For example a 3X game element multiplier scoring rule may be used or a add 3 points to game element point value scoring rule may be utilized. Many other scoring rules which provide some benefit to a player as a result of the player placing a game element on an element position associated with the scoring rule would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the present disclosure.

It may be assumed for purposes of illustrating one non limiting example of a game which may utilize a game interface such as game interface that the game elements available for placement during a game may be blank elements or elements which have indicated thereon a numeral from the set 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9. In accordance with some embodiments the distribution and scoring of the game elements is selected a priori. It may further be assumed that the particular distribution of game elements in the example game i.e. the set of elements from which elements are selected and output to player s as available for placement on the game interface during a move consists of two 2 blank game elements ten 10 0 elements fourteen 14 1 elements fourteen 14 2 elements fourteen 14 3 elements eight 8 4 elements eight 8 5 elements eight 8 6 elements six 6 7 elements six 6 8 elements and six 6 9 elements as summarized in the table below a face value score or point value also being shown for each type of element 

In this particular example each game element s score value i.e. the number of points or value of a score contributed to a total score for a move involving the element is the same as the number indicated on the game element and utilized for purposes of determining whether the game element satisfies a required mathematical relationship with the other game elements being evaluated for a current move and the score value of a blank element is 0.

Referring now to illustrated therein is the game interface with the additional game interface area for showing a set of game elements provided to a player for use in placing onto the game interface during a move. In accordance with some embodiments it may be assumed that for purposes of the present example each player can hold seven 7 game elements which the central process selects at random from the central pool of game elements and adds to the game elements of each player after each move so that if there are enough game elements available in the central pool each player always ends up holding seven 7 game elements. The example area shows the seven 7 numbers the player has available as 0 1 1 2 2 9 and 9 .

The illustration of game interface of further shows that in the present example scenario at least one player has placed a sequence of numbers onto the game interface. The sequence placed by the at least one player is 1 8 9 7 6. As can be seen the 1 in the sequence has been placed on the center symbol position . After a player has placed the sequence on the game interface a processor e.g. a processor of apparatus or a processor of a user device if different from apparatus may evaluate the validity of the sequence and or calculate a score for the sequence .

As described herein evaluating a sequence to determine whether it is valid may in some embodiments comprise determining whether the game elements of the sequence satisfy a mathematical relationship or other rule. In some embodiments the required mathematical relationship that all elements of a sequence must bear to one another is a modulo 10 addition or a modulo 10 difference. Modulo 10 is also alternatively referred to in the mathematical literature and herein as mod 10 . It should be noted that in accordance with some embodiments the mathematical term modulo 10 addition simply means add the numbers and just use the last digit. So 7 9 16 therefore 7 9 modulo 10 6. Similarly two numbers differing by modulo 10 really means that if you lay down the numbers in sequence 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 then a number is next to another in this sequence and the sequence wraps around like a circle so that 0 is actually next to 9. Assuming for purposes of the present non limiting example that any sequence placed on a game interface must satisfy the mathematical relationship of a mod 10 a processor would determine the sequence to be a valid one since 1 8 9 mod 10 8 9 7 mod 10 and 9 7 6 mod 10 .

In accordance with some embodiments calculating a score for a sequence or other set of numerals being evaluated may comprise adding up the score value of each game element of the sequence which respective score value in accordance with some embodiments is also the value used for determining whether the game elements satisfy the required mathematical relationship in order to determine whether the sequence is a valid one . In accordance with some embodiments the calculation of a score may further take into account any special scoring rules associated with any element positions onto which a numeral of the sequence has been placed. For purposes of the present example the 1 has been placed on a dotted background pattern element position type while the 6 has been placed on a diagonal line background element position type . As described with respect to the dotted background pattern element position type comprises one associated with a 3X sequence multiplier scoring rule and the diagonal line background element position type is associated with a 2X game element multiplier scoring rule. Thus using these scoring rules and the face value of the points associated with each game element of the sequence a processor may calculate the score for the sequence as follows 1 8 9 7 2 6 3 1 8 9 7 12 3 37 3 111. The processor may further provide to the player replacement game elements to replace the five game elements used by the player to create the sequence .

Turning now to illustrated therein is a representation of game interface at a time after the placement of the sequence of after a player either the same player who placed the sequence of or another player the latter if the game being played is a multi player game . Assuming the player was provided with the elements 0 3 4 5 7 7 9 it can be seen in that the player elected to place these numbers onto the game interface as the sequence 5 9 4 3 7 0 7 sequence . As with sequence of the sequence may be evaluated by a processor e.g. a processor of apparatus or a processor of a user device if different from the apparatus to determine whether it is valid and or a score may be calculated for the sequence.

For purposes of the present example it may be assumed that a processor would determine the sequence to be valid because it satisfies the mod 10 addition mathematical relationship requirement applied to sequence of and because in accordance with some embodiments it further satisfies an additional rule of the game in that at least one of the game elements of a placed sequence must be adjacent to game element of a previously placed sequence in the example of there are two adjacent game elements since the 0 of sequence is under the 1 of sequence and the second 7 of sequence is under the 8 of sequence . The sequence satisfies the mod 10 addition mathematical relationship as illustrated i 5 9 4 modulo 10 ii 9 4 3 modulo 10 iii 4 3 7 modulo 10 iv 3 7 0 modulo 10 and v 7 0 7 modulo 10 .

It should further be noted that the placement of sequence actually created three 3 distinct sequences in that the 1 of sequence and the 0 of sequence created a second sequence and the 8 of sequence and the 7 of sequence created a third sequence. It should be assumed for purposes of the present example that the mod 10 addition mathematical relationship requirement is applied to sequences of three 3 or more elements while a two 2 element sequence must satisfy a distinct rule that the numbers of the two game elements differ by mod 10 . Applying this latter mathematical relationship requirement to the two other 2 element sequences created by the placement of sequence it may be seen that each of the sequences would be determined to satisfy this rule the sequence 1 0 is valid because it is a two number sequence and the numbers differ by mod 10 and the sequence 8 7 is valid because it is a two number sequence and the numbers differ by mod 10 .

In accordance with some embodiments computing a score for a move may comprise summing the score for each sequence created during the move by i summing for each given sequence of the move the face value point score of each game element and ii applying any special scoring rules of any element position s onto which an element of a given sequence has been placed provided those element positions have not been used by an existing sequence in the board. Recalling from the description of that i the diagonal line background element position type is associated with a 2X game element multiplier scoring rule and ii the grid background element position type comprises one associated with a 2X sequence multiplier scoring rule a processor computing a score for the move illustrated in and the three sequences resulting from that move including the sequence and the 1 0 and 8 7 sequences would compute the score as follows 1 0 1 a 8 2 7 22 b 5 9 4 3 2 7 0 2 7 2 98 c 

In accordance with some embodiments bonus points may be added to a score if certain conditions are satisfied. For example in some embodiments bonus points may be added to a score for a move if all of the game elements available to the player for placement during the move are in fact placed by the player during the move. In the present example it may be assumed that 100 bonus points are added to the score for placing all seven 7 of the available game elements onto the game interface during a move. Thus in such embodiments the score of 98 may be finally determined to be 198 for the move.

Turning now to illustrated therein is a flowchart of an example process which is consistent with some embodiments described herein. The process may be performed for example by a processor of an apparatus and or a processor of a user device if different from apparatus . Of course additional or different steps from those illustrated may be used and not all of the steps described with respect to process are necessary or preferred in all embodiments. The process may in some embodiments begin upon it being determined that a user has initiated a game requested a new game to be initiated or requested to enter join or return to a game in progress. For example depending on the embodiment a user may initiate join re join or return to a game by various methods including but not limited to initiating a single player game initiating a multi player game with a randomly chosen user or an existing acquaintance of theirs or a computer opponent or accepting another user s or computer opponent s invitation to play a game. In some embodiments a player may initiate or join a game make one or more moves in the game pause the game unjoin the game or not participate in the game for some time and subsequently rejoin or return to the game. In such embodiments if the game is a single player game the game may be paused e.g. for a maximum period of time or for an indefinite period of time until the player returns to the game. If the game is a multi player game the one or more other players may in some embodiments be allowed to continue the game without the player while in other embodiments the game is paused until the player makes his her next move e.g. the game progresses while the other player s move then is paused when it is the subject player s turn to move .

It should be noted that in some embodiments a given user can be involved with e.g. playing or participating in multiple games at a given time e.g. playing them in parallel . In such embodiments the user may be playing the multiple games on the same user device or different user devices the games can be of the same type or they can be of different types e.g. at least one of which may be a single player game while another is a multi player game where the multi player games can be played with multiple opponents or with the same opponent . For example in some embodiments upon launching a software application for facilitating the game on the appropriate user device and or logging into a website or server operable to facilitate the game e.g. logging into a website of user interface server or game production server via a user device a user may i be prompted to place a move in the one or more games the user has previously initiated or joined ii be provided with an interface for initiating a new game or joining a game in progress or previously initiated by another player.

For example in one embodiment involving a multi player game and upon entering a game or game provider website the user is provided with information and or gets notified regarding the move s of the other player s if they are playing a multi player game and is prompted to play a move when it is the subject player s turn to make a move e.g. place a sequence . In another embodiment involving a multi player game a user who has previously initiated or joined a multi player game that has not yet ended may receive a notification via one or more of their user devices associated with the player i when it is the player s turn to play ii when one of the other players has won the game quit the game lost the game or made some other game related action or iii when another user sends them a message via email or chat or via posting into another platform.

It should be noted that in some embodiments players participating in a multi player game may be provided with a means of communication with one another. For example upon entering a game when sending a move when finishing or winning or quitting the game and at any other time a player may be allowed to choose to communicate their actions such as playing of the game their last move their score etc e.g. with automatically generated and or custom comments via chat or email or posting to sites such as the website of the game provider Twitter Facebook or others.

Returning now to process in step it is determined that a player participating in a game has completed a move in the game e.g. the player has finished placing game elements on the game interface . In accordance with some embodiments step may be triggered by an indication from a player while in other embodiments step may comprise an automatic determination by a processor e.g. based on information inferred from a player s action or a time allotted for a move . For example in some embodiments a player may actuate a done or move complete button or area of the game interface to indicate that the game elements for the move should be evaluated.

In step the one or more sequence s of numbers created in the move is are determined. For example at least one sequence created by a player in a current move via placement of one or more game elements on the game interface is determined. In some embodiments step may comprise identifying the at least one game element to be evaluated for a current move. In some embodiments such a determination may be done automatically by a processor e.g. based on game elements placed by the player during the current move . For example the one or more game elements placed by a player may be identified and a positional relationship evaluation of the one or more game elements placed by the player may be performed to identify any sequences created by the player which may also include one or more game elements previously placed on the game interface by the player performing the current move or another player . In other embodiments a player may manually indicate which game elements are to be evaluated for a current move e.g. by clicking on or otherwise selecting game elements for evaluation .

In step the one or more sequence s determined in step are evaluated to determine whether they satisfy one or more positional rule s for the game. In some embodiments such an evaluation is performed separately for each sequence created by a move if more than one sequence has been created which in some embodiments is only possible after the first move of the game when placement of game elements onto the game interface may create one or more sequences with game elements previously placed on the game interface in addition to any sequences created by the newly placed elements on the game interface . As described herein in accordance with some embodiments each move or each sequence created by a move needs to satisfy at least one positional relationship rule and at least one mathematical relationship rule.

A positional relationship rule defines requirements or restrictions as to how a game element may acceptably be placed on the game interface e.g. the positional relationship as to the other game elements also placed during the current move the positional relationship as to any game elements previously placed and or the positional relationship to element positions of the game interface . Various positional relationship rules have been described herein and will not be repeated for purposes of brevity. For example it may be determined that the game elements of a given sequence are positioned along a straight horizontal or vertical line. It should further be noted that certain positional relationship rules may apply to only certain circumstances. For example in some embodiments only the very first move of the game has the positional relationship requirement that one of the game elements placed is on the center element position of the game interface and it is only after the very first move has the positional relationship requirement that at least one placed game element is adjacent to a previously placed game element. In another embodiment players of a certain player rating or otherwise having a certain characteristic e.g. expert rated players may have more stringent or difficult to satisfy positional relationship rules applied to their moves. In yet another embodiment games of a certain rating or otherwise having a certain characteristic e.g. expert or difficult games may have more stringent or difficult to satisfy positional relationship rules applied to moves of the games. Thus in some embodiments step may comprise determining which positional relationship rule to apply e.g. based on which move it is a rating or characteristic of the player a rating or other characteristic of the game or another factor .

As described herein in one embodiment a rule for the very first move in a game may comprise a requirement that one game element placed during the move is placed in the center square of the board. Examples of additional rules for evaluating a validity of a move include without limitation i a requirement that the elements evaluated for a given move e.g. any newly placed game elements and any game elements already on the game interface which are being evaluated in combination for a given move are positioned in a sequence of game elements in a single horizontal or vertical line ii a requirement that the elements evaluated for a given move be positioned such that they create a contiguous sequence and iii a requirement that at least one game element placed on a the game interface for a current move is placed next to a game element previously placed on the game interface which requirement may be omitted for the very first move of a game when no game elements have previously been placed on the game interface . Such rules may be referred to as positional relationship rules meaning they are rules requiring elements being evaluated for a current move to satisfy at least one positional relationship to one another to at least one game element previously placed on the game interface or to at least one element position of the game interface.

If it is determined in step that the one or more positional rule s are satisfied the process continues to step . Otherwise the process continues to step in which step a notice message or other indication is output to the player indicating the error or problem with the move e.g. an explanation of why or how the game element s placed by the player fail to satisfy the one or more positional rule s . In other embodiments a player s attempted placement of one or more game elements onto a game interface which fails to satisfy the one or more positional rule s may be rejected at the time it is attempted e.g. an evaluation of the game element s the player is placing is evaluated at the time of the placement before the player completes the move and a notification may be output at that time.

In step it is determined whether the sequence s determined in step satisfy one or more mathematical relationship requirements or rules of the game. Such an evaluation may be performed separately for each such sequence. A mathematical relationship rule may as described herein define a mathematical relationship game elements or the content of game elements must bear to each other or a mathematical function the game elements must satisfy in order to be acceptable.

For example in one embodiment a set of game elements being evaluated for a current move whether a new sequence created solely by the newly placed game elements or an old sequence modified by an adjacently placed new game element may be evaluated to determine whether the set of game elements satisfies the following two requirements i if the sequence is more than three 3 game elements long then each game element is the sum modulo 10 of the previous two game elements i.e. 9 and 7 must be followed by a 6 as 9 7 modulo 10 6 a previous game element may comprise the element to the left if the sequence is horizontal or directly above if the sequence is vertical of the subject game element and ii if the sequence is comprised of two 2 game elements then the numbers must differ by 1 modulo 10 e.g. such that 8 can be next to a 7 or a 9 0 can be next to a 1 or a 9 etc. . In accordance with some embodiments a blank game element can be used to represent any number although in some embodiments the score value of the blank element may be zero 0 irrespective of the number it is representing in any given move . Additionally in some embodiments once a blank element is selected to represent a particular number the particular number represented by that blank element cannot be changed for the remainder of the game. Of course many other mathematical relationship requirements may be utilized and the embodiments described herein are not dependent on any particular mathematical relationship requirement s .

If it is determined in step that the one or more mathematical relationship rule s are satisfied the process continues to step . Otherwise the process continues to step .

In step a score is calculated for the move. For example a score for each sequence identified in step may be determined and the scores may be summed to obtain a total score for the move. As described herein in some embodiments calculating a score may comprise applying one or more special scoring rules if a corresponding scoring condition is satisfied e.g. a predetermined number of bonus points may be added if a player utilizes all of his available game elements in a single move . In one embodiment step further comprises adding the score for the move to the player s total score for the game.

In one example embodiment of calculating a score for a move the processor first counts the score of each game element such as 8 points for placing an 8 then multiplies this by the multiplier factor if it is placed on a game element position associated with a special scoring rule e.g. a multiplier rule such as 2E or 3E described above repeating the above for all game elements placed then counts again in the same manner the score for all sequences modified by the placed game elements but without using the multiplier squares for any game elements that were already on the game interface before the current move then multiplies the score of each new or modified sequence by the sequence multiplier squares such as 2S or 3S onto which the newly placed game elements were placed then adds a bonus of 100 for placing all seven 7 of one s game elements in a single move then if the player places all their game elements which could be less than 7 game elements if there were not enough game elements to replenish his or her used game elements from a previous move and there are no more game elements to select from the central pool of game elements adds the score of the other player s game elements into the score of the finishing player and subtracts the score of these game elements from the other player and finally it tallies all of the above points to compute the score for the move.

In step it is determined whether a game is over. A game may be determined to be over for example if at least one of the following possible conditions are satisfied i one or more players participating in the game requests for it to be over ii a central pool of elements for the game is depleted e.g. all elements originally available in the pool at the initiation of the game have been output to players iii a predetermined number of moves has been made iv a predetermined duration of time has passed v at least one player does not have any elements available that would satisfy the one or more mathematical relationship rule s of the game vi less than a minimum number of element positions remain open for element placement or the element positions which remain open would fail to satisfy the one or more positional rule s of the game if game elements were placed thereon vii a player has placed all of their available game elements onto the game interface in a single move in a manner which satisfies any positional and mathematical relationship rules of the game viii each of the players has had their turn without being able to place any game elements on the game interface or ix the players have had 3 consecutive tries collectively among them to place a move and they have failed.

In one example embodiment if it is determined in step that the game is over based on one or more predetermined conditions the total score of the game for one or more of the players may be updated or recalculated. For example if a player places all of their available game elements in a single move then the processor may sum up the scores of the unplaced game elements of the other player and add the total to the score of the player who placed all of his game elements onto the game interface while subtracting the total from the score of the player s who did not.

If it is determined in step that the game is over the process continues to step . Otherwise the process continues to step . In step any game elements placed on the game interface by the player are replaced e.g. the same number of game elements as the player placed on the game interface are selected at random from a pool of available game elements for the game and output to the player . The replacement game elements may be output to the player via a designated area of the game interface e.g. such as area of .

Determining a winner of the game in step is particularly applicable to multi player games. In single player games there may be no need to determine a winner but one or more benefits to be provided to the player based on his score may instead be determined. The processor declares the winner as the player with the highest score after the game ends. Of course determining the winner in step may comprise determining whether any of the players participating in the game qualify for any further bonus points to be added to their total score for the game prior to determining the winner. For example bonus points may be added to a player s score for particularly long sequences the greatest number of sequences consisting of a number of game elements greater than a predetermined number of game elements or for rewarding other desirable behavior.

In accordance with some embodiments a coach feature may be made available to players of a game which feature provides advice instructions or tips to the player for playing the game. In some embodiments a coach feature may comprise facilitating a live or recorded person to provide such advice instructions or tips. In other embodiments a coach feature may comprise software such as an algorithm or process operating on one or more computing platforms. Such advice tips or instructions may be provided to a player before or after the player playing the game performs a move. Whether it be embodied as a person or software such a coach feature is referred to as a coach herein for purposes of brevity.

In accordance with some embodiments the coach takes into account the user s game elements the moves already performed the number and distribution of the remaining game elements and other information and computes a move that tries to maximize the user s tactical position e.g. a high score in this particular move and or the user s strategic position e.g. by making it difficult for the other player s in the game to place game elements with high scores in the next move while allowing the user enough flexibility to create high scoring moves in the future as well as leaving the user with good game elements to maximize their future scoring.

In one embodiment the coach may simply propose a suggested move e.g. a sequence of game element s to place and the element position s onto which to place them to the user or indicate to the user what move s he should have placed. In some embodiments the coach may teach the game strategy to the user by communicating the goals or motives of the suggested move to the user so that the user understands the logic behind maximizing the chances of winning the whole game as opposed to simply performing a high score move but compromising his or her overall position in the game.

In embodiments in which the coach is embodied as a person such coach may interact with the player via a server e.g. game interface server or game production server and a user device. In embodiments in which the coach is embodied as software or a process operating on one or more computing platforms it may interact with a server operable to facilitate the game via an Application Programming Interface API or it can be a part of the server itself or it can operate inside the user device itself.

The following tables exemplify one possible structure of the coaching feature of the game in accordance with one embodiment. This structure supports the user purchasing a generic coaching advice from a software coach or from a human coach. A human coach can participate in a generic coaching item where the user purchasing it expects coaching advice from any coach say on a first come first served basis. Or the coach can designate their own item where the user specifically purchases coaching advice from that coach. In some embodiments a combination of these approaches may be used where the user purchases coaching from a category of coaches say A rated coaching or B rated coaching . In such embodiments a user can be participating in multiple items as a coach. In accordance with some embodiments a process may facilitate the player or players receiving the advice instructions or tips from a coach by facilitating payment to the entity providing the suggestions. In accordance with some embodiments a process may facilitate collection of payment for advice instructions or tips on behalf of the entity providing such. For example the process may provide for holding the payment from a player in escrow until the advice instructions or tips from the coach is are successfully output to the player and or implemented in the game. The process may then distribute the payment to the coach at a later time.

In accordance with some embodiments one or more tables may be utilized to store an indication of i users who are registered or qualified to serve as coaches for one or more games ii payment information for such coaches and or iii tokens purchased by a player for use in obtaining advice instructions or tips from a coach. Some example and non limiting embodiments of tables which may be useful in embodiments involving a coach are illustrated and described below.

The table immediately below comprises one example embodiment of a User Coach table which defines information about one or more users who act as coaches for one or more games. In the table a user and item may be stored as foreign keys to user id and item id of the user and item table respectively.

As described herein in embodiments in which a coach is embodied as a person e.g. a user a coach may be provided payment for serving as a coach e.g. a periodic payment . For example once a month or some other period a server process goes over the coach table adds the differences of amount accumulated payments for each coach then if the total is above a threshold for example 10 it initiates a payment to the user and adds a log in the coach payment table plus assigns the payments made in the coach table by increasing the value of payments fields accordingly.

The Payment Table below comprises one example embodiment of a payment table which may be used to track and store payment information for a coach. It should be noted that in the table below user is a foreign key to the user id field of the coach table above.

As described above in some embodiments a coach may be embodied as software e.g. an algorithm application or module comprising a program to provide advice instructions or tips to a user playing a game . The following tables exemplify one possible structure of the coaching feature embodied as software. This structure supports the user purchasing a generic coaching advice from a software coach. In this example the user buys tokens which are then utilized to invoke the software coach. Every time the coach is involved a certain number of tokens are subtracted from the user s token balance. Specifically the Purchases Table below stores in indication of the tokens purchased by a particular user.

Additionally in some embodiments a Token Usage table may be utilized to store and track an indication of the tokens usage of each user.

Finally a Token Balance table may be utilized to store and track the tokens available to each user i.e. adding the tokens the user purchased and subtracting the tokens the user has spent or utilized.

It should be noted that in accordance with some embodiments in addition or in lieu of being able to purchase tokens a player may be allowed to earn or win tokens. For example tokens may be awarded to a player on a random basis or as a reward for certain in game behavior that is sought to be encouraged. In some embodiments a new or novice player is automatically provided with a predetermined number of free tokens when first joining a game or registering with the game provider.

In accordance with various embodiments a coach embodied as software may be operable to function in any of a multitude of ways. In one example embodiment the coach may first require the player to place a move on the board. The coach may then perform an exhaustive search of all available moves to the player and select the highest scoring move. In this case the coach searches the game interface one element position at a time e.g. in a grid or tiled configuration starting from the top row and leftmost column and progressing to the rightmost column of the top row then moving to the leftmost column of the second row and progressing to the rightmost column and so on until all rows and columns have been checked . For every position the process may provide for determining whether a the position is empty and b there is a game element already placed in a neighboring position i.e. directly to the left to the right up or down of the current position. If not the coach proceeds to the next element position. If yes then the coach checks whether there is a game element available on the player s rack that can be placed on a symbol position that would constitute a valid move based on the game elements already placed on the game interface and the one or more positional rule s of the game. If not then it proceeds to the next element position if yes then it records this candidate move in its memory and checks whether the move can be extended by placing one or more of the remaining available game elements on the player s rack. If yes the coach adds this new candidate move to its memory and keeps iterating this process until the move can no longer be extended. In such a way the coach collects all the possible placements of the player at this particular turn. Then the coach orders all the moves from highest scoring to lowest scoring and picks the highest scoring move. Subsequent to finding the best possible move the coach computes the score for the player s current move and then computes the ratio of that move divided by the best possible move if the best possible move s score is greater than 0. This ratio is then shown as a percentage from 0 if the best possible move has 0 points to 100 if the player s move scores as many points as the best possible move to the player.

In accordance with some embodiments players may be allowed to purchase items or services associated with the game s described herein. In accordance with some embodiments such items or services may be made available as in app purchases ad free apps clothing physical boards etc. In one embodiment the items available for purchase may be customized or personalized for a user or user device. The table below is one example embodiment of how indications of items available for purchase may be stored 

In accordance with some embodiments a player may be allowed to swap game elements during a move e.g. with another player or with other game elements available from the central pool . For example in some embodiments a process may provide for i receiving a request to swap at least one game element ii receiving an indication of the at least one game element to be swapped iii selecting the next game elements from the pool that will be used to replace the player s game elements e.g. if there are more than a minimum number e.g. 7 seven game elements left on the pool otherwise rejecting the request for a swap iv returning the at least one returned game element into the pool and in some embodiments reshuffling the pool and v adjusting the one or more variables that hold the state of the game and saving them in a database e.g. the game data database .

In accordance with some embodiments a process may provide for generating a leaderboard of the top players among everyone playing a game or who has played a game of the game provider e.g. the same game or different games active games or inactive games etc. . For example the leaderboard may consist of the top 10 players. One way to calculate the leaderboard on a daily basis is by most games won in the last 5 days with a tie breaker of highest average score difference. In this example the server computes the most games won in the trailing 120 hours 5 days from a given time. The player with the most games won is at the top of the leaderboard the player with the second most games won at the second position and so on. In case of a tie the player with the highest average difference in score from the opponents in the games that the player won is placed higher on the leaderboard.

The present disclosure provides to one of ordinary skill in the art an enabling description of several embodiments and or inventions. Some of these embodiments and or inventions may not be claimed in the present application but may nevertheless be claimed in one or more continuing applications that claim the benefit of priority of the present application. Applicants intend to file additional applications to pursue patents for subject matter that has been disclosed and enabled but not claimed in the present application.

Numerous embodiments are described in this disclosure and are presented for illustrative purposes only. The described embodiments are not and are not intended to be limiting in any sense. The presently disclosed invention s are widely applicable to numerous embodiments as is readily apparent from the disclosure. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the disclosed invention s may be practiced with various modifications and alterations such as structural logical software and electrical modifications. Although particular features of the disclosed invention s may be described with reference to one or more particular embodiments and or drawings it should be understood that such features are not limited to usage in the one or more particular embodiments or drawings with reference to which they are described unless expressly specified otherwise.

The present disclosure is neither a literal description of all embodiments nor a listing of features of the invention that must be present in all embodiments.

The term product means any machine manufacture and or composition of matter as contemplated by 35 U.S.C. 101 unless expressly specified otherwise.

The terms an embodiment embodiment embodiments the embodiment the embodiments one or more embodiments some embodiments one embodiment and the like mean one or more but not all disclosed embodiments unless expressly specified otherwise.

The terms the invention and the present disclosure and the like mean one or more embodiments of the present disclosure. 

A reference to another embodiment in describing an embodiment does not imply that the referenced embodiment is mutually exclusive with another embodiment e.g. an embodiment described before the referenced embodiment unless expressly specified otherwise.

The terms including comprising and variations thereof mean including but not limited to unless expressly specified otherwise.

The term herein means in the present disclosure including anything which may be incorporated by reference unless expressly specified otherwise.

The phrase at least one of when such phrase modifies a plurality of things such as an enumerated list of things means any combination of one or more of those things unless expressly specified otherwise. For example the phrase at least one of a widget a car and a wheel means either i a widget ii a car iii a wheel iv a widget and a car v a widget and a wheel vi a car and a wheel or vii a widget a car and a wheel.

The phrase based on does not mean based only on unless expressly specified otherwise. In other words the phrase based on describes both based only on and based at least on .

Where a limitation of a first claim would cover one of a feature as well as more than one of a feature e.g. a limitation such as at least one widget covers one widget as well as more than one widget and where in a second claim that depends on the first claim the second claim uses a definite article the to refer to the limitation e.g. the widget this does not imply that the first claim covers only one of the feature and this does not imply that the second claim covers only one of the feature e.g. the widget can cover both one widget and more than one widget .

Each process whether called a method algorithm or otherwise inherently includes one or more steps and therefore all references to a step or steps of a process have an inherent antecedent basis in the mere recitation of the term process or a like term. Accordingly any reference in a claim to a step or steps of a process has sufficient antecedent basis.

When an ordinal number such as first second third and so on is used as an adjective before a term that ordinal number is used unless expressly specified otherwise merely to indicate a particular feature such as to distinguish that particular feature from another feature that is described by the same term or by a similar term. For example a first widget may be so named merely to distinguish it from e.g. a second widget . Thus the mere usage of the ordinal numbers first and second before the term widget does not indicate any other relationship between the two widgets and likewise does not indicate any other characteristics of either or both widgets. For example the mere usage of the ordinal numbers first and second before the term widget 1 does not indicate that either widget comes before or after any other in order or location 2 does not indicate that either widget occurs or acts before or after any other in time and 3 does not indicate that either widget ranks above or below any other as in importance or quality. In addition the mere usage of ordinal numbers does not define a numerical limit to the features identified with the ordinal numbers. For example the mere usage of the ordinal numbers first and second before the term widget does not indicate that there must be no more than two widgets.

When a single device or article is described herein more than one device or article whether or not they cooperate may alternatively be used in place of the single device or article that is described. Accordingly the functionality that is described as being possessed by a device may alternatively be possessed by more than one device or article whether or not they cooperate .

Similarly where more than one device or article is described herein whether or not they cooperate a single device or article may alternatively be used in place of the more than one device or article that is described. For example a plurality of computer based devices may be substituted with a single computer based device. Accordingly the various functionality that is described as being possessed by more than one device or article may alternatively be possessed by a single device or article.

The functionality and or the features of a single device that is described may be alternatively embodied by one or more other devices that are described but are not explicitly described as having such functionality and or features. Thus other embodiments need not include the described device itself but rather can include the one or more other devices which would in those other embodiments have such functionality features.

Devices that are in communication with each other need not be in continuous communication with each other unless expressly specified otherwise. On the contrary such devices need only transmit to each other as necessary or desirable and may actually refrain from exchanging data most of the time. For example a machine in communication with another machine via the Internet may not transmit data to the other machine for weeks at a time. In addition devices that are in communication with each other may communicate directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries.

A description of an embodiment with several components or features does not imply that all or even any of such components and or features are required. On the contrary a variety of optional components are described to illustrate the wide variety of possible embodiments of the present disclosure s . Unless otherwise specified explicitly no component and or feature is essential or required.

Further although process steps algorithms or the like may be described in a sequential order such processes may be configured to work in different orders. In other words any sequence or order of steps that may be explicitly described does not necessarily indicate a requirement that the steps be performed in that order. The steps of processes described herein may be performed in any order practical. Further some steps may be performed simultaneously despite being described or implied as occurring non simultaneously e.g. because one step is described after the other step . Moreover the illustration of a process by its depiction in a drawing does not imply that the illustrated process is exclusive of other variations and modifications thereto does not imply that the illustrated process or any of its steps are necessary to the invention and does not imply that the illustrated process is preferred.

Although a process may be described as including a plurality of steps that does not indicate that all or even any of the steps are essential or required. Various other embodiments within the scope of the described invention s include other processes that omit some or all of the described steps. Unless otherwise specified explicitly no step is essential or required.

Although a product may be described as including a plurality of components aspects qualities characteristics and or features that does not indicate that all of the plurality are essential or required. Various other embodiments within the scope of the described invention s include other products that omit some or all of the described plurality.

An enumerated list of items which may or may not be numbered does not imply that any or all of the items are mutually exclusive unless expressly specified otherwise. Likewise an enumerated list of items which may or may not be numbered does not imply that any or all of the items are comprehensive of any category unless expressly specified otherwise. For example the enumerated list a computer a laptop a PDA does not imply that any or all of the three items of that list are mutually exclusive and does not imply that any or all of the three items of that list are comprehensive of any category.

Headings of sections provided in this disclosure are for convenience only and are not to be taken as limiting the disclosure in any way.
