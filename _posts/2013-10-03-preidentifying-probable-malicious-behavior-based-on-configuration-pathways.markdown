This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 044 956 entitled Malware Detection and Prevention by Monitoring and Modifying a Hardware Pipeline which is filed contemporaneously with this application and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Generally the performance and power efficiency of a mobile computing device degrade over time. Anti virus companies e.g. McAfee Symantec etc. now sell mobile anti virus firewall and encryption products that aim to slow this degradation. However many of these solutions rely on the periodic execution of a computationally intensive scanning engine on the mobile computing device which may consume many of the mobile computing device s processing and battery resources slow or render the mobile computing device useless for extended periods of time and or otherwise degrade the user experience. In addition these solutions are typically limited to detecting known viruses and malware and do not address the multiple complex factors and or the interactions that often combine to contribute to a mobile computing device s degradation over time e.g. when the performance degradation is not caused by viruses or malware . For these and other reasons existing anti virus firewall and encryption products do not provide adequate solutions for identifying the numerous factors that may contribute to a mobile computing device s degradation over time or for preventing mobile computing device degradation.

While the various aspects are particularly useful for mobile computing devices such as smartphones which have limited resources the aspects are generally useful in any electronic device that includes a processor and executes application programs.

The term malicious behavior is used herein to refer to a wide variety of undesirable mobile computing device operations and characteristics such as longer processing times lower battery life loss of private data malicious economic activity e.g. sending unauthorized premium SMS message operations relating to commandeering the mobile computing device or utilizing the phone for spying or botnet activities etc.

The term malicious configuration is used herein to refer to a configuration of a mobile computing device application process etc. that exhibits or performs malicious behavior. The term suspicious configuration is used herein to refer to a configuration in which there is some evidence of malicious behavior but more information is needed before a definitive conclusion can be reached regarding malicious behavior. The term benign configuration is used herein to refer to a configuration that is neither a malicious configuration nor a suspicious configuration.

The term pathway configuration is used herein to refer to a vector or pathway that a network server has recognized as an intermediate configuration leading to a malicious configuration. In various aspects a pathway configuration may be any configuration e.g. a benign configuration a suspicious configuration or a malicious configuration that leads to a malicious configuration.

There are a variety of factors that may contribute to the degradation in performance and power utilization levels of a mobile computing device over time including poorly designed software applications malware viruses fragmented memory background processes and other malicious behavior. However due to the complexity of modern mobile computing devices it is increasingly difficult for users operating systems and or application programs e.g. anti virus software etc. to accurately and efficiently identify the sources of such problems and or to provide adequate remedies to identified problems.

Various solutions currently exist for detecting malicious behavior on a computing device. Many solutions have traditionally relied on a signature database of malicious code malware built on a server. These solutions require referencing a signature database to detect whether code is malicious based on the identity i.e. signature of the code such as the name of a file the name of a function call the structure of a particular code segment and even the signature of each byte of code. However these solutions are inadequate to detect malicious behavior that may be undetectable until the code is executed and are increasingly ineffective as a result of new techniques of forging signatures. In contrast the various aspects described below enable a mobile computing device to detect malicious behavior during normal operations i.e. in real time and prevent such malicious behavior from occurring in the future regardless of any particular identity or signature.

Other solutions use behavioral models to differentiate between malicious and benign process programs on computing devices. However these solutions are currently limited to evaluating the current on going behavior of individual application programs or processes. Thus these solutions are limited to resolving problems only after they have already begun. In contrast the various aspects described below enable a mobile computing device to anticipate and prevent future malicious behavior in real time before such malicious behavior occurs.

Additionally some solutions look for signs of malicious behavior in code files scripts etc. before they are executed by initiating preemptive scans. For instance a solution may require a file downloaded from a location on the Internet to be scanned for viruses before the file can be executed locally. Other solutions attempt to discover malicious behavior by executing programs or processes in a safe environment e.g. a virtual machine and attempting to discover whether the programs or processes behave maliciously when run. However these solutions require an investment of considerable computation resources because each suspected programs files processes etc. must be determined to be benign before being allowed to execute as part of normal operations.

In contrast to conventional approaches the various aspects described below enable a mobile computing device to detect and prevent malicious behavior in real time thereby avoiding the considerable startup costs of contemporary methods and allowing applications and processes to execute normally until the mobile computing device detects a credible risk of future malicious behavior. In overview the various aspects address the limitations of contemporary solutions such as those described above by providing mobile devices with a database of pathway configurations that enable mobile computing devices to determine whether they are at risk of experiencing malicious behavior in the near future given the mobile computing device s current state or condition of operation as well as operations scheduled for execution. Thus the various aspects present a system for anticipating malicious behavior on a mobile computing device before the malicious behavior begins rather than after the malicious behavior has occurred or begun. In the various aspects a network server may receive behavior vector information from multiple mobile computing devices and may implement various pattern recognition techniques including finite state machine analysis on the received behavior vector information to identify malicious configurations and pathway configurations leading to those malicious configurations. The network server may inform mobile computing devices of the identified malicious configurations and the corresponding pathway configurations i.e. configurations that exit not long before the identified malicious configurations thereby enabling the mobile computing device to anticipate and prevent malicious behavior in real time by recognizing when it has entered or is about to enter a pathway configuration leading to malicious behavior.

In an aspect the network server may receive configuration information e.g. states in a finite state machine or vector values in a behavior vector from a plurality of mobile computing devices after the mobile computing devices have detected on going malicious activity. The configuration information may indicate the configurations or states of the mobile computing devices at the time the malicious behavior was detected as well as a history of the mobile computing devices configurations and states leading up to the malicious behavior. The network server may analyze the assembled mobile computing devices configuration information e.g. by utilizing pattern recognition or finite state machine analysis to determine configurations that indicate malicious behavior. The network server may utilize the mobile computing devices configuration histories to walk back from the malicious configurations to recognize configuration patterns and pathways between configurations that lead to malicious configurations i.e. pathway configurations . The server may assemble the identified pathway configurations into a database or other suitable data structure and may send malicious and pathway configuration databases to the mobile computing devices that provide a database or data structure of the identified malicious configurations and pathway configurations that the mobile computing devices can use in analyzing their own behaviors and configurations.

In another aspect after receiving a malicious and pathway configuration database a mobile computing device may determine its current configuration and compare its current configuration to the configurations included in the malicious and pathway configuration database to determine whether its current configuration is leading to malicious behavior. In other words the mobile computing device may utilize the configuration database or data structure received from the network server to determine whether its current configuration is a pathway configuration. When the mobile computing device s current configuration is a pathway configuration the mobile computing device may implement various preventative measures to head off or prevent the malicious behavior from beginning.

In another aspect the network server may also calculate the probability that a pathway configuration leads to malicious behavior. In such an aspect the network server may send the probabilities that particular pathway configurations lead to malicious configurations with the configuration database or data structure and the mobile computing device may reference the received probabilities in addition to the pathway configurations in the configuration database or data structure to determine whether its current configuration is likely to lead to a malicious configuration.

In another aspect the network server may identify particular instructions that if performed would turn a pathway configuration into a malicious configuration. The network server may include such identified instructions in the configuration database or data structure and a mobile computing device may reference the configuration database or data structure to watch out for and prevent execution of identified instructions when the device s current configuration is a pathway configuration.

In an aspect the mobile computing devices may send their current configuration information e.g. their behavioral vectors describing their current state after experiencing malicious behavior. The mobile computing device may also send their configuration histories to the network server . The configuration histories may include a history of configuration changes that occurred leading up to the discovery of malicious behavior and optionally the instructions that caused those configuration changes.

In an aspect the classifier unit or the behavior analyzer unit may compare the mobile computing device s current configuration with one or more pathway configurations included in the malicious and pathway configuration database received from the network server to determine whether the current configuration of the mobile computing device matches a pathway configuration included in the malicious and pathway configuration database. For example the behavior analyzer unit may generate a behavioral vector for a particular application currently running on the mobile computing device and the classifier unit may compare the application s behavioral vector with pathway configurations included in the malicious and pathway configuration database to determine whether the application s current configuration is leading to malicious behavior on the mobile computing device.

When the classifier unit determines that the mobile computing device s current configuration is included in the malicious and pathway configuration database received from the network server i.e. that the mobile computing device s current configuration is leading to malicious behavior the classifier unit may notify the actuator unit which may perform various actions or operations to prevent malicious behavior or other performance degrading activities on the mobile computing device before such malicious behavior occurs.

The cloud unit may be configured to receive a large amount of information from a cloud service network and generate a full or robust data behavior model that includes all or most of the features data points and or factors that lead to malicious behaviors. In an aspect the information from the cloud service network may include configuration information and configuration histories reported from multiple mobile computing devices that detected some form of malicious behavior. For example multiple mobile computing devices may have reported malicious behavior for a particular configuration and may have also reported their configurations states instructions leading up to the malicious behavior detected.

The malicious and pathway configuration database generator may generate a malicious and pathway configuration database that includes behavior models based on a full behavior model generated in the cloud unit . In an aspect generating the behavior models may include generating one or more reduced feature models RFMs that include a subset of the features and data points included in the full model generated by the cloud unit . In an aspect the malicious and pathway configuration database generator may generate a malicious and pathway configuration database that includes an initial feature set e.g. an initial reduced feature model that includes information determined to have a highest probably of enabling the classifier unit to conclusively determine whether a particular mobile computing device behavior is leading to malicious behavior. The malicious and pathway configuration database may send the generated malicious and pathway configuration database to the classifier unit .

The behavior observer unit may monitor observe mobile computing device behaviors on the mobile computing device generate observations and send the observations to the classifier unit . The classifier unit may perform real time analysis operations which may include comparing behavior models in the malicious and pathway configuration database to configuration information collected by the behavior observer unit to determine whether the mobile computing device s current state is leading to malicious behavior. The classifier unit may determine that a mobile computing device behavior is leading to malicious behavior when the classifier unit determines that the mobile computing device s current configuration matches a pathway configuration included in the malicious and pathway configuration database. As discussed above with reference to when the classifier unit finds a match the classifier unit may alert the actuator unit to begin taking steps to avoid future malicious behavior.

In another aspect the mobile computing device may send the results of its operations and or success rates associated with the application of models to the network server . For example the classifier unit may not find a match in the malicious and pathway configuration database but malicious behavior may still occur thereby indicating previously undetected malicious behavior i.e. a gap in protection that the mobile computing device may report to the network server to include in a next distribution of malicious and pathway configuration databases. The network server may generate training data e.g. via the training data unit based on the results success rates for use by the model generator . The model generator may generate updated malicious and pathway configuration databases based on the training data and send the updated malicious and pathway configuration databases to the mobile computing device and other mobile computing devices on a periodic basis.

In block the network server may receive configuration information and configuration histories from a plurality of mobile computing devices. In an aspect when a mobile computing device detects malicious behavior e.g. being hacked malware or viruses etc. the mobile computing device may send the network server a behavior vector or similar information that represents the mobile computing device s configuration at the time the mobile computing device discovered the malicious behavior. Additionally the mobile computing devices may also send configuration histories that describe the progression of configurations that occurred up until the malicious behavior was detected.

In an aspect the mobile computing device may maintain a list of configuration changes that begins from an initial configuration such as a startup configuration. For example a mobile computing device may detect malware activity when its behavior vector is 0 2 1 0 . . . 4 . The mobile computing device may send the behavior vector 0 2 1 0 . . . 4 to the network server and information for retracing the mobile computing device s configurations from 0 2 1 0 . . . 4 to an earlier configuration such as an initial configuration e.g. 0 0 0 0 . . . 0 . In another aspect the mobile computing device may conserve resources by maintaining only an abbreviated configuration history i.e. the mobile computing device may only keep an account of a certain number of previous configurations leading up to the malicious configuration .

In block the network server may analyze the configuration information to identify malicious configurations. In an aspect the network server may identify malicious configurations by matching identical or similar behaviors reported by several mobile computing devices to represent malicious behavior. In a further aspect the network server may identify a configuration as malicious only when a certain number or percentage of mobile computing devices identifies the configuration as malicious. In other words the network server may employ a confidence threshold to label behaviors as malicious only when there is some consensus among the mobile computing devices reporting in.

In another aspect the network server may receive configuration information from various types and models of mobile computing devices that may not share the same capabilities or configurations and thus the mobile computing device may have dissimilar configuration information behavioral vectors. In such an aspect the network server may identify malicious configurations by implementing various pattern matching algorithms or strategies to detect malicious configurations or particular features that multiple mobile computing devices commonly report to represent malicious behavior. In other words the network server may compile thousands of reports from mobile computing devices of different models and determine the configuration characteristics consistently present at the time the mobile computing devices detected malicious behavior. For example the network server may determine that various types of mobile computing devices almost always reported malicious behavior when their configurations included screen off accessing contact information and transmitting data. 

In block the network server may identify pathway configurations based on the identified malicious configurations. In an aspect a pathway configuration may be a precursor configuration leading up to a malicious configuration. In other words a pathway configuration may be at risk of evolving into a malicious configuration under some circumstances. For example a pathway configuration may be one or two configuration changes away from being a malicious configuration.

In an aspect after receiving numerous configuration histories the network server may implement pattern recognition or state machine analysis if the configuration history is presented as transitions between states to discover one or more patterns or configurations leading to an ultimate malicious configuration. In other words the network server may use the configuration histories from the various mobile computing devices to walk back i.e. along configuration paths from the malicious configuration to identify an earlier configuration or configurations that have led to the malicious configurations. These earlier configurations may be identified as pathway configurations as defined above when the analysis determines that there is a significant probability that a subsequent configuration will be malicious. As discussed below with reference to any given configuration or state may evolve or be transformed into any number of subsequent configurations or states depending upon the instructions or operations that are performed next. Thus a configuration that preceded a malicious configuration may not necessarily lead to the malicious configuration if other instructions or operations are performed. To address this the server analysis may determine from the reported information how frequently a given configuration leads directly to a malicious configuration and identify as pathway configurations only those configurations that frequently i.e. the frequency exceeds a threshold value or probability lead to malicious configurations. For example the network server may only classify a configuration as a pathway configuration when there is over a 10 chance that the configuration will lead to malicious behavior. The server analysis may also identify the instructions operations that when performed transform a pathway configuration into a malicious configuration.

In an aspect the network server may first identify a malicious configuration state as discussed above with reference to block one or more intermediate configurations and a starting configuration. For example the network sever may first identify that transmitting address book information while the screen is off is a malicious configuration and may walk back to discover that accessing address book information while the display screen is off is a pathway configuration that frequently leads to transmitting address book information while the screen is off. 

In an aspect to increase the effectiveness of using pathway configurations as early warning signs of future malicious behavior the network server may only classify a configuration as being a pathway configuration when that configuration is within a threshold number of steps away from a malicious configuration. The server analysis may also identify the subsequent pathway configurations leading directly to malicious behavior as well as instructions operations that when performed take the mobile computing device through the series of steps from the identified pathway configuration to a malicious configuration.

In block the network server may generate a malicious and pathway configuration database that includes the identified malicious configurations and the identified pathway configurations. In an aspect the malicious and pathway configuration database may include information that may enable a mobile computing device to assess whether the mobile computing device is at risk of entering a malicious configuration as discussed below with reference to .

As discussed above in optional block the network server may calculate a probability of transitioning to a malicious configuration for each identified pathway configuration. To calculate the probabilities the network server may analyze the configuration histories of thousands of mobile computing devices to determine how often a transition from a pathway configuration to a malicious configuration occurs. For example after analyzing reports from 100 000 mobile computing devices the network server may determine that 70 000 mobile computing devices transitioned from a certain pathway configuration to a benign configuration i.e. 70 or 0.7 and that 30 000 transitioned from the certain pathway configuration to a malicious configuration i.e. 30 or 0.3 . In an aspect the network server may represent this information in a Markov Chain analysis that includes each configuration i.e. state and the probabilities for transitioning from one configuration to another as illustrated in below. The network server may also include the calculated probabilities in the malicious and pathway configuration database in optional block .

Also as discussed above in optional block the network server may identify malicious pathway instructions or operations that when executed while in an identified pathway configuration lead to a malicious configuration. In this operation the network server may analyze the behavior vector information and configuration histories to identify the code parameters or other instructions that cause a pathway configuration to turn into a malicious configuration. The network server may identify such instructions in the context of particular pathway configurations. Thus the network server may determine the instructions that when executed cause pathway configurations to become malicious thereby enabling a mobile computing device to better determine whether it is at risk of evolving to a malicious configuration. In other words the network server may determine that a mobile computing device in a particular pathway configuration will become malicious after executing certain instructions that are referred to herein as malicious pathway instructions. It should be noted that malicious pathway instructions may only result in malicious behavior or malicious configurations when they are executed while the mobile computing device is in a pathway configuration. In this manner the various aspects differ from conventional malware detection systems because the aspects enable recognizing and reacting to instructions operations that in most circumstances are safe and not associated with malicious behaviors.

The network server may include a list of the identified instructions that lead to the identified malicious configurations when executed in the malicious and pathway configuration database in optional block . In a further aspect the network server may also include an association between a pathway configuration and the malicious pathway instruction or instructions that will cause the pathway configuration to become malicious. A mobile computing device may utilize a malicious and pathway configuration database that includes a list of instructions leading to malicious behavior to avoid such malicious behavior as further described below with reference to .

In block the network server may send the malicious and pathway configuration database to a plurality of mobile computing devices. In various aspects the mobile computing device may use the malicious and pathway configuration databases for use in preemptively identifying pathway configurations that may lead to malicious behavior. In an aspect the malicious and pathway configuration databases may present the malicious and pathway configurations as states in a finite state machine paths or as behavior vector values that can be utilized by a behavior analyzer unit and or classifier unit operating on the mobile computing device.

In an optional aspect the network server may execute the process in a loop as it continually receives behavior vector information and configuration histories from mobile computing devices in block . In such an aspect the network server may receive the behavior vector information and configuration histories on a rolling basis. In other words the network server may continually receive information of malicious behavior from the mobile computing devices as they occur and the network server may continually analyze and identify malicious configurations and pathway configurations as more behavior vector information and configuration histories are receive. As such the network server may repeat the process in order to continually send out updated malicious and pathway configuration databases to the mobile computing devices based on new information received.

In block the mobile computing device may receive a malicious and pathway configuration database. As discussed above in block of method described with reference to the network server may use crowd sourced configuration information and or configuration histories to identify certain configurations that have a risk of leading to some form of malicious behavior reported by other mobile computing devices. The network server may compile information regarding malicious and pathway configurations into a malicious and pathway configuration database and may send one or more malicious and pathway configuration databases to the mobile computing device. In a further aspect the mobile computing device may routinely receive the malicious and pathway configuration databases as part of a periodic service that the network service manages e.g. the mobile computing device may register with the network server to receive malicious and pathway configuration databases .

In block the mobile computing device may determine its current configuration. As described above with reference to in an aspect a behavior observer unit may collect various types of information regarding the current operations status state of the mobile computing device i.e. behavior observations as well as the configuration or state changes the mobile computing device has undergone.

In an aspect the mobile computing device may reference a behavior vector to ascertain the mobile computing device s current configuration. In another aspect a behavior analyzer unit may receive the behavior observations from the behavior observer unit and the behavior analyzer unit may use the behavior observations to generate a behavior vector or another indication of the mobile computing device s current configuration. For example the behavior analyzer unit may determine that the mobile computing device s current configuration indicates that data is being transmitting and that the screen is off. The behavior analyzer unit may conduct finite state analysis using the behavior observations by which the behavior analyzer unit may determine the mobile computing device s current configuration by following a series of state transitions to the current state i.e. current configuration . Using a finite state machine analysis to determine the current configuration is described in further detail below as discussed with reference to .

In determination block the mobile computing device may determine whether a current configuration is leading to a malicious configuration based on the malicious and pathway configuration database. In other words the mobile computing device may determine whether its current configuration is a pathway configuration. In an aspect a behavior analyzer unit and or a classifier unit may compare the mobile computing device s current configuration e.g. a behavior vector representing the mobile computing device s current configuration to the pathway configurations and malicious configurations included in the malicious and pathway configuration database received from the network server to determine whether the current configuration matches a pathway configuration included in the malicious and pathway configuration database.

When the mobile computing device determines that the current configuration is not leading to a malicious configuration based on the malicious and pathway configuration database i.e. determination block No the mobile computing device may continue performing normally in block . The process may continue in loop as the mobile computing device may continue by determining the current configuration of the mobile computing device in block . Thus in an aspect the mobile computing device may continually check its current configuration to make sure it is not at risk of a future malicious behavior.

When the mobile computing device determines that the current configuration is leading to a malicious configuration based on the malicious and pathway configuration database i.e. determination block Yes the mobile computing device may determine whether to implement preventative measures to avoid the malicious configuration in optional determination block .

In some instances the mobile computing device may experience poor or unacceptable performance by implementing preventative measures every time the current configuration of the device or a component on the device is determined to be leading to a malicious configuration. Because there is no certainty that the current configuration will actually evolve into a malicious configuration the mobile computing device may selectively implement preventative measures only when there is a certain risk of malicious behavior in the near future that exceeds a predefined threshold in order to achieve an effective balance of security and performance. For example the mobile computing device may only implement preventative measures when the current configuration has a substantial likelihood of leading to a malicious configuration as further described below with reference to . Similarly in another example the mobile communication device may only implement preventative measures when a calculated risk of entering a malicious configuration from the current configuration exceeds a predefined probability risk threshold as further described below with reference to .

In a further aspect the predefined threshold may be set based on user input received from a user interface component on the mobile computing device and the predefined threshold may reflect a user s security to performance preference. For example a user at an intelligence agency may require higher security i.e. more instances in which the mobile computing device determines to implement preventative measure to avoid a future malicious configuration to ensure that all the malicious applications are caught and such a user may configure the mobile computing device to use a low threshold so that preventative measures are taken most or all of the time. In another example another user may decide that stopping every malicious behavior is not worth the performance impact and may configure the mobile computing device to implement preventative measures only when the risk of entering a malicious configuration exceeds a high threshold.

When the mobile computing device determines not to implement preventative measures to avoid the malicious configuration i.e. optional determination block No the mobile computing device may continue performing normally in block . The process may continue in loop as the mobile computing device may continue by determining the current configuration of the mobile computing device in block . Thus in an aspect the mobile computing device may continually check its current configuration to make sure it is not at risk of a future malicious behavior.

When the mobile computing device determines to implement preventative measures to avoid the malicious configuration i.e. optional determination block Yes the device may implement preventative measures to avoid the malicious configuration in block . In an aspect the mobile computing device may perform various operations to avoid a future malicious configuration such as determining the applications processes associated with the future malicious configurations and terminating quarantining and or curing those applications processes. Implementing preventative measures is described below in further detail with reference to .

After implementing preventative measures the mobile computing device may continue performing normally in block . The process may continue in a loop as the analysis engine may continue by determining the current configuration of the mobile computing device in block .

While the above description pertains to determining whether a mobile computing device s current configuration is leading to a malicious configuration in further aspects the mobile computing device or a component operating on the mobile computing device may instead determine whether the current configuration of an individual hardware or software component operating on the mobile computing device is leading to a malicious configuration. For example the mobile computing device may determine that an application s current configuration is a pathway configuration that leads to a malicious configuration. In these alternative aspects the malicious and pathway configuration database received from the network server may include information regarding malicious and pathway configurations necessary for the mobile computing device or a component operating the mobile computing device to determine whether individual applications or hardware components are at risk of malicious behavior in the near future.

The operations of method implement an aspect of the operations of block of method described above with reference to . Thus the mobile computing device may begin performing method after determining that the mobile computing device is currently in a pathway configuration leading to malicious behavior i.e. determination block Yes .

In block the mobile computing device may identify one or more processes associated with the current configuration. In an aspect the one or more processes may be applications programs scripts hardware components or other components operating on the mobile computing device. For example the current configuration may include camera on and screen off and the mobile computing device may associate those characteristics with a camera application currently running on the mobile computing device.

In an another aspect the mobile computing device may receive information included in the malicious and pathway configuration database that identifies one or more processes associated with the mobile computing device s current pathway configuration and the mobile computing device may leverage this information to identify one or more processes related to the current configuration. For example after determining that it is in a pathway configuration the mobile computing device may reference the malicious and pathway configuration database to discover that a social media application operating on the mobile computing device is associated with the pathway configuration and thus is likely responsible for leading the mobile computing device to malicious behavior. In a further aspect the malicious and pathway configuration database may include the identities of more than one process or component linked to a pathway configuration.

In block the mobile computing device may slow down execution of the one or more processes. In an aspect slowing down the one or more processes may be an initial preventative measure that arrests on going development of malicious behavior which may occur soon after initially discovering that the current configuration is a pathway configuration as described above in determination block of method described with reference to . In another aspect the mobile computing device may instead completely stop the one or more processes execution.

While slowing or pausing the execution of the one or more processes may temporarily reduce the functionality and performance of the mobile computing device such costs may be outweighed by the potential benefits of avoiding malicious behavior in the near future. The various aspects further reduce these costs because the mobile computing device may judiciously intervene in processes operations only after determining that the mobile computing device is currently in a pathway configuration. Thus by taking action only when there is a detected risk of future malicious behavior i.e. when the mobile computing device is currently in a pathway configuration the mobile computing device may protect itself while causing minimal impact on the one or more processes or components operating on the mobile computing device.

Returning to in block the mobile computing device may examine the other behaviors currently occurring on the mobile computing device. In an aspect while the one or more processes are slowed or stopped the mobile computing device may investigate other on going activities in an attempt to better predict whether the current configuration is trending towards malicious behavior. For example the mobile computing device may scan applications or hardware components related to or used by the one or more processes in an attempt to discover other unusual or suspicious behavior. In another aspect the examination of other behaviors may include comprehensive and thorough scanning and analysis and slowing down the one or more processes may enable the mobile computing device to complete these comprehensive scans before the current configuration evolves into a malicious configuration.

In optional determination block the mobile computing device may determine whether more examination is required before making a definitive determination of whether the current configuration is becoming malicious. When the mobile computing device determines that more examination is needed i.e. optional determination block Yes the mobile computing device may continue examining other behaviors currently occurring on the mobile computing device in optional block . The mobile computing device may continue examining other behaviors until it is reasonably capable of making a definitive determination of whether the current configuration is becoming malicious and or what may be causing the mobile computing device to trend toward malicious behavior.

Thus when the mobile computing device determines that more examination is not required i.e. optional determination block No the mobile computing device may determine whether there is a substantial likelihood that the current configuration is leading to a malicious configuration based on the examination of other behaviors in determination block . In an example in which the one or more processes are a camera application that is taking a picture while the screen is off i.e. the current configuration is camera on and screen off the mobile computing device may conclude that the current configuration is not entering a malicious state e.g. screen off camera on and transmit camera data on because other activity on the mobile computing device indicates that the screen is about to turn on in response to the user s input. In this example the current configuration is anticipated to transition to camera on and screen on which may not be a malicious configuration.

When the mobile computing device determines that there is not a substantial likelihood that the current configuration is leading to a malicious configuration i.e. determination block No the mobile computing device may return the one or more processes to normal operations in block . In an aspect the one or more processes may continue operations at a normal rate.

When the mobile computing device determines that the current configuration is becoming malicious i.e. determination block Yes the mobile computing device may interrupt the one or more processes in optional block . In an aspect interrupting the one or more processes may include completely stopping execution of or terminating the one or more processes.

In block the mobile computing device may implement preventative measures for the one or more processes. In an aspect the mobile computing device may implement various techniques to avoid malicious behavior including isolating the one or more processes from interacting with other applications or components on the mobile computing device and resetting restarting the one or more processes from an initial benign configuration. Other techniques may include restoring the one or more processes to an earlier processing point that is known to be benign e.g. reverting an application to an earlier version . The mobile computing device may also return the one or more processes to normal operations in block .

The mobile computing device may continue by determining the current configuration in block of method described above with reference to .

In an aspect the FSM may include a state i.e. a configuration for each of the mobile computing device s possible configurations screen on screen off sending data etc. . The FSM may also represent how the mobile computing device s configuration changes over time with transitions from one state configuration to another. For example the FSM may indicate that a particular configuration A e.g. screen on and sound off may transition to another configuration B e.g. screen on and sound on .

In an aspect a network server may generate the FSM based on configuration information and or configuration histories obtained from multiple mobile devices. For instance the network server may receive configuration information from multiple mobile computing devices and may compile this information to generate a FSM representing the configurations states of the mobile computing devices and the transitions between those configurations. In an example the network server may receive configuration histories from thousands of mobile computing devices and may generate a FSM that represents configuration transitions from an initial configuration e.g. a power on state to various intermediate and terminal configurations. In another aspect because different mobile computing devices may have different features or functionalities the network server may generate specialized FSMs for mobile computing devices sharing similar characteristics e.g. the same model number manufacturer etc. .

In another aspect the network server may classify each configuration state in the FSM as a benign configuration a suspicious configuration or a malicious configuration. In an aspect the network server may perform a behavioral analysis based on the configuration information received from the multiple mobile computing devices. For example the network server may identify configurations consistently linked with reports of malicious behavior i.e. malicious configurations configurations that require more examination to determine whether they are malicious i.e. suspicious configurations and configurations that do not indicate malicious behavior i.e. benign configurations . Thus in a further aspect the network server may produce a FSM that describes configurations and transitions between those configurations as well as each configuration s classification.

Additionally in another aspect after classifying the configurations in the FSM the network server may walk back from malicious configurations to identify configurations that have a substantial risk of leading to those malicious configurations i.e. pathway configurations as described above with reference to . For example the network server may use the configuration information and configuration histories received from the multiple mobile devices to determine particular configurations that consistently indicate the beginning of a trend toward malicious behavior.

In another aspect after generating the FSM classifying the configurations in the FSM and identifying pathway configurations leading to malicious configurations in the FSM the network server may send this information regarding the FSM to the mobile computing device such as in a malicious and pathway configuration database as described above with reference to .

In an aspect the mobile computing device may utilize the FSM to track its configurations in real time. For example during normal operations the mobile computing device may follow the configuration transitions in the FSM to keep track of its current configuration. In another aspect the mobile computing device may determine whether its current configuration is a pathway configuration e.g. as indicated in a malicious and pathway configuration database received from the network server . When the mobile computing device determines that it is currently in a pathway configuration the mobile computing device may analyze the FSM to determine potential configurations to which the mobile computing device may transition in the near future. In other words the mobile computing device may perform finite state machine analysis and walk forward from the mobile computing device s current configuration to determine the configurations that may next occur i.e. potential future configurations .

In an aspect the potential future configurations may be configurations to which mobile computing device may reach after a particular number of transitions. For example the mobile computing device s current configuration may be screen off and sound off. Thus the mobile computing device may have two potential future configurations that may be reachable in one transition configuration change such as screen on and sound off and screen off and sound on. In a further example the mobile computing device may transition to another potential future configuration reachable in two transitions e.g. screen on and sound on .

In an aspect after identifying the potential future configurations the mobile computing device may determine their classifications and may take necessary steps to prevent or avoid entering a malicious configuration in the future based on the classifications of those potential future configurations. In an example the mobile computing device may currently be in configuration A which is benign and not a pathway configuration i.e. there is no identified risk of future malicious behavior given the current configuration . In this event the mobile computing device may continue operating normally. In other words the mobile computing device may quickly check whether its current state is leading to malicious behavior in real time i.e. during actual normal operations without having to spend considerable computation resources.

In a continuation of the above example the mobile computing device may undergo one or more configuration changes over time that may cause the mobile computing device to transition from configuration A to a configuration B . Upon entering configuration B the mobile computing device may determine that its current configuration is a pathway configuration. Thus the mobile computing device may determine that there is a risk of transitioning to a malicious configuration in the near future. At this point the mobile computing device may slow or stop one or more processes related to the configuration B to allow for additional time to assess the likelihood that malicious behavior will occur in the near future. Thus by waiting to begin preventative measures until there is an identified risk of future malicious behavior the mobile computing device may avoid unnecessary computations.

In an aspect after entering pathway configuration the mobile computing device may determine whether there is a substantial likelihood of malicious behavior in the near future based on the classification of its current configuration and the classifications of potential future configurations as illustrated in table described with reference to . In another aspect further described below with reference to the mobile computing device may utilize information received from the network server to determine the probability e.g. a value from 0.0 to 1.0 of malicious behavior occurring in the near future and the device may determine that there is a substantial likelihood of malicious behavior when the probability of malicious behavior exceeds a certain threshold probability e.g. 25 .

In an example after the mobile computing device determines that configuration B is a pathway configuration the mobile computing device may determine that configuration B is benign and that the potential future configurations reachable in one step i.e. configuration C and configuration D are benign and malicious respectively. In an aspect the mobile computing device may reference a table and based on the table lookup conclude that that there is a substantial likelihood of future malicious behavior because configuration B leads directly to a malicious configuration.

In another example when the mobile computing device s current configuration is configuration E the mobile computing device may determine that there is an insubstantial likelihood of eventually leading to malicious behavior because the only potential future configuration i.e. configuration F is benign. However if the mobile computing device transitions to configuration F the mobile computing device may determine that there is a substantial risk of future malicious behavior because the potential future configurations are all malicious.

In another example in which the mobile computing device s current configuration is configuration G the mobile computing device may determine there is a substantial likelihood that the current configuration is leading to malicious behavior because the configuration G is suspicious. In an aspect the mobile computing device or the network server may classify a configuration as suspicious when more information is needed in order to determine whether a configuration is benign or malicious.

In an aspect after determining the likelihood of future malicious behavior the mobile computing device may determine whether to implement various preventative measures to avoid future malicious behavior based on the determined likelihood. The process of determining the appropriate measures to take based on the determined likelihood is described below with reference to .

The operations of method implement an aspect of the operations of block of method described above with reference to . Thus the mobile computing device may begin performing method after determining that the current configuration is a pathway configuration determination block Yes as described above with reference to .

In block the mobile computing device may identify one or more processes associated with the current configuration as described above with reference to . The mobile computing device may also slow down execution of the one or more processes in block . In an aspect by slowing down the execution of the one or more processes the mobile computing device may have additional time to determine whether preventative measures are necessary to avoid malicious behavior in the near future.

In block the mobile computing device may determine the classification of the current configuration. In an aspect the mobile computing device may determine whether the current configuration is benign malicious or suspicious. In an aspect a network server may have determined the classifications of the various configurations of the mobile computing device as described with reference to e.g. as part of an FSM describing the mobile computing device s configurations and the transitions between those configurations and may have sent the classifications as part of a malicious and pathway configuration database received by the mobile computing device.

In another aspect rather than receiving the mobile computing device s current configuration s classification from the network server as part of a malicious and pathway configuration database a behavior analyzer unit and or a classifier unit operating on the mobile computing device may instead determine the classification of the mobile computing device s current configuration locally as discussed above with reference to . For example a behavior analyzer unit may receive current behavioral observations from a behavioral observer unit and may generate a behavioral vector that represents the mobile computing device s current configuration. The classifier unit may then determine whether the generated behavioral vector indicates that the mobile computing device s current configuration is benign suspicious or malicious.

In optional determination block the mobile computing device may determine whether the current configuration is malicious. When the mobile computing device determines that the current configuration is malicious i.e. optional determination block Yes the mobile computing device may implement remedial measures on the one or more processes associated with the current configuration to resolve the current malicious configuration in optional block . In an aspect when the mobile computing device s current configuration is malicious it may be too late to prevent malicious behavior and thus the mobile computing device may need to implement remedial measures to stop the on going malicious behavior. For example the mobile computing device may scan for and remove malware viruses corrupt files etc. The mobile computing device may also return the one or more processes to normal operations in block . The mobile computing device may also continue performing by determining the current configuration in block of method described above with reference to .

When the mobile computing device determines that the current configuration is not malicious i.e. optional determination block No the mobile computing device may determine the classifications of potential future configurations in block . In an aspect the mobile computing device may determine the classifications of the potential future configurations as discussed above with reference to determining the classification of the current configuration in block . For example the mobile computing device may have received the classifications of the potential future configurations as part of a malicious and pathway configuration database sent from a network server. In another example the mobile computing device or one or more components operating on the mobile computing device may generate behavioral vectors based on the potential future configurations and classify those behavioral vectors.

In block the mobile computing device may determine a likelihood that the current configuration will lead to a malicious configuration based on the classifications of the current configuration and the potential future configurations. In an aspect the mobile computing device may reference a look up table like table described above with reference to to determine the likelihood of the current configuration leading to malicious behavior.

In determination block the mobile computing device may determine whether the current configuration has a substantial likelihood of leading to a malicious configuration. For example the mobile computing device may determine that there is an insubstantial risk of malicious behavior in the near future when the current configuration and all of the potential future configurations are benign. In another example the mobile computing device may determine that there is a substantial risk of malicious behavior when one or more of the potential future configurations are malicious even though the current configuration is benign.

When the mobile computing device determines that there is an insubstantial likelihood of leading to a malicious configuration i.e. determination block No the mobile computing device may return the one or more processes to normal operations in block . The mobile computing device may continue performing by determining the current configuration in block of method described above with reference to .

When the mobile computing device determines that there is a substantial likelihood that the current configuration will lead to malicious behavior i.e. determination block Yes the mobile computing device may optionally interrupt the execution of the one or more processes in optional block . In an aspect the mobile computing device may stop the execution of the one or more processes to provide the mobile computing device sufficient time to avoid any future malicious behavior.

In block the mobile computing device may implement preventative measures for the one or more processes as described above in block of method illustrated in . In an aspect implementing preventative measures may include adjusting the performance or configuration of the one or more processes to avoid anticipated malicious behavior. For example the one or more processes may be reverted to an earlier configuration known to be benign.

In block the mobile computing device may return the one or more processes to normal operations. In an aspect not shown the mobile computing device may resume the one or more processes normal execution when the mobile computing device determines that there is no longer a substantial likelihood of malicious behavior in the near future. The mobile computing device may continue performing by determining the current configuration in block of method described above with reference to .

In an aspect the network server may generate a FSM from configuration information configuration histories received from multiple mobile computing device as described above with reference to FSM illustrated in . Thus FSM may include various configurations states and transitions among those configurations. The network server may also determine a classification i.e. benign malicious or suspicious for each configuration in the FSM and determine the one or more configurations that lead to malicious behavior i.e. pathway configurations .

Additionally in another aspect the network server may calculate the probability that a pathway configuration will directly transition to a particular potential future configuration e.g. from screen off to screen on . For instance the network server may receive reports from multiple mobile computing devices and may determine the number of times each pathway configuration transitioned to a potential future configuration out of total number of reported transitions. For example as illustrated in the network server may have calculated that mobile computing devices in configuration B transitioned to configuration C 10 of the time and transitioned to configuration D 90 of the time.

In a further aspect after determining that the current configuration is a pathway configuration the mobile computing device may determine the classifications of the potential future configurations and the probability that the current configuration will transition to each of the potential future configurations. If the probability of directly transitioning to a malicious potential future configuration exceeds a certain threshold the mobile computing device may implement preventative measures to avoid the anticipated malicious behavior. For example a mobile computing device in configuration E may have a 0 chance of directly transitioning to a malicious configuration. In this situation the mobile computing device may not implement preventative measures because the probability of directly transitioning to a malicious configuration is below a threshold probability. However a mobile computing device in configuration F may have a 100 0.7 0.3 1.0 100 chance of directly transitioning to a malicious state and therefore the mobile computing device may implement preventative measures to avoid the very high probability that the current configuration will lead to malicious behavior.

In another aspect the network server may calculate a probability of eventually transitioning to a malicious configuration for each pathway configuration as described above with reference to optional block in . In an example a mobile computing device in configuration H may eventually transition to two malicious configurations i.e. configuration D and configuration I . The probability of transitioning from configuration H to configuration D is 9 a 10 probability of transitioning to configuration B and then a 90 probability of transitioning from configuration B to configuration D . The probability of transitioning from configuration H to configuration I may be 2.5 a 5 probability of transitioning from configuration H to configuration G and a 50 probability of transitioning from configuration G to configuration I . Therefore a mobile computing device in configuration H may have an overall 11.5 9 2.5 11.5 chance of eventually leading to a malicious configuration.

The network server may send the mobile computing device probability information that may enable the mobile computing device to determine the probability that a pathway configuration will eventually lead to malicious behavior. In another aspect the mobile computing device may receive the probabilities of transitioning from a pathway configuration to potential future configurations i.e. the probabilities of directly transitioning from the current configuration to a next configuration and may locally calculate the probability that a current pathway configuration will eventually lead to malicious behavior.

In block the mobile computing device may receive a malicious and pathway configuration database from a network server that includes configuration transition probabilities. As discussed with reference to the configuration transition probabilities may describe the likelihood that a mobile computing device will transition from one configuration to another configuration including the probability that a pathway configuration will transition to a malicious configuration. In an aspect the configuration transition probabilities may describe the probability of transitioning directly from a pathway configuration to a malicious configuration i.e. the probability of entering a malicious configuration in a single transition . In another aspect the configuration transition probabilities may indicate the overall probability of eventually transitioning from a pathway configuration to a malicious configuration i.e. the probability of entering a malicious configuration in one or more transitions .

In block the mobile computing device may determine its current configuration as discussed with reference to block of method described above with reference to . For example a behavioral analyzer unit may generate a behavioral vector describing the mobile computing device s current configuration based on behavioral observations.

In determination block the mobile computing device may determine whether the current configuration is leading to a malicious configuration based on the malicious and pathway configuration database. In other words the mobile computing device may determine whether the mobile computing device is a pathway configuration by comparing the mobile computing device s current configuration with a list of pathway configurations included in the malicious and pathway configuration database received from the network server. When the mobile computing device determines that the current configuration is not a pathway configuration i.e. determination block No the process may continue in a loop until the mobile computing device determines that its current configuration is a pathway configuration i.e. that there is a risk of future malicious behavior .

When the mobile computing device determines that the current configuration is a pathway configuration i.e. determination block Yes the mobile computing device may identify one or more processes associated with the current configuration in block . The mobile computing device may also slow down the execution of the one or more processes in block . In an aspect the mobile computing device may identify and slow down the execution of the one or more processes in a manner similar to the ones described above with reference to .

In an optional aspect the mobile computing device may determine whether the current configuration is malicious in optional determination block . For example by the time the mobile computing device receives a malicious and pathway configuration database from the network server the mobile computing device s current configuration may already be a malicious configuration. When the mobile computing device determines that the current configuration is malicious i.e. optional determination block Yes the mobile computing device may implement remedial measures on the one or more processes to resolve the current malicious configurations in optional block . For example the mobile computing device may employ convention methods of scanning for and removing malware. The mobile computing device may return the one or more processes to normal operations in block . The process may continue in a loop as the mobile computing device may continue recognizing when the mobile computing device enters a pathway configuration starting in block .

When the mobile computing device determine that the current configuration is not malicious i.e. optional determination block No the mobile computing device may determine a probability of the current configuration leading to a malicious configuration based on the current configuration and the configuration transition probabilities in block . In an aspect the mobile computing device may reference the configuration transition probabilities received from the network server and determine the probability that the mobile computing device will directly transition to a malicious configuration from its current configuration.

In another aspect the mobile computing device may follow transitions from the current configuration to one or more malicious configurations. The mobile computing device may utilize the configuration transition probabilities received from the network server to calculate the probability of the mobile computing device s transition to a malicious configuration from its current configuration after one or more transitions. For example the mobile computing device may have a 75 chance of transitioning from its current configuration to an intermediate configuration and a 50 chance of transitioning from the intermediate configuration to a malicious configuration. Thus there may be a 37.5 75 50 37.5 chance that the current configuration will eventually lead to a malicious configuration.

In determination block the mobile computing device may determine whether the probability of the current configuration leading to a malicious configuration exceeds a risk threshold. In an aspect the risk threshold may represent a point at which the costs of implementing preventative measures may exceed the benefits of avoiding malicious behavior. For example the costs of restoring the one or more processes associated with the current configuration to a previous state or version may not be cost effective when there is only a 5 chance that the current configuration will actually develop into a malicious configuration. The costs of implementing preventative measures may greatly benefit the mobile computing device s overall performance when there is a 95 chance that the current configuration will lead to malicious behavior. As mentioned above with reference to the risk threshold may be set based on a user input received from a user interface device thereby enabling the user to specify a desired level of security.

For example mobile computing device may report both their configurations at the point in which they discovered malicious behavior as well as a list of the instructions the mobile computing devices performed leading up to the malicious behavior. Thus in an aspect the network server may generate a malicious and pathway configuration database that includes these potentially malicious pathway instructions thereby enabling a mobile computing device to monitor for and prevent the execution of these instructions as described below.
