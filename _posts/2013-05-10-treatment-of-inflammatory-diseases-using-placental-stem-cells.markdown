This application is a continuation of U.S patent application Ser. No.12 030 161 filed Feb.12 2008 which claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 901 067 filed Feb. 12 2007 which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.

Provided herein are methods of using human placental stem cells to treat individuals having a disease disorder or condition caused by or relating to an unwanted or harmful immune response for example inflammatory bowel disease graft versus host disease multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis lupus erythematosus diabetes mycosis fungoides Alibert Bazin syndrome or scleroderma.

Human stem cells are totipotential or pluripotential precursor cells capable of generating a variety of mature human cell lineages. Evidence exists that demonstrates that stem cells can be employed to repopulate many if not all tissues and restore physiologic and anatomic functionality.

Many different types of mammalian stem cells have been characterized. See e.g. Caplan et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 486 359 human mesenchymal stem cells Boyse et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 004 681 fetal and neonatal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells Boyse et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 192 553 same Beltrami et al. 114 6 763 766 2003 cardiac stem cells Forbes et al. 197 4 510 518 2002 hepatic stem cells . Umbilical cord blood and total nucleated cells derived from cord blood have been used in transplants to restore partially or fully hematopoietic function in patients who have undergone ablative therapy.

The placenta is a particularly attractive source of stem cells.

As used herein the term SH2 refers to an antibody that binds an epitope on the marker CD 105. Thus cells that are referred to as SH2 are CD105.

As used herein the terms SH3 and SH4 refer to antibodies that bind epitopes present on the marker CD73. Thus cells that are referred to as SH3 and or SH4 are CD73.

As used herein the term isolated stem cell means a stem cell that is substantially separated from other non stem cells of the tissue e.g. placenta from which the stem cell is derived. A stem cell is isolated if at least 50 60 70 80 90 95 or at least 99 of the non stem cells with which the stem cell is naturally associated are removed from the stem cell e.g. during collection and or culture of the stem cell.

As used herein the term isolated population of cells means a population of cells that is substantially separated from other cells of the tissue e.g. placenta from which the population of cells is derived. A population of e.g. stem cells is isolated if at least 50 60 70 80 90 95 or at least 99 of the cells with which the population of stem cells are naturally associated are removed from the population of stem cells e.g. during collection and or culture of the population of stem cells.

As used herein the term placental stem cell refers to a stem cell or progenitor cell that is derived from a mammalian placenta regardless of morphology cell surface markers or the number of passages after a primary culture which adheres to a tissue culture substrate e.g. tissue culture plastic or a fibronectin coated tissue culture plate . The term placenta stem cell as used herein does not however refer to a trophoblast a cytotrophoblast embryonic germ call or embryonic stem cell as those cells are understood by persons of skill in the art. A cell is considered a stem cell if the cell retains at least one attribute of a stem cell e.g. a marker or gene expression profile associated with one or more types of stem cells the ability to replicate at least 10 40 times in culture multipotency e.g. the ability to differentiate either in vitro in vivo or both into cells of one or more of the three germ layers the lack of adult i.e. differentiated cell characteristics or the like. The terms placental stem cell and placenta derived stem cell may be used interchangeably. Unless otherwise noted herein the term placental includes the umbilical cord. The placental stem cells disclosed herein are in certain embodiments multipotent in vitro that is the cells differentiate in vitro under differentiating conditions multipotent in vivo that is the cells differentiate in vivo or both.

As used herein a stem cell is positive for a particular marker when that marker is detectable. For example a placental stem cell is positive for e.g. CD73 because CD73 is detectable on placental stem cells in an amount detectably greater than background in comparison to e.g. an isotype control . A cell is also positive for a marker when that marker can be used to distinguish the cell from at least one other cell type or can be used to select or isolate the cell when present or expressed by the cell.

As used herein immunomodulation and immunomodulatory mean causing or having the capacity to cause a detectable change in an immune response and the ability to cause a detectable change in an immune response.

Provided herein are methods for the treatment of an individual having a disease disorder or condition associated with arising from or related to an inappropriate unwanted harmful or deleterious immune response e.g. an autoimmune disease comprising administering to the individual having the disease disorder or condition one or more doses of placental stem cells and or umbilical cord stem cells. Methods for the treatment of such individuals and for the administration of such stem cells alone or in combination with other therapies are discussed in detail below.

Provided herein are methods for the modulation e.g. suppression of the activity e.g. proliferation of an immune cell or plurality of immune cells by contacting the immune cell s with a plurality of placental stem cells. Such immunomodulation is useful in the treatment of an individual having a disease disorder or condition caused by or relating to an unwanted or harmful immune response for example inflammatory bowel disease graft versus host disease multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis lupus erythematosus diabetes mycosis fungoides Alibert Bazin syndrome or scleroderma. Such immunomodulation is also useful e.g. in the reduction or elimination of a host immune response against allogenic tissue e.g. a transplanted organ composite tissue allograft and the like.

In one embodiment provided herein is a method of suppressing an immune response comprising contacting a plurality of immune cells with a plurality of placental stem cells for a time sufficient for said placental stem cells to detectably suppress an immune response wherein said placental stem cells detectably suppress T cell proliferation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction MLR assay or a regression assay.

Placental stem cells are e.g. the placental stem cells described elsewhere herein see Section 5.2 . Placental stem cells used for immunosuppression can be derived or obtained from a single placenta or multiple placentas. Placental stem cells used for immunosuppression can also be derived from a single species e.g. the species of the intended recipient or the species of the immune cells the function of which is to be reduced or suppressed or can be derived from multiple species.

An immune cell in the context of this method means any cell of the immune system particularly T cells and NK natural killer cells. Thus in various embodiments of the method placental stem cells are contacted with a plurality of immune cells wherein the plurality of immune cells are or comprises a plurality of T cells e.g. a plurality of CD3 T cells CD4 T cells and or CD8 T cells and or natural killer cells. An immune response in the context of the method can be any response by an immune cell to a stimulus normally perceived by an immune cell e.g. a response to the presence of an antigen. In various embodiments an immune response can be the proliferation of T cells e.g. CD3 T cells CD4 T cells and or CD8 T cells in response to a foreign antigen such as an antigen present in a transfusion or graft or to a self antigen as in an autoimmune disease. The immune response can also be a proliferation of T cells contained within a graft. The immune response can also be any activity of a natural killer NK cell the maturation of a dendritic cell or the like. The immune response can also be a local tissue or organ specific or systemic effect of an activity of one or more classes of immune cells e.g. the immune response can be graft versus host disease inflammation formation of inflammation related scar tissue an autoimmune condition e.g. rheumatoid arthritis Type I diabetes lupus erythematosus etc. . and the like.

 Contacting in this context encompasses bringing the placental stem cells and immune cells together in a single container e.g. culture dish flask vial etc. or in vivo for example the same individual e.g. mammal for example human . In a preferred embodiment the contacting is for a time sufficient and with a sufficient number of placental stem cells and immune cells that a change in an immune function of the immune cells is detectable. More preferably in various embodiments said contacting is sufficient to suppress immune function e.g. T cell proliferation in response to an antigen by at least 50 60 70 80 90 or 95 compared to the immune function in the absence of the placental stem cells. Such suppression in an in vivo context can be determined in an in vitro assay see below that is the degree of suppression in the in vitro assay can be extrapolated for a particular number of placental stem cells and a number of immune cells in a recipient individual to a degree of suppression in the individual.

In certain embodiments provided herein are methods of using placental stem cells to modulate an immune response or the activity of a plurality of one or more types of immune cells in vitro. Contacting the placental stem cells and plurality of immune cells can comprise combining the placental stem cells and immune cells in the same physical space such that at least a portion of the plurality of placental stem cells interacts with at least a portion of the plurality of immune cells maintaining the placental stem cells and immune cells in separate physical spaces with common medium or can comprise contacting medium from one or a culture of placental stem cells or immune cells with the other type of cell for example obtaining culture medium from a culture of placental stem cells and resuspending isolated immune cells in the medium . In a specific example the contacting is performed in a Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction MLR . In another specific example the contacting is performed in a regression assay.

Such contacting can for example take place in an experimental setting designed to determine the extent to which a particular plurality of placental stem cells is immunomodulatory e.g. immunosuppressive. Such an experimental setting can be for example a mixed lymphocyte reaction MLR or regression assay. Procedures for performing the MLR and regression assays are well known in the art. See e.g. Schwarz The Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction An In Vitro Test for Tolerance 127 5 879 890 1968 Lacerda et al. Human Epstein Barr Virus EBV Specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes Home Preferentially to and Induce Selective Regressions of Autologous EBV Induced B Lymphoproliferations in Xenografted C.B 17 Scid Scid Mice 183 1215 1228 1996 . In a preferred embodiment an MLR is performed in which a plurality of placental stem cells are contacted with a plurality of immune cells e.g. lymphocytes for example CD3 CD4 and or CD8 T lymphocytes .

The MLR can be used to determine the immunosuppressive capacity of a plurality of placental stem cells. For example a plurality of placental stem cells can be tested in an MLR comprising combining CD4 or CD8 T cells dendritic cells DC and placental stem cells in a ratio of about 10 1 2 wherein the T cells are stained with a dye such as e.g. CFSE that partitions into daughter cells and wherein the T cells are allowed to proliferate for about 6 days. The plurality of placental stem cells is immunosuppressive if the T cell proliferation at 6 days in the presence of placental stem cells is detectably reduced compared to T cell proliferation in the presence of DC and absence of placental stem cells. In such an MLR placental stem cells are either thawed or harvested from culture. About 20 000 placental stem cells are resuspended in 100 l of medium RPMI 1640 1 mM HEPES buffer antibiotics and 5 pooled human serum and allowed to attach to the bottom of a well for 2 hours. CD4 and or CD8 T cells are isolated from whole peripheral blood mononuclear cells Miltenyi magnetic beads. The cells are CFSE stained and a total of 100 000 T cells CD4 T cells alone CD8 T cells alone or equal amounts of CD4 and CD8 T cells are added per well. The volume in the well is brought to 200 l and the MLR is allowed to proceed.

In one embodiment therefore provided herein is a method of suppressing an immune response comprising contacting a plurality of immune cells with a plurality of placental stem cells for a time sufficient for said placental stem cells to detectably suppress T cell proliferation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction MLR assay or in a regression assay. In one embodiment said placental stem cells used in the MLR represent a sample or aliquot of placental stem cells from a larger population of placental stem cells.

Populations of placental stem cells obtained from different placentas or different tissues within the same placenta can differ in their ability to modulate an activity of an immune cell e.g. can differ in their ability to suppress T cell activity or proliferation or NK cell activity. It is thus desirable to determine prior to use the capacity of a particular population of placental stem cells for immunosuppression. Such a capacity can be determined for example by testing a sample of the placental stem cell population in an MLR or regression assay. In one embodiment an MLR is performed with the sample and a degree of immunosuppression in the assay attributable to the placental stem cells is determined. This degree of immunosuppression can then be attributed to the placental stem cell population that was sampled. Thus the MLR can be used as a method of determining the absolute and relative ability of a particular population of placental stem cells to suppress immune function. The parameters of the MLR can be varied to provide more data or to best determine the capacity of a sample of placental stem cells to immunosuppress. For example because immunosuppression by placental stem cells appears to increase roughly in proportion to the number of placental stem cells present in the assay the MLR can be performed with in one embodiment two or more numbers of placental stem cells e.g. 1 10 3 10 1 10and or 3 10placental stem cells per reaction. The number of placental stem cells relative to the number of T cells in the assay can also be varied. For example placental stem cells and T cells in the assay can be present in any ratio of e.g. about 10 1 to about 1 10 preferably about 1 5 though a relatively greater number of placental stem cells or T cells can be used.

Provided herein are methods of using placental stem cells to modulate an immune response or the activity of a plurality of one or more types of immune cells in vivo. Placental stem cells and immune cells can be contacted e.g. in an individual that is a recipient of a plurality of placental stem cells. Where the contacting is performed in an individual in one embodiment the contacting is between exogenous placental stem cells that is placental stem cells not derived from the individual and a plurality of immune cells endogenous to the individual. In specific embodiments the immune cells within the individual are CD3 T cells CD4 T cells CD8 T cells and or NK cells.

Such immunosuppression using placental stem cells would be advantageous for any condition caused or worsened by or related to an inappropriate or undesirable immune response. Placental stem cell mediated immunomodulation e.g. immunosuppression would for example be useful in the suppression of an inappropriate immune response raised by the individual s immune system against one or more of its own tissues. In various embodiments therefore provided herein is a method of suppressing an immune response wherein the immune response is an autoimmune disease e.g. lupus erythematosus diabetes rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis.

The contacting of the plurality of placental stem cells with the plurality of one or more types of immune cells can occur in vivo in the context of or as an adjunct to for example grafting or transplanting of one or more types of tissues to a recipient individual. Such tissues may be for example bone marrow or blood an organ a specific tissue e.g. skin graft composite tissue allograft i.e. a graft comprising two or more different types of tissues etc. In this regard the placental stem cells can be used to suppress one or more immune responses of one or more immune cells contained within the recipient individual within the transplanted tissue or graft or both. The contacting can occur before during and or after the grafting or transplanting. For example placental stem cells can be administered at the time of the transplant or graft. The placental stem cells can also or alternatively be administered prior to the transplanting or grafting e.g. about 1 2 3 4 5 6 or 7 days prior to the transplanting or grafting. Placental stem cells can also or alternatively be administered to a transplant or graft recipient after the transplantation or grafting for example about 1 2 3 4 5 6 or 7 days after the transplanting or grafting. Preferably the plurality of placental stem cells are contacted with the plurality of placental stem cells before any detectable sign or symptom of an immune response either by the recipient individual or the transplanted tissue or graft e.g. a detectable sign or symptom of graft versus host disease or detectable inflammation is detectable.

In another embodiment the contacting within an individual is primarily between exogenous placental stem cells and exogenous progenitor cells or stem cells e.g. exogenous progenitor cells or stem cells that differentiate into immune cells. For example individuals undergoing partial or full immunoablation or myeloablation as an adjunct to cancer therapy can receive placental stem cells in combination with one or more other types of stem or progenitor cells. For example the placental stem cells can be combined with a plurality of CD34 cells e.g. CD34 hematopoietic stem cells. Such CD34 cells can be e.g. CD34 cells from a tissue source such as peripheral blood umbilical cord blood placental blood or bone marrow. The CD34 cells can be isolated from such tissue sources or the whole tissue source e.g. units of umbilical cord blood or bone marrow or a partially purified preparation from the tissue source e.g. white blood cells from cord blood can be combined with the placental stem cells. Combinations of placental stem cells and cord blood or stem cells from cord blood are described in Hariri U.S. Application Publication No. 2003 0180269.

The placental stem cells can be administered to the individual in a ratio with respect to the known or expected number of immune cells e.g. T cells in the individual of from about 10 1 to about 1 10 preferably about 1 5. However a plurality of placental stem cells can be administered to an individual in a ratio of in non limiting examples about 10 000 1 about 1 000 1 about 100 1 about 10 1 about 1 1 about 1 10 about 1 100 about 1 1 000 or about 1 10 000. Generally about 1 10to about 1 10placental stem cells per recipient kilogram preferably about 1 10to about 1 10placental stem per recipient kilogram can be administered to effect immunosuppression. In various embodiments a plurality of placental stem cells administered to an individual or subject comprises at least about or no more than 1 10 3 10 1 10 3 10 1 10 3 10 1 10 3 10 1 10 3 10placental stem cells or more.

The placental stem cells can also be administered with one or more second types of stem cells e.g. mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow. Such second stem cells can be administered to an individual with placental stem cells in a ratio of e.g. about 1 10 to about 10 1.

To facilitate contacting the placental stem cells and immune cells in vivo the placental stem cells can be administered to the individual by any route sufficient to bring the placental stem cells and immune cells into contact with each other. For example the placental stem cells can be administered to the individual e.g. intravenously intramuscularly intraperitoneally intraocularly parenterally or directly into an organ e.g. pancreas. For in vivo administration the placental stem cells can be formulated as a pharmaceutical composition as described in Section 5.6.1 below.

The method of immunosuppression can additionally comprise the addition of one or more immunosuppressive agents particularly in the in vivo context. In one embodiment the plurality of placental stem cells are contacted with the plurality of immune cells in vivo in an individual and a composition comprising an immunosuppressive agent is administered to the individual. Immunosuppressive agents are well known in the art and include e.g. anti T cell receptor antibodies monoclonal or polyclonal or antibody fragments or derivatives thereof anti IL 2 receptor antibodies e.g. Basiliximab SIMULECT or daclizumab ZENAPAX anti T cell receptor antibodies e.g. Muromonab CD3 azathioprine corticosteroids cyclosporine tacrolimus mycophenolate mofetil sirolimus calcineurin inhibitors and the like. In a specific embodiment the immumosuppressive agent is a neutralizing antibody to macrophage inflammatory protein MIP 1 or MIP 1 . Preferably the anti MIP 1 or MIP 1 antibody is administered in an amount sufficient to cause a detectable reduction in the amount of MIP 1 and or MIP 1 in said individual e.g. at the time of transplanting.

The methods of immunosuppression provided herein use placental stem cells that is stem cells obtainable from a placenta or part thereof that 1 adhere to a tissue culture substrate 2 have the capacity to differentiate into non placental cell types and 3 have in sufficient numbers the capacity to detectably suppress an immune function e.g. proliferation of CD4 and or CD8 T cells in a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay or regression assay. Placental stem cells are not derived from blood e.g. placental blood or umbilical cord blood. The placental stem cells used in the methods and compositions provided herein have the capacity and are selected for their capacity to suppress the immune system of an individual.

Placental stem cells can be either fetal or maternal in origin that is can have the genotype of either the mother or fetus . Populations of placental stem cells or populations of cells comprising placental stem cells can comprise placental stem cells that are solely fetal or maternal in origin or can comprise a mixed population of placental stem cells of both fetal and maternal origin. The placental stem cells and populations of cells comprising the placental stem cells can be identified and selected by the morphological marker and culture characteristics discussed below.

The placental stem cells used as described herein when cultured in primary cultures or in cell culture adhere to the tissue culture substrate e.g. tissue culture container surface e.g. tissue culture plastic . Placental stem cells in culture assume a generally fibroblastoid stellate appearance with a number of cyotplasmic processes extending from the central cell body. The placental stem cells are however morphologically differentiable from fibroblasts cultured under the same conditions as the placental stem cells exhibit a greater number of such processes than do fibroblasts. Morphologically placental stem cells are also differentiable from hematopoietic stem cells which generally assume a more rounded or cobblestone morphology in culture.

Placental stem cells and populations of placental stem cells useful in the methods and compositions provided herein express a plurality of markers that can be used to identify and or isolate the stem cells or populations of cells that comprise the stem cells. The placental stem cells and stem cell populations that is two or more placental stem cells include stem cells and stem cell containing cell populations obtained directly from the placenta or any part thereof e.g. amnion chorion placental cotyledons and the like . Placental stem cell populations also includes populations of that is two or more placental stem cells in culture and a population in a container e.g. a bag. Placental stem cells are not however trophoblasts.

Placental stem cells generally express the markers CD73 CD105 CD200 HLA G and or OCT 4 and do not express CD34 CD38 or CD45. Placental stem cells can also express HLA ABC MHC 1 and HLA DR. These markers can be used to identify placental stem cells and to distinguish placental stem cells from other stem cell types. Because the placental stem cells can express CD73 and CD105 they can have mesenchymal stem cell like characteristics. However because the placental stem cells can express CD200 and HLA G a fetal specific marker they can be distinguished from mesenchymal stem cells e.g. bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells which express neither CD200 nor HLA G. In the same manner the lack of expression of CD34 CD38 and or CD45 identifies the placental stem cells as non hematopoietic stem cells.

In a specific embodiment of the methods of producing an immunosuppressive placental stem cell population said T cells and said placental cells are present in said MLR at a ratio of about 5 1. The placental cells used in the method can be derived from the whole placenta or primarily from amnion or amnion and chorion. In another specific embodiment the placental cells suppress CD4 or CD8 T cell proliferation by at least 50 at least 75 at least 90 or at least 95 in said MLR compared to an amount of T cell proliferation in said MLR in the absence of said placental cells.

The growth of the placental stem cells described herein as for any mammalian cell depends in part upon the particular medium selected for growth. Under optimum conditions placental stem cells typically double in number in 3 5 days. During culture the placental stem cells provided herein adhere to a substrate in culture e.g. the surface of a tissue culture container e.g. tissue culture dish plastic fibronectin coated plastic and the like and form a monolayer.

Populations of isolated placental cells that comprise the placental stem cells provided herein when cultured under appropriate conditions form embryoid like bodies that is three dimensional clusters of cells grow atop the adherent stem cell layer. Cells within the embryoid like bodies express markers associated with very early stem cells e.g. OCT 4 Nanog SSEA3 and SSEA4. Cells within the embryoid like bodies are typically not adherent to the culture substrate as are the placental stem cells described herein but remain attached to the adherent cells during culture. Embryoid like body cells are dependent upon the adherent placental stem cells for viability as embryoid like bodies do not form in the absence of the adherent stem cells. The adherent placental stem cells thus facilitate the growth of one or more embryoid like bodies in a population of placental cells that comprise the adherent placental stem cells. Without wishing to be bound by theory the cells of the embryoid like bodies are thought to grow on the adherent placental stem cells much as embryonic stem cells grow on a feeder layer of cells. Mesenchymal stem cells e.g. bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells do not develop embryoid like bodies in culture.

The placental stem cells useful in the methods of treating diseases disorder or conditions associated with or caused by inappropriate or harmful immune response e.g. inflammation provided herein are differentiable into different committed cell lineages. For example the placental stem cells can be differentiated into cells of an adipogenic chondrogenic neurogenic or osteogenic lineage. Such differentiation can be accomplished e.g. by any method known in the art for differentiating e.g. bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells into similar cell lineages or by methods described elsewhere herein.

The placental stem cells and umbilical cord stem cells provided herein can exhibit the capacity to differentiate into a particular cell lineage in vitro in vivo or in vitro and in vivo. In a specific embodiment the placental stem cells and umbilical cord stem cells provided herein can be differentiated in vitro when placed in conditions that cause or promote differentiation into a particular cell lineage but do not detectably differentiate in vivo e.g. in a NOD SCID mouse model.

Placental stem cells can be collected and isolated according to the methods provided herein. Generally stem cells are obtained from a mammalian placenta using a physiologically acceptable solution e.g. a stem cell collection composition. A stem cell collection composition is described in detail in related U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 754 969 entitled Improved Composition for Collecting and Preserving Placental Stem Cells and Methods of Using the Composition filed on Dec. 29 2005.

The stem cell collection composition can comprise any physiologically acceptable solution suitable for the collection and or culture of stem cells for example a saline solution e.g. phosphate buffered saline Kreb s solution modified Kreb s solution Eagle s solution 0.9 NaCl. etc. a culture medium e.g. DMEM HDMEM etc. and the like.

The stem cell collection composition can comprise one or more components that tend to preserve placental stem cells that is prevent the placental stem cells from dying or delay the death of the placental stem cells reduce the number of placental stem cells in a population of cells that die or the like from the time of collection to the time of culturing. Such components can be e.g. an apoptosis inhibitor e.g. a caspase inhibitor or JNK inhibitor a vasodilator e.g. magnesium sulfate an antihypertensive drug atrial natriuretic peptide ANP adrenocorticotropin corticotropin releasing hormone sodium nitroprusside hydralazine adenosine triphosphate adenosine indomethacin or magnesium sulfate a phosphodiesterase inhibitor etc. a necrosis inhibitor e.g. 2 1H Indol 3 yl 3 pentylamino maleimide pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or clonazepam a TNF inhibitor and or an oxygen carrying perfluorocarbon e.g. perfluorooctyl bromide perfluorodecyl bromide etc. .

The stem cell collection composition can comprise one or more tissue degrading enzymes e.g. a metalloprotease a serine protease a neutral protease an RNase or a DNase or the like. Such enzymes include but are not limited to collagenases e.g. collagenase I II III or IV a collagenase from etc. dispase thermolysin elastase trypsin LIBERASE hyaluronidase and the like.

The stem cell collection composition can comprise a bacteriocidally or bacteriostatically effective amount of an antibiotic. In certain non limiting embodiments the antibiotic is a macrolide e.g. tobramycin a cephalosporin e.g. cephalexin cephradine cefuroxime cefprozil cefaclor cefixime or cefadroxil a clarithromycin an erythromycin a penicillin e.g. penicillin V or a quinolone e.g. ofloxacin ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin a tetracycline a streptomycin etc. In a particular embodiment the antibiotic is active against Gram and or Gram bacteria e.g. and the like.

The stem cell collection composition can also comprise one or more of the following compounds adenosine about 1 mM to about 50 mM D glucose about 20 mM to about 100 mM magnesium ions about 1 mM to about 50 mM a macromolecule of molecular weight greater than 20 000 daltons in one embodiment present in an amount sufficient to maintain endothelial integrity and cellular viability e.g. a synthetic or naturally occurring colloid a polysaccharide such as dextran or a polyethylene glycol present at about 25 g l to about 100 g l or about 40 g l to about 60 g l an antioxidant e.g. butylated hydroxyanisole butylated hydroxytoluene glutathione vitamin C or vitamin E present at about 25 M to about 100 M a reducing agent e.g. N acetylcysteine present at about 0.1 mM to about 5 mM an agent that prevents calcium entry into cells e.g. verapamil present at about 2 M to about 25 M nitroglycerin e.g. about 0.05 g L to about 0.2 g L an anticoagulant in one embodiment present in an amount sufficient to help prevent clotting of residual blood e.g. heparin or hirudin present at a concentration of about 1000 units 1 to about 100 000 units 1 or an amiloride containing compound e.g. amiloride ethyl isopropyl amiloride hexamethylene amiloride dimethyl amiloride or isobutyl amiloride present at about 1.0 M to about 5 M .

Generally a human placenta is recovered shortly after its expulsion after birth. In a preferred embodiment the placenta is recovered from a patient after informed consent and after a complete medical history of the patient is taken and is associated with the placenta. Preferably the medical history continues after delivery. Such a medical history can be used to coordinate subsequent use of the placenta or the stem cells harvested therefrom. For example human placental stem cells can be used in light of the medical history for personalized medicine for the infant associated with the placenta or for parents siblings or other relatives of the infant.

Prior to recovery of placental stem cells the umbilical cord blood and placental blood are removed. In certain embodiments after delivery the cord blood in the placenta is recovered. The placenta can be subjected to a conventional cord blood recovery process. Typically a needle or cannula is used with the aid of gravity to exsanguinate the placenta see e.g. Anderson U.S. Pat. No. 5 372 581 Hessel et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 415 665 . The needle or cannula is usually placed in the umbilical vein and the placenta can be gently massaged to aid in draining cord blood from the placenta. Such cord blood recovery may be performed commercially e.g. LifeBank Inc. Cedar Knolls N.J. ViaCord Cord Blood Registry and Cryocell. Preferably the placenta is gravity drained without further manipulation so as to minimize tissue disruption during cord blood recovery.

Typically a placenta is transported from the delivery or birthing room to another location e.g. a laboratory for recovery of cord blood and collection of stem cells by e.g. perfusion or tissue dissociation. The placenta is preferably transported in a sterile thermally insulated transport device maintaining the temperature of the placenta between 20 28 C. for example by placing the placenta with clamped proximal umbilical cord in a sterile zip lock plastic bag which is then placed in an insulated container. In another embodiment the placenta is transported in a cord blood collection kit substantially as described in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 230 760 filed Sep. 19 2005. Preferably the placenta is delivered to the laboratory four to twenty four hours following delivery. In certain embodiments the proximal umbilical cord is clamped preferably within 4 5 cm centimeter of the insertion into the placental disc prior to cord blood recovery. In other embodiments the proximal umbilical cord is clamped after cord blood recovery but prior to further processing of the placenta.

The placenta prior to stem cell collection can be stored under sterile conditions and at either room temperature or at a temperature of 5 to 25 C. centigrade . The placenta may be stored for a period of longer than forty eight hours and preferably for a period of four to twenty four hours prior to perfusing the placenta to remove any residual cord blood. The placenta is preferably stored in an anticoagulant solution at a temperature of 5 to 25 C. centigrade . Suitable anticoagulant solutions are well known in the art. For example a solution of heparin or warfarin sodium can be used. In a preferred embodiment the anticoagulant solution comprises a solution of heparin e.g. 1 w w in 1 1000 solution . The exsanguinated placenta is preferably stored for no more than 36 hours before placental stem cells are collected.

The mammalian placenta or a part thereof once collected and prepared generally as above can be treated in any art known manner e.g. can be perfused or disrupted e.g. digested with one or more tissue disrupting enzymes to obtain stem cells.

In one embodiment stem cells are collected from a mammalian placenta by physical disruption e.g. enzymatic digestion of the organ e.g. using the stem cell collection composition described in Section 5.3.1 above. For example the placenta or a portion thereof may be e.g. crushed sheared minced diced chopped macerated or the like while in contact with e.g. a buffer medium or a stem cell collection composition and the tissue subsequently digested with one or more enzymes. The placenta or a portion thereof may also be physically disrupted and digested with one or more enzymes and the resulting material then immersed in or mixed into a buffer medium or a stem cell collection composition. Any method of physical disruption can be used provided that the method of disruption leaves a plurality more preferably a majority and more preferably at least 60 70 80 90 95 98 or 99 of the cells in said organ viable as determined by e.g. trypan blue exclusion.

The placenta can be dissected into components prior to physical disruption and or enzymatic digestion and stem cell recovery. For example placental stem cells can be obtained from the amniotic membrane chorion placental cotyledons or any combination thereof or umbilical cord or any combination thereof. Preferably placental stem cells are obtained from placental tissue comprising amnion and chorion or amnion chorion and umbilical cord. In one embodiment stem cells are obtained from amnion chorion and umbilical cord in about a 1 1 weight ratio. Typically placental stem cells can be obtained by disruption of a small block of placental tissue e.g. a block of placental tissue that is about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 or about 1000 cubic millimeters in volume.

A preferred stem cell collection composition comprises one or more tissue disruptive enzyme s . Enzymatic digestion preferably uses a combination of enzymes e.g. a combination of a matrix metalloprotease and a neutral protease for example a combination of collagenase and dispase. In one embodiment enzymatic digestion of placental tissue uses a combination of a matrix metalloprotease a neutral protease and a mucolytic enzyme for digestion of hyaluronic acid such as a combination of collagenase dispase and hyaluronidase or a combination of LIBERASE Boehringer Mannheim Corp. Indianapolis Ind. and hyaluronidase. Other enzymes that can be used to disrupt placenta tissue include papain deoxyribonucleases serine proteases such as trypsin chymotrypsin or elastase. Serine proteases may be inhibited by alpha 2 microglobulin in serum and therefore the medium used for digestion is usually serum free. EDTA and DNase are commonly used in enzyme digestion procedures to increase the efficiency of cell recovery. The digestate is preferably diluted so as to avoid trapping stem cells within the viscous digest.

Any combination of tissue digestion enzymes can be used. Typical concentrations for tissue digestion enzymes include e.g. 50 200 U mL for collagenase I and collagenase IV 1 10 U mL for dispase and 10 100 U mL for elastase. Proteases can be used in combination that is two or more proteases in the same digestion reaction or can be used sequentially in order to liberate placental stem cells. For example in one embodiment a placenta or part thereof is digested first with an appropriate amount of collagenase I at 2 mg ml for 30 minutes followed by digestion with trypsin 0.25 for 10 minutes at 37 C. Serine proteases are preferably used consecutively following use of other enzymes.

In another embodiment the tissue can further be disrupted by the addition of a chelator e.g. ethylene glycol bis 2 aminoethyl ether N N N N tetraacetic acid EGTA or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA to the stem cell collection composition comprising the stem cells or to a solution in which the tissue is disrupted and or digested prior to isolation of the stem cells with the stem cell collection composition.

It will be appreciated that where an entire placenta or portion of a placenta comprising both fetal and maternal cells for example where the portion of the placenta comprises the chorion or cotyledons the placental stem cells collected will comprise a mix of placental stem cells derived from both fetal and maternal sources. Where a portion of the placenta that comprises no or a negligible number of maternal cells for example amnion the placental stem cells collected will comprise almost exclusively fetal placental stem cells.

Placental stem cells can also be obtained by perfusion of the mammalian placenta. Methods of perfusing mammalian placenta to obtain stem cells are disclosed e.g. in Hariri U.S. Application Publication No. 2002 0123141 and in related U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 754 969 entitled Improved Composition for Collecting and Preserving Placental Stem Cells and Methods of Using the Composition filed on Dec. 29 2005.

Placental stem cells can be collected by perfusion e.g. through the placental vasculature using e.g. a stem cell collection composition as a perfusion solution. In one embodiment a mammalian placenta is perfused by passage of perfusion solution through either or both of the umbilical artery and umbilical vein. The flow of perfusion solution through the placenta may be accomplished using e.g. gravity flow into the placenta. Preferably the perfusion solution is forced through the placenta using a pump e.g. a peristaltic pump. The umbilical vein can be e.g. cannulated with a cannula e.g. a TEFLON or plastic cannula that is connected to a sterile connection apparatus such as sterile tubing. The sterile connection apparatus is connected to a perfusion manifold.

In preparation for perfusion the placenta is preferably oriented e.g. suspended in such a manner that the umbilical artery and umbilical vein are located at the highest point of the placenta. The placenta can be perfused by passage of a perfusion fluid e.g. the stem cell collection composition provided herein through the placental vasculature or through the placental vasculature and surrounding tissue. In one embodiment the umbilical artery and the umbilical vein are connected simultaneously to a pipette that is connected via a flexible connector to a reservoir of the perfusion solution. The perfusion solution is passed into the umbilical vein and artery. The perfusion solution exudes from and or passes through the walls of the blood vessels into the surrounding tissues of the placenta and is collected in a suitable open vessel from the surface of the placenta that was attached to the uterus of the mother during gestation. The perfusion solution may also be introduced through the umbilical cord opening and allowed to flow or percolate out of openings in the wall of the placenta which interfaced with the maternal uterine wall. In another embodiment the perfusion solution is passed through the umbilical veins and collected from the umbilical artery or is passed through the umbilical artery and collected from the umbilical veins.

In one embodiment the proximal umbilical cord is clamped during perfusion and more preferably is clamped within 4 5 cm centimeter of the cord s insertion into the placental disc.

The first collection of perfusion fluid from a mammalian placenta during the exsanguination process is generally colored with residual red blood cells of the cord blood and or placental blood. The perfusion fluid becomes more colorless as perfusion proceeds and the residual cord blood cells are washed out of the placenta. Generally from 30 to 100 ml milliliter of perfusion fluid is adequate to initially exsanguinate the placenta but more or less perfusion fluid may be used depending on the observed results.

The volume of perfusion liquid used to collect placental stem cells may vary depending upon the number of stem cells to be collected the size of the placenta the number of collections to be made from a single placenta etc. In various embodiments the volume of perfusion liquid may be from 50 mL to 5000 mL 50 mL to 4000 mL 50 mL to 3000 mL 100 mL to 2000 mL 250 mL to 2000 mL 500 mL to 2000 mL or 750 mL to 2000 mL. Typically the placenta is perfused with 700 800 mL of perfusion liquid following exsanguination.

The placenta can be perfused a plurality of times over the course of several hours or several days. Where the placenta is to be perfused a plurality of times it may be maintained or cultured under aseptic conditions in a container or other suitable vessel and perfused with the stem cell collection composition or a standard perfusion solution e.g. a normal saline solution such as phosphate buffered saline PBS with or without an anticoagulant e.g. heparin warfarin sodium coumarin bishydroxycoumarin and or with or without an antimicrobial agent e.g. mercaptoethanol 0.1 mM antibiotics such as streptomycin e.g. at 40 100 g ml penicillin e.g. at 40 U ml amphotericin B e.g. at 0.5 g ml . In one embodiment an isolated placenta is maintained or cultured for a period of time without collecting the perfusate such that the placenta is maintained or cultured for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 or 24 hours or 2 or 3 or more days before perfusion and collection of perfusate. The perfused placenta can be maintained for one or more additional time s e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 or more hours and perfused a second time with e.g. 700 800 mL perfusion fluid. The placenta can be perfused 1 2 3 4 5 or more times for example once every 1 2 3 4 5 or 6 hours. In a preferred embodiment perfusion of the placenta and collection of perfusion solution e.g. stem cell collection composition is repeated until the number of recovered nucleated cells falls below 100 cells ml. The perfusates at different time points can be further processed individually to recover time dependent populations of cells e.g. stem cells. Perfusates from different time points can also be pooled.

Without wishing to be bound by any theory after exsanguination and a sufficient time of perfusion of the placenta placental stem cells are believed to migrate into the exsanguinated and perfused microcirculation of the placenta where they are collected preferably by washing into a collecting vessel by perfusion. Perfusing the isolated placenta not only serves to remove residual cord blood but also provide the placenta with the appropriate nutrients including oxygen. The placenta may be cultivated and perfused with a similar solution which was used to remove the residual cord blood cells preferably without the addition of anticoagulant agents.

Perfusion as described herein results in the collection of significantly more placental stem cells than the number obtainable from a mammalian placenta not perfused with said solution and not otherwise treated to obtain stem cells e.g. by tissue disruption e.g. enzymatic digestion . In this context significantly more means at least 10 more. Perfusion yields significantly more placental stem cells than e.g. the number of placental stem cells obtainable from culture medium in which a placenta or portion thereof has been cultured.

Stem cells can be isolated from placenta by perfusion with a solution comprising one or more proteases or other tissue disruptive enzymes. In a specific embodiment a placenta or portion thereof e.g. amniotic membrane amnion and chorion placental lobule or cotyledon or combination of any of the foregoing is brought to 25 37 C. and is incubated with one or more tissue disruptive enzymes in 200 mL of a culture medium for 30 minutes. Cells from the perfusate are collected brought to 4 C. and washed with a cold inhibitor mix comprising 5 mM EDTA 2 mM dithiothreitol and 2 mM beta mercaptoethanol. The stem cells are washed after several minutes with a cold e.g. 4 C. stem cell collection composition described elsewhere herein.

It will be appreciated that perfusion using the pan method that is whereby perfusate is collected after it has exuded from the maternal side of the placenta results in a mix of fetal and maternal cells. As a result the cells collected by this method comprise a mixed population of placental stem cells of both fetal and maternal origin. In contrast perfusion solely through the placental vasculature whereby perfusion fluid is passed through one or two placental vessels and is collected solely through the remaining vessel s results in the collection of a population of placental stem cells almost exclusively of fetal origin.

Stem cells from mammalian placenta whether obtained by perfusion or enyzmatic digestion can initially be purified from i.e. be isolated from other cells by Ficoll gradient centrifugation. Such centrifugation can follow any standard protocol for centrifugation speed etc. In one embodiment for example cells collected from the placenta are recovered from perfusate by centrifugation at 5000 g for 15 minutes at room temperature which separates cells from e.g. contaminating debris and platelets. In another embodiment placental perfusate is concentrated to about 200 ml gently layered over Ficoll and centrifuged at about 1100 g for 20 minutes at 22 C. and the low density interface layer of cells is collected for further processing.

Cell pellets can be resuspended in fresh stem cell collection composition or a medium suitable for stem cell maintenance e.g. IMDM serum free medium containing 2 U ml heparin and 2 mM EDTA GibcoBRL NY . The total mononuclear cell fraction can be isolated e.g. using Lymphoprep Nycomed Pharma Oslo Norway according to the manufacturer s recommended procedure.

As used herein isolating placental stem cells means to remove at least 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 or 99 of the cells with which the stem cells are normally associated in the intact mammalian placenta. A stem cell from an organ is isolated when it is present in a population of cells that comprises fewer than 50 of the cells with which the stem cell is normally associated in the intact organ.

Placental cells obtained by perfusion or digestion can for example be further or initially isolated by differential trypsinization using e.g. a solution of 0.05 trypsin with 0.2 EDTA Sigma St. Louis Mo. . Differential trypsinization is possible because placental stem cells typically detach from plastic surfaces within about five minutes whereas other adherent populations typically require more than 20 30 minutes incubation. The detached placental stem cells can be harvested following trypsinization and trypsin neutralization using e.g. Trypsin Neutralizing Solution TNS Cambrex . In one embodiment of isolation of adherent cells aliquots of for example about 5 10 10cells are placed in each of several T 75 flasks preferably fibronectin coated T75 flasks. In such an embodiment the cells can be cultured with commercially available Mesenchymal Stem Cell Growth Medium MSCGM Cambrex and placed in a tissue culture incubator 37 C. 5 CO . After 10 to 15 days non adherent cells are removed from the flasks by washing with PBS. The PBS is then replaced by MSCGM. Flasks are preferably examined daily for the presence of various adherent cell types and in particular for identification and expansion of clusters of fibroblastoid cells.

The number and type of cells collected from a mammalian placenta can be monitored for example by measuring changes in morphology and cell surface markers using standard cell detection techniques such as flow cytometry cell sorting immunocytochemistry e.g. staining with tissue specific or cell marker specific antibodies fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS magnetic activated cell sorting MACS by examination of the morphology of cells using light or confocal microscopy and or by measuring changes in gene expression using techniques well known in the art such as PCR and gene expression profiling. These techniques can be used too to identify cells that are positive for one or more particular markers. For example using antibodies to CD34 one can determine using the techniques above whether a cell comprises a detectable amount of CD34 if so the cell is CD34. Likewise if a cell produces enough OCT 4 RNA to be detectable by RT PCR or significantly more OCT 4 RNA than an adult cell the cell is OCT 4 Antibodies to cell surface markers e.g. CD markers such as CD34 and the sequence of stem cell specific genes such as OCT 4 are well known in the art.

Placental cells particularly cells that have been isolated by Ficoll separation differential adherence or a combination of both may be sorted using a fluorescence activated cell sorter FACS . Fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS is a well known method for separating particles including cells based on the fluorescent properties of the particles Kamarch 1987 Methods Enzymol 151 150 165 . Laser excitation of fluorescent moieties in the individual particles results in a small electrical charge allowing electromagnetic separation of positive and negative particles from a mixture. In one embodiment cell surface marker specific antibodies or ligands are labeled with distinct fluorescent labels. Cells are processed through the cell sorter allowing separation of cells based on their ability to bind to the antibodies used. FACS sorted particles may be directly deposited into individual wells of 96 well or 384 well plates to facilitate separation and cloning.

In one sorting scheme stem cells from placenta are sorted on the basis of expression of the markers CD34 CD38 CD44 CD45 CD73 CD105 OCT 4 and or HLA G. This can be accomplished in connection with procedures to select stem cells on the basis of their adherence properties in culture. For example an adherence selection stem can be accomplished before or after sorting on the basis of marker expression. In one embodiment for example cells are sorted first on the basis of their expression of CD34 CD34 cells are retained and cells that are CD200HLA G are separated from all other CD34 cells. In another embodiment cells from placenta are based on their expression of markers CD200 and or HLA G for example cells displaying either of these markers are isolated for further use. Cells that express e.g. CD200 and or HLA G can in a specific embodiment be further sorted based on their expression of CD73 and or CD105 or epitopes recognized by antibodies SH2 SH3 or SH4 or lack of expression of CD34 CD38 or CD45. For example in one embodiment placental cells are sorted by expression or lack thereof of CD200 HLA G CD73 CD105 CD34 CD38 and CD45 and placental cells that are CD200 HLA G CD73 CD105 CD34 CD38 and CD45 are isolated from other placental cells for further use.

In another embodiment magnetic beads can be used to separate cells. The cells may be sorted using a magnetic activated cell sorting MACS technique a method for separating particles based on their ability to bind magnetic beads 0.5 100 m diameter . A variety of useful modifications can be performed on the magnetic microspheres including covalent addition of antibody that specifically recognizes a particular cell surface molecule or hapten. The beads are then mixed with the cells to allow binding. Cells are then passed through a magnetic field to separate out cells having the specific cell surface marker. In one embodiment these cells can then isolated and re mixed with magnetic beads coupled to an antibody against additional cell surface markers. The cells are again passed through a magnetic field isolating cells that bound both the antibodies. Such cells can then be diluted into separate dishes such as microtiter dishes for clonal isolation.

Placental stem cells can also be characterized and or sorted based on cell morphology and growth characteristics. For example placental stem cells can be characterized as having and or selected on the basis of e.g. a fibroblastoid appearance in culture. Placental stem cells can also be characterized as having and or be selected on the basis of their ability to form embryoid like bodies. In one embodiment for example placental cells that are fibroblastoid in shape express CD73 and CD105 and produce one or more embryoid like bodies in culture are isolated from other placental cells. In another embodiment OCT 4 placental cells that produce one or more embryoid like bodies in culture are isolated from other placental cells.

In another embodiment placental stem cells can be identified and characterized by a colony forming unit assay. Colony forming unit assays are commonly known in the art such as Mesen Cult medium Stem Cell Technologies Inc. Vancouver British Columbia 

Placental stem cells can be assessed for viability proliferation potential and longevity using standard techniques known in the art such as trypan blue exclusion assay fluorescein diacetate uptake assay propidium iodide uptake assay to assess viability and thymidine uptake assay MTT cell proliferation assay to assess proliferation . Longevity may be determined by methods well known in the art such as by determining the maximum number of population doubling in an extended culture.

Placental stem cells can also be separated from other placental cells using other techniques known in the art e.g. selective growth of desired cells positive selection selective destruction of unwanted cells negative selection separation based upon differential cell agglutinability in the mixed population as for example with soybean agglutinin freeze thaw procedures filtration conventional and zonal centrifugation centrifugal elutriation counter streaming centrifugation unit gravity separation countercurrent distribution electrophoresis and the like.

Isolated placental stem cells or placental stem cell population or cells or placental tissue from which placental stem cells grow out can be used to initiate or seed cell cultures. Cells are generally transferred to sterile tissue culture vessels either uncoated or coated with extracellular matrix or ligands such as laminin collagen e.g. native or denatured gelatin fibronectin ornithine vitronectin and extracellular membrane protein e.g. MATRIGEL BD Discovery Labware Bedford Mass. .

Placental stem cells can be cultured in any medium and under any conditions recognized in the art as acceptable for the culture of stem cells. Preferably the culture medium comprises serum. Placental stem cells can be cultured in for example DMEM LG Dulbecco s Modified Essential Medium low glucose MCDB 201 chick fibroblast basal medium containing ITS insulin transferrin selenium LA BSA linoleic acid bovine serum albumin dextrose L ascorbic acid PDGF EGF IGF 1 and penicillin streptomycin DMEM HG high glucose comprising 10 fetal bovine serum FBS DMEM HG comprising 15 FBS IMDM Iscove s modified Dulbecco s medium comprising 10 FBS 10 horse serum and hydrocortisone M199 comprising 10 FBS EGF and heparin MEM minimal essential medium comprising 10 FBS GlutaMAX and gentamicin DMEM comprising 10 FBS GlutaMAX and gentamicin etc. A preferred medium is DMEM LG MCDB 201 comprising 2 FBS ITS LA BSA dextrose L ascorbic acid PDGF EGF and penicillin streptomycin.

Other media in that can be used to culture placental stem cells include DMEM high or low glucose Eagle s basal medium Ham s F10 medium F10 Ham s F 12 medium F12 Iscove s modified Dulbecco s medium Mesenchymal Stem Cell Growth Medium MSCGM Liebovitz s L 15 medium MCDB DMIEM F12 RPMI 1640 advanced DMEM Gibco DMEM MCDB201 Sigma and CELL GRO FREE.

The culture medium can be supplemented with one or more components including for example serum e.g. fetal bovine serum FBS preferably about 2 15 v v equine horse serum ES human serum HS beta mercaptoethanol BME preferably about 0.001 v v one or more growth factors for example platelet derived growth factor PDGF epidermal growth factor EGF basic fibroblast growth factor bFGF insulin like growth factor 1 IGF 1 leukemia inhibitory factor LIF vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF and erythropoietin EPO amino acids including L valine and one or more antibiotic and or antimycotic agents to control microbial contamination such as for example penicillin G streptomycin sulfate amphotericin B gentamicin and nystatin either alone or in combination.

Once an isolated placental stem cell or isolated population of stem cells e.g. a stem cell or population of stem cells separated from at least 50 of the placental cells with which the stem cell or population of stem cells is normally associated in vivo the stem cell or population of stem cells can be proliferated and expanded in vitro. For example a population of placental stem cells can be cultured in tissue culture containers e.g. dishes flasks multiwell plates or the like for a sufficient time for the stem cells to proliferate to 70 90 confluence that is until the stem cells and their progeny occupy 70 90 of the culturing surface area of the tissue culture container.

Placental stem cells can be seeded in culture vessels at a density that allows cell growth. For example the cells may be seeded at low density e.g. about 1 000 to about 5 000 cells cm to high density e.g. about 50 000 or more cells cm . In a preferred embodiment the cells are cultured at about 0 to about 5 percent by volume COin air. In some preferred embodiments the cells are cultured at about 2 to about 25 percent Oin air preferably about 5 to about 20 percent Oin air. The cells preferably are cultured at about 25 C. to about 40 C. preferably 37 C. The cells are preferably cultured in an incubator. The culture medium can be static or agitated for example using a bioreactor. Placental stem cells preferably are grown under low oxidative stress e.g. with addition of glutathione ascorbic acid catalase tocopherol N acetylcysteine or the like .

Once 70 90 confluence is obtained the cells may be passaged. For example the cells can be enzymatically treated e.g. trypsinized using techniques well known in the art to separate them from the tissue culture surface. After removing the cells by pipetting and counting the cells about 20 000 100 000 stem cells preferably about 50 000 stem cells are passaged to a new culture container containing fresh culture medium. Typically the new medium is the same type of medium from which the stem cells were removed. Provided herein are populations of placental stem cells that have been passaged at least 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 14 16 18 or 20 times or more and combinations of the same.

The methods of treatment provided herein in certain embodiments use populations of placental stem cells. Placental stem cell populations can be isolated directly from one or more placentas that is the placental stem cell population can be a population of placental cells comprising placental stem cells obtained from or contained within perfusate or obtained from or contained within digestate that is the collection of cells obtained by enzymatic digestion of a placenta or part thereof . Isolated placental stem cells as described herein can also be cultured and expanded to produce placental stem cell populations. Populations of placental cells comprising placental stem cells can also be cultured and expanded to produce placental stem cell populations.

Placental stem cell populations described herein comprise placental stem cells for example placental stem cells as described herein. In various embodiments at least 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 or 99 of the cells in an isolated placental stem cell population are placental stem cells. That is a placental stem cell population can comprise e.g. as much as 1 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 non stem cells.

Provided herein are methods of producing isolated placental stem cell population by e.g. selecting placental stem cells whether derived from enzymatic digestion or perfusion that express particular markers and or particular culture or morphological characteristics. In one embodiment for example a cell population can be produced by a method comprising selecting placental cells that a adhere to a substrate and b express CD200 and HLA G and isolating said cells from other cells to form a cell population. In another embodiment the method of producing a cell population comprises selecting placental cells that a adhere to a substrate and b express CD73 CD105 and CD200 and isolating said cells from other cells to form a cell population. In another embodiment the method of producing a cell population comprises selecting placental cells that a adhere to a substrate and b express CD200 and OCT 4 and isolating said cells from other cells to form a cell population. In another embodiment the method of producing a cell population comprises selecting placental cells that a adhere to a substrate b express CD73 and CD105 and c facilitate the formation of one or more embryoid like bodies in a population of placental cells comprising said stem cell when said population is cultured under conditions that allow for the formation of an embryoid like body and isolating said cells from other cells to form a cell population. In another embodiment the method of producing a cell population comprises selecting placental cells that a adhere to a substrate and b express CD73 CD105 and HLA G and isolating said cells from other cells to form a cell population. In another embodiment the method of producing a cell population comprises selecting placental cells that a adhere to a substrate b express OCT 4 and c facilitate the formation of one or more embryoid like bodies in a population of placental cells comprising said stem cell when said population is cultured under conditions that allow for the formation of an embryoid like body and isolating said cells from other cells to form a cell population. In any of the above embodiments the method can additionally comprise selecting placental cells that express ABC p a placenta specific ABC transporter protein see e.g. Allikmets et al. 58 23 5337 9 1998 . The method can also comprise selecting cells exhibiting at least one characteristic specific to e.g. a mesenchymal stem cell for example expression of CD29 expression of CD44 expression of CD90 or expression of a combination of the foregoing.

In the above embodiments the substrate can be any surface on which culture and or selection of cells e.g. placental stem cells can be accomplished.

Cells e.g. placental stem cells can be selected for a placental stem cell population by any means known in the art of cell selection.

The placental stem cells described herein can in another embodiment be seeded onto foam scaffolds that may be composite structures. Such foam scaffolds can be molded into a useful shape such as that of a portion of a specific structure in the body to be repaired replaced or augmented. In some embodiments the framework is treated e.g. with 0.1M acetic acid followed by incubation in polylysine PBS and or collagen prior to inoculation of the immunosuppressive placental stem cells in order to enhance cell attachment. External surfaces of a matrix may be modified to improve the attachment or growth of cells and differentiation of tissue such as by plasma coating the matrix or addition of one or more proteins e.g. collagens elastic fibers reticular fibers glycoproteins glycosaminoglycans e.g. heparin sulfate chondroitin 4 sulfate chondroitin 6 sulfate dermatan sulfate keratin sulfate etc. a cellular matrix and or other materials such as but not limited to gelatin alginates agar agarose and plant gums and the like.

In another aspect provided herein are placental stem cells and umbilical cord stem cells that are genetically modified e.g. to produce a nucleic acid or polypeptide of interest. Genetic modification can be accomplished e.g. using virus based vectors including but not limited to non integrating replicating vectors e.g. papilloma virus vectors SV40 vectors adenoviral vectors integrating viral vectors e.g. retrovirus vector or adeno associated viral vectors or replication defective viral vectors. Other methods of introducing DNA into cells include the use of liposomes electroporation a particle gun direct DNA injection or the like.

Stem cells can be e.g. transformed or transfected with DNA controlled by or in operative association with one or more appropriate expression control elements for example promoter or enhancer sequences transcription terminators polyadenylation sites internal ribosomal entry sites. Preferably such a DNA incorporates a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA engineered stem cells can be e.g. grown in enriched media and then switched to selective media. In one embodiment the DNA used to engineer a placental stem cell comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of interest e.g. a cytokine growth factor differentiation agent or therapeutic polypeptide.

The DNA used to engineer the stem cell can comprise any promoter known in the art to drive expression of a nucleotide sequence in mammalian cells e.g. human cells. For example promoters include but are not limited to CMV promoter enhancer SV40 promoter papillomavirus promoter Epstein Barr virus promoter elastin gene promoter and the like. In a specific embodiment the promoter is regulatable so that the nucleotide sequence is expressed only when desired. Promoters can be either inducible e.g. those associated with metallothionein and heat shock proteins or constitutive.

In another specific embodiment the promoter is tissue specific or exhibits tissue specificity. Examples of such promoters include but are not limited to myelin basic protein gene control region Readhead et al. 198748 703 oligodendrocyte cells elastase I gene control region Swit et al. 198438 639 Ornitz et al. 198650 399 MacDonald 19877 425 pancreatic acinar cells insulin gene control region Hanahan 1985315 115 pancreatic beta cells myosin light chain 2 gene control region Shani 1985314 283 skeletal muscle .

Placental stem cells may be engineered to knock out or knock down expression of one or more genes. The expression of a gene native to a cell can be diminished by for example inhibition of expression by inactivating the gene completely by e.g. homologous recombination. In one embodiment for example an exon encoding an important region of the protein or an exon 5 to that region is interrupted by a positive selectable marker e.g. neo preventing the production of normal mRNA from the target gene and resulting in inactivation of the gene. A gene may also be inactivated by creating a deletion in part of a gene or by deleting the entire gene. By using a construct with two regions of homology to the target gene that are far apart in the genome the sequences intervening the two regions can be deleted Mombaerts et al. 199188 3084 . Antisense DNAzymes small interfering RNA and ribozyme molecules that inhibit expression of the target gene can also be used to reduce the level of target gene activity in the stem cells. For example antisense RNA molecules which inhibit the expression of major histocompatibility gene complexes HLA have been shown to be most versatile with respect to immune responses. Triple helix molecules can be utilized in reducing the level of target gene activity. See e.g. L. G. Davis et al. eds 1994 BASIC METHODS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY 2nd ed. Appleton Lange Norwalk Conn. which is incorporated herein by reference.

In a specific embodiment placental or umbilical cord stem cells can be genetically modified with a nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of interest wherein expression of the polypeptide of interest is controllable by an exogenous factor e.g. polypeptide small organic molecule or the like. Such a polypeptide can be a therapeutic polypeptide. In a more specific embodiment the polypeptide of interest is IL 12 or interleukin 1 receptor antagonist IL 1Ra . In another more specific embodiment the polypeptide of interest is a fusion of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist and dihydrofolate reductase DHFR and the exogenous factor is an antifolate e.g. methotrexate. Such a construct is useful in the engineering of placental or umbilical cord stem cells that express IL 1 Ra or a fusion of IL 1Ra and DHFR upon contact with methotrexate. Such a construct can be used e.g. in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In this embodiment the fusion of IL 1Ra and DHFR is translationally upregulated upon exposure to an antifolate such as methotrexate. Therefore in another specific embodiment the nucleic acid used to genetically engineer a placental stem cell or umbilical cord stem cell can comprise nucleotide sequences encoding a first polypeptide and a second polypeptide wherein said first and second polypeptides are expressed as a fusion protein that is translationally upregulated in the presence of an exogenous factor. The polypeptide can be expressed transiently or long term e.g. over the course of weeks or months .

Such a nucleic acid molecule can additionally comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide that allows for positive selection of engineered stem cells or allows for visualization of the engineered stem cells. In another more specific embodiment the nucleotide sequence encodes a polypeptide that is e.g. fluorescent under appropriate visualization conditions e.g. luciferase Luc . In a more specific embodiment such a nucleic acid molecule can comprise IL lRa DHFR IRES Luc where IRES is an internal ribosomal entry site.

Mammalian placental cells can be conditionally immortalized by transfection with any suitable vector containing a growth promoting gene that is a gene encoding a protein that under appropriate conditions promotes growth of the transfected cell such that the production and or activity of the growth promoting protein is regulatable by an external factor. In a preferred embodiment the growth promoting gene is an oncogene such as but not limited to v myc N myc c myc p53 SV40 large T antigen polyoma large T antigen E1a adenovirus or E7 protein of human papillomavirus.

External regulation of the growth promoting protein can be achieved by placing the growth promoting gene under the control of an externally regulatable promoter e.g. a promoter the activity of which can be controlled by for example modifying the temperature of the transfected cells or the composition of the medium in contact with the cells. in one embodiment a tetracycline tet controlled gene expression system can be employed see Gossen et al. 89 5547 5551 1992 Hoshimaru et al. 93 1518 1523 1996 . In the absence of tet a tet controlled transactivator tTA within this vector strongly activates transcription from ph1 a minimal promoter from human cytomegalovirus fused to tet operator sequences. tTA is a fusion protein of the repressor tetR of the transposon 10 derived tet resistance operon of and the acidic domain of VP16 of herpes simplex virus. Low non toxic concentrations of tet e.g. 0.01 1.0 g mL almost completely abolish transactivation by tTA.

In one embodiment the vector further contains a gene encoding a selectable marker e.g. a protein that confers drug resistance. The bacterial neomycin resistance gene neo is one such marker that may be employed within the methods described herein. Cells carrying neomay be selected by means known to those of ordinary skill in the art such as the addition of e.g. 100 200 g mL G418 to the growth medium.

Transfection can be achieved by any of a variety of means known to those of ordinary skill in the art including but not limited to retroviral infection. In general a cell culture may be transfected by incubation with a mixture of conditioned medium collected from the producer cell line for the vector and DMEM F12 containing N2 supplements. For example a placental cell culture prepared as described above may be infected after e.g. five days in vitro by incubation for about 20 hours in one volume of conditioned medium and two volumes of DMEM F12 containing N2 supplements. Transfected cells carrying a selectable marker may then be selected as described above.

Following transfection cultures are passaged onto a surface that permits proliferation e.g. allows at least 30 of the cells to double in a 24 hour period. Preferably the substrate is a polyornithine laminin substrate consisting of tissue culture plastic coated with polyornithine 10 g mL and or laminin 10 g mL a polylysine laminin substrate or a surface treated with fibronectin. Cultures are then fed every 3 4 days with growth medium which may or may not be supplemented with one or more proliferation enhancing factors. Proliferation enhancing factors may be added to the growth medium when cultures are less than 50 confluent.

The conditionally immortalized placental stem cell lines can be passaged using standard techniques such as by trypsinization when 80 95 confluent. Up to approximately the twentieth passage it is in some embodiments beneficial to maintain selection by for example the addition of G418 for cells containing a neomycin resistance gene . Cells may also be frozen in liquid nitrogen for long term storage.

Clonal cell lines can be isolated from a conditionally immortalized human placental stem cell line prepared as described above. In general such clonal cell lines may be isolated using standard techniques such as by limit dilution or using cloning rings and expanded. Clonal cell lines may generally be fed and passaged as described above.

Conditionally immortalized human placental stem cell lines which may but need not be clonal may generally be induced to differentiate by suppressing the production and or activity of the growth promoting protein under culture conditions that facilitate differentiation. For example if the gene encoding the growth promoting protein is under the control of an externally regulatable promoter the conditions e.g. temperature or composition of medium may be modified to suppress transcription of the growth promoting gene. For the tetracycline controlled gene expression system discussed above differentiation can be achieved by the addition of tetracycline to suppress transcription of the growth promoting gene. In general 1 g mL tetracycline for 4 5 days is sufficient to initiate differentiation. To promote further differentiation additional agents may be included in the growth medium.

Placental stem cells can be used in assays to determine the influence of culture conditions environmental factors molecules e.g. biomolecules small inorganic molecules. etc. and the like on stem cell proliferation expansion and or differentiation compared to placental stem cells not exposed to such conditions.

In one embodiment placental stem cells can be assayed for changes in proliferation expansion or differentiation upon contact with a molecule.

In a specific embodiment said compound is identified as an inhibitor of differentiation. In another specific embodiment said compound is identified as an enhancer of differentiation.

Stem cells from postpartum placentas can be cultured in a number of different ways to produce a set of lots e.g. a set of individually administrable doses of placental stem cells. Such lots can for example be obtained from stem cells from placental perfusate or from enzyme digested placental tissue. Sets of lots of placental stem cells obtained from a plurality of placentas can be arranged in a bank of placental stem cells for e.g. long term storage. Generally adherent stem cells are obtained from an initial culture of placental material to form a seed culture which is expanded under controlled conditions to form populations of cells from approximately equivalent numbers of doublings. Lots are preferably derived from the tissue of a single placenta but can be derived from the tissue of a plurality of placentas.

In one embodiment stem cell lots are obtained as follows. Placental tissue is first disrupted e.g. by mincing digested with a suitable enzyme e.g. collagenase see Section 5.2.3 above . The placental tissue preferably comprises e.g. the entire amnion entire chorion or both from a single placenta but can comprise only a part of either the amnion or chorion. The digested tissue is cultured e.g. for about 1 3 weeks preferably about 2 weeks. After removal of non adherent cells high density colonies that form are collected e.g. by trypsinization. These cells are collected and resuspended in a convenient volume of culture medium and defined as Passage 0 cells.

Passage 0 cells are then used to seed expansion cultures. Expansion cultures can be any arrangement of separate cell culture apparatuses e.g. a Cell Factory by NUNC . Cells in the Passage 0 culture can be subdivided to any degree so as to seed expansion cultures with e.g. 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 10 8 10 9 10 1 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 10 8 10 9 10 or 10 10stem cells. Preferably from about 2 10to about 3 10Passage 0 cells are used to seed each expansion culture. The number of expansion cultures can depend upon the number of Passage 0 cells and may be greater or fewer in number depending upon the particular placenta s from which the stem cells are obtained.

Expansion cultures are grown until the density of cells in culture reaches a certain value e.g. about 1 10cells cm. Cells can either be collected and cryopreserved at this point or passaged into new expansion cultures as described above. Cells can be passaged e.g. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 or 20 times prior to use. A record of the cumulative number of population doublings is preferably maintained during expansion culture s . The cells from a Passage 0 culture can be expanded for 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 or 40 doublings or up to 60 doublings. Preferably however the number of population doublings prior to dividing the population of cells into individual doses is between about 15 and about 30 preferably about 20 doublings. The cells can be culture continuously throughout the expansion process or can be frozen at one or more points during expansion.

Cells to be used for individual doses can be frozen e.g. cryopreserved for later use. Individual doses can comprise e.g. about 1 million to about 100 million cells per ml and can comprise between about 10and about 10cells in total.

In a specific embodiment of the method Passage 0 cells are cultured for approximately 4 doublings then frozen in a first cell bank. Cells from the first cell bank are frozen and used to seed a second cell bank the cells of which are expanded for about another eight doublings. Cells at this stage are collected and frozen and used to seed new expansion cultures that are allowed to proceed for about eight additional doublings bringing the cumulative number of cell doublings to about 20. Cells at the intermediate points in passaging can be frozen in units of about 100 000 to about 10 million cells per ml preferably about 1 million cells per ml for use in subsequent expansion culture. Cells at about 20 doublings can be frozen in individual doses of between about 1 million to about 100 million cells per ml for administration or use in making a stem cell containing composition. In one embodiment the cells are diluted to about 2 million ml in 10 HAS 10 DMSO in Plasmalyte.

In a preferred embodiment the donor from which the placenta is obtained e.g. the mother is tested for at least one pathogen. If the mother tests positive for a tested pathogen the entire lot from the placenta is discarded. Such testing can be performed at any time during production of placental stem cell lots including before or after establishment of Passage 0 cells or during expansion culture. Pathogens for which the presence is tested can include without limitation hepatitis A hepatitis B hepatitis C hepatitis D hepatitis E human immunodeficiency virus types I and II cytomegalovirus herpesvirus and the like.

Multiple sclerosis MS is a chronic recurrent inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. The disease results in injury to the myelin sheaths surrounding CNS and PNS axons oligodendrocytes and the nerve cells themselves. The disease is mediated by autoreactive T cells particularly CD4 T cells that proliferate cross the blood brain barrier and enter the CNS under the influence of cellular adhesion molecules and pro inflammatory cytokines. The symptoms of MS include sensory disturbances in the limbs optic nerve dysfunction pyramidal tract dysfunction bladder dysfunction bowel dysfunction sexual dysfunction ataxia and diplopia.

Four different types or clinical courses of MS have been identified. The first relapsing remitting MS RRMS is characterized by self limiting attacks of neurological dysfunction that manifest acutely over the course of days to weeks followed by a period of recovery sometimes incomplete over several months. The second type secondary progressive MS SPMS begins as RRMS but changes such that the clinical course becomes characterized by a steady deterioration in function unrelated to acute attacks. The third primary progressive MS PPMS is characterized by a steady decline in function from onset with no acute attacks. The fourth type progressive relapsing MS PRMS also begins with a progressive course with occasional attacks superimposed on the progressive decline in function.

Persons having MS are generally evaluated using a motor skills assessment optionally with an MRI. For example one motor skills assessment the expanded disability status scale scores gradations in an affected individual s abilities as follows 

In the above scoring system FS refers to the eight functional systems measured including pyramidal cerebellar brainstem sensory bowel and bladder visual cerebral and other systems.

Other similar scoring systems are known including the Scripps neurological rating scale the ambulatory index and the multiple sclerosis functional composite score MSFC .

The progress of MS has also been assessed by magnetic resonance imaging which can detect neural lesions associated with MS e.g. new lesions enhancing lesions or combined unique active lesions .

In one embodiment the IBD is Crohn s disease sometimes referred to as ileitis or enteritis. Crohn s disease is a chronic disorder that causes inflammation of the digestive tract also referred to as the gastrointestinal or GI tract . Crohn s disease can affect any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus but most commonly affects the lower part of the small intestine referred to as the ileum. Five types of Crohn s disease are known. Gastroduodenal Crohn s disease affects the stomach and duodenum the highest portion of the small intestine . Jejunoileitis is Crohn s disease of the jejunum the longest portion of the small intestine. Ileitis is Crohn s disease of the ileum the lower portion of the small intestine. Ileocolitis the most common form of Crohn s disease affects the ileum and colon. Finally Crohn s colitis Granulomatous colitis affects the colon and is distinguished from ulcerative colitis in that in Crohn s colitis there are often areas of healthy tissue between areas of diseased tissue and Crohn s colitis can involve only the colon without involving the rectum. Crohn s disease is thought to arise from inappropriate reaction of the body s immune system to antigens in the GI tract including e.g. food beneficial bacteria etc. resulting in an accumulation of white blood cells in the lining of the intestines. Inflammation associated with Crohn s disease has also been attributed to the action of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor TNF .

In another embodiment the IBD is ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis is a disease that causes inflammation and sores ulcers in the lining of the rectum and or colon. Ulcers form where inflammation has killed the cells that usually line the colon the ulcers typically subsequently bleed and produce pus. When inflammation occurs in the rectum and lower part of the colon the disease is referred to as ulcerative proctitis. If the entire colon is affected the disease is called pancolitis. If only the left side of the colon is affected the disease is referred to as limited or distal colitis. Symptoms of ulcerative colitis include but are not limited to abdominal pain bloody diarrhea fevers nausea abdominal cramps anemia fatigue weight loss loss of appetite rectal bleeding loss of bodily fluids and nutrients skin lesions joint pain and growth failure in children . Ulcerative colitis can also cause complications such as inflammation of the eye liver disease and osteoporosis.

In another embodiment provided herein is a method of treating an individual that has or is experiencing a symptom of or is at risk for developing scleroderma comprising administering to the individual a therapeutically effective amount of placental stem cells or umbilical cord stem cells or culture medium conditioned by placental stem cells or umbilical cord stem cells wherein the therapeutically effective amount is an amount sufficient to cause a detectable improvement in one or more symptoms of scleroderma or sufficient to detectably reduce the onset of one or more symptoms of scleroderma.

Scleroderma is a chronic disease characterized by excessive deposits of collagen in the skin or other organs. Scleroderma can be localized or generalized. The localized form of the disease while disabling tends not to be fatal. The generalized form of the disease manifesting as diffuse scleroderma or systemic sclerosis can be fatal as a result of heart kidney lung or intestinal damage. The three types of scleroderma are diffuse scleroderma and limited CREST syndrome scleroderma which are systemic and morphea linear scleroderma which is limited to the skin. Diffuse scleroderma is the most severe form with victims experiencing rapid onset widespread skin hardening and significant internal organ damage particularly to the lungs and gastrointestinal tract.

The limited form of scleroderma is much milder exhibiting a slower onset and progression. Skin hardening is usually confined to the hands and face internal organ involvement is less severe than in the diffuse form. Typically Raynaud s phenomenon may precede scleroderma by several years. Raynaud s phenomenon is due to vasoconstriction of the small arteries of exposed peripheries particularly the hands and feet in the cold and is classically characterized by a triphasic color change first white then blue and finally red on rewarming. The limited form is often referred to as CREST syndrome where CREST is an acronym for the five main features calcinosis calcium deposits in soft tissue e.g. the skin Raynaud s syndrome esophageal dysmotility sclerodactyl scleroderma of the fingers and telangiectasia spider veins .

Development of scleroderma has been correlated with the presence of autoantibodies particularly anti centromere and anti sc170 anti topoisomerase antibodies. Up to 90 of affected individuals have a detectable anti nuclear antibody. Anti centromere antibody is more common in the limited form 80 90 than in the systemic form 10 and anti sc170 is more common in the diffuse form 30 40 and in African American patients.

In a specific embodiment said second type of stem cell is a mesenchymal stem cell e.g. a bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell. The second type of stem cell e.g. hematopoietic stem cell or mesenchymal stem cell can be administered with the placental stem cells in any ratio e.g. about 100 1 75 1 50 1 25 1 20 1 15 1 10 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 10 1 15 1 20 1 25 1 50 1 75 or 1 100. Such mesenchymal stem cells can be obtained commercially or from an original source e.g. bone marrow bone marrow aspirate adipose tissue and the like.

Any combination of the above therapeutic agents suitable for treatment of scleroderma or a symptom of scleroderma can be administered. Such therapeutic agents can be administered in any combination with the placental stem cells or umbilical cord stem cells at the same time or as a separate course of treatment.

In another embodiment provided herein is a method of treating an individual that has or is experiencing a symptom of or is at risk for developing psoriasis comprising administering to the individual a therapeutically effective amount of placental stem cells or umbilical cord stem cells or culture medium conditioned by placental stem cells or umbilical cord stem cells wherein the therapeutically effective amount is an amount sufficient to cause a detectable improvement in one or more symptoms of psoriasis sufficient to detectably reduce the onset of one or more symptoms of psoriasis or sufficient to reduce the progress of psoriasis.

Psoriasis is a disease affecting the skin and joints which commonly causes red scaly patches called psoriatic plaques to appear on the skin. Psoriatic patches are areas of inflammation and excessive skin production. Skin rapidly accumulates at these sites and takes a silvery white appearance. Plaques frequently occur on the skin of the elbows and knees but can affect any area including the scalp and genitals. Psoriasis is hypothesized to be immune mediated.

Plaque psoriasis psoriasis vulgaris the most common form of psoriasis typically appears as raised areas of inflamed skin covered with silvery white scaly skin called plaques.

Flexural psoriasis inverse psoriasis appears as smooth inflamed patches of skin occurring in skin folds for example around the genitals between the thigh and groin the armpits under an overweight stomach and under the breasts.

Guttate psoriasis manifests as numerous small oval teardrop shaped spots that appear over large areas of the body such as the trunk limbs and scalp. Guttate psoriasis is associated with streptococcal throat infection.

Pustular psoriasis appears as raised bumps that are filled with non infectious pus pustules . Pustular psoriasis can be localized commonly to the hands and feet palmoplantar pustulosis or generalized with widespread patches occurring randomly on any part of the body.

Nail psoriasis produces a variety of changes in the appearance of finger and toe nails including discoloration under the nail plate pitting of the nails lines going across the nails thickening of the skin under the nail and the loosening onycholysis and crumbling of the nail.

Psoriatic arthritis involves joint and connective tissue inflammation e.g. in the joints of the fingers and toes which can result in a sausage shaped swelling of the fingers and toes known as dactylitis. Psoriatic arthritis can also affect the hips knees and spine spondylitis .

Erythrodermic psoriasis manifests as the widespread inflammation and exfoliation of the skin over most of the body surface. It may be accompanied by severe itching swelling and pain. It is often the result of an exacerbation of unstable plaque psoriasis particularly following the abrupt withdrawal of systemic treatment. This form of psoriasis can be fatal as the extreme inflammation and exfoliation disrupt the body s ability to regulate temperature and for the skin to perform barrier functions.

In one embodiment the invention provides for the administration of an effective dose placental stem cells to an individual affected with psoriasis wherein said effective dose is an amount of placental stem cells sufficient e.g. to cause a detectable improvement in reduce the severity of or reduce the progression of one or more of the symptoms of psoriasis listed above.

The severity of psoriasis can be evaluated e.g. by the Psoriasis Area Severity Index PASI . PASI combines the assessment of the severity of lesions and the area affected into a single score in the range 0 no disease to 72 maximal disease .

To calculate the PASI the body is divided into four sections legs the body trunk area stomach chest back etc. arms and head. Each of these areas is scored by itself and then the four scores are combined into the final PASI. For each section the percent of area of skin afflicted with psoriasis is estimated and then transformed into a grade from 0 to 6 as follows 

The severity is estimated by four different parameters graded from 0 to 4 itching erythema redness scaling and thickness. The sum of all four severity parameters is then calculated for each section of skin multiplied by the area score for that area and multiplied by weight of respective section 0.1 for head 0.2 for arms 0.3 for body and 0.4 for legs . Example I E S T A 0.3 Total. At the end the total PASI is calculated as a sum of PASIs for all four skin sections.

The degree of severity can also be assessed by photographing an individual afflicted with psoriasis and calculating by computer the percent body area covered by psoriatic lesions.

Placenta donors were recruited from expectant mothers that enrolled in private umbilical cord blood banking programs and provided informed consent permitting the use of the exsanguinated placenta following recovery of cord blood for research purposes. These donors permitted use of blinded data generated from the normal processing of their umbilical cord blood specimens for cryopreservation. This allowed comparison between the composition of the collected cord blood and the effluent perfusate recovered using this experimental method described below.

Following exsanguination of the umbilical cord and placenta the placenta was placed in a sterile insulated container at room temperature and delivered to the laboratory within 4 hours of birth. Placentas were discarded if on inspection they had evidence of physical damage such as fragmentation of the organ or avulsion of umbilical vessels. Placentas were maintained at room temperature 23 2 C. or refrigerated 4 C. in sterile containers for 2 to 20 hours. Periodically the placentas were immersed and washed in sterile saline at 25 3 C. to remove any visible surface blood or debris. The umbilical cod was transected approximately 5 cm from its insertion into the placenta and the umbilical vessels were cannulated with Teflon or polypropylene catheters connected to a sterile fluid path allowing bidirectional perfusion of the placenta and recovery of the effluent fluid. The system employed herein enabled all aspects of conditioning perfusion and effluent collection to be performed under controlled ambient atmospheric conditions as well as real time monitoring of intravascular pressure and flow rates core and perfusate temperatures and recovered effluent volumes. A range of conditioning protocols was evaluated over a 24 hour postpartum period and the cellular composition of the effluent fluid was analyzed by flow cytometry light microscopy and colony forming unit assays.

A placenta was maintained under varying conditions in an attempt to simulate and sustain a physiologically compatible environment for the proliferation and recruitment of placental stem cells. A cannula was flushed with IMDM serum free medium GibcoBRL NY containing 2 U ml heparin EJkins Sinn N. J. . Perfusion of the placenta was performed at a rate of 50 mL per minute until approximately 150 mL of perfusate was collected. This volume of perfusate was labeled the early fraction . The placenta was perfused at the same rate to collect a second fraction of approximately 150 mL which was labeled the late fraction . During the course of the procedure the placenta was gently massaged to aid in the perfusion process and assist in the recovery of cellular material. Effluent fluid was collected from the perfusion circuit by both gravity drainage and aspiration through the arterial cannula.

Placentas were obtained from delivery rooms along with cord blood after obtaining written parental consent and were processed at room temperature within 12 to 24 hours after delivery. Before processing the membranes were removed and the maternal site washed clean of residual blood. The umbilical vessels were cannulated with catheters made from 20 gauge Butterfly needles use for blood sample collection. Placentas were then perfused with heparinized 2 U mL Dulbecco s modified Eagle Medium HDMEM at the rate of 15 mL minute for 10 minutes and the perfusates were collected from the maternal sites within one hour and the nucleated cells counted. The perfusion and collection procedures were repeated once or twice until the number of recovered nucleated cells fell below 100 L. The perfusates were pooled and subjected to light centrifugation to remove platelets debris and de nucleated cell membranes. The nucleated cells were then isolated by Ficoll Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and after washing resuspended in HDMEM. For isolation of adherent cells aliquots of 5 10 10cells were placed in each of several T 75 flasks and cultured with commercially available Mesenchymal Stem Cell Growth Medium MSCGM obtained from BioWhittaker and placed in a tissue culture incubator at 37 C. 5 CO. After 10 to 15 days the non adherent cells were removed by washing with PBS which was then replaced by MSCGM. The flasks were examined daily for the presence of various adherent cell types and in particular for identification and expansion of clusters of fibroblastoid cells.

Cells were recovered from the perfusates by centrifugation at about 200 g for 15 minutes at room temperature. This procedure served to separate cells from contaminating debris and platelets. The cell pellets were resuspended in IMDM serum free medium containing 2 U ml heparin and 2 mM EDTA GibcoBRL NY . The total mononuclear cell fraction was isolated using Lymphoprep Nycomed Pharma Oslo Norway according to the manufacturer s recommended procedure and the mononuclear cell fraction was resuspended. Cells were counted using a hemocytometer. Viability was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion. Isolation of mesenchymal cells was achieved by differential trypsinization using a solution of 0.05 trypsin with 0.2 EDTA Sigma . Differential trypsinization was possible because fibroblastoid cells detached from plastic surfaces within about five minutes whereas the other adherent populations required more than 20 30 minutes incubation. The detached fibroblastoid cells were harvested following trypsinization and trypsin neutralization using Trypsin Neutralyzing Solution TNS BioWhitaker . The cells were washed in HDMEM and resuspended in MSCGM. Flow cytometry of the cells was carried out using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur instrument using FITC and PE labeled monoclonal antibodies selected on the basis of known markers for bone marrow derived MSC mesenchymal stem cells . Antibodies were purchased from B.D. and Caltag laboratories South San Francisco Calif. and SH2 SH3 and SH4 antibody producing hybridomas were obtained from AM. Cul. and reactivities of the antibodies in their cultured supernatants were detected by FITC or PE labeled F ab goat anti mouse antibodies. Lineage differentiation was carried out using the commercially available induction and maintenance culture media BioWhittaker used as per manufacturer s instructions.

Microscopic examination of the adherent cells in the culture flasks revealed morphologically different cell types including spindle shaped cells round cells with large nuclei and numerous perinuclear small vacuoles and star shaped cells with several projections through one of which the cells were attached to the flask. No attempts were made to further characterize these types of adherent cells because similar non stem cells were observed in the culture of bone marrow cord and peripheral blood. However fibroblastoid cells appearing last as clusters and appearing by visual inspection to be similar to bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells were isolated by differential trypsinization and subcultured in secondary flasks. Phase microscopy of the cells which appeared rounded after trypsinization showed them to be highly granulated and similar to bone marrow derived MSC produced in the laboratory or purchased from BioWhittaker.

When subcultured these adherent placental cells in contrast to their earlier phase adhered within hours assumed characteristic fibroblastoid shape and formed a growth pattern similar to the reference bone marrow derived MSC. Moreover during subculturing and refeeding the loosely bound mononuclear cells were washed out and the cultures remained homogeneous and devoid of any visible non fibroblastoid cell contaminants.

In subsequent experiments the cell surface marker phenotype or in the case of OCT 4 the gene expression phenotype of these adherent cells obtained from different perfusion experiments was characterized. The results of these experiments are shown in Table 3 below 

Placental stem cells are obtained from a post partum mammalian placenta either by perfusion or by physical disruption e.g. enzymatic digestion. The cells are cultured in a culture medium comprising 60 DMEM LG Gibco 40 MCDB 201 Sigma 2 fetal calf serum FCS Hyclone Laboratories 1 insulin transferrin selenium ITS 1 lenolenic acid bovine serum albumin LA BSA 10M dexamethasone Sigma 10M ascorbic acid 2 phosphate Sigma epidermal growth factor EGF 10 ng ml R D Systems platelet derived growth factor PDGF BB 10 ng ml R D Systems and 100 U penicillin 1000 U streptomycin.

The culture flask in which the cells are cultured is prepared as follows. T75 flasks are coated with fibronectin FN by adding 5 ml PBS containing 5 ng ml human FN Sigma F0895 to the flask. The flasks with FN solution are left at 37 C. for 30 min. The FN solution is then removed prior to cell culture. There is no need to dry the flasks following treatment. Alternatively the flasks are left in contact with the FN solution at 4 C. overnight or longer prior to culture the flasks are warmed and the FN solution is removed.

Cultures of placental stem cells from placental perfusate are established as follows. Cells from a Ficoll gradient are seeded in FN coated T75 flasks prepared as above at 50 100 10cells flask in 15 ml culture medium. Typically 5 to 10 flasks are seeded. The flasks are incubated at 37 C. for 12 18 hrs to allow the attachment of adherent cells. 10 ml of warm PBS is added to each flask to remove cells in suspension and mixed gently. 15 mL of the medium is then removed and replaced with 15 ml fresh culture medium. All medium is changed 3 4 days after the start of culture. Subsequent culture medium changes are performed during which 50 or 7.5 ml of the medium is removed.

Starting at about day 12 the culture is checked under a microscope to examine the growth of the adherent cell colonies. When cell cultures become approximately 80 confluent typically between day 13 to day 18 after the start of culture adherent cells are harvested by trypsin digestion. Cells harvested from these primary cultures are designated passage 0 zero .

Placental stem cell cultures are established from digested placental tissue as follows. The perfused placenta is placed on a sterile paper sheet with the maternal side up. Approximately 0.5 cm of the surface layer on maternal side of placenta is scraped off with a blade and the blade is used to remove a placental tissue block measuring approximately 1 2 1 cm. This placenta tissue is then minced into approximately 1 mmpieces. These pieces are collected into a 50 ml Falcon tube and digested with collagenase IA 2 mg ml Sigma for 30 minutes followed by trypsin EDTA 0.25 GIBCO BRL for 10 minutes at 37 C. in water bath. The resulting solution is centrifuged at 400 g for 10 minutes at room temperature and the digestion solution is removed. The pellet is resuspended to approximately 10 volumes with PBS for example a 5 ml pellet is resuspended with 45 ml PBS and the tubes are centrifuged at 400 g for 10 minutes at room temperature. The tissue cell pellet is resuspended in 130 mL culture medium and the cells are seeded at 13 ml per fibronectin coated T 75 flask. Cells are incubated at 37 C. with a humidified atmosphere with 5 CO. Placental Stem Cells are optionally cryopreserved at this stage.

Cryopreserved cells can be quickly thawed in a 37 C. water bath. Placental stem cells are immediately removed from the cryovial with 10 ml warm medium and transferred to a 15 ml sterile tube. The cells are centrifuged at 400 g for 10 minutes at room temperature. The cells are gently resuspended in 10 ml of warm culture medium by pipetting and viable cell counts are determined by Trypan blue exclusion. Cells are then seeded at about 6000 7000 cells per cmonto FN coated flasks prepared as above approximately 5 10cells per T 75 flask . The cells are incubated at 37 C. 5 COand 90 humidity. When the cells reached 75 85 confluency all of the spent media is aseptically removed from the flasks and discarded. 3 ml of 0.25 trypsin EDTA w v solution is added to cover the cell layer and the cells are incubated at 37 C. 5 COand 90 humidity for 5 minutes. The flask is tapped once or twice to expedite cell detachment. Once 95 of the cells are rounded and detached 7 ml of warm culture medium is added to each T 75 flask and the solution is dispersed by pipetting over the cell layer surface several times.

After counting the cells and determining viability as above the cells are centrifuged at 1000 RPM for 5 minutes at room temperature. Cells are passaged by gently resuspending the cell pellet from one T 75 flask with culture medium and evenly plating the cells onto two FN coated T 75 flasks.

Using the above methods populations of adherent placental stem cells are identified that express markers CD105 CD117 CD33 CD73 CD29 CD44 CD10 CD90 and CD133. This population of cells did not express CD34 or CD45. Some but not all cultures of these placental stem cells express HLA ABC and or HLA DR.

6.3.1.1 Isolation of the Phenotype of Interest Five distinct populations of placental cells were obtained from the placentas of normal full term pregnancies. All donors provided full written consent for the use of their placentas for research purposes. Five populations of cells were examined placental cells from 1 placental perfusate from perfusion of the placental vasculature and enzymatic digestions of 2 amnion 3 chorion 4 amnion chorion plate and 5 umbilical cord cells from enzymatic digestion. The various tissues were cleaned in sterile PBS Gibco Invitrogen Corporation Carlsbad Calif. and placed on separate sterile Petri dishes. The various tissues were minced using a sterile surgical scalpel and placed into 50 mL Falcon Conical tubes. The minced tissues were digested with 1 Collagenase Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. for 20 minutes in a 37 C. water bath centrifuged and then digested with 0.25 Trypsin EDTA Gibco Invitrogen Corp for 10 minutes in a 37 C. water bath. The various tissues were centrifuged after digestion and rinsed once with sterile PBS Gibco Invitrogen Corp . The reconstituted cells were then filtered twice once with 100 m cell strainers and once with 30 m separation filters to remove any residual extracellular matrix or cellular debris.

The manual trypan blue exclusion method was employed post digestion to calculate cell counts and assess cellular viability. Cells were mixed with Trypan Blue Dye Sigma Aldrich at a ratio of 1 1 and the cells were read on hemacytometer.

Cells that were HLA ABC CD45 CD34 CD133 were selected for characterization. Cells having this phenotype were identified quantified and characterized by two of Becton Dickinson flow cytometers the FACSCalibur and the FACS Aria Becton Dickinson San Jose Calif. USA . The various placental cells were stained at a ratio of about 10 L of antibody per 1 million cells for 30 minutes at room temperature on a shaker. The following anti human antibodies were used Fluorescein Isothiocyanate FITC conjugated monoclonal antibodies against HLA G Serotec Raleigh N.C. CD10 BD Immunocytometry Systems San Jose Calif. CD44 BD Biosciences Pharmingen San Jose Calif. and CD105 R D Systems Inc. Minneapolis Minn. Phycoerythrin PE conjugated monoclonal antibodies against CD44 CD200 CD117 and CD13 BD Biosciences Pharmingen Phycoerythrin Cy5 PE Cy5 conjugated Streptavidin and monoclonal antibodies against CD 117 BD Biosciences Pharmingen Phycoerythrin Cy7 PE Cy7 conjugated monoclonal antibodies against CD33 and CD10 BD Biosciences Allophycocyanin APC conjugated streptavidin and monoclonal antibodies against CD38 BD Biosciences Pharmingen and Biotinylated CD90 BD Biosciences Pharmingen . After incubation the cells were rinsed once to remove unbound antibodies and were fixed overnight with 4 paraformaldehyde USB Cleveland Ohio at 4 C. The following day the cells were rinsed twice filtered through a 30 m separation filter and were run on the flow cytometer s .

Samples that were stained with anti mouse IgG antibodies BD Biosciences Pharmingen were used as negative controls and were used to adjust the Photo Multiplier Tubes PMTS . Samples that were single stained with anti human antibodies were used as positive controls and were used to adjust spectral overlaps compensations.

One set of placental cells from perfusate amnion or chorion was stained with 7 Amino Actinomycin D 7AAD BD Biosciences Pharmingen and monoclonal antibodies specific for the phenotype of interest. The cells were stained at a ratio of 100 L of antibody per 1 million cells and were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature on a shaker. These cells were then positively sorted for live cells expressing the phenotype of interest on the BD FACS Aria and plated into culture. Sorted population of interest and All non sorted placental cell populations were plated for comparisons. The cells were plated onto a fibronectin Sigma Aldrich coated 96 well plate at the cell densities listed in Table 4 cells cm . The cell density and whether the cell type was plated in duplicate or triplicate was determined and governed by the number of cells expressing the phenotype of interest.

Complete medium 60 DMEM LG Gibco and 40 MCDB 201 Sigma 2 fetal calf serum Hyclone Labs. 1 insulin transferrin selenium ITS 1 linoleic acid bovine serum albumin LA BSA 10M dexamethasone Sigma 10M ascorbic acid 2 phosphate Sigma epidermal growth factor 10 ng mL R D Systems and platelet derived growth factor PDGF BB 10 ng mL R D Systems was added to each well of the 96 well plate and the plate was placed in a 5 CO 37 C. incubator. On day 7 100 L of complete medium was added to each of the wells. The 96 well plate was monitored for about two weeks and a final assessment of the culture was completed on day 12.

FACSCalibur data was analyzed in FlowJo Tree star Inc using standard gating techniques. The BD FACS Aria data was analyzed using the FACSDiva software Becton Dickinson . The FACS Aria data was analyzed using doublet discrimination gating to minimize doublets as well as standard gating techniques. All results were compiled in Microsoft Excel and all values herein are represented as average standard deviation number standard error of mean .

Post digestion viability was assessed using the manual trypan blue exclusion method . The average viability of cells obtained from the majority of the digested tissue from amnion chorion or amnion chorion plate was around 70 . Cells from amnion had an average viability of 74.35 10.31 n 6 SEM 4.21 chorion had an average viability of 78.18 12.65 n 4 SEM 6.32 amnion chorion plate had an average viability of 69.05 10.80 n 4 SEM 5.40 and umbilical cord had an average viability of 63.30 20.13 n 4 SEM 10.06 . Cells from perfusion which did not undergo digestion retained the highest average viability 89.98 6.39 n 5 SEM 2.86 .

The five distinct populations of placenta derived cells were analyzed to determine the numbers of HLA ABC CD45 CD34 CD133 cells. From the analysis of the BD FACSCalibur data it was observed that the amnion perfusate and chorion contained the greatest total number of these cells 30.72 21.80 cells n 4 SEM 10.90 26.92 22.56 cells n 3 SEM 13.02 and 18.39 6.44 cells n 2 SEM 4.55 respectively data not shown .

Similarly when the percent of total cells expressing the phenotype of interest was analyzed it was observed that amnion and placental perfusate contained the highest percentages of cells expressing this phenotype 0.0319 0.0202 n 4 SEM 0.0101 and 0.0269 0.0226 n 3 SEM 0.0130 respectively . Although umbilical cord contained a small number of cells expressing the phenotype of interest it contained the third highest percentage of cells expressing the phenotype of interest 0.020 0.0226 n 3 SEM 0.0131 .

Consistent with the results of the BD FACSCalibur analysis the BD FACS Aria data also identified amnion perfusate and chorion as providing higher numbers of HLA ABC CD45 CD34 CD133 cells than the remaining sources. The average total number of cells expressing the phenotype of interest among amnion perfusate and chorion was 126.47 55.61 cells n 15 SEM 14.36 81.65 34.64 cells n 20 SEM 7.75 and 51.47 32.41 cells n 15 SEM 8.37 respectively data not shown . The amnion chorion plate and umbilical cord contained the least total number of cells expressing the phenotype of interest 44.89 37.43 cells n 9 SEM 12.48 and 11.00 4.03 cells n 9 SEM 1.34 respectively data not shown .

BD FACS Aria data revealed that the B and A cell sources contained the highest percentages of HLA ABC CD45 CD34 CD133 cells 0.1523 0.0227 n 15 SEM 0.0059 and 0.0929 0.0419 n 20 SEM 0.0094 respectively .

After HLA ABC CD45 CD34 CD133 cells were identified and quantified from each cell source its cells were further analyzed and characterized for their expression of cell surface markers HLA G CD10 CD13 CD33 CD38 CD44 CD90 CD105 CD117 CD200 and CD105.

Perfusate derived cells were consistently positive for HLA G CD33 CD117 CD10 CD44 CD200 CD90 CD38 CD105 and CD13 .

Umbilical cord derived cells were consistently positive for HLA G CD33 CD90 CD38 CD105 and CD13 while the expression of CD117 CD10 CD44 and CD200 varied . The average expression of each marker for umbilical cord derived cells was the following 62.50 53.03 n 2 SEM 37.50 of the cells expressed HLA G 25.67 11.28 n 5 SEM 5.04 of the cells expressed CD33 44.45 62.85 n 2 SEM 44.45 of the cells expressed CD117 8.33 11.79 n 2 SEM 8.33 of the cells expressed CD10 21.43 30.30 n 2 SEM 21.43 of the cells expressed CD44 0.0 n 1 of the cells expressed CD200 81.25 n 1 of the cells expressed CD90 64.29 n 1 of the cells expressed CD38 6.25 n 1 of the cells expressed CD105 and 50.0 n 1 of the cells expressed CD13.

The three distinct populations of placental cells that expressed the greatest percentages of HLA ABC CD45 CD34 and CD133 cells derived from perfusate amnion and chorion were stained with 7AAD and the antibodies for these markers. The three populations were positively sorted for live cells expressing the phenotype of interest. The results of the BD FACS Aria sort are listed in Table 5.

The three distinct populations of positively sorted cells sorted and their corresponding non sorted cells were plated and the results of the culture were assessed on day 12. Sorted perfusate derived cells plated at a cell density of 40 600 cm resulted in small round non adherent cells. Two out of the three sets of non sorted perfusate derived cells each plated at a cell density of 40 600 cm resulted in mostly small round non adherent cells with several adherent cells located around the periphery of well. Non sorted perfusate derived cells plated at a cell density of 93 800 cm resulted in mostly small round non adherent cells with several adherent cells located around the well peripheries.

Sorted amnion derived cells plated at a cell density of 6 300 cm resulted in small round non adherent cells. Non sorted amnion derived cells plated at a cell density of 6 300 cm resulted in small round non adherent cells. Non sorted amnion derived cells plated at a cell density of 62 500 cmresulted in small round non adherent cells.

Sorted chorion derived cells plated at a cell density of 6 300 cm resulted in small round non adherent cells. Non sorted chorion derived cells plated at a cell density of 6 300 cm resulted in small round non adherent cells. Non sorted chorion derived cells plated at a cell density of 62 500 cm resulted in small round non adherent cells. These cells became adherent upon subsequent culture.

Subsequent to the performance of the experiments related above and further culture of the placental stem cells it was determined that the labeling of the antibodies for CD117 and CD133 in which a streptavidin conjugated antibody was labeled with biotin conjugated phycoerythrin PE produced background significant enough to resemble a positive reading. This background had initially resulted in the placental stem cells being deemed to be positive for both markers. When a different label APC or PerCP was used the background was reduced and the placental stem cells were correctly determined to be negative for both CD117 and CD133.

Adherent placental stem cells were differentiated into several different cell lineages. Adherent placental stem cells were isolated from the placenta by physical disruption of tissue from anatomical sites within the placenta including the amniotic membrane chorion placental cotyledons or any combination thereof and umbilical cord stem cells were obtained by physical disruption of umbilical cord tissue.

Placental stem cells and umbilical cord stem cells were established in a medium containing low concentrations of fetal calf serum and limited growth factors. Flow cytometry analysis showed that placental stem cells typically exhibited a CD200 CD105 CD73 CD34 CD45 phenotype at percentages of 70 . Placental stem cells were found to differentiate down the adipocyte chondrocyte and osteocyte lineages.

In an induction medium containing IBMX insulin dexamethasone and indomethacin placental stem cells turned into fat laden adipocytes in 3 to 5 weeks. Under osteogenic induction culture conditions placental stem cells were found to form bone nodules and have calcium depositions in their extracellular matrix. Chondrogenic differentiation of placental stem cells was performed in micropellets and was confirmed by formation of glycosaminoglycan in the tissue aggregates.

Placental stem cells possess an immunomodulatory effect including suppression of the proliferation of T cells and natural killer cells. The following experiments demonstrate that placental stem cells have the ability to modulate the response of T cells to stimulation in two assays the mixed lymphocyte reaction assay and the regression assay.

The MLR measures the reaction of an effector population against a target population. The effectors can be lymphocytes or purified subpopulations such as CD8 T cells or NK cells. The target population is either allogeneic irradiated PBMCs or as in the present studies mature DCs. The responder population consists of allo specific cells estimated at 20 of total T cells. The modified placental stem cell MLR uses placental stem cells in the reaction.

Placental stem cells were plated in 96 well plate wells and the effector population was added. Placental stem cells and 5 6 carboxyfluorescein diacetate N succinimidyl ester CFSE stained effectors were preincubated for 24 hours before targets mature DCs were added. After six days supernatants and non adherent cells were harvested. Supernatants were analyzed by Luminex bead analysis and the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.

Classically the MLR produces a proliferative response in both the CD8 and the CD4 T cell compartment. This response is a na ve T cell response as two allogeneic donors have never encountered each other before. Both CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells proliferated vigorously in the standard MLR. When placental stem cells were added to the MLR the CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation as measured by the percentage of CFSEresponder cells was dampened.

The effect of adding placental stem cells to an MLR PMLR can be seen in PMLR trace and . The results were similar whether only CD4 or CD8 T cells were used individually or whether equal amounts of CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells were used together. Placental stem cells obtained from the amnion chorion or umbilical cord stroma suppressed the MLR to similar extents and no difference in suppression was seen between CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells. This was also true for the bulk T cell reactions.

A separate MLR was performed using CD4 T cells CD8 T cells or both CD4 and CD8 T cells and allogeneic dendritic cells DC . Placental stem cells were added to the MLR and the degree of proliferation of the T cells was assessed using an MLR without placental stem cells as a control.

CD4 and CD8 T cells and CD14 monocytes were isolated from buffy coats using Miltenyi MACS columns and beads used according to manufacturer instructions. Dendritic cells were obtained by a six day culture of monocytes in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1 donor plasma IL 4 and GM CSF and a two day culture in RPMI 1640 supplemented with IL 1 TNF and IL 6. Allogeneic T cells and DC in the ratio T DC of 10 1 were incubated to produce a classic 6 day MLR. T cell proliferation was assessed by staining T cells with CFSE Carboxy fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester before being added to the assay. CSFE is used to assess the degree of proliferation by measurement of dilution of the stain among daughter cell populations.

To this assay placental stem cells PSCs were added at the ratio T DC PSC of 10 1 2. The reaction was set up in a 96 well plate in a final volume of 200 L RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5 pooled human serum R5 . After six days non adherent cells were briefly resuspended and transferred to a 5 mL tube washed with RPMI and stained with CD4 and CD8 antibody. Proliferation of the CD4 and CD8 compartment was assessed on a BD FACS Calibur.

Placental stem cells were obtained as described in Examples 1 and 2 above. Placental stem cells were obtained from the following placental tissues amnion AM or amnion chorion AC . Umbilical cord stem cells were obtained from digestion of umbilical cord UC . Fibroblasts FB and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells MSCs were added as controls.

When placental stem cells are added to the MLR T cell proliferation is dampened . Placental stem cells used in the experiments reflected in were derived from one placenta designated 61665. For all placental stem cells tested when either CD4 and CD8 T cells but not both were used the CD4 compartment was suppressed to a greater degree than the CD8 compartment . Suppression by AM and UC placental stem cells of CD4 activation was roughly equivalent to suppression mediated by MSCs with a suppression of about 60 75 . When the MLR was run using both CD4 and CD8 T cells placental stem cells suppressed proliferation in the CD4 compartment to a far greater degree than the CD8 compartment . In particular CD4 T cell proliferation suppression by AM placental stem cells approached 90 exceeding the suppression shown by MSCs. The difference in suppression between these two compartments was most striking for AM and AC placental stem cells.

Placental stem cells from different donors suppress T cell proliferation in the MLR to a different degree . Placental stem cells from a different placenta designated 65450 suppressed CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation in the MLR differently than placental stem cells from placenta 61665. Strikingly AC and UC PSCs from placenta 65450 suppressed T cell proliferation from 80 to 95 exceeding the suppression in this assay by MSCs. AC placental stem cells from placenta 65450 however did not suppress T cell proliferation to an appreciable degree compare AM placental stem cell suppression in .

Placental stem cells were shown in a regression assay to suppress a T cell response to a B cell line expressing Epstein Barr virus EBV antigens. The regression assay is a recall assay that measures effector T cell mechanisms brought about by presentation of EBV antigen peptides on MHC Class I and II of EBV transformed B cells. The assay is performed by mixing T cells with an artificially created transformed B cell line the lymphoblastoid cell line LCL from the same donor. The LCL expresses nine Epstein Barr virus antigens that elicit between them a range of adaptive T and B cell responses although in the classic regression assay only T cell effector mechanisms are measured. The regression assay offers a convenient way of measuring cytotoxicity to targets infected with a naturally occurring pathogen in that the LCL expresses the activated B cell marker CD23. Therefore the cell count of CD23 expressing cells is a measure of the number of LCL surviving in the assay.

The classic seventeen day regression assay gave results similar to those seen in the first cluster of bars in . No CD23 cells were detected as they had all been killed by CD4 and CD8 T cells. With the addition of placental stem cells seen in the next two clusters of bars survival of CD23 cells was enhanced. Without wishing to be bound by theory two explanations can be given for the observed effect. Either the T cells had died and left behind the LCL to expand freely or placental stem cells mainly increased the longevity of the LCL having had less of an effect on the T cells.

In a separate regression assay T cells and dendritic cells were obtained from laboratory donors. Epstein Barr virus transformed B cells lines LCLs were obtained by incubating peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs with supernatant from a lytic EBV line B95.8 and cyclosporin A for two weeks. The LCL expressed 9 EBV antigens. The outgrowing LCL line is maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum. The regression assay was performed by mixing CD4 or CD8 T cells with autologous LCL at a ratio T LCL of 10 1. The assay was performed in a 96 well plate in 2004 RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5 pooled human serum R5 . To this assay placental stem cells are added in a ratio T LCL PSC of 10 1 2. The assay was run for 6 10 or 17 days.

A six day regression assay was performed using CSFE labeled T cells. Placental stem cells from placenta 65450 suppressed T cell proliferation in the regression assay by about 65 to about 97 a result that corresponds to the results for these PSCs in the MLR . Again UC and AC lines from placenta 65450 significantly suppressed T cell proliferation while 65450 AM PSCs did not suppress proliferation.

In a separate experiment it was determined that natural killer cells were suppressed in the MLR and regression assays as well. NK cells when the MLR or regression assay was run including 50 U ml IL 2 the suppressive effect was about 45 range about 40 to about 65 SEM 5 .

In no instance was more than 5 background T cell proliferation observed against placental stem cells from any donor or any placental anatomical site.

The cytotoxic effect in the regression assay and allo recognition in the MLR both depend on TCR T cell receptor MHC interactions between target and effector cells. The requirements for cell to cell contact in placental stem cell mediated suppression was assessed using a transwell assay. In the assay an MLR was conducted in which the T cells and placental stem cells were separated by a membrane. As seen in the higher the number of placental stem cells used in the MLR the higher the reduction of suppression indicating that particularly at higher densities placental stem cells UC require significant contact with the T cells to suppress T cell proliferation.

A separate assay confirmed that immunosuppression of T cells by placental stem cells appears to at least partially involve a soluble factor. To determine whether the placental stem cells mediated immunosuppression is dependent on cell to cell contact transwell assays were performed in which placental stem cells were placed in an insert at the bottom of which a membrane allowed passage only of soluble factors. At the floor of the well separated from the placental stem cells were the MLR or T cells alone. In order to determine if an observed effect depended on the relative dose of placental stem cells the stem cells were added at different relative densities to T cells and DCs. When umbilical cord placental stem cells were separated from the MLR the suppressive effect was partly abrogated. When placental stem cells were used at densities similar to that used in the MLR suppression was abrogated 75 for CD4 T cells and 85 for CD8 T cells . The suppressive effect was still at 66 when just a quarter dose of placental stem cells were used UC OP 25 and dropped to background levels when 12 500 UC placental stem cells were added. No change in suppression with separation using an insert was observed . At 25 000 placental stem cells despite the still vigorous suppressive effect the smallest relative drop in suppression on introduction of the insert was observed .

In an experiment to determine the degree of contact dependency in immunomodulation umbilical cord stem cells showed a markedly different requirement for cell to cell contact for immunomodulation than that of bone marrow derived stem cells. In particular placental stem cells depended more upon cell to cell contact to effect immunomodulation particularly at higher numbers of placental or mesenchymal stem cells.

Bone marrow derived stem cells BMSCs and umbilical cord stem cells UC have different requirements for cell to cell contact depending on the ratio of adherent cells to T cells in a mixed leukocyte reaction assay MLR . In a transwell experiment in which placental stem cells were separated from T cells and dendritic cells DCs in the MLR the suppression varied between the two types of adherent cell. displays results from the open well and transwell side by side. When approximately 100 000 or 75 000 UC or BMSCs were used in the open well format a similar suppression was observed. However in the transwell format UCs suppress the MLR to a lesser degree than do BMSCs indicating a larger contact dependency at these higher placental stem cell T cell ratios. When lower placental cell to T cell ratios were used placental stem cells were more suppressive cell for cell.

From the suppression data the degree of contact dependency was calculated. shows the contact dependency of the UC and BMSC MLRs. Bone marrow derived cells are less contact dependent at higher BM T cell ratios than are UCs. In other words UC placental stem cells and BMSCs behave differently with respect to an important mechanistic parameter the need for cell to cell contact.

Regulatory T cells Tregs are necessary for BMSC mediated T cell suppression. See Aggarwal Pittenger Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells Modulate Allogeneic Immune Cell Responses 105 4 1815 1822 2004 . CD4CD25 Tregs were depleted from healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs and a regression assay was performed using autologous EBV Epstein Barr virus transformed cells. UCs were added to some conditions. As can be seen in there is no difference in placental stem cell mediated suppression of the T cell response in the regression assay whether or not Tregs are present. Thus while T regulatory T cells are reportedly necessary for BMSC mediated T cell suppression T regulatory cells do not appear to play a role in placental stem cell mediated immune suppression.

An MLR was performed in which the T cells were taken from an MLR suppressed by placental stem cells and the dendritic cells were added fresh. The T cells were stained with CFSE which is distributed equally into daughter cells during proliferation. CFSEcells are T cells that have not proliferated e.g. the left most peaks in the panels in . This population was obtained by sorting stained T cells on a FACS Aria. These cells were used in a second MLR with fresh dendritic cells. As can be seen in no lasting suppression was observed as the formerly suppressed cells proliferated well against the DCs. It is unlikely that the CFSEcells that is daughter cells would have been responsible for the suppression as these cells themselves proliferated subsequently. The CFSEpopulation is made up of non allo specific cells that would not have proliferated against this DC donor as well as T cells suppressed by placental stem cells. Once the placental stem cells were removed the suppressed cells proliferated.

An MLR is suppressed by BMSCs when approximately 10 of the supernatant is replaced by the supernatant from a BMSC MLR. In sharp contrast no change in T cell proliferation was observed when supernatant was replaced by supernatant from an MLR comprising placental stem cells even when 75 of the medium was replaced .

It is possible that DCs or resting T cells are affected by incubation with placental stem cells for different amounts of time before starting the MLR. This was tested by incubating placental stem cells or BMSCs with T cells or DCs for varying lengths of time before starting the assay. Preincubating T cells and placental stem cells does not alter the suppressive phenotype appreciably . However BMSC T cell suppression changes depending of the length of DC placental stem cell preincubation. As shown in suppression by BMSCs is strongest when DCs are added one day after the T cells. A much lower suppression appears however when DCs are added at the same time as T cells. Incubating DCs longer with BMSCs can reverse this loss of suppression. At two days preincubation the suppression approaches the scenario where DCs are added a day after T cells 1 day . No similar tendency is observed with placental stem cell mediated suppression.

Umbilical cord stem cells UC and placental stem cells from amnion chorion plate AC were determined to secrete certain cytokines into the MLR medium.

In some assays a cytokine array was used to measure the levels of cytokines and chemokines in the supernatants. Several factors were found to be secreted into supernatants the most relevant to the MLR and regression assays being macrophage inflammatory protein MIP 1 and MIP 1 . Both of these chemoattractants attract T cells and are secreted by CD8 T cells in response to human immunodeficiency virus HIV infection. When assayed in the MLR these chemoattractants secretion correlated inversely with placental stem cell and MSC suppression of the MLR . Neither placental stem cells nor MSCs secreted MIP 1 and MIP 1 .

In another study a correlation was found in secretion of MCP 1 and IL 6 both of which are important immuno regulators and compare with . While placental stem cells alone secreted no IL 6 or MCP 1 the UC and AC lines both of which suppress the MLR and T cell proliferation in the regression assay secrete MCP 1 and IL 6 and . Although IL 6 is mostly associated with pro inflammatory actions see e.g. Kishimoto et al. 23 1 21 2005 it also has other functions such as a protective role during liver damage in mice see e.g. Klein et al. 115 860 869 2005 .

In a separate study AC used in an MLR or regression assay were analyzed for cytokine secretion. Cytokines were measured on a Luminex system in supernatants from 6 day stem cell cultures stem cell MLRs or stem cell regression assays. MLRs included the stem cells dendritic cells DC and T cells in a ratio of 2 1 10. Epstein Barr virus EBV regression assays included stem cells EBV tumor cells Ts and T cells at TS stem cell T ratio of 2 1 10.

Levels of IL 6 11 ng ml and IL 8 16 ng ml were found to stay constant in stem cell solo cultures MLRs and regression assays. The concentration of MCP 1 was determined to be about 2 ng ml in stem cell solo cultures and non suppressive control adherent cell MLRs and regression assays but increased to about 10 ng ml in suppressed stem cell MLRs and stem cell regression assays. These values fall within serum levels recorded for MCP 1.

Interleukin 2 IL 2 is both a T cell survival factor and an obligate factor for CD4CD25 T regulatory cells. This T cell subset is not required for T cell suppression by the AC stem cells but IL 2 levels consistently decrease during MLR suppression by AC stem cells. MLR supernatants in the absence of AC stem cells contained about 35 pg ml IL 2 whereas the MLRs that included AC stem cells contained up to 440 pg ml IL 2.

The IL 2 concentrations correlated with suppression. For example a CD4 T cell MLR showing 85 suppression contained 330 pg ml IL 2 and a CD8 T cell MLR showing 85 suppression using AC stem cells contained 66 pg ml IL 2. These results indicate that IL 2 and MCP 1 traditionally known as stimulators of the immune response may play a role in immune suppression.

This Example demonstrates the isolation of placental stem cell and the production of a frozen stem cell based product.

Placental tissue is dissected and digested followed by primary and expansion cultures to achieve an expanded cell product that produces many cell doses. Cells are stored in a two tiered cell bank and are distributed as a frozen cell product. All cell doses derived from a single donor placenta are defined as a lot and one placenta lot is processed at a time using sterile technique in a dedicated room and Class 100 laminar flow hood. The cell product is defined as being CD105 CD200 CD10 and CD34 having a normal karyotype and no or substantially no maternal cell content.

A placenta is obtained less than 24 hours after expulsion. Placental tissue is obtained from amnion a combination of amnion and chorion or chorion. The tissue is minced into small pieces about 1 mm in size. Minced tissue is digested in 1 mg ml Collagenase 1 A for 1 hour at 37 C. followed by Trypsin EDTA for 30 minutes at 37 C. After three washes in 5 FBS in PBS the tissue is resuspended in culture medium.

In another embodiment a placenta is obtained les than 24 hours after expulsion. After cleaning the placenta a hemostat is clamped to the distal end of the umbilical cord. The umbilical cord is cut at the junction with the placenta and transferred to a sterile dish. After cutting the cord below the hemostat the cord is massaged to remove blood clots and transferred to 500 ml PBS containing gentamicin and amphotericin B. 5 g of this cord is used. A scalpel is used to trim the remaining placental material by cutting in a radius of about 3 inches from the umbilical cord attachment point. Blood clots are forced from the remaining material and 5 g of the amnion chorion centered at the umbilical cord root is transferred to the same container as the umbilical cord. The umbilical cord and amnion chorion tissue is sliced then minced to pieces about 1 mmin size. The tissue is then digested with 1 mg ml Collagenase 1 A 20 ml g tissue for 1 hour at 37 C. followed by Trypsin EDTA 10 ml g tissue for 30 minutes at 37 C. After three washes in 5 FBS in PBS the tissue is resuspended in culture medium 20 ml g tissue and transferred to T flasks at about 0.22 ml cm.

Primary Culture The purpose of primary culture is to establish cells from digested placental tissue. The digested tissue is suspended in culture medium and placed into Corning T flasks which are incubated in a humidified chamber maintained at 37 C. with 5 CO. Half of the medium is replenished after 5 days of culture. High density colonies of cells form by 2 weeks of culture. Colonies are harvested with Trypsin EDTA which is then quenched with 2 FBS in PBS. Cells are centrifuged and resuspended in culture medium for seeding expansion cultures. These cells are defined as Passage 0 cells having doubled 0 times.

Expansion Culture Cells harvested from primary culture harvested from expansion culture or thawed from the cell bank are used to seed expansion cultures. Cell Factories NUNC are treated with 5 COin air at 50 ml min tray for 10 min through a sterile filter and warmed in a humidified incubator maintained at 37 C. with 5 CO. Cell seeds are counted on a hemacytometer with trypan blue and cell number viability passage number and the cumulative number of doublings are recorded. Cells are suspended in culture medium to about 2.3 10cells ml and 110 ml tray are seeded in the Cell Factories. After 3 4 days and again at 5 6 days of culture culture medium is removed and replaced with fresh medium followed by another treatment with 5 COin air. When cells reach approximately 10cells cm cells are harvested with Trypsin EDTA followed by quenching with 2 FBS in PBS. Cell are then centrifuged and resuspended in culture medium.

Cryopreservation Cells to be frozen down are harvested from culture with Trypsin EDTA e.g. 0.044 ml cmfor 5 minutes quenched with 2 FBS in PBS and counted on a hemacytometer. After centrifugation e.g. at 300 g cells are resuspended with 10 DMSO in FBS to a concentration of about 1 million cells ml for cells to be used for assembly of a cell bank and 10 million cells ml for individual frozen cell doses. In another embodiment the cells are diluted to about 2 million calls ml in 10 HAS 10 DMSO in Plasmalyte. The cell solution is transferred to a freezing container which is placed in an isopropyl alcohol bath in a 80 C. freezer. The following day cells are transferred to liquid nitrogen.

A lot is defined as all cell doses derived from a single donor placenta. Cells maintained normal growth karyotype and cell surface maker phenotype for over 8 passages and 30 doublings during expansion culture. Given this limitation doses comprise cells from 5 passages and about 20 doublings. To generate a supply of equivalent cells a single lot is expanded in culture and is stored in a two tiered cell bank and frozen doses. In particular cells harvested from the primary culture which are defined as Passage 0 cells having undergone 0 doublings are used to initiate an expansion culture. After the first passage approximately 4 doublings occur and cells are frozen in a Master Cell Bank MCB . Vials from the MCB are used to seed additional expansion cultures. After two additional passages of cells thawed from the MCB cells are frozen down in a Working Cell Bank WCB approximately 12 cumulative doublings. Vials from the WCB are used to seed an expansion culture for another 2 passages resulting in Passage 5 cells at approximately 20 doublings that are frozen down into individual doses.

Frozen containers of cells are placed into a sealed plastic bag and immersed in a 37 C. water bath. Containers are gently swirled until all of the contents are melted except for a small piece of ice. Containers are removed from the sealed plastic bag and a 10 volume of culture medium is slowly added to the cells with gentle mixing. A sample is counted on the hemacytometer and seeded into expansion cultures.

Frozen containers of cells are transferred to the administration site in a dry nitrogen shipper. Prior to administration containers are placed into a sealed plastic bag and immersed in a 37 C. water bath. Containers are gently swirled until all of the contents are melted except for a small piece of ice. Containers are removed from the sealed plastic bag and an equal volume of 2.5 HSA 5 Dextran is added. Cells are injected with no further washing.

A maternal blood sample accompanies all donor placentas. The sample is screened for Hepatitis B core antibody and surface antigen Hepatitis C Virus antibody and nucleic acid and HIV I and II antibody and nucleic acid. Placental processing and primary culture begins prior to the receipt of test results but continues only for placentas associated with maternal blood samples testing negative for all viruses. A lot is rejected if the donor tests positive for any pathogen. In addition the tests described in Table 6 are performed on the MCB the WCB and a sample of the cell dose material derived from a vial of the WCB. A lot is released only when all specifications are met.

Cells are placed in 1 paraformaldehyde PFA in PBS for 20 minutes and stored in a refrigerator until stained up to a week . Cells are washed with 2 FBS 0.05 sodium azide in PBS Staining Buffer and then resuspended in staining buffer. Cells are stained with the following antibody conjugates CD105 FITC CD200 PE CD34 PECy7 CD10 APC. Cells are also stained with isotype controls. After 30 minute incubation the cells are washed and resuspended with Staining Buffer followed by analysis on a flow cytometer. Cells having an increased fluorescence compared to isotype controls are counted as positive for a marker.
