Non firing type electrodes are widely used in various electrical devices. The term non firing type electrode is defined as an electrode formed without a heat treatment at temperature of 350 C. or higher.

US20090169724 discloses a method for producing a non firing type electrode of membrane touch switch by a screen printing a conductive paste containing silver powder phenoxy resin urethane resin and an organic solvent on a polymer film and b heating the printed conductive paste at 140 C.

An objective is to provide a method of manufacturing a non firing type electrode which can have sufficient electrical property.

An aspect of the invention relates to a method of manufacturing a non firing type electrode comprising steps of A applying a conductive paste on a substrate B heating the applied conductive paste at 50 to 350 C. to form an electrode and C pressing the electrode at 10 to 1000 kN mof plane surface pressure or at 5 to 300 kN m of linear pressure.

Another aspect of the invention relates to an electrical device comprising the non firing type electrode manufactured by the method above.

The method of manufacturing the non firing type electrode comprises steps of A applying on a substrate a conductive paste B heating the applied conductive paste to form an electrode and C pressing the electrode. The method and materials to form non firing type electrode explained below.

An example of the method of manufacturing the non firing type electrode is explained with reference to .

The conductive paste is applied onto a substrate as illustrated in . To apply the conductive paste on the substrate screen printing stencil printing gravure printing offset printing spin coating blade coating casting or nozzle discharge can be available. The screen printing can be selected because the paste can be quickly screen printed in the desired pattern on a substrate in an embodiment.

The substrate can be glass substrate polymer film semiconductor substrate ceramic substrate or metal substrate in an embodiment. The substrate can be selected depending on electrical devices for example a glass or polymer substrate for a touch panel a semiconductor substrate for a solar cell and a ceramic substrate for a capacitor or a chip resistor. A metal substrate that has good thermal conductivity can be suitable for an electrical device that needs heat radiation such as a light emitter diode LED . When the substrate is a metal substrate or a semiconductor substrate an insulating layer can be formed on the substrate to not get electrical continuity between the substrate and the formed electrode.

In an embodiment the substrate can be a polymer film. The polymer film is flexible enough to not be broken by pressing. The polymer film can be a polyethylene terephthalate PET film polyethylene naphthalate PEN film polyimide PI film polyimideamide film polyamide film polypropylene film or polyethylene film. In the event of heating the conductive paste at over 100 C. in the later heating step the polymer substrate can be the polymer film having heat resistance such as the PET film PEN film or the PI film.

The applied conductive paste on the substrate is heated. By heating the applied conductive paste which is viscous can be non viscous enough to not be adhesive to a pressing tool in the subsequent pressing step. The heating temperature is 50 to 350 C. 60 to 250 C. in another embodiment 70 to 200 C. in another embodiment. The heating time can be 1 to 120 minutes in an embodiment 3 to 90 minutes in another embodiment 5 to 50 minutes in another embodiment. In the event that the conductive paste is heat curable the applied paste can get cured by evaporations of solvent and or by the molecular structure in the thermosetting polymer turned into net like structure under the heat.

In another embodiment the conductive paste can be heated at 50 to 120 C. just to be non viscous before the pressing step C . The electrode can be heated again after the pressing step C at relatively high temperature for example 100 to 350 C. to be firmly cured. In the event of heating the electrode twice the method of manufacturing a non firing type electrode comprising steps of A applying a conductive paste on a substrate B heating the applied conductive paste at 50 to 120 C. to form an electrode C pressing the electrode at 10 to 1000 kN mof plane surface pressure or at 5 to 300 kN m of linear pressure and D heating the pressed electrode at 100 to 350 C. in an embodiment. The heating temperature in the heating step D can be 110 to 220 C. in another embodiment 120 to 180 C. in another embodiment.

A heating machine such as an oven a dryer and a furnace that can control the temperature can be used for heating.

The electrode can be obtained by heating the applied conductive paste. The applied conductive paste which is non viscous by being heated to have electrical conduction is called electrode in this specification.

In an embodiment the electrode is pressed at 5 to 300 kN m of linear pressure in the direction of P1 by a roll moving on the upper surface of the electrode in the direction of D1 as illustrated in and .

The linear pressure is a pressure on line on the upper and or rear surface of the electrode. The linear pressure moves to one direction to press entire upper surface and or rear surface of the electrode.

The pressure strength can be selected according to for example thickness of the electrode kind of the conductive powder or type of the substrate. The linear pressure can be 22 to 200 kN m in another embodiment 35 to 125 kN m in another embodiment and 45 to 98 kN m in still another embodiment. By being pressed in such range resistivity of the electrode can be lowered as shown in Example below.

In the event of employing the liner pressure the substrate on which the electrode is formed can be a continuous roll and pressed with the calendar roll in a roll to roll system in another embodiment as illustrated in . The substrate can be a polymer film which is flexible enough to make the roll when employing the roll to roll system. The substrate is threaded through the calendar roll which linearly presses the electrode on the substrate. Calendar is in general a machine having two or more rolls to thread a substance between the rolls to press the substance.

The electrode can be also pressed at 10 to 1000 kN mof plane surface pressure. The plane surface pressure is a pressure on the entire upper and or rear surface of the electrode at the same time. Any method to make the plane surface pressure can be available for example crank press crankless press or knuckle joint press. Presumptively air bobble between the conductive particles in the electrode could be pushed out of the electrode by the press to result in getting high conductivity.

The surface pressure can be 32 to 720 kN min another embodiment 65 to 580 kN min another embodiment and 100 to 470 kN min still another embodiment.

The pressing is carried out just once or twice in an embodiment. The electrode could obtain lower resistivity by pressing just once as shown in Example below. Being pressed three times or more could damage the electrode and the substrate.

The method of manufacturing the electrode can optionally employ photolithography. In the event of photolithographic method the conductive paste is photosensitive and the method can further contain a step of exposing the electrode to light to cure between the step of heating B and the step of pressing C or after the step of pressing C . In another embodiment the method of manufacturing the non firing type electrode comprises steps of A applying on a substrate a conductive paste B heating the applied conductive paste to form an electrode E exposing the electrode to light and C pressing the electrode. In another embodiment the method of manufacturing the non firing type electrode comprises steps of A applying on a substrate a conductive paste B heating the applied conductive paste to form an electrode C pressing the electrode E exposing the electrode to light.

The exposing condition can be controlled according to photosensitivity of the photosensitive paste and thickness of the applied conductive paste. The cumulative exposure is 50 to 2000 mJ cmin an embodiment.

When the conductive paste or the substrate is unfavorable to be wet the electrode is formed by applying the conductive paste with a desired pattern and exposed to light without an aqueous development.

However when both of the substrate and the electrode are fine to be wet the exposing step can be followed by a developing step with an aqueous solution. The photolithographic method using the developing step is advantageous especially when forming a fine pattern. The fine pattern can comprises lines with width of 1 to 200 m and space between the lines of 1 to 200 m in an embodiment width of 5 to 160 m and space between the lines of 3 to 160 m in another embodiment width of 10 to 110 m and space between the lines of 3 to 110 m in another embodiment. The thickness of the fine pattern electrode can be 1 to 20 m in an embodiment.

The aqueous solution can be an alkaline solution such as a 0.4 sodium carbonate solution. The aqueous solution can be sprayed to the exposed conductive paste to remove the unexposed area of the conductive paste so that the cured pattern by the photo energy shows up.
