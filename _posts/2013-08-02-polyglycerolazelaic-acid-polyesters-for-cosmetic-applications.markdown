The present disclosure relates to polyglycerol azelaic acid polyesters and their applications in the field of cosmetics.

Azelaic acid is dicarboxylic acid with the IUPAC name nonanedioic acid and the structural formula I shown below 

This acid can be produced from oleic acid cis 9 octadecenoic acid a monounsaturated fatty acid by ozonolysis followed by oxidative cleavage during the reaction they form an azelaic acid molecule and a nonanedioic acid molecule.

Azelaic acid has been proven to be particularly effective in the topical treatment of comedonal acne and inflammatory acne papulopustular nodular and nodulocystic . Its use was developed from the observation that species of the genus are able to oxidise the unsaturated fatty acids present in sebum to dicarboxylic acids which competitively inhibit the tyrosinase enzyme. Due to its inhibitory effect against tyrosinase the compound has also been used to treat melasma lentigo maligna hyperpigmentation and other diseases characterised by the abnormal proliferation of melanocytes.

Azelaic acid is also proven to be effective in treating hypermelanosis caused by physical and photochemical agents with no evident lightening action on normal skin and without being photosensitising.

This acid has also shown a selective antiproliferative and cytotoxic effect on human malignant melanocytes as is discussed in the article Azelaic acid. A review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic efficacy in acne and hyperpigmentary skin disorders Fitton A. Goa K. L. Drugs 1991 May 41 5 780 98 . The mechanism of this action is still unclear although it may be related to the ability of azelaic acid to inhibit mitochondrial oxidoreductase activity and DNA synthesis.

A problem related to the use of azelaic acid in topical formulations is that this acid like other short chain dicarboxylic acids has an irritant effect when in contact with the skin this side effect which is generally temporary may manifest itself as itching or tingling. The information contained in the literature indicates that the irritation potential of these substances decreases with increasing alkyl chain length although longer chains do not retain the positive primary effects of azelaic acid illustrated above.

There is therefore a need for compositions which are able to deliver azelaic acid whilst substantially reducing or eliminating the side effects.

One of the purposes of this disclosure is to provide polymers or mixtures of compounds containing azelaic acid wherein this compound maintains its action considerably reducing the occurrence of unwanted side effects which are typical of azelaic acid.

Other purposes of the disclosure are to provide a process for producing said mixtures and to provide cosmetic compositions containing them.

These purposes are fulfilled in accordance with the first aspect of the disclosure by providing a linear or branched polyglycerol azelaic acid polyester.

In accordance with certain aspects the polyglycerol azelaic acid polyester of the disclosure is obtainable by reacting or condensing azelaic acid with polyglycerols with a polymerisation degree in the range from 1.5 to 10.

In accordance with another aspect the present disclosure provides a method for producing mixtures of esters and polyesters obtained by condensing or reacting azelaic acid with a polyol selected from glycerol and oligomers thereof containing up to 10 units glycerol.

In accordance with a first aspect of the disclosure a polyglycerol azelaic acid polyester is provided consisting essentially of at least one unit of azelaic acid and at least one unit of polyglycerol having a polymerisation degree from 1.5 to 10.

In certain embodiments the polyglycerol azelaic acid polyester of the disclosure contains 1 20 units preferably 2 10 units of polyglycerol.

Typically the polyglycerol azelaic acid polyester of the present disclosure does not contain mono or di carboxylic acids other than azelaic acid.

The main component of esters and polyesters in this disclosure is glycerol and oligomers thereof. Glycerol is a trifunctional molecule and can therefore condense with other glycerol molecules to form dimers trimers oligomers and polymers. The simplest example is diglycerol or diglycerine which is obtained by condensing two glycerol molecules. The dehydration reaction may affect all three of the molecule s hydroxyl groups and therefore may have varying types of condensations alpha alpha i.e. between two hydroxyl groups bonded to primary carbon atoms of two glycerol molecules beta beta i.e. between two hydroxyl groups bonded to secondary carbon atoms of two glycerol molecules and alfa beta i.e. between one hydroxyl group bonded to a primary carbon atom of a glycerol molecule and one hydroxyl group bonded to a secondary carbon atom of another glycerol molecule as in the structures described below 

The number of possible isomers increases along with an increase in the polymerisation degree for example going from three different linear isomers for a diglycerol to eight different linear isomers for a triglycerol.

Intra molecular reactions can also lead to the formation of cyclic products. Typically the processes currently available for obtaining high purity polyglycerols can be divided into two types 

For the purposes of this disclosure glycerol and oligomers thereof containing up to 10 units of the monomer polyglycerol 10 for example from 2 to 10 units of glycerol have proven particularly suitable. In fact an increase in the degree of polymerisation of polyglycerols corresponds to a decrease in the purity of the same together with the presence of an increasingly higher number of fractions with different molecular weights which renders the chemical and physical properties of the final polyesters less homogeneous. It should also be considered that as the degree of polymerisation and therefore the molecular weight increases there is an increase in viscosity and a decrease in the hygroscopicity of the molecule. Finally polyglycerols of up to 10 monomer units are commercially available for example from Solvay Spiga North Carasco Genoa Lonza Basel avoiding the necessity to synthesise this component.

Typically polyglycerols can be synthesised using methods which allow the condensation of glycerol with alkaline catalysts its dehydration with the elimination of water. The result of this synthesis is normally a mixture of oligomers which can include unreacted glycerol cyclic products and high oligomer products. Temperature typically above 200 C. synthesis and vacuum duration conditions promote the formation of the desired structures. Dehydration of glycerol achieves various polymers where glycerine molecules are linked by a bridge of oxygen. From glycerol which contains three hydroxyl groups the number of OH increases by one for every glycerin molecule which is condensed therefore diglycerol has four free OH triglycerol has five OH tetraglycerol six and so on.

In the production of the polyesters in this disclosure glycerol and oligomers thereof may be used in pure form or a mixture thereof may be used.

In some embodiments of preparing the disclosure polyglycerol 3 was used typically the trimer wherein the three glycerol units are linked in configuration 

The second component of esters and polyesters in this disclosure is azelaic acid. The synthesis of polyesters in this disclosure is carried out through the reaction of the first component glycerol its oligomers or mixtures thereof and said acid.

Typically the esterification reaction can be catalysed by acid or base. In some forms of preparing the disclosure an acid catalyst is used for example para toluenesulfonic acid or no catalyst is added in this case using the acidity of the azelaic acid itself.

Laboratory synthesis can be performed using various equipment. For example it is possible to use a glass spherical reactor flask placed inside a microwave oven equipped with an anchor stirrer thermometer dip tube for nitrogen a Claisen distillation flask with a Graham condenser and finally an addition funnel. Alternatively it is possible to use a reactor consisting of a 250 ml 2 neck pyrex glass flask positioned inside an electric laboratory oven and connected to a three necked glass candlestick which allows the metal rod to pass through for mechanical stirring of the product central rod and circulation of a flow of nitrogen. Reaction temperatures are variable and can range from around 145 C. to 180 C. in the case of microwave oven synthesis and from around 130 C. to 220 C. in the case of electric oven synthesis.

Equimolar amounts of glycerol or oligomers thereof and azelaic acid are typically used for synthesis or a slight excess of glycerol and oligomers thereof for example of 5 10 is introduced.

Typically linear molecules are also present in the reaction environment arising from the reaction between a secondary alcohol group and an acid group as well as branched molecules.

By appropriately adjusting the molar ratios between reagents and the reaction times a prevalence of the desired polyesters can be achieved in the reaction product.

The reaction between a diacid and a polyalcohol can lead to various products from simple esters resulting from the reaction of a diacid molecule and a polyglycerol molecule to oligomers and polymers resulting from successive condensations of molecules containing acid groups and molecules with hydroxyl groups. As polyglycerol is a multifunctional reagent you can also achieve the formation of cross linked molecules wherein various chains react with each other forming bridges producing insoluble products or branched molecules. In the event that no crosslinking or branching occurs and polyesters are therefore linear with G indicating a unit of glycerol or polyglycerol and AZ a unit of azelaic acid the esters and polyesters in this disclosure can be represented schematically as G AZ . The product obtained from the condensation reaction is a relatively complex mixture of esters and polyesters G AZ wherein the structure of the unit G and index n are both variables.

A second aspect of the disclosure relates to esters and polyesters obtained by the synthesis process described above.

In certain embodiments a polyglycerol azelaic acid polyester consisting essentially of at least one unit of azelaic acid and at least one unit of polyglycerol having a polymerisation degree from 1.5 to 10 is provided obtained by condensing azelaic acid or cyclic anhydride of azelaic acid with polyglycerol having a polymerisation degree in the range from 1.5 to 10. Typically the disclosure product comprises esters and or polyesters derived from the condensation of glycerol or its oligomers up to polyglycerol 10 for example from 2 to 10 units with structures containing an alternating residue of azelaic acid and one of glycerol or polyglycerol.

In accordance with some embodiments the disclosure relates to polyglycerol azelaic acid esters and or polyesters obtained by condensing azelaic acid with the glycerol trimer wherein the three glycerol units are connected with bonds represented schematically below 

Typically characterisation of the polyglycerol azelaic acid esters and or polyesters obtained can be done by chromatography in particular using the SEC Size Exclusion Chromatography technique. This technique produces chromatograms which report peaks corresponding to the output of a substance or fraction from the instrument in relation to time. This is achieved after calibrating the instrument with reference compounds which have a hydrodynamic volume similar to those of the molecules or polymers being observed. For example for a polystyrene of known molecular weight the technique provides among others the following values 

In accordance with certain embodiments a polyglycerol azelaic acid polyester is provided obtainable by reacting polyglycerol having from 2 to 10 glycerol units with azelaic acid or cyclic anhydride of azelaic acid specifically in a molar ration from 1 2 to 2 1.

In certain embodiments the polyglycerol azelaic acid polyester contains at least one unit of azelaic acid and at least one unit of polyglycerol having a polymerisation degree of about 2.

Within the terms of the present application the polymerisation degree is specifically referred to the oligomers of polyglycerol and designs the units or glycerol monomers of the oligomeric polyglycerol. Typically the polymerisation degree is given by the ratio between the molecular weight of the oligomer and the molecular weight of the monomer.

In certain embodiments of the disclosure the oligomers are obtained by condensing from 2 to 10 units of glycerol wherein the lower is the glycerin dimer that is diglycerin.

In accordance with a further aspect the disclosure relates to cosmetic compositions in particular preparations for topical use containing the polyglycerol azelaic acid esters and or polyesters described above. Preparations for topical use of the disclosure rinse off or otherwise have properties which are suitable for applications in the field of cosmetics and dermatology.

In accordance with some preparation forms polyglycerol azelaic acid esters and or polyesters are present in the cosmetic composition of this disclosure in a quantity of 0.01 to 20 by weight preferably from 0.05 to 5 by weight. Typically the cosmetic composition of this disclosure may be presented in any form suitable for local or topical application.

In some preparation forms the disclosure composition comprises mixtures of polyglycerol azelaic acid esters and or polyesters as previously described and a cosmetically and pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle.

Typically the disclosure composition can be presented in liquid form such as a lotion solution suspension shampoo or milk or solid semi solid or fluid form such as a cream or serum.

In some preparation forms the disclosure composition is in liquid form for example in the form of an aqueous based lotion containing one or more vehicles and or excipients suitable for cosmetic applications.

In liquid form the composition generally contains around 1 to 99.9 by weight of water. In some preparation forms water is present in a quantity ranging between 5 and 95 by weight. In other preparation forms water is present in a quantity between 10 and 90 by weight.

In some preparation forms the vehicle for the disclosure composition is a base preparation for cosmetic formulations typically for formulations of fluid preparations suitable for dermal or tricological applications.

In accordance with some preparation forms the cosmetic composition containing polyglycerol azelaic acid esters and or polyesters may be a formulation for tricological use to be applied to hair for example a formulation which does not require rinsing leave on .

Leave on formulations which are suitable for applying to the hair and or scalp include but are not limited to aqueous lotions such as aqueous colloidal solutions or dispersions hydroalcoholic lotions or hydroalcoholic colloidal solutions or dispersions fluid emulsions oil in water emulsions hydrophilic gels gelified aqueous or hydroalcoholic solutions which are formed by adding polymers e.g. acrylic polymers such as Carbopol or high molecular weight polyethylene glycols etc. to solvents or serums.

According to other preparation forms the cosmetic composition containing polyglycerol azelaic acid esters and or polyesters may be a formulation for tricological use to be applied to the hair for example a formulation which does require rinsing rinse off .

Rinse off formulations which are suitable for applying to the hair and or scalp include but are not limited to shampoos cleansing systems containing surfactants creams e.g. containing cationic substances Polyquaternium cetyltrimethylammonium chloride Docosil trimethylammonium methyl sulphate etc. alcohols or high melting point fatty acids to be applied to wet or dry hair before or after shampooing and then rinsed masks e.g. containing cationic substances.

Applying the cosmetic composition of this disclosure to the skin or keratin structures results in the beneficial formation of a complex film with protective film forming characteristics.

By way of example the compositions of this disclosure in liquid form can be prepared by dissolving the mixture of esters and polyesters or polyglycerol azelaic acid polyesters of the type previously described in a fluid typically water. Optionally the resulting mixture may be buffered to reach a pH level compatible with that of skin conveniently selected between pH 4 and 8.

In some preparation forms the tricological composition of this disclosure may include excipients commonly used in the formulation of cosmetic preparations for local use such as preservatives bactericidal agents stabilisers emulsifiers surfactants buffers humectants dyes and other excipients commonly used in cosmetic pharmaceutical preparation processes.

The disclosure composition may be applied in an effective quantity directly to the area to be treated typically the skin of the face or body scalp or hair. According to another aspect of the disclosure a method of cosmetic treatment is provided which consists of local application at the keratin structure level of the human body of an effective amount of a cosmetic composition of the type previously described.

The mixtures and or cosmetic compositions of this disclosure offer benefits in comparison with the cosmetic or dermatological use of azelaic acid or cosmetic compositions in which it is an active principle.

Polyglycerol is safe for use and can form polymeric structures which are very different from each other linear branched and hyper branched with better solubility and cytotoxicity characteristics than polyethylene glycol polymers used in known compositions . Furthermore by selecting a specific molecular weight of the polyglycerol chain it is possible to modulate the properties of the mixture and the formulations which contain it these being chemical and physical properties for example the solubility or the absorption kinetics of the active ingredient to achieve the preparation of modified forms of release of azelaic acid regulated by a chemical mechanism due to the fact that the ester bond may in certain conditions be susceptible to in situ hydrolytic or enzymatic cleavage.

When applied to the skin the polyesters of this disclosure due to the presence of numerous hydroxyl groups which are able to form hydrogen bridges with as many water molecules act as a polyfunctional reservoir of azelaic acid which can form thin films on the skin normalise it and hydrate it. The polyesters of this disclosure are therefore particularly beneficial in light of the greater tolerability compared with azelaic acid in order to produce a sebum normalising action on the skin. In fact it is known that at the level of the sebaceous glands the concentration of androgens is the most important regulating factor in sebum secretion. In particular the 5 alpha reductase enzyme converts 4 androstenedione to dihydrotestosterone a metabolite which can significantly increase sebaceous secretions.

A further benefit of the cosmetic use of polyglycerol azelaic acid polyesters of this disclosure can be attributed to the antimicrobial action of azelaic acid which produces an overall reduction in lipase activity of bacterial origin associated with lower production of free fatty acids which determines the sebum normalising action on the skin.

Subsequent to these actions the present disclosure provides for according to a further aspect the use of

In accordance with a further aspect of the present disclosure it provides for the use of polyglycerol azelaic acid polyesters of the type previously described to protect the skin skin appendages or hair from heat or heat treatments.

Indeed the Applicant has surprisingly found that the polyglycerol azelaic acid esters and or polyesters of this disclosure form a polymeric film when exposed to sources of heat or heat treatment.

This unexpected property of the polyglycerol azelaic acid polyesters of this disclosure enables its application in the field of cosmetics for protecting the skin its appendages or keratin fibres and hair in particular from heat treatments or exposure to heat sources such as sunlight.

In accordance with some preparation forms polyglycerol azelaic acid polyesters are added to cosmetic formulations for treating hair during washing or rinsing with water for example shampoos and conditioners in order to form a protective film over the hair s keratin structures during heat drying such as with a hair dryer.

In some preparation forms polyglycerol azelaic acid polyesters are added to cosmetic formulations for treating hair which do not require washing after treatment in order to protect the hair from the effects of the sun s rays.

The present disclosure will now be described making reference to the following examples which are provided solely for illustrative purposes and should not be understood as limiting the present disclosure.

Mn 4818 Mw 4931 Mp 4693 D 1 023. The polydispersity index equal to 1.02 indicates a very pure product essentially consisting only of polyglycerol 3 units.

This example refers to the production of polyglycerol azelaic acid polyesters. Preparation of a batch PGAO 02 01 of polyglycerol azelaic acid polyesters 

The maximum temperature of the reaction was 175 180 C. The progress of the reaction was monitored by measuring the acidity index on samples collected every 30 minutes using a sampler . The reaction time was approximately 2 hours. Operating under the process conditions described above various polyglycerol azelaic acid polyesters were produced listed below as Treatments according to the following table 

Of these polyesters polyglycerol azelaic acid polyesters PGAO 02 01 were characterised with SEC testing. See the chromatogram in . The test produced the following results Mn 7722 Daltons Mw 10 470 Daltons D 1.356. The molecular weights M.W. are expressed as polystyrene equivalents

Using the same SEC system and the same calibration for analysing the monomers azelaic acid and polyglycerol 3 the following values are obtained 

The average weight is very close to the sum of the weight of an azelaic acid molecule and a polyglycerol molecule but the distribution of the weights indicates the presence of different species which result from the condensation of more than one acid molecule and polyglycerol molecule which evidently leads to the formation of oligomers.

Comparing the SEC chromatogram for this mixture with that of the source compounds shows that the product still contains the unreacted polyglycerol overlap between the polyglycerol peak and one of the peaks of the product curve .

The SEC pattern shows that there is a significant presence of fractions of polymers with high molecular weights.

The SEC test was repeated on polyesters obtained with polyglycerol 3 using varying temperature conditions and molecular relationships between the reagents in order to reduce the presence of monoesters and increase fractions with higher molecular weights. These tests showed that the average molecular weight of the product increases as the reaction time increases.

This example relates to verifying the influence of the mixtures of this disclosure on the functional properties of formulations containing them.

In particular the influence of mixtures in this disclosure on the formation and durability of foam in cleansing formulations was verified.

Formulations were prepared for testing constituting a simplified shampoo model formed solely of water and the surfactant in question added in a percentage equal to the active washing substance 12 according to the present example as stated in Estimated daily exposure levels for different cosmetic product types according to Colipa data SCCNFP 0321 02 Hall et al. 2007 2011 . An anionic surfactant was chosen as these surfactants are known to be the most susceptible to hard and very hard water.

The tests were carried out on a formulation containing a mixture of this disclosure produced in Example 1 and for comparison on a blank .

The formulation according to the disclosure was prepared by weighing 4.650 g of Sulfetal LA anionic active matter 27 for a total of 1 255 g of ammonium lauryl sulphate 0.120 g of Treatment 2 PGAO 02 01 and demineralised water sufficient for 10 460 g homogenising all the components with a magnetic stirrer for 5 minutes.

The comparison formulation was prepared by weighing 4.650 g of Sulfetal LA and demineralised water sufficient for 10 460 g and homogenising these components with a magnetic stirrer for 5 minutes.

250 g of water of a controlled composition and classified as hard was added to both these samples. The analytical data of this water is bicarbonate 574 mg l nitrate 6.9 mg l sodium 74.4 mg l calcium 171 mg l magnesium 27.8 mg l fixed residue at 180 C. 752 mg l electrical conductivity at 20 C. 1123 S pH 5.8 both sample 1 the disclosure and sample 2 the blank sample were prepared in this way.

The two samples underwent testing for the formation and durability of foam performed using the SITA Foam Tester instrument SITA Messtechnick GmbH Dresden . This instrument is described in detail in patent EP 1092970 and enables automatic sampling heating and temperature control of the sample by means of a double jacket in the vessel which houses the test sample. A sensor allows precise adjustment of the sample temperature. For this purpose the instrument was used alongside a MLW 4 thermostat VEB MLW Pr fger te Werk Medingen Germany .

Foam formation is achieved with a rotor which enables the amount of air within the sample to be regulated. The measurement of the volume of foam and its deterioration over time are carried out using needle shaped sensors which can measure the profile in many points in the sample s surface.

For testing the samples are loaded into the instrument s reservoir which carries out automatic sampling of 250 ml of the product and starts the test according to an agitation cycle at 1250 rpm for 120 seconds. The sample temperature is maintained at 44 C. 1 C. representative of a hot shower . The foam is measured every 60 seconds over a period of 15 minutes.

As can be seen from the data in Table 2 the presence of the mixture of this disclosure does not substantially alter the durability properties of the foam from the water based surfactant composition.

The same test was carried out with other anionic and amphoteric surfactants such as disodium laureth sulfosuccinate disosium laureth sulphate disodium amphodiacetate on formulations containing mixtures of this disclosure in a range between 0.1 and 3 by weight without detecting significant differences related to the formation and stability of the foam.

Formulations for cosmetic use containing polyglycerol azelaic acid polyesters obtained by condensing the linear glycerol trimer and azelaic acid according to example 1.

The anti inflammatory effects were investigated of polyglyceryl 3 azelaiate oligomers POLY AZ obtained with the method in Example 1 in an in vitro model of inflammation on human keratinocytes NCTC2544 and using lipopolysaccharide

 LPS from to mediate inflammation or irritation. The effect of the derivative in the models used was compared with that of azelaic acid AZ ACID a known anti inflammatory agent.

The irritant potential of the derivative POLY AZ was also determined in vitro compared with a positive control cells treated with 5 g ml of lipopolysaccharide . The results were compared with those obtained using azelaic acid AZ ACID in the same experimental model.

The human keratinocyte cell line NCTC 2544 Perry V. P. et Al. 1957 was obtained from the Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro National Institute for Cancer Research Genoa Italy.

Using the immortalised human keratinocyte cell line NCTC 2544 Perry V. P. et al. 1957 cultured in sterile flasks 25 cm incubated at 37 C. in a wet atmosphere at 5 COin MEM Minimum Essential Medium culture medium supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum FBS 2 mM glutamine 1 non essential amino acids in the presence of 1 penicillin and streptomycin.

1 3 splitting is carried out every 2 days when monolayer is formed by washing with PBS 1 phosphate buffer without CaMg and cell separation with a trypsin EDTA solution at 37 C. for 2 minutes.

Negative control Human keratinocytes NCTC2544 cultured in EMEM EBSS at 2.5 FBS supplemented with 2 mM L glutamine 1 amino acid solution and 1 penicillin 10 000 U ml streptomycin 10 000 Ug ml mixture at 37 C. 5 CO.

Positive control Human keratinocytes NCTC2544 treated with LPS 5 g ml in EMEM EBSS at 2.5 FBS supplemented with 2 mM L glutamine 1 amino acid solution and 1 penicillin 10 000 U ml streptomycin 10 000 Ug ml mixture a 37 C. 5 CO.

Under experimental conditions in connection with the results obtained in a previous MTT assay data not shown polyglyceryl 3 azelaiate and azelaic acid were tested at a concentration of 20 M final concentration in the medium . Both positive and negative controls were tested.

When the cells human keratinocytes NCTC 2544 reached approximately 80 confluence they were separated with trypsin EDTA and seeded at a density of 1 10cells ml in a 12 well plate and then incubated at 37 C. 5 CO2 24 hours .

Polyglyceryl 3 azelaiate and azelaic acid were dissolved in DMSO 100 at a concentration of 25 mM stock solution and then diluted in EMEM supplemented with 2.5 FCS 2 mM L glutamine 1 NEAA solution and 1 penicillin 10 000 U ml streptomycin 10 000 pg ml .

The controls containing only culture medium negative control and the culture medium plus LPS 5 g ml positive control were included in each plate.

The cells were exposed to 20 M of the compounds. LPS in a concentration of 5 g ml was added to each well with the exception of the negative control . The test was replicated for each compound.

When the cells human keratinocytes NCTC 2544 reached approximately 80 confluence they were separated with trypsin EDTA and seeded at a density of 1 10cells ml in a 12 well plate and then incubated at 37 C. 5 CO2 24 hours .

Polyglyceryl 3 azelaiate and azelaic acid were dissolved in DMSO 100 at a concentration of 25 mM stock solution and then diluted in EMEM supplemented with 2.5 FCS 2 mM L glutamine 1 NEAA solution and 1 penicillin 10 000 U ml streptomycin 10 000 pg ml .

The controls containing culture medium negative control and the culture medium plus LPS 5 g ml positive control were included in each plate.

Total RNA was extracted from the cells using Tri Reagent Sigma Aldrich which is a single homogeneous solution for RNA isolation according to the supplier s indications.

The purity of the extracted total RNA was evaluated by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm the A in which the nucleic acid has the maximum absorbance. The absorbance at 280 nm was also measured to evaluate contamination with proteins or phenol. RNA is considered good quality if the A260 A280 ratio R is 1.4.

After determining the total RNA concentration and the purity of each RNA sample it was diluted in DEPC treated water to a final concentration of 2 g ml. This is the concentration required by the reverse transcription kit. Gel electrophoresis was also performed to verify the integrity of the extracted total RNA.

The extracted and quantified total RNA was amplified using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit Applied Biosystems .

The RT PCR System Mx3000P Stratagene was used for the amplification and each total RNA was amplified in duplicate.

After amplification samples were diluted with 30 pl of DEPC treated water and stored at 20 C. until use.

The RT PCR was set up using linear TaqMan probes Applied Biosystems . These probes are the most common and publicised detection system for qPCR applications.

The inventoried probes and primers were chosen on the strength of previous specific bibliographical studies.

The relative quantification method was used which compares the relative concentration of the gene of interest target in unknown samples to a calibrator or control sample untreated cells . Here the calibrator is a baseline for the expression of a target gene.

The RT PCR was performed using the cDNA of cells treated with different treatment times and control cells.

10 l of Mix 2 Gene Expression master TaqMan and 1 l of 20 Gene Expression TaqMan were added to the cDNA. Each biological sample was treated in duplicate and amplified as indicated in the table.

The data provided by the Stratagene Mx3000P tool was recorded by the MXpro v.4.01 software. When the amplification was complete the software automatically applied the 2 Ct method. The Ct values of the target and the normaliser should ideally be within approximately ten cycles of one another.

Comparative quantisation produces a relative comparative diagram. A value equal to one indicates no change in the gene expression of the target gene between the study sample and the calibrator while a value greater than one indicates up regulation and less than one indicates down regulation. A value is considered significant if it is at any time greater or less up regulated or down regulated in comparison with the calibrator.

TNF is usually over expressed in the epidermis of patients with psoriasis Kristensen et al 1993 Ettehadi et al 1994 and has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the disease itself. The main role of TNF is also supported by evidence that in psoriasis other TNF regulated genes are over expressed and that TNF antagonists are used as highly effective therapeutic agents in most patients Richardson and Gelfand 2008 . It has recently been suggested that TNF inhibits barrier protein expression for example FLG and LOR that TNF antagonists may contribute to the clinical improvement of psoriasis patients by increasing barrier protein expression Kim et al. 2011 .

McRitchie et al. 1997 recently demonstrated that 10 g ml of LPS from maximally stimulated TNF production by alveolar epithelial cells within 4 hours.

In the study undertaken it was found that treatment with LPS from 5 g ml had a stimulatory effect on TNF production and therefore the inflammatory process of NCTC 2544 cells from 16 hours of treatment.

An experiment to verify the effects of LPS on the NCTC 2544 cell line was initially set up. Treatments were carried out with LPS 5 g ml in EMEM with a low FBS 2.5 content for 16 24 and 48 hours and TNF stimulation was evaluated.

From 16 hours incubation with LPS produces significant TNF production gene expression compared to the negative control.

On the basis of the results obtained subsequent assays were carried out after 24 hours of incubation corresponding to a greater TNF stimulation by LPS.

Following the preliminary model validation experiment described above the TNF gene expression was evaluated using RT PCR on NCTC 2544 cells after treatments with 20 M of polyglyceryl 3 azelaiate and 20 M of azelaic acid together with LPS at 5 g ml in the culture medium to evaluate the anti inflammatory effect of the two compounds.

After 24 hours of treatment azelaic acid does not produce an inhibitory effect on TNF gene expression while polyglyceryl 3 azelaiate has a significant inhibitory effect P

The TNF gene expression in NCTC 2544 cells was also evaluated after treatments with 20 M of polyglyceryl 3 azelaiate and 20 M of azelaic acid compared with cells treated with LPS 5 g ml in the culture medium in order to compare the effects of these compounds against a known irritant agent LPS .

During the inflammation test after 24 hours of incubation treatment with polyglyceryl 3 azelaiate acid produced a significant P

The experiments conducted show that at 20 M polyglyceryl 3 azelaiate was well tolerated by the system used.

In terms of the anti inflammatory effect a marked increase in TNF gene expression was observed after treatment with LPS 5 g ml compared with untreated cells polyglyceryl 3 azelaiate demonstrated an anti inflammatory effect reduction of TNF and this effect is greater than with azelaic acid. Also when tested in vitro for their irritancy potential on human keratinocytes NCTC 2544 after 24 hours of incubation polyglyceryl 3 azelaiate was more effective in down regulating TNF gene expression compared with the same concentration of azelaic acid.

During the tests carried out to identify the most suitable synthesis conditions for obtaining polyglycerol azelaic acid polyesters it was observed that the application of increasing temperatures promotes crosslinking of the polymer polyester.

In some cases the polyglycerol azelaic acid polyester based product as it existed at the end of the process appeared as an elastic solid with an opaque gel type appearance.

Consequently topical applications of polyglycerol azelaic acid polyesters were tested in cases where the skin or skin appendages are exposed to heat for example during exposure to solar radiation during warmer periods of the year or to direct or indirect heating systems hot plates hair dryers hairdressers helmet dryers etc. .

It is known that such treatments can cause stress to the hair especially when they are used frequently.

Temporary straightening of hair by applying heat with a heated plate is an increasingly common technique in the field of hair styling.

Tests were conducted on the effects of prolonged heat treatment using commercial hair straighteners GA.MA Italy Professional Line mod. Art. 100 on the hair fibre s cuticular structure.

The process of straightening hair using commercial hair straighteners subjects the hair to thermal stress in particular if the heat treatment is performed in a continuous manner and in close proximity.

The objective of the test procedure below was to develop a method to verify the protective efficacy of two different formulations shampoo and leave on product containing polyglyceryl 3 azelaiate after application to donated locks of hair which had never previously been treated when faced with prolonged thermal stress from using a commercial hair straightener GA.MA Italy Professional Line Mod ART. 100 . A formulation shampoo with no active ingredient was used as a negative control during the tests. Locks of hair from the same donor which had not been subjected to any thermal stress were used as a positive control.

Locks of hair from the same donor which had not been subjected to any heat treatment the locks of hair were taken before heat treatment was commenced .

In order to determine the protective potential of the active ingredient tested a shampoo formulation without polyglyceryl 3 azelaiate was simultaneously prepared according to the following formulation 

3 locks of hair from the same donor never previously treated chestnut in colour and 25 cm long arranged in equal weight locks approximately 10 g .

4. The lock underwent repeated brushing alternating 10 brushes on the front and 10 on the back for 4 minutes 

Application of commercial hair straighteners GA.MA Italy Professional Line Mod. ART. 100 continuously for 15 seconds along the entire length of the lock 

7. 1 mL of the PLACEBO or ACTIVE shampoo formulation was applied evenly to the entire lock for 1 minute dispersed over the lock then gently massaged with the fingertips 

8. The formulation was left for a further minute and then rinsed under running water approx. 44 C. constant flow for one minute 

9. The lock was gently wrung out and dried with absorbent paper towel and then reattached to the frame.

LEAVE ON APPLICATION in this case only after shampooing with the PLACEBO formulation 1 mL of Leave on formulation was applied evenly to the lock 

10. The lock of hair was dried without brushing or combing using a hair dryer Turbo Action Professional Mod. ST. 30005 from which the air was applied on the highest heat setting at medium power from a distance of approximately 4 cm from the lock and for a duration of 4 minutes.

11. At the end of the first heat cycle the hairs and hair fragments collected on the sheet at the base of the frame were carefully collected counted and stored for subsequent microscopic analysis 

12. The lock of hair underwent the same heat cycle a further two times according to the specifications listed above 

13. At the end of the third heat cycle the lock was combed front and back with a fine toothed comb for approximately 1 minute 

14. Fragments of hair approximately 2 3 cm in length from each heat cycle underwent subsequent microscopic analysis to assess the damage from thermal stress.

For each of the three formulations tested microscope observation was performed on the fragments of hair collected at the base of the frame and resulting respectively from the first and third heat treatments. The images were studied with a phase contrast microscope Leica DM 2000 at 100 oil immersion magnification. For each fragment digital images of 5 different points of the fragment were acquired. Each observation was carried out in duplicate at least.

Subjecting strands of hair to prolonged heat cycles using a commercial hair straightener GA.MA Italy Professional Line Mod. ART. 100 resulted in significant degradation and disorganisation of the cuticles of the hair subjected to thermal stress. This stress is demonstrated in which shows a fragment of hair which underwent washing with a placebo formulation.

In general the results obtained have demonstrated the protective effect exerted by the two formulations in the form of shampoo and leave on lotion containing polyglyceryl 3 azelaiate on hair subsequently subjected to repeated heat cycles which under normal conditions application of a placebo shampoo formulation and repeated thermal stress cause significant damage to the hair which manifests as deterioration and disorganisation of the hair cuticles.
