title: Multicast messaging within a wireless communication system
abstract: Methods and systems for sending multicast messages are disclosed. A multicast message is received to be transmitted to a plurality of access terminals at a radio access network (RAN), the received multicast message having a first format. The first format may correspond to a conventional multicast message format. The RAN determines whether the received multicast message requires special handling. If the RAN determines the received multicast message requires special handling, the radio access network converts the received multicast message from the first format into a second format. The RAN transmits the converted multicast message with the second format (e.g., a data over signaling (DOS) message) on a control channel to at least one of the plurality of access terminals. The access terminals receiving the converted multicast message interpret the message as a multicast message.

The present Application for Patent is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 212 462 entitled MULTICAST MESSAGING WITHIN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM filed Sep. 17 2008 which in turn claims priority to Provisional Application No. 60 974 833 entitled MULTICAST MESSAGING WITHIN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM filed Sep. 24 2007 each of which is assigned to the assignee hereof and is hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The invention relates to communications in a wireless telecommunication system and more particularly to multicast messaging within the wireless communication system.

Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations including a first generation analog wireless phone service 1G a second generation 2G digital wireless phone service including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks and a third generation 3G high speed data Internet capable wireless service. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use including Cellular and Personal Communications Service PCS systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System AMPS and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Frequency Division Multiple Access FDMA Time Division Multiple Access TDMA the Global System for Mobile access GSM variation of TDMA and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.

The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association Electronic Industries Association in TIA EIA IS 95 A entitled Mobile Station Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System referred to herein as IS 95. Combined AMPS CDMA systems are described in TIA EIA Standard IS 98. Other communications systems are described in the IMT 2000 UM or International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000 Universal Mobile Telecommunications System standards covering what are referred to as wideband CDMA WCDMA CDMA2000 such as CDMA2000 1xEV DO standards for example or TD SCDMA.

In wireless communication systems mobile stations handsets or access terminals AT receive signals from fixed position base stations also referred to as cell sites or cells that support communication links or service within particular geographic regions adjacent to or surrounding the base stations. Base stations provide entry points to an access network AN radio access network RAN which is generally a packet data network using standard Internet Engineering Task Force IETF based protocols that support methods for differentiating traffic based on Quality of Service QoS requirements. Therefore the base stations generally interact with ATs through an over the air interface and with the AN through Internet Protocol IP network data packets.

In wireless telecommunication systems Push to talk PTT capabilities are becoming popular with service sectors and consumers. PTT can support a dispatch voice service that operates over standard commercial wireless infrastructures such as CDMA FDMA TDMA GSM etc. In a dispatch model communication between endpoints ATs occurs within virtual groups wherein the voice of one talker is transmitted to one or more listeners. A single instance of this type of communication is commonly referred to as a dispatch call or simply a PTT call. A PTT call is an instantiation of a group which defines the characteristics of a call. A group in essence is defined by a member list and associated information such as group name or group identification.

Conventionally data packets within a wireless communication network have been configured to be sent to a single destination or access terminal. A transmission of data to a single destination is referred to as unicast . As mobile communications have increased the ability to transmit given data concurrently to multiple access terminals has become more important. Accordingly protocols have been adopted to support concurrent data transmissions of the same packet or message to multiple destinations or target access terminals. A broadcast refers to a transmission of data packets to all destinations or access terminals e.g. within a given cell served by a given service provider etc. while a multicast refers to a transmission of data packets to a given group of destinations or access terminals. In an example the given group of destinations or multicast group may include more than one and less than all of possible destinations or access terminals e.g. within a given group served by a given service provider etc. . However it is at least possible in certain situations that the multicast group comprises only one access terminal similar to a unicast or alternatively that the multicast group comprises all access terminals e.g. within a cell or sector similar to a broadcast.

Broadcasts and or multicasts may be performed within wireless communication systems in a number of ways such as performing a plurality of sequential unicast operations to accommodate the multicast group allocating a unique broadcast multicast channel BCH for handling multiple data transmissions at the same time and the like. A conventional system using a broadcast channel for push to talk communications is described in United States Patent Application Publication No. 2007 0049314 dated Mar. 1 2007 and entitled Push To Talk Group Call System Using CDMA 1x EVDO Cellular Network the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As described in Publication No. 2007 0049314 a broadcast channel can be used for push to talk calls using conventional signaling techniques. Although the use of a broadcast channel may improve bandwidth requirements over conventional unicast techniques the conventional signaling of the broadcast channel can still result in additional overhead and or delay and may degrade system performance.

The 3Generation Partnership Project 2 3GPP2 defines a broadcast multicast service BCMCS specification for supporting multicast communications in CDMA2000 networks. Accordingly a version of 3GPP2 s BCMCS specification entitled CDMA2000 High Rate Broadcast Multicast Packet Data Air Interface Specification dated Feb. 14 2006 Version 1.0 C.S0054 A is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Embodiments of the invention are directed to methods and systems for sending multicast messages. For example a method includes receiving a multicast message to be transmitted to a plurality of access terminals at a radio access network RAN the received multicast message having a first format. The first format may correspond to a conventional multicast message format. The RAN determines whether the received multicast message requires special handling. If the RAN determines the received multicast message requires special handling the radio access network converts the received multicast message from the first format into a second format. The RAN transmits the converted multicast message with the second format e.g. a data over signaling DOS message on a control channel to at least one of the plurality of access terminals. The access terminals receiving the converted multicast message interpret the message as a multicast message.

Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally well known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.

The words exemplary and or example are used herein to mean serving as an example instance or illustration. Any embodiment described herein as exemplary and or example is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise the term embodiments of the invention does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature advantage or mode of operation.

Further many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by for example elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits e.g. application specific integrated circuits ASICs by program instructions being executed by one or more processors or by a combination of both. Additionally these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition for each of the embodiments described herein the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as for example logic configured to perform the described action.

A High Data Rate HDR subscriber station referred to herein as an access terminal AT may be mobile or stationary and may communicate with one or more HDR base stations referred to herein as modem pool transceivers MPTs or base stations BS . An access terminal transmits and receives data packets through one or more modem pool transceivers to an HDR base station controller referred to as a modem pool controller MPC base station controller BSC and or packet control function PCF . Modem pool transceivers and modem pool controllers are parts of a network called an access network. An access network transports data packets between multiple access terminals.

The access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the access network such as a corporate intranet or the Internet and may transport data packets between each access terminal and such outside networks. An access terminal that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is called an active access terminal and is said to be in a traffic state. An access terminal that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is said to be in a connection setup state. An access terminal may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel for example using fiber optic or coaxial cables. An access terminal may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card compact flash external or internal modem or wireless or wireline phone. The communication link through which the access terminal sends signals to the modem pool transceiver is called a reverse link or traffic channel. The communication link through which a modem pool transceiver sends signals to an access terminal is called a forward link or traffic channel. As used herein the term traffic channel can refer to either a forward or reverse traffic channel.

Referring back to the components of the wireless network and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary embodiments of the invention are not limited to the configuration illustrated. System is merely exemplary and can include any system that allows remote access terminals such as wireless client computing devices to communicate over the air between and among each other and or between and among components connected via the air interface and RAN including without limitation carrier network the Internet and or other remote servers.

The RAN controls messages typically sent as data packets sent to a base station controller packet control function BSC PCF . The BSC PCF is responsible for signaling establishing and tearing down bearer channels i.e. data channels between a packet data service node PDSN and the access terminals . If link layer encryption is enabled the BSC PCF also encrypts the content before forwarding it over the air interface . The function of the BSC PCF is well known in the art and will not be discussed further for the sake of brevity. The carrier network may communicate with the BSC PCF by a network the Internet and or a public switched telephone network PSTN . Alternatively the BSC PCF may connect directly to the Internet or external network. Typically the network or Internet connection between the carrier network and the BSC PCF transfers data and the PSTN transfers voice information. The BSC PCF can be connected to multiple base stations BS or modem pool transceivers MPT . In a similar manner to the carrier network the BSC PCF is typically connected to the MPT BS by a network the Internet and or PSTN for data transfer and or voice information. The MPT BS can broadcast data messages wirelessly to the access terminals such as cellular telephone . The MPT BS BSC PCF and other components may form the RAN as is known in the art. However alternate configurations may also be used and the invention is not limited to the configuration illustrated. For example in another embodiment the functionality of the BSC PCF and one or more of the MPT BS may be collapsed into a single hybrid module having the functionality of both the BSC PCF and the MPT BS .

Referring to the broadcast serving node BSN is typically configured to support multicast and broadcast services. The BSN will be described in greater detail below. The BSN communicates with the RAN e.g. the BSC PCF via a broadcast BC A connection and with the application server via the Internet . The BCA connection is used to transfer multicast and or broadcast messaging. Accordingly the application server sends unicast messaging to the PDSN via the Internet and sends multicast messaging to the BSN via the Internet . The PDSN and BSN may be integrated into a single network node.

Generally as will be described in greater detail below the RAN transmits multicast messages received from the BSN via the BCA connection over a broadcast channel BCH of the air interface to one or more access terminals .

Referring to an access terminal here a wireless device such as a cellular telephone has a platform that can receive and execute software applications data and or commands transmitted from the RAN that may ultimately come from the carrier network the Internet and or other remote servers and networks. The platform can include a transceiver operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other processor microprocessor logic circuit or other data processing device. The ASIC or other processor executes the application programming interface API layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory of the wireless device. The memory can be comprised of read only or random access memory RAM and ROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform also can include a local database that can hold applications not actively used in memory . The local database is typically a flash memory cell but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art such as magnetic media EEPROM optical media tape soft or hard disk or the like. The internal platform components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna display push to talk button and keypad among other components as is known in the art.

Accordingly an embodiment of the invention can include an access terminal including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example ASIC memory API and local database may all be used cooperatively to load store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore the features of the access terminal in are to be considered merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.

The wireless communication between the access terminal and the RAN can be based on different technologies such as code division multiple access CDMA WCDMA time division multiple access TDMA frequency division multiple access FDMA Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM the Global System for Mobile Communications GSM or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. The data communication is typically between the client device MPT BS and BSC PCF . The BSC PCF can be connected to multiple data networks such as the carrier network PSTN the Internet a virtual private network and the like thus allowing the access terminal access to a broader communication network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art voice transmission and or data can be transmitted to the access terminals from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments of the invention and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of embodiments of the invention.

As discussed in the Background section multicast messaging may be performed in a number of ways. In order to better understand embodiments of the present invention a conventional multicast messaging process will be described with respect to respectively. Then a multicast messaging process according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described in greater detail.

After receiving the forwarded multicast message the RAN waits for a next available control channel capsule in . The control channel referred to herein is a downlink control channel which is assigned a different frequency coding and or bandwidth than the broadcast channel BCH . Generally less bandwidth is allocated to the control channel which is conventionally intended to include control messaging only while more bandwidth is allocated to the broadcast channel BCH which is conventionally intended to include data.

Referring to each control channel cycle includes a total of slots. Each control channel cycle includes a synchronous control channel capsule SC an asynchronous control channel capsule AC and a number of sub synchronous control channels SSCs . One SC is regularly or periodically transmitted at a given timeslot for each control channel cycle having a period of 256 slots whereas the AC is transmitted at random or at non synchronous timeslots within the control channel cycle. The SC is first transmitted at a timeslot corresponding to T mod Offset and then retransmitted at a timeslot corresponding to T mod Offset where T denotes a system time and an Offset denotes a time value delayed from a fixed time which are included in the control channel header. Each SC may include a plurality of control channel MAC layer packets whereas each AC includes only one control channel MAC layer packet. As each MPT BS periodically transmits one or more control channel MAC layer packets interference e.g. inter cell interference may occur if each MPT BS transmits at the same time. Accordingly a different offset is applied to the SC for each MPT BS to avoid collisions. The MPT BS may transmit as many as three SSC capsules within one control channel period or 256 slot cycle. Each SSC typically transmits only one control channel MAC layer packet. Assuming an offset value of 2 the SSCs are transmitted at time slots and . Control channel capsules e.g. SCs ACs SSCs etc. are generally well known in the art within BCMCS systems and as such a further description thereof has been omitted for the sake of brevity.

Returning back to in the RAN may wait for either a synchronous control channel capsule SC e.g. timeslot in a next control channel cycle assuming an offset of or alternatively a sub synchronous control channel capsule SSC e.g. one of timeslots of the control channel cycle assuming an offset of where the periodic BOM message is scheduled. For example one particular control channel capsule within each control channel cycle may be reserved for a particular BOM. Since other applications may be attempting to access the control channel and other messages may be scheduled a delay of multiple cycles may be incurred.

In after waiting for the next available SC or SSC the RAN transmits a broadcast overhead message BOM over the air interface to one or more multicast group members e.g. ATs A B C . The BOM is a forward link control message defined by EV DO standards. The BOM is used to notify each multicast group member of the BCMCS flows which are currently being carried in a sector. The BOM also provides Interlaced Multiplexed Pair IM Pair information which is information regarding the forward link physical layer timeslots that should be decoded to receive the desired packet flows and information on the number of physical layer slots per broadcast physical layer packet and physical layer rate used to transmit the flow. In the RAN waits a predetermined number of slots e.g. 8 to 16 slots for the BOM to be decoded at the target ATs. After the delay the RAN waits for the BCH slot designated by the decoded BOM . This creates another delay which may be further exacerbated based on the traffic on the broadcast channel. In the RAN transmits the announce message to each multicast group member or target AT which it is serving over the broadcast channel BCH on the designated BCH slot.

As described above with respect to conventional BCMCS multicast messaging typically requires each target AT or multicast group member to decode a broadcast overhead message BOM before a multicast message is transmitted over a broadcast channel BCH to the respective members of the multicast group. This creates delays both for the scheduling of the BOM delays for the decoding and potential subsequent delays for the scheduling the announce message.

In the embodiment of in the application server requests a multicast message be sent to a multicast group including ATs A B and C. The multicast message from is routed to the BSN . In the BSN forwards the multicast message along with the associated multicast group including the target destinations or ATs for the multicast message over the BCA connection to the RAN . For example the BSN may forward the multicast message to the BSC PCF which may analyze the multicast group members associated with the multicast message and forwards the multicast message to each MPT BS serving one or more multicast group members.

After receiving the forwarded multicast messages the RAN analyzes the received multicast message in . Based on the analysis in the RAN determines whether to apply special handling instructions or treatment to the multicast message in . For example the analyzing in may evaluate the internet protocol IP header of the multicast message. If a flag is determined to be present within the IP header for example the Difserv Code Point DSCP value of the IP header the flag may be interpreted as a trigger which requests special handling for the multicast message. Alternatively the flag may be provided within the well known BCA identifier ID or BCMCS flow ID e.g. separate from the IP header . For example before the multicast session the BSN may be configured with the multicast sessions each identified by a multicast IP address and port number which are reserved or associated with special handling e.g. multicast sessions reserved for emergency communications etc. . The BSN may then share the corresponding BCMCS flow IDs with the RAN . Accordingly thereafter during a multicast session the RAN may check in whether the received multicast message corresponds to one of the reserved BCMCS flow IDs and if so determines to apply special handling for the received multicast message in .

In another alternative example the flag may be provided via both the IP header and BCMCS flow ID BCA ID. Generally a flag represented by a BCMCS flow ID may be recognized by either portion of the BSC PCF whereas a flag within the IP header either a DSCP or a multicast IP address and port number may be recognized decoded by the PCF portion of the BSC PCF of the RAN . BCA identifiers and DSCP values are well known in the art and will not be described further for the sake of brevity.

For example the flag may be inserted into the multicast message e.g. via the IP header the BCMCS flow ID or BCA ID etc. at any higher level position within the network architecture relative to the RAN . The flag may be inserted into the IP header by the application server the BSN etc. In another example the flag may be used to designate higher priority multicast messages such as announce messages that announce or initiate a particular PTT session. In another example multicast messages associated with emergency alerts may be flagged whereas multicast messages associated with product advertisements may not necessarily be flagged .

In if the RAN determines not to apply special handling to the multicast message the process advances to block of and conventional BCMCS multicast message protocols can be used to transmit the multicast message to the multicast message group. Otherwise if the RAN determines that special handling has been requested for the multicast message in the process advances to .

In the RAN generates a data over signaling DOS message which includes the multicast message. DOS messages are well known in the art within EV DO protocols. DOS messages are defined by EV DO standards as a unicast message and are not associated with multicast messaging in the EV DO standard. However embodiments of the invention generate a DOS message including the multicast message. The DOS message may be reconfigured to support multicast messaging protocols as will now be described.

The CDMA2000 1x EV DO defines an access terminal identifier ATI for identifying an access terminal a broadcast ATI BATI a multicast ATI MATI a unicast ATI UATI and a random ATI RATI . The BATI is defined as 00 the MATI is defined as 01 the UATI is defined as 10 and the RATI is defined as 11 . The three ATI types excluding the BATI have a 32 bit field for representing an ATI. The UATI is used in a 1 1 call processing procedure.

As discussed above DOS messages are defined by EV DO standards as being associated with unicast messaging and not multicast messaging. However the DOS message generated in is addressed to the multicast access terminal identifier MATI where the MATI is set to the BCMCSFlowID associated with the multicast message. The BCMCSFlowID allows the ATs to identify the appropriate stream on the broadcast channel for the group call. Generally the BCMCSFlowID is known at each respective AT which is monitoring a particular BCMCS flow e.g. the BCMCSFlowID may be designated by the BOM etc. . Accordingly as will be described in greater detail below by tagging or addressing the DOS message of to the MATI the target ATs receiving the DOS message may interpret the DOS message as a multicast message associated with a particular BCMCS flow and directly receive the needed information to start the group call. Alternatively however it will be appreciated that other embodiments need not be limited to setting the MATI to the BCMCSFlowID to distinguish the DOS as a multicast message. For example the MATI may be set to any value which multicast group members or ATs may interpret as identifying the MATI to be a multicast message for a particular multicast group.

In the RAN waits for a next available control channel capsule on the control channel. In the RAN transmits the DOS message to the multicast group members over the control channel within the next available control channel capsule. As discussed above each synchronous channel SC e.g. or alternatively each sub synchronous channel of the control channel capsule may include a plurality of MAC layer packets. Accordingly in an example the DOS message may be included in the first MAC layer packet of the given control channel capsule.

In each target AT receives the DOS message transmitted in over the control channel. Because the DOS message is addressed to the MATI each target AT determines the DOS message to include the associated multicast message e.g. as opposed to a unicast message . It will be appreciated that a DOS message addressed to a MATI would likely be interpreted as an error in a conventional handset or AT. In this embodiment however each target AT may be configured to recognize a control message addressed to the MATI e.g. or otherwise identified as a multicast message as a multicast message such that the AT configured in accordance with this embodiment extracts the multicast message from the received DOS message in . The respective target ATs may acknowledge receipt of the multicast message included within the DOS message subsequent to a successful receipt or extracting of the multicast message. In another aspect of the invention the RAN may first confirm that one or more given target ATs is capable of interpreting for example DOS messages using the MATI as multicast messages in order to ensure that the DOS multicast messages are interpreted correctly by receiving ATs. In an example each AT receiving the DOS message may decode extract the multicast message in irrespective of whether the AT is actually one of the intended recipients of the multicast message. In another example only target ATs or ATs interested in the multicast session may decode extract the multicast message from the DOS message in .

As will be appreciated from the forgoing description of the exemplary multicast messaging process of the delays and potential loss of data associated with sending a BOM to the multicast group members waiting for BOM decoding and sending an announce message may be avoided for DOS multicast messages by allocating higher priority status via an IP header flag and transmitting the higher priority multicast messages via the control channel.

Further it will be appreciated that the process of which has been described as being performed at the RAN and or MPT BS may be performed at one or more RANs and or MPT BSs at the same time in other embodiments of the invention and the description of has been directed to a single RAN and MPT BS implementation for the sake of convenience of description only. In another example if multicast group members are dispersed among different MPT BS s procedures through may be performed among the different MPT BS s independently.

Further while the embodiment of is directed to a DOS message in 1xEVDO being set to a MATI address or multicast bit signature as opposed to a UATI address or unicast bit signature it will be appreciated that any control channel message adapted to conform to a MATI type message may alternatively be used to transfer a multicast message on the control channel.

Those of skill in the art will appreciate that information and signals may be represented using any of a variety of different technologies and techniques.
