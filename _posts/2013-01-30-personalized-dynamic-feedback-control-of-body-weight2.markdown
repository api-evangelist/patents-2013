Obesity and diabetes have undergone explosive growth within almost every nation in the world. The medical profession health maintenance organizations and insurance companies have realized that this epidemic must be brought under control. Many corporations have implemented programs in to inspire employees to lose or control weight. Commonly individuals struggle to find a diet or exercise plan that fit their needs and results in effective weight loss. Diet physical activity and exercise may each contribute to body weight management but specifics and personalization are lacking regarding what is required to achieve and maintain an individual s ideal weight. Previous research has suggested that personalization and feedback may be useful aspects of web based weight management programs and simple weekly feedback based on daily weight measurements may be effective at preventing weight gain for some individuals.

The prevalence of obesity has reached epidemic proportions and the incidence and economic burden of obesity related complications are rapidly increasing. While obese individuals often attempt to lose weight through diet and exercise they generally fail to meet their goals and weight regain is common. These failures may be due to difficulties in setting appropriate goals for weight loss as well as vague or erroneous information regarding the caloric deficit necessary to achieve and maintain a given weight loss.

For example quantifying the relationship between calorie balance and body weight change has been difficult and the prior art either presumes a qualitative relationship between calories and weight or adopts widespread official recommendations from the National Health Service in the Deviceed Kingdom the NHLBI and the American Dietetic Association which state that reducing energy intake by 500 kcal d will result in slow and steady weight loss of about 0.5 kg each week. The basis of this recommendation is the ubiquitous dieting rule that 3500 kcal equals 1 pound which has been used for more than half a century to estimate expected weight loss in humans. But despite its popularity the assumptions underlying this calculation are now known to be invalid because it ignores important physiological adaptations to altered body weight that lead to changes of both resting metabolic rate as well as the energy cost of physical activity. Hence the official recommendations drastically overestimate the magnitude of expected weight loss making it difficult to accurately prescribe a lifestyle intervention that will achieve a weight loss goal in a specified time frame. Furthermore such simple weight loss rules do not account for individual differences in metabolism and the response to weight control interventions. To address this issue mathematical models of human metabolism have been developed and validated that are personalized and accurately simulate the dynamic changes of energy expenditure and body composition during weight loss. These models can be used to predict the weight loss time course in response to a given diet and exercise intervention and can thereby be used to help set body weight goals that are quantitatively commensurate with an agreed upon intervention. The present subject matter employs one or more of such models to create a personalized weight loss program that additionally incorporates dynamic feedback control using a personalized mathematical model of metabolism and weight change.

Previous research has shown that personalization and feedback are often useful aspects of web based weight loss programs and simple weekly feedback by telephone mail or email based on daily body weight measurements has been effective at preventing weight gain in some individuals. While promising these previous efforts have made limited use of personalization and feedback but rather used tools such as progress charts and journals which may be difficult for many individuals to maintain and use accurately and consistently. Furthermore prior art has been unable to provide accurate quantitative prescriptions for the impact of an intervention on an individual s body weight since they fail to account for changes of metabolism that occur with weight change.

Herein the first personalized weight loss program is described incorporating dynamic feedback control using an accurate personalized mathematical model of metabolism and weight change in combination with repeated physiological or behavioral measurements such as body weight physical activity diet eating behavior various components of energy expenditure metabolic heat production or combinations thereof. The present personalized weight loss program differs substantially from prior art in that personalized mathematical models of metabolism are used to accurately simulate an individual s metabolism as their weight changes and the model parameters are iteratively and dynamically updated based on repeated physiological or behavioral measurements. The updated model simulations are thereby used to provide ongoing dynamic and quantitative feedback regarding adherence to the intervention the projected body weight trajectory range and quantitative guidance regarding any modifications to the intervention required to achieve weight goals. The weight goals can also be dynamically updated during the course of the feedback control intervention.

Aspects of a personalized weight management system PWMS described herein provide an improved system and method for implementing weight loss interventions. The PWMS uses a baseline mathematical model of the metabolism of a subject or individual participating in a weight management intervention to prescribe dietary physical activity guidelines medication surgery and or other interventions for the subject to achieve a desired body weight or to be within a desired weight range over a period time. Thereafter the PWMS periodically receives for example body weight data physical activity data diet data eating behavior data or various other physiological and behavioral measurement data for a subject and uses the mathematical model of the metabolism to predict a body weight for the subject. The PWMS compares an expected body weight of the subject to received body weight data to determine if the subject is adhering to the prescribed intervention.
