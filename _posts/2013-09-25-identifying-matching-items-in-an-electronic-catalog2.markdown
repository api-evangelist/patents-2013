title: Identifying matching items in an electronic catalog
abstract: Systems and methods are provided for analyzing received item information for a number of items in order to determine whether each item is already included in an electronic catalog. The item information for each item may be analyzed in order to determine whether the received item information is a close match with any known item previously included in the electronic catalog. When close matches are found for one or more items, one or more modifications may be applied to at least a portion of the received item information in order to match stored item information for the corresponding close match. One or more rules associated with the determined modifications may then be generated and applied to receive item information for other items that fit certain determined criteria.

Electronic commerce is a popular way of selling products services and other items to consumers. A typical electronic commerce system may provide user interfaces that enable consumers to browse and or purchase items from a merchant or seller associated with the electronic commerce system. Electronic systems that support user to user sales of items have also become popular. Sellers in such systems typically include both small merchants and non merchant individuals. Item listings can typically be located using a search engine. In some cases the user to user sales system is operated in association with a network based retail store such that a customer can search a retail catalog as well as a database of item listings from users via a single search query.

Different sellers in an electronic marketplace will often use very different terminology to describe identical items. As a result buyers seeking certain items often fail to find relevant listings. Further small sellers sometimes fail to fully and accurately describe their items resulting in lost sales and or erroneous purchases. Some user to user sales systems seek to address such problems by allowing a seller to specify a Universal Product Code or other item identifier of an item being listed. This allows the system to associate different sellers listings for a particular item. However various problems may be encountered when a system attempts to match newly submitted item information from a seller with an existing item listed in an electronic catalog. For example a seller may associate the seller s own internal item codes with items that the seller lists for sale rather than a more universally known item identifier or may incorrectly enter certain item information.

Generally described aspects of the present disclosure relate to analyzing received item information for a number of items in order to determine whether each item is already listed in an electronic catalog. For example a seller may submit a list of items which may each be identified by an item identifier and or other item attributes provided by the seller that the seller would like to list for sale via an electronic marketplace. An item management server as disclosed herein may analyze the item information for each item in order to determine whether the seller s listed item information matches exactly or closely item information for a known item previously included in an electronic catalog stored in association with the marketplace. When close matches are found for one or more items the item management server may determine whether any normalization or other data modifications may be applied to at least a portion of the received item information in order to match stored item information associated with a known item in the electronic catalog. A close match for a submitted item s information may be in some embodiments an item for which some of the submitted item attribute values match corresponding item attribute values for the close match but where other submitted attribute values are incorrect slightly different or missing compared to the corresponding item attribute values for the close match.

In some embodiments after identifying close matches one or more rules may then be generated and applied by the item management server to received item information for other items that fit certain criteria such as to item information for items received from a given seller associated with a given item category associated with a given item brand and or other criteria. The rules may be generated for example based on recognized patterns or common differences between multiple seller submitted items item information and item information of corresponding close matches in the electronic catalog. After applying rules to normalize or otherwise correct incoming item information the electronic catalog may be updated to identify which sellers have a given item for sale in the case that a received item information is normalized to match an existing catalog item . In the case that the item management server determines that item information for a given item does not match any known catalog item even after normalization or other modification a new item entry may be created for the item in the electronic catalog.

In some embodiments a marketplace system as described herein may include a data store of information about products or other items that may be listed for sale by sellers merchants and or other users hereinafter such sellers merchants and or other users may be referred to generally as sellers . The item information in this data store may be viewable by end users through a browsable electronic catalog in which each item may be described in association with a corresponding network page describing the item hereinafter an item detail page . Each item detail page may include for example an item image and description customer ratings customer and professional reviews sales rank data lists of related items and or other types of supplemental data that may assist consumers in making informed purchase decisions. Users of the system may in some embodiments locate specific item detail pages within the electronic catalog by executing search queries navigating a browse tree and or using various other navigation techniques.

In some embodiments in order for a seller to list a particular item for sale via the marketplace the seller may browse to the detail page for that item and then select an option for adding a listing. Because detailed information already exists within the electronic catalog for that item there is no need for the seller to supply a complete description of the item. For example in one embodiment the seller can simply specify the condition and selling price of the particular unit of the item. Because the seller need not supply a detailed item description listings may be added more rapidly and efficiently.

To accommodate volume sellers the marketplace system may also provide a bulk uploading service that permits sellers to add multiple listings at a time without first browsing to the associated item detail pages. When a bulk uploaded listing record does not specify a standard format item identifier the bulk uploading service may execute a search routine to attempt to match the listing record to a corresponding item record of an item represented in the electronic catalog. When no exact match is found in the electronic catalog as discussed in more detail below a loading module described herein may attempt to identify potential close matches in the electronic catalog for the submitted item information. The loading module may in some embodiments generate one or more rules based on analysis of the received item information for a number of different items. The generated rules may be applied in some embodiments to a subset of received items item information in order to normalize or otherwise modify the received data to match items previously included in the electronic catalog.

Seller provided data may be provided using an inventory loader user interface uploading a spreadsheet text file or other file using an application or application programming interface API provided by the operator of the retail server and or in other ways depending on the embodiment. In one embodiment a seller may submit a tab delimited or comma separated file that includes entries for a number of different items that the seller would like to add to the catalog in bulk. In some embodiments entries for each item may include one of more of a stock keeping unit SKU established by a merchant or seller a unique identifier established by the manufacturer or other entity a price an item condition a quantity various shipping options tax properties item notes and or various attributes of the item. Unique identifiers provided for an item may include for example a Universal Product Code UPC an International Standard Book Number ISBN a European Article Number EAN and or a unique identifier established by the operator of the retail server . In some embodiments one or more of the unique identifiers provided may be considered a Global Trade Item Number GTIN . Item attributes may include for example size color manufacturer weight and or others. It will be appreciated that some item attributes may be specific to a given item type. Item attributes for a book for example may include book title author publisher and page count while item attributes for an item of clothing may include size color designer gender etc.

Stored item attribute data in some embodiments may include both item attributes and item attribute values. Example item attributes for a given item such as a running shoe may include Title Color Size Fabric Type Brand Name Sole Type etc. An item attribute value is a value associated with a given item attribute. For example the Fabric Type item attribute for a given item such as running shoes may have an associated item attribute value of leather. In some embodiments the electronic catalog may include the same set of attributes for all items or for all items in a given item category but for a given item may only include associated item attribute values for a subset of the item attributes. For example an item attribute of Sole Type may be stored for both a running shoes item and a wristwatch item but there may be no associated item attribute value stored for the wristwatch item because for example the Sole Type attribute is not relevant to a wristwatch. In other embodiments an item attribute for a given item may only be included in the electronic catalog if an associated item attribute value is also included.

To assist potential buyers in efficiently locating the marketplace listings for a particular item each item detail page may present or summarize the existing marketplace listings for the corresponding item. These listings may be associated with a variety of different sellers including individuals and or merchants and may be for both new and used units of an item. Thus by accessing the detail page for a particular item a buyer can efficiently and accurately locate all of the current marketplace listings for that item as well as view detailed item information from the electronic catalog such as item images third party item reviews and or other information . The user may also compare the prices item conditions and or other parameters of the various listings and can initiate purchasing of the item from a particular desired seller.

In some embodiments the association of item listings to individual item detail pages may be accomplished at least in part through the use of a unique identifier associated with each item. The unique identifiers can include UPCs ISBNs and other types of standard item codes. In some embodiments even if an item already has a standardized identifier such as an ISBN or UPC associated with it each item in the catalog may be assigned a standard unique identifier assigned by the marketplace. According to some embodiments the marketplace may use the standard unique identifier as an index to relate or otherwise associate information in various databases with each other to for example generate item detail pages for each unique item and group seller listings for the item.

The illustrative operating environment shown in includes a marketplace system that enables users to browse and place orders for items such as items listed in an electronic catalog as well as submit item information for items to be offered for sale to other users. The marketplace system may include one or more item management servers including a loading module that may be used to implement various aspects of the present disclosure such as processing item submissions from sellers and matching items submitted by sellers to existing items listed in an electronic catalog. The marketplace system may also include one or more retail servers that facilitate electronic browsing and purchasing of items such as digital content items using various user devices such as computing device . Those skilled in the art will recognize that the computing device may be any of a number of computing devices that are capable of communicating over a network including but not limited to a laptop personal computer personal digital assistant PDA hybrid PDA mobile phone mobile phone electronic book reader digital media player tablet computer game console game controller and the like.

The item management server which will be described below in more detail may be connected to or in communication with a rules data store that may store rules generated by the item management server to be applied to seller submitted item information for items meeting identified criteria in order to normalize or otherwise modify the received information to match or be more likely to match items previously identified in the electronic catalog. The retail server may be connected to or in communication with an item data store that stores item information regarding a number of items such as items listed in an electronic catalog as available for browse and or purchase via the retail server . Item data stored in item data store may include any information related to each item. For example item data may include but is not limited to price availability title item identifier item feedback e.g. user reviews ratings etc. item image item description item attributes keywords associated with the item etc. In some embodiments the item data store may store digital content items e.g. audiobooks electronic books music movies multimedia works text documents etc. . In other embodiments the information in item data store and rules data store may be stored in a single data store connected to or in communication with the item management server and or retail server .

The retail server may also be connected to or in communication with a user data store that stores user data associated with users of retail server such as purchase history browsing history item reviews and ratings personal information user preferences location information activity information context consumption history associated with specific contexts etc.

In different embodiments each of item data store user data store and or rules data store may be local to item management server may be local to retail server may be remote from both item management server and retail server and or may be a network based service itself. In the environment shown in a user of the marketplace system may utilize computing device to communicate with the retail server via a communication network such as the Internet or other communications link. The network may be any wired network wireless network or combination thereof. In addition the network may be a personal area network local area network wide area network cable network satellite network cellular telephone network etc. or combination thereof. Protocols and components for communicating via the Internet or any of the other aforementioned types of communication networks are well known to those skilled in the art and thus are not described in more detail herein.

The marketplace system is depicted in as operating in a distributed computing environment including several computer systems that are interconnected using one or more computer networks. The marketplace system could also operate within a computer system having a fewer or greater number of components than are illustrated in . Thus the depiction of marketplace system in should be taken as illustrative and not limiting to the present disclosure. For example the marketplace system could implement various Web services components and peer to peer network configurations to implement at least a portion of the processes.

In brief the retail server is generally responsible for providing front end communication with various user devices such as computing device via network . The front end communication provided by the retail server may include generating text and or graphics possibly organized as a user interface using hypertext transfer or other protocols in response to information inquiries received from the various user devices. The retail server may obtain information on available goods and services from one or more data stores such as item data store as is done in conventional electronic commerce systems. In certain embodiments the retail server may also access item data from other data sources either internal or external to marketplace system . While marketplace system illustrates an embodiment in which the item management server communicates with a retail server in other embodiments an item management server may operate independently of a retail environment. For example the item management server may be operated in association with a service that provides information and or reviews regarding products services movies people events and or items of various other types without necessarily enabling purchase of items. In such embodiments the item management server may communicate with the computing device and or item data store without the presence of a retail server. In other embodiments the computing device or retailer server may include a loading module as described herein such that a separate item management server may not be present in certain embodiments.

The memory contains computer program instructions that the processing unit executes in order to implement one or more embodiments. The memory generally includes RAM ROM and or other persistent auxiliary or non transitory computer readable media. The memory may store an operating system that provides computer program instructions for use by the processing unit in the general administration and operation of the item management server . The memory may further include computer program instructions and other information for implementing aspects of the present disclosure. For example in one embodiment the memory includes a user interface module that generates user interfaces and or instructions therefor for display upon a computing device e.g. via a navigation interface such as a browser installed on the computing device. In addition memory may include or communicate with an auxiliary rules data store item data store and or one or more other data stores as discussed above with reference to .

In addition to the user interface module the memory may include a loading module that may be executed by the processing unit . In one embodiment the loading module implements various aspects of the present disclosure e.g. identifying differences between received item information and close matching items in the electronic catalog generating rules for normalizing or otherwise modifying submitted item information etc. as described further below. While the loading module is shown in as part of the item management server in other embodiments all or a portion of a loading module may be a part of the retail server and or a user computing device such as computing device . For example in certain embodiments of the present disclosure the retail server may include several components that operate similarly to the components illustrated as part of the item management server including a user interface module loading module processing unit computer readable medium drive etc. In such embodiments the retail server may communicate with a rules data store such as rules data store and the item management server may not be needed in certain embodiments. Further although certain examples are illustrated herein in the context of a retail server this is not a limitation on the systems and methods described herein.

At block the loading module may determine for at least some of the items for which item information was submitted a close match to an existing item listed in the electronic catalog. A close match for a submitted item may be determined for example by comparing the submitted item information for the item to stored item information in item data store for a number of items in order to identify the closest matching item in the electronic catalog. A close match may be in some embodiments an item for which some of the submitted item attribute values match corresponding item attribute values for the close match but where other submitted attribute values are incorrect slightly different or missing compared to the corresponding item attribute values for the close match. As an example according to one embodiment if a submitted item identifier for a seller submitted item does not match any unique item identifiers for items in the electronic catalog or is not included at all in the submitted item information the loading module may identify one or more close matches as items in the electronic catalog that match a number of other item attribute values in the submitted item information such as item name or title brand release date page count and or others.

In some embodiments the loading module may consider items in the electronic catalog with item attribute values that are similar to submitted attribute values as being potential close matches. For example an item attribute value with a slight misspelling such as a brand of Bellmont instead of Belmont missing or adding leading or trailing digits or characters such as a part number of 00562 instead of 562 or 123 D instead of 123 and or having a similar meaning such as a color of red instead of crimson may be weighted higher in determining close matches than if the given submitted item attribute value and stored item attribute value did not have such similarities. In some embodiments the loading module may retrieve a lookup table that includes associations between various item attribute values and common typos synonyms misidentifications and or other common incorrectly listed submissions.

As will be appreciated submitted item information for some items listed by the seller may match existing catalog information exactly such as by the seller providing a unique identifier and item title that are each exact matches with stored item information for an item identified in the electronic catalog. In some embodiments for such exact matches the loading module may process these matching items without considering them for the additional pattern matching analysis rule generation and other blocks of illustrative method discussed below. Instead for example the loading module may update availability information associated with the matching item in the electronic data store stored in item data store . Updating the availability information may include for example storing information indicating that an additional unit of the matching item is available for sale from the seller that submitted the item information.

Once the loading module has determined a close match for each of at least some of the submitted items the illustrative method proceeds to block . At block the loading module determines for each close match one or more differences between the item attribute values listed by the seller and corresponding item attribute values of the close match in the electronic catalog. For example the loading module may compare each item attribute value stored in association with the close match in the electronic catalog with the submitted item attribute value if any for the corresponding attribute in the seller submitted information. A sample result may be for example that a seller s submission differs in its submitted unique item identifier for an item by missing leading characters associated with the brand name such as the seller submitting a unique identifier of 89JK8217 and brand ABC Co. while the closest match has a unique identifier of ABC 89JK8217 . Another sample result may be for example that a seller s submission differs in its submitted part number for an automotive item by missing trailing digits that indicate color such as the seller submitting a part number of 9716 and a color of Black while the closest match has a part number of 9716 BLK .

At block the loading module determines one or more common differences between two or more seller submitted item entries and corresponding close matches in the electronic catalog. The loading module may for example compare the differences determined at block for each of the seller submitted items relative to the corresponding closest match in the electronic catalog in order to identify repeated differences or patterns in the differences. For example the loading module may determine that the submitted item information for a first item and a second item each differ from the respective item s closest item match in the electronic catalog by missing a portion of the given item s unique identifier that corresponds to the brand of the item. As another example the loading module may determine that the seller has repeatedly listed the same incorrect brand name for a number of items that otherwise match the respective close match in the electronic catalog for a number of other item attribute values. Depending on the embodiment the loading module may employ any of a number of known pattern matching techniques neural networks and or other known artificial intelligence or data mining techniques in order to identify patterns themes or logical connections in the differences between the various seller submitted data and corresponding close matches in the electronic catalog.

In some embodiments the loading module may logically separate items into various buckets before determining patterns or other commonalities among the differences identified at block . For example according to some embodiments a subset of submitted items may be determined to belong to the same bucket as each other based at least in part on the items being submitted by the same seller as each other being associated with the same brand as each other being associated with the same item type or item category as each other and or having one or more other preselected item attributes in common. As one example according to one embodiment the loading module may analyze books listed in the submitted item information for a given seller separately from analyzing clothing items submitted by the same seller. As another example according to another embodiment the loading module may consider the submitted item information from a number of different sellers for items of a certain brand as belonging to the same bucket despite being received at different times and from different sellers and may analyze the various sellers submitted information for patterns across sellers. A bucket of items may also be referred to herein as a group of items.

Next at block the loading module may generate at least one rule for normalizing or otherwise modifying the seller submitted item data based at least in part on the one or more common differences determined at block . The generated rule may then be stored for example in rules data store . In some embodiments the loading module may generate the rule in the form of one or more regular expressions a portion of executable code a script and or other format. The rule may indicate according to some embodiments the item attributes and or attribute values that describe the applicable bucket of items such as items of a specified brand and or received from a specified seller and the data transformations or modifications to be made to receive item information for items belonging to the bucket.

In some embodiments the data modifications described by the rule may include conditional statements. For example one determined rule may indicate that any received part number for a specific brand of car parts should have a dash followed by three digits added to the received part number according to a specified lookup table or rule set if the received part number is seven digits in length and missing a dash. This example rule may have been determined based on a determination at block that a seller s submitted part number for two or more different car parts of the given brand each differed from car parts associated with known items in the electronic catalog at least in part by missing a dash and three digits corresponding to a vehicle type for the car part. The loading module may have retrieved a lookup table for example indicating that seller submitted values for a vehicle type attribute for each of these items corresponded to a certain three digit suffix that should be added to the end of the submitted part number.

In some embodiments the loading module may determine that a rule based on a common difference identified at block should be generated based at least in part on the number or percentage of items in the relevant bucket of received item information for which applying the rule results in the modified item information matching item information for an item included in the electronic catalog. For example the determined percentage may be compared against a predetermined threshold percentage of items such as 90 or more according to one embodiment or the determined number of items may be compared against a predetermined threshold number of items such as three or more items according to one embodiment . In some embodiments the threshold percentage or number of items may vary depending for example on the seller the item category the relevant item attribute types the extent of difference between submitted item attribute values and the modified item attribute values and or other factors. In some embodiments a confidence score may be determined and stored in association with the rule based at least in part on how common a given error or difference in submitted item information is across a given seller s submitted item information across a number of different sellers submitted item information and or across submissions to the electronic catalog as a whole.

In some embodiments some or all of the normalization rules determined by the item management server may be ranked ordered and or assigned a confidence score based at least in part on the relative commonality or the frequency with which the given normalization applies to seller submitted information. For example according to one embodiment if a seller uses spaces instead of hyphens in part numbers such an error may be deemed common enough such as based on many sellers making this common mistake that the accompanying normalization rule is assigned a high confidence. On the other hand for example a misspelling of a brand name may have a low confidence if such error is rare. In some embodiments when a suggested normalization rule has a confidence score below a given threshold such as 90 according to one embodiment the item management server may request that the seller confirm the rule before it is applied. In some such embodiments rules above the given threshold may be automatically applied without prompting the seller. According to some embodiments when a confidence score for a given rule reaches a first threshold the rule may be automatically applied to a particular seller s submitted item information which may be considered a seller specific rule while a higher second threshold may be set before the rule will be applied to other sellers information which may be considered a global rule .

In some embodiments once the loading module has generated at least one rule for normalizing or otherwise modifying incoming item information the loading module may store the rule for later use in rules data store . In some embodiments the illustrative method may then proceed to block where the loading module applies the at least one generated rule to a new item entry received from the seller in order to match a new item to an existing item in the electronic catalog. For example the loading module may receive item information for additional items submitted from the seller determine that the rule is applicable to the new item which may be based in some embodiments at least in part on a bucket to which the new item belongs and or conditional statements stored in associated with the rule and then apply the rule in order to modify the received item information for the new item. The modified item information may then be matched with an existing item in the electronic catalog and or added as a new entry to the electronic catalog as appropriate which is discussed in more detail above.

As will be appreciated in some embodiments applying the at least one rule at block may occur either a short time or a long time after the rule was generated at block . For example in some embodiments the rule may be applied to a subset of the same submitted list of item information as that received at block . In other embodiments the rule may be applied to item information that the seller submits separately days weeks or months after the submission at block . In some embodiments depending on how the bucket of items was defined the at least one rule may be applied to incoming item information received from sellers other than the seller that submitted the item information from which the rule was generated. The illustrative method ends at block .

As illustrated the user interface includes an option for selecting to upload or otherwise submit a file to the retailer server . One acceptable file type may be according to some embodiments a tab delimited or comma separated text file that lists item attribute values for each item in a list of items. Depending on the embodiment the loading module may be configured to parse files of a variety of types including variously formatted text files spreadsheet files encrypted files and or proprietary file types that include inventory data. As another option user interface includes a text entry form or field in which the user may type or electronically paste tab delimited item information or other formatted text data. As illustrated the user has entered item information for a number of different items in field . Once the user is ready to submit the entered information to the marketplace system the user may select the submit option .

The illustrative user interface includes indication of a first suggested rule and a second suggested rule each of which may have been determined by the loading module based on a method similar to that described above with reference to . The first suggested rule is identified as a modification that corrects the seller s submitted part numbers for XYZ Brand car parts by adding additional characters to the provided part number that correspond to a color of the item. If the user agrees that the rule appears to be a correct modification and that the correction corresponds to the intended item the user may select the Yes option from confirmation options . The loading module may then apply the rule and corresponding modification to the identified item and to other items belonging to the same bucket as discussed in more detail above . The loading module may additionally store the rule in rules data store in order for the rule to be applied in the future to other submitted item information for items in the given bucket. If the user selects the No option from confirmation options the loading module may not apply the rule to the identified item information or store the rule for future use. Instead in some embodiments the loading module may create a new item entry in the electronic catalog for the submitted item.

The second suggested rule is identified in the illustrative user interface as a modification to a value for a brand name item attribute modifying Cool Air as submitted by the seller to match a recognized brand of CoolAire Co. . The suggested brand name modification may have been made by the loading module based on information other than just the brand name data such as by determining that other item attribute values for the submitted item match item attribute values for an item with CoolAire Co. as the brand name. In the illustrated embodiment the user may similarly select whether to accept or decline the suggested second rule.

The loading module may have determined such as by implementing a method similar to that described with reference to above that the submitted item information for the Through the Look Glass item corresponded to item in the electronic catalog. This determination may have been made based at least in part by modifying the seller submitted item information for the item based on one or more rules determined by the loading module as a result of analyzing item information for a number of different submitted items. Based on the normalizations and or modifications applied by the loading module the item data store may have been updated to reflect that the John s Books seller had one copy of the book for sale for 4.99. The retail server may have then retrieved seller information from item data store in order to generate the list of sellers for item presented in user interface . The shopper viewing user interface may select add to cart option in order to begin an ordering process to purchase the book item from the John s Books seller via the marketplace system .

The present disclosure often includes examples above of adding or updating information in an electronic catalog to include a new item and or to update availability of an item based on seller submitted data. As will be appreciated the illustrative methods described herein are not limited to processing seller submitted item information or to updating item entries or availability information. As one example aspects of the present disclosure may be used to determine patterns for part numbers item identifiers and or other item attribute values in order to extrapolate information for additional items that are not included in the electronic catalog and that have not been submitted by any sellers. For example the marketplace system may search one or more potential item sources or external data stores to determine whether an item with a part number of 10345 exists for a given brand if the loading module determines that the electronic catalog includes items with part numbers 10344 and 10346 for the given brand. In some embodiments the marketplace system may automatically generate leads and or send electronic communications to manufacturers distributors retailers and or individuals to request that an item determined to be missing from the electronic catalog be offered for sale via the marketplace system .
