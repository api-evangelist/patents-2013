This application is a nonprovisional of and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 600 455 filed on Feb. 17 2012 entitled CUSTOMIZED PRINTER IDENTIFIER WITH EMBEDDED ACCESS RIGHTS the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The ability to print paper versions of documents and other content typically requires access to one or more printers based on a person s identity and or inclusion within a class of users. For example users may purchase configure and utilize a personal printer e.g. for in home use. In other examples printers may be provided to employees or students of a business or school e.g. by providing individual user accounts in conjunction with network access to printers. Further various business models exist for providing consumers with printing functionality e.g. copy shops often provide consumers with an ability to use in store printers for a fee.

In contrast network access is often provided as a commodity service. For example many retail establishments routinely provide free or fee based Wi Fi access. Such access thus provides a customer attraction and may enhance revenue and provide other benefits.

However it may be difficult to provide printing resources in a similar fashion and in an efficient practical manner when using conventional technologies. For example while it may be possible for a retail establishment to provide public printers such public printers may be prone to abuse and over use by the general public. Moreover it is difficult or impossible for retail establishments and other would be print providers to accurately track and monitor printer usage by individuals in a way that would be acceptable for or desirable by the individuals.

According to one general aspect a print server may include instructions stored on a computer readable medium and executable by at least one processor. The print server may include an access rights manager configured to cause the at least one processor to receive an access request for printer access rights a customized printer identifier generator configured to cause the at least one processor to generate a customized printer identifier based on the access request with the printer access rights associated therewith and a print job router configured to cause the at least one processor to provide printing in response to receipt of the customized printer identifier and in accordance with the printer access rights.

According to another general aspect a method may include receiving an access request for printer access rights generating a customized printer identifier based on the access request with the printer access rights associated therewith and providing printing in response to receipt of the customized printer identifier and in accordance with the printer access rights.

According to another general aspect a computer program product may be tangibly embodied on a computer readable storage medium and may include executable code that when executed is configured to cause a data processing apparatus to receive an access request for printer access rights generate a customized printer identifier based on the access request with the printer access rights associated therewith and provide printing in response to receipt of the customized printer identifier and in accordance with the printer access rights.

The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

In a device is illustrated as an example of virtually any computing device from which a user may wish to identify designate or submit a print job. By way of non limiting example then the device may include a laptop or desktop computer a netbook a tablet computer a smartphone a camera or any device which may store or have access to data which the user may desire to print.

In the example of an operating system is illustrated as executing an application . Again these elements are included by way of illustration and example and may include virtually any operating system or other platform on which virtually any application may run. For example the operating system may include operating systems such as the Windows operating system Mac OS or Linux and may include mobile platforms such as Android Symbian or iPhone OS to name a few examples. In other examples the operating system may include a browser based operating system such as the Chrome OS.

Consequently the application may include virtually any application which may run on any underlying operating system or platform. Examples of such applications are well known and too numerous to mention in any detail but generally include document processing applications email applications image editing or presentation software a web browser or virtually any application which provides the user with a rendering of data which the user may wish to print or combinations thereof.

In particular as referenced above the application may represent a web application which executes on a remote application server as application . That is the application may include any application functionality which is accessed by the user over the network and experienced locally as the application e.g. using a browser running at the device . As is known such web applications allow an owner or other provider of the application server to assume responsibility for installing configuring executing and maintaining the application at the application server so that the user of the device may obtain the benefit of the application without many or any of the associated costs and responsibilities. Techniques for executing such a web application and related technology are well known in the art and are therefore not described further in detail herein except as may be helpful or necessary to understand operations of the system of .

The network may thus represent for example the public Internet or other wide area public or private network. The network may represent in further examples a corporate or other intranet and or a smaller scale local or personal network any of which and or combinations thereof may be implemented using standard network technology.

Further in a cloud aware printer is illustrated which is configured to communicate with the cloud print service over the network . In this regard the term cloud or cloud aware references the use of cloud computing which generally speaking includes a style of computing in which computing resources such as application programs and file storage are remotely provided over a network such as the Internet typically through a web browser. For example many web browsers are capable of running applications which can themselves be application programming interfaces API s to more sophisticated applications running on remote servers. In the cloud computing paradigm a web browser interfaces with and controls an application program that is running on a remote server. Through the browser the user can create edit save and delete files on the remote server via the remote application program. Thus it may be observed that the application server and associated application may also represent examples of cloud computing.

In the context of the cloud aware printer the cloud print service enables the application to print directly to the cloud aware printer without a requirement or need for e.g. independently of involvement of the operating system . In other words the application may communicate directly with the cloud print service to thereby print to the cloud aware printer without e.g. requiring a local driver within the operating system . As a result virtually any application that may be configured to communicate with the cloud print service may make use of the cloud aware printer as described in detail below.

For example the cloud print service may be configured to register the user and or the device as well as the cloud aware printer . In a specific example the device may be a smartphone and the user may use the application to purchase a ticket e.g. a movie ticket or an airline ticket . Then the user may print the purchased ticket directly to the cloud aware printer even though the device and or the operating system may not have the resources or otherwise be configured to support native printing in a conventional sense e.g. may not currently be executing a print driver of any sort associated with the cloud aware printer . In this way the user of the application may be provided with a print option and associated abilities that are not currently provided in conventional printing paradigms and techniques. Many other such examples are described herein or would be apparent.

The cloud aware printer may be contrasted with a legacy printer not specifically illustrated in which does not natively support communication with the cloud print service . When using such a legacy printer a separate device and or software may be utilized to impart the advantages of the cloud print service to the legacy printer. It will be appreciated that all of the various features and functions of the cloud aware printer may be obtained through the use of a legacy printer supplemented with appropriate hardware software support.

In short the system provides an ability for virtually any application running on any device within the network e.g. the applications and device to communicate with the cloud print service to thereby print to any printer which is also in direct or indirect communication with the cloud print service . Consequently users may benefit from increased printing options and abilities and experience an overall decrease in the costs and efforts associated with doing so. Meanwhile printer manufacturers may experience a decreased or eliminated need to provide users with the updated driver s and other prerequisites for users to fully experience the benefits of their products. This may result in for example higher customer satisfaction and a decreased cost of producing and maintaining printers.

In particular as referenced above the system may provide a number of enhanced features and functions related to enabling a provider to manage access rights of a user illustrated in as a user . For example the provider may be understood to represent any person business or other entity that wishes to provide printing as a commodity service for the use and enjoyment of the user . For example as referenced above the provider may represent an owner operator of a retail establishment such as a coffee shop who may wish to provide customers with an ability to utilize in store printers. Thus in the conceptualized example of the provider may represent an individual and or a physical location e.g. store associated with providing printing as described herein.

In the examples described herein the provider may be described as representing a third party provider leveraging functionality of the cloud print service . However in example implementations the provider of the cloud print service itself also may act as the provider .

As described in detail herein the system may be configured to provide users such as the user with convenient and optionally anonymous access to the cloud aware printer. Moreover the system may provide an accounting of the printer usage of the user over time. For example the system may be configured to determine to track a printing history of the user add or subtract user print rights e.g. with respect to available printers and or quantity of printings permitted and otherwise provide a printing experience that is convenient and enjoyable for the user while beneficial for the provider .

In specific non limiting example scenarios the provider may represent an owner of a retail establishment and may wish to provide access to the cloud aware printer as a customer reward service. For example the provider may provide printer access to the user in exchange for a certain number or amount of purchases by the user . In this way the user may be incentivized to purchase goods services from the provider .

For example the provider may be associated with a number of printers perhaps at a number of different physical locations. Then the user may be provided with an ability to utilize all such printers which may be extremely convenient and useful for the user . For example the user may represent a student who wishes to print a school paper or an employee traveling for business who needs to print a report or presentation. Rather than travelling to a specialty print copy shop the user may prefer to visit a branch franchise of a coffee shop convenience store or other retail establishment utilizing the system which may be closer easier to find and visit and otherwise more convenient e.g. the user may wish to visit the provider for its normal business purpose anyway so that the ability to print is simply a value added service to a visit the user would have made in any case .

As shown in the cloud print service may include a number of example components or modules which may be utilized to implement functionalities of the cloud print service and in particular may be utilized to implement the various printer access rights management scenarios described herein. For example the cloud print service may include a registration manager which may be configured to register printers and users. Thus it may be appreciated that through the use of the registration manager the provider and or the user may register with the cloud print service and may thereafter interact with the registration manager to login to and utilize the cloud print service .

For example the registration manager may store a username and password of the user which the user may provide e.g. in conjunction with a print job submission identifying application content to be printed i.e. using the device . In example scenarios the device may represent a mobile device e.g. a smartphone tablet netbook notebook or laptop computer so that the user may in the example scenarios use the same username password to authenticate to the cloud print service while present at the location of the provider and or the cloud aware printer .

Somewhat similarly the cloud aware printer as well as various other printers not specifically illustrated in the example of may be registered with the registration manager . In the described examples it may be appreciated that a particular subset of such printers including the cloud aware printer may be associated with the provider and or with one or more other providers including entities such as business or schools . That is the registration manager may register a plurality of users and a plurality of printers and may associate various subsets of users with various subsets of printers depending on associated authorizations or permissions of the users printers. For example a given user may register a number of printers with a user account of the user. In other examples a network administrator e.g. employed by the provider may configure a plurality of printers for use in the various access rights management scenarios described herein.

In some examples users already may have a user account with a separate and possibly related service or service provider. For example various online services e.g. other cloud based computing resources may provide functionalities such as email data storage and document processing and in such cases the user may already have a secure user account established in connection therewith. In such cases the cloud print service may leverage or access such existing user accounts e.g. to avoid a need to create a new user account and to facilitate access of existing users of other services with the cloud print service such as e.g. for implementation of the printer sharing techniques just described.

Thus it may be appreciated that although the registration manager is illustrated as being included within the cloud print service it also may occur that some or all functionality related to the registration manager may exist externally to the cloud print service . For example the application server may provide an email application as the application and a user of the device may be registered with this email application service . In such a case the application server may have the responsibility of maintaining the user s account and the cloud print service may simply interface with the application server and provide access to the user once the user is logged on into the application .

Thus in the example of registered printers and user accounts are illustrated. Of course the cloud aware printer and other printers associated with the provider may be registered within the registered printers . Further the accounts may include an account of the provider which may thus be linked to or associated with the various registered printers just referenced. Further as described in detail herein the accounts may include anonymous accounts individually associated with one or more users perhaps anonymously which may be used to provide the access rights management techniques described herein.

Further in an application manager may be configured to communicate with any application which may be desired to be used for printing within the system including e.g. the application and the application . Thus for example the application manager may implement various application programming interfaces APIs which enable such communication with external applications.

For example the application manager may include a print dialog API which may be configured to render a print dialog in association with the application . A job submit API may be utilized to receive the identification of application content submitted by the user by way of the print dialog . The job submit API may be configured to submit a corresponding print job including application content to be printed and associated print characteristics to a format converter which may be configured to execute a conversion of the print job into a format which is consistent and compatible with the cloud aware printer . For example the job submit API may receive a print job and to give a specific and non limiting set of examples a hypertext transfer protocol HTTP multi part request which may include the printer capabilities expressed e.g. in XPS as well as a MIME type identifying the content type.

Thus the application manager may generally implement the functions of receiving a print request and then receiving an associated print job from e.g. the application . In general the first function of a receiving a print request may include providing the user with the print dialog or other user interface with which the user may select an available associated registered printer and or as described herein. Receiving the print job may include receiving print data to be printed possibly along with print characteristics characterizing preferences and other aspects of how the print data is desired to be printed e.g. color versus black and white paper size orientation number of copies or any other relevant or desired print characteristic . The application manager may conduct other communications with the application as well such as e.g. providing a status of the printer of a print job during the print job.

Thus it may be appreciated that the application manager may communicate with the application or other application in a format that is independent of a specific printer e.g. that is generic with respect to all available or relevant printers within the system . In this way the application may be relieved of some or all of the burdens associated with needing knowledge of the destination printer when formulating and or sending a print job.

For example when sending the print job the application may formulate both the print data and print characteristics in the same manner regardless of whether the print job is destined for a particular identified printer or is merely identified or associated with a generic as yet undetermined printer. In fact even if the user does not currently have any registered printer associated with his or her user account the print job still may be forwarded to the cloud print service for storage and for later printing to the cloud aware printer or other printer that ultimately may be registered to the cloud print service in conjunction with the account of the user and at a time of arrival of the user at such a printer at the second location .

Thus it may be appreciated that the various APIs e.g. utilized by the application manager and or the applications may represent lightweight consistent customizable and easily implementable APIs which may be utilized in conjunction with a large number of various types of applications. Moreover such APIs may rarely if ever need to be updated or maintained by the user in order for the user to utilize the cloud print service in conjunction with a particular application. Instead such updates may be managed by an administrator or other provider of a cloud print service and or by a provider of the application so that the user is unburdened of associated efforts and responsibilities.

As referenced above such print jobs received at the application manager in the printer independent or generic format which may be specifically or generically identified with one or more printers may be passed to the format converter which may be configured to receive the print job and facilitate or execute conversion of the print job into a format associated with the designated type of printer for the print job in question. Such conversion may thus generally include as needed conversion of the print data itself as well as conversion of the print characteristics specified in conjunction with the given print job.

In more detail as is known printers generally require low level device or type specific instructions which provide a base by which printers actually apply ink to paper to achieve a desired appearance. Such instructions may therefore include very specific portrayals of the desired print outcome using e.g. a page description language PDL . For example the language postscript may be used to describe a desired print outcome which may then be rendered e.g. or rasterized by a specific printer using a print text or images. Additionally fixed layout document formats exist which are designed to facilitate device independent printing all maintaining documents available. For example the portable document format PDF is an example of such format where .PDF documents may be generated using postscript. Somewhat similarly the XML paper specification XPF provides such a fixed layout document which is based on the eXtensible markup language XML .

Thus application content or other print data may be received from the application in virtually any format including e.g. hypertext markup language HTML or in the format associated with document processing applications and or images or any PDF or XPF formats referenced above. The format converter may thus be configured to receive print data in these and any other various formats and to convert the print data into a format that is recognizable by a designated printer e.g. that is recognizable by the cloud aware printer that is designated and identified by the user upon the arrival of the user at the second location.

Similarly as referenced above the format converter may be configured to convert the print characteristics associated with the print job into a format that is recognizable by the designated printer . That is as referenced above the print characteristics may include aspects of how the print data should or can be printed i.e. based on preferences of the user and or capabilities or lack thereof of the designated printer. For example a given printer may be a black and white printer with no two sided printing abilities while a second printer may be a color printer with two sided printing. The format converter may thus provide appropriate conversion depending on a selected printer and or on preferences of the user . The format converter may then provide and execute a resulting converted print job using e.g. a protocol referred to herein as the cloud print protocol CPP . Thus the cloud print protocol allows the cloud print service to communicate with the cloud aware printer or with a legacy printer enabled to communicate with the cloud print service .

As may be appreciated from the above description the cloud print service may include job storage which may provide one or more types of data storage related to operations of the cloud print service . For example the job storage may store print jobs and related information where such print jobs information may be stored prior to and or after the format conversions provided by the format converter . For example a print job may be stored in a printer independent format in which the print job may have been received by the job submit API .

In the example of the job storage may include a virtual print queue not specifically illustrated which is specifically configured to receive and store print jobs from the device or other device and which are designated for roving printing at a time of submission of the print job e.g. when the user is not necessarily aware of a location or identify of the cloud aware printer when submitting the relevant print job. For example the user may utilize the print dialog to select the such a virtual print queue to thereby identify the associated print job within the job storage so that the user may retrieve the identified print job from the virtual print queue A upon arrival at the location of the provider .

Thus for example it may be observed that print jobs of the user may be stored in conjunction with the associated user account of or anonymous account associated with the user i.e. in the accounts . As a result print jobs may be committed to short term or long term storage so that for example the user may locate identify and re print desired print jobs even if the user later accesses the cloud print service from a different location and or using a different device than the device .

Further it may be observed that conversion of the print job at least partially occurs at separate devices from the one or more devices in which the originating application may itself be executing. In this way for example it is possible to formulate and submit a print job at least partially separately from a conversion of the print job into a printer specific format and to thereby divorce such conversion from an underlying operating system of the executing application e.g. the operating system .

Further in the example of the cloud print service of a print job router may be configured to route the converted print job from the format converter and or the job storage to a designated printer e.g. the cloud aware printer . The print job router may further be configured to monitor and mediate execution and success failure of a given print job. The print job router may thus be responsible for managing and monitoring ongoing print jobs from a plurality of users including the user which may be designated for a corresponding plurality of printers including the cloud aware printer .

As shown the print job router may include or otherwise be associated with a job fetch API and or a job control API . For example the job fetch API may be configured to provide the print job to the cloud aware printer e.g. may be used by the cloud aware printer to fetch a desired print job e.g. a print job specified from within the virtual print queue A or in other embodiments a next available print job for the cloud aware printer .

The job control API may be responsible for authorizing the cloud aware printer as needed and for receiving updated status information from the cloud aware printer e.g. whether the print job has completed or failed. Such status information also may be stored using the job storage in association with the corresponding print job in question. The job control API also may include status information including e.g. whether a print job is currently queued by not yet downloaded to a corresponding printer or spooled downloaded and added to a native printer queue of the cloud aware printer if applicable .

Thus in example scenarios associated with implementing the system of it may occur that the user arrives at a location of the provider and wishes to use the cloud aware printer . Then the provider may provide the user with a customized printer identifier for this purpose. For example as described in detail below the provider may provide the customized printer identifier as part of a purchase receipt given to the user in conjunction with consummating a business transaction sale.

The cloud print service may provide the customized printer identifier and thereafter utilize the customized printer identifier to track printer usages of the user and otherwise manage printer access rights of the user . For example the cloud print service may create an anonymous account within the accounts which is uniquely identified with the customized printer identifier but not with the user as such and which is thereafter used to provide an monitor printer access.

For example the printers may be stored as e.g. identified using a collection of Uniform Resource Locators URLs which are each uniquely identified with an individual printer registered with the cloud print service . Then the cloud print service may include a customized URL generator which is configured to generate a modified or enhanced version of the URL associated with the cloud aware printer for use as the customized printer identifier provided to the user . The resulting customized URL may have access rights embedded therein or otherwise associated therewith. In this way multiple users may be provided with access to the same cloud aware printer in a manner that is nonetheless individualized for each user.

Thereafter an access rights manager may be configured to provide printer access to the user based on the usage of the customized printer identifier by the user . For example the access rights manager may store and track a usage history which records a number of print jobs submitted a number of sheets of paper that have been printed and an identity of the cloud aware printer or other printers which have been used in conjunction with the customized printer identifier . In this regard although the usage history is illustrated separately from the accounts it may be appreciated that such illustration is merely for clarity of explanation and that in example implementations the accounts may be used to store the usage history directly.

In implementations of the system the provider may have various different criteria for assigning or otherwise providing printer access rights. Such criteria are illustrated in as access criteria . For example as referenced above and described in detail below the provider may wish to provide printer access as part of a customer reward program and may therefore define the access criteria such that customers who make a larger number of purchases more frequent purchases and or more high value purchases are provided with a greater amount of printer access rights.

For example the user may enter a retail establishment and make a large individual purchase. At the time of sale the provider may utilize the access criteria to define a quantity and quality of printer access to be afforded to the user based on the purchase and the customized URL generator may generate the customized printer identifier which the provider may then print on a receipt for the transaction.

Then the user may utilize the device to access the application or and may use the print dialog to utilize the customized printer identifier . Specifically as shown when prompted to select a printer by field e.g. drop down list A the user may enter or otherwise select the customized printer identifier in a field B. Then the access rights manager may receive the customized printer identifier identify the cloud aware printer as being associated therewith and check the accounts the usage history and or the access criteria in order to determine whether a requested print job submitted by the user is currently allowed. Additional and alternative examples of implementations of the cloud print service for providing printer access rights management are provided in more detail below or would be apparent.

In some such various example implementations the cloud aware printer may utilize various hardware software components during normal printing operations and or in conjunction with operations of the customized URL generator access rights manager . For example during execution the printer job router may be configured to communicate with e.g. a print client executing on firmware of the cloud aware printer . The print client may communicate with the cloud print service e.g. with the print job router using the cloud print protocol referenced herein.

More specifically the print client may be configured to register the cloud aware printer with the cloud print service and to thereby associate the thus registered printer with the provider . Moreover the print client may be configured to actually drive the cloud aware printer and thereby execute the desired printing.

In the example of the cloud aware printer is illustrated as including the print client within the firmware . The firmware as would be appreciated by one of skill in the art may represent factory installed hardware and or software which provides designated functions without generally requiring or allowing user modification or configuration e.g. may utilize read only memory . Thus the cloud aware printer may be preconfigured from before time of purchase to communicate and coordinate with the cloud print service to thereby provide a convenient and enjoyable user experience.

For example the cloud aware printer may include a network access manager user input and a display or other user output which may generally represent otherwise conventional components that are therefore not described here in detail except as may be needed to assist in understanding example operations of the system . Of course the cloud aware printer need not include all of the components and or may include additional or alternative components which are also not discussed here in detail.

In the example of the network access manager may represent associated hardware software which enables a cloud aware printer to communicate over the network with the cloud print service . For example such communication may be conducted wirelessly if the cloud aware printer is within range of an appropriate wireless network. In other examples the network access manager may enable a wired connection of the cloud aware printer to the network e.g. by way of connection to an appropriate router.

The user input may represent virtually any sort of keypad stylus or other input technique for entering data to the cloud aware printer . Similarly the display may represent virtually any sort of audio and or video display to output information to the user or other user of the cloud aware printer .

Thus as described herein and or as may be appreciated the various features and functions of the cloud aware printer and other features and functions not specifically illustrated may be utilized in conjunction with operations of the customized URL generator and the access rights manager . For example the display may be used to provide the customized printer identifier and or a current level of access rights e.g. remaining number of sheets that may be printed associated therewith. Similarly the user input may be used to enter the customized printer identifier identify a print job for printing and or purchase additional printer access rights among other uses.

Thus it will be appreciated that many other configurations of the cloud aware printer or other printers are contemplated for use in conjunction with the system . For example as referenced above a legacy printer not specifically illustrated in the example of may lack some of the functionality of the cloud aware printer . For example such a legacy printer may not have the network access manager and or the firmware which may be utilized to implement the print client and otherwise communicate with the cloud print service . In such cases the print client may be configured to execute on or in conjunction with a computing device which is in communication with the legacy printer and which has the available resources necessary to implement the functionalities described herein and which may include an otherwise conventional printer driver communicating with the legacy printer in question. Other variations and implementations of the printer or related printers would be apparent and are not described here in detail except as may be necessary or helpful in understanding operations of the system of

In the example of an access request for printer access rights may be received . For example the access rights manager may receive an access request from the provider for printer access rights to be provided to a third party e.g. to a consumer or other recipient of printing privileges. In other example implementations the provider or other requestor of printer access rights may desire such printing access for its own use or enjoyment.

A customized printer identifier may be generated based on the access request with the printer access rights associated therewith . For example the customized URL generator may utilize a URL associated with the cloud aware printer as determined from the database A of printers and may thereafter modify or enhance the retrieved URL with access rights specific to the received access request as determined in conjunction with use of the access criteria .

Printing may be provided in response to receipt of the customized printer identifier and in accordance with the printer access rights . For example the print job router may be configured to utilize the usage history in conjunction with one or more present or future print requests and relative to the original or updated access rights provided by way of the customized printer identifier. As referenced above and as described below the courts may be utilized to track the usage history in conjunction with the customized printer identifier so as to thereby provide accurate access accounting in a manner which may be conducted anonymously.

For example the provider as referenced above may represent a retail establishment or other business or entity which wishes to provide printing privileges for the use and enjoyment of its customers or other users. Consequently such business or other entities may have vastly different criteria for providing such printer privileges. For example the first business may wish to provide various levels of printing privileges in conjunction with additional purchases of goods or services. In other example implementations the provider may wish to implement the providing of printer access rights in conjunction with a customer loyalty or rewards program. In still other additional or alternative embodiments it may occur that the provider may wish to provide a certain minimum level of printing privileges which expire and or renew in the context of certain defined time periods and or quantity of print jobs without necessarily being correlated with purchases of goods or services.

Consequently it may be appreciated that many different scenarios may be implemented for defining and implementing the access criteria . Moreover such scenarios may be highly configurable and may easily be individualized in a manner that is desired by the provider or other users of the system with access and or administrative rights provided with respect to the access criteria .

URLs may be stored in conjunction with one or more printers . For example as illustrated and described above printers A may represent URLs which define a network location of printers such as the cloud aware printer . As referenced above during normal operations of the cloud print service users may identify specific printers to be utilized in conjunction with such URLs. For example in a simple scenario in which the cloud aware printer represents a home printer of the user the user may simply select the printer using the print dialog and the print job router may thereafter utilize the corresponding URL stored in the printer s database A to route the associated print job accordingly.

In the example of and in the context of the examples described above with respect to the system of it may be appreciated that the provider may store URLs for one or more printers to be owned and operated by the provider in conjunction with the providing of commodity printing privileges. For example an owner of many different branches or franchises of a retail establishment may purchase and install one or more printers at each such branch franchise. In these and similar scenarios the printers A may therefore store corresponding URLs which are individually associated with each such printer.

At a subsequent time a specific access request for printer access rights may be received . For example continuing the examples just referenced a retail establishment may conduct a transaction and may transmit a request for corresponding printer access rights to be granted in conjunction therewith. For example as described below with respect to a point of sale transaction conducted at such a retail establishment may include a transmission of the access request from the retail establishment to the cloud print service so that the corresponding printer access rights may be provided in conjunction with a receipt for the transaction. Further details associated with such example scenarios are described below or would be apparent.

Thus the access rights manager may receive the access request and thereafter may consult the access criteria in order to determine an appropriate level of printing privileges to be provided. For example as referenced above the access criteria may specify that larger purchases are associated with greater printing privileges then relatively smaller purchases. In examples such as those referenced above in which the printing privileges are provided in conjunction with a customer loyalty or rewards program access rights and associated printing privileges may be cumulative with respect to multiple purchases of the user at one or more associated branches franchises of the retail establishment.

Somewhat similarly it may be appreciated from the above that the printing privileges to be extended may be provided with respect to one or more specific printers. For example as referenced the provider may represent the retail establishment having multiple branches franchises any one of which may include two or more printers provided at a corresponding location. Consequently the user may be provided with printing privileges at any two or more such printers.

Thus the customized URL generator may be configured to receive the access rights determined by the access rights manager in conjunction with the access criteria so as to thereby select corresponding URLs from the printers A for subsequent generation of a corresponding customized URL with embedded access rights . That is as may be understood from the above description of the system of printers A may include a plurality of URLs which are uniquely associated with individual printers implemented in conjunction with the system . For example continuing the above described example scenarios retail establishments of the provider may be used to provide a plurality of printers and each such printer may be uniquely identified in the context of the network in conjunction with a corresponding URL. Thus the customized URL generator may be configured to utilize the stored printer URLs in conjunction with the access rights determined by the access rights manager to thereby provide a customized printer URL as the customized printer identifier to be provided to the user . Consequently as described one or more unique individual printers may nonetheless be associated with a relatively large number of individual users or classes of users so that the cloud print service may thereby provide accurate accounting for the providing of printing privileges as a commodity.

Consequently at a subsequent time the customized URL may be received in conjunction with a desired print job which is desired by the user . For example the print job router may receive the customized URL provided to the user as the customized printer identifier .

For example it may occur that the customized printer identifier is associated with the single cloud aware printer . Consequently the user may utilize the device in the application to select a document for printing by way of the print dialog . Consequently as described above with respect to and illustrated in more detail below with respect to the specific examples of the user may use the drop down list to select or otherwise identify the cloud aware printer and may use the field to provide the customized printer identifier i.e. the customized URL.

It will be appreciated that many different techniques may be utilized in the context of the print dialog for identifying the cloud aware printer for use in printing. For example the cloud aware printer may be provided with a name or other identifier printed thereon or provided by the provider in conjunction with the customized printer identifier e.g. printed on the corresponding transaction receipt . In additional or alternative examples a quick review QR code may be provided on the cloud aware printer so that if the device includes functionality for reading such QR codes the cloud aware printer may thus be identified accordingly. Of course various other examples of appropriate technologies may be utilized for identifying the cloud aware printer as such. For example near field communication NFC techniques Bluetooth techniques Infra red communications and various other techniques and associated protocols or combinations thereof may be utilized.

In still other additional or alternative implementations the user may utilize the user input and the display of the cloud aware printer itself in order to submit the customized printer identifier and otherwise utilize provided printing privileges. In such cases it may be appreciated that it may be unnecessary or less necessary for the user to identify the cloud aware printer as such. Since for example the print client and the network access manager of the cloud aware printer may be configured to identify the cloud aware printer to the cloud print service .

Upon receipt of the customized URL the print job router may communicate with the access rights manager and or the usage history and access criteria to thereby determine a current corresponding level of printing privileges which are available to the user . For example as described an anonymous or non anonymous account of the user may be maintained in accounts . Consequently as also described the usage history may track usage of printing privileges by the user over time so as to thereby provide an accounting thereof with respect to original printing privileges provided to the user .

Thus in the first instance after the initial providing of the customized printer identifier to the user the usage history for the corresponding account may indicate that no usage of printing has occurred so that provided access rights remain fully available to the user .

Consequently a print job desired by the user may be received . For example the print dialog may be utilized to submit a document of the application to the application manager for printing of the identified document in accordance with available access rights. In this regard it may be appreciated that operations are illustrated as separate sequential operations but as referenced above with respect to the operations may occur in a partially or completely overlapping or parallel fashion. For example the customized URL and print job may be received simultaneously by the application manager . Moreover similarly although the print job router and the application manager are illustrated as separate components in the example of it may be appreciated that functionality of the print job router associated with the extraction analysis and implementation of the corresponding access rights and usage history associated with the received customized URL may be implemented as part of or in conjunction with operations of the application manager and or as part of or in conjunction with operations of the access rights manager .

Thus if the requested print job is not allowed in conjunction with the corresponding access rights then the requested printing may be denied . For example if the user has been provided with printing privileges associated with the printing of a certain number of pages and the request print job exceeds the allowed number of pages then the print request may be denied. In such scenarios the user may be provided with information as to why the denial occurred. Additionally or alternatively it may occur that the customized URL is generated in conjunction with a time to live TTL after which a validity or extent of the provided printing privileges may be reduced or invalidated entirely. For example a time limit may be associated with the customized personal identifier e.g. an hour a day or a number of days after which the user may no longer be able to utilize the particular customized printer identifier . Generally multiple time limits may be provided at each of which a corresponding extent of printing privileges may be reduced.

If however the print job is allowed in accordance with available access rights then the print job router may relieve the requested print job to the printer . Afterwards it may occur that the customized URL may again be received . As a result operations may be provided in an iterative fashion until the corresponding access rights and usage history indicate that corresponding printing privileges have been exhausted.

Of course as also illustrated and described existing access rights may be enhanced or supplemented at any time. For example a supplemental access request may be received so that the corresponding customized URL with embedded access rights may be correspondingly updated . In such scenarios as may be appreciated the accounts may utilize longer running or more permanently stored account information which may be updated over time to reflect such increases in current or available printing privileges. For example as referenced above a provider may provide printing privileges in association with customer loyalty or reward programs so that the accounts B are updated in conjunction with each new purchase or other event activity which results in increased printing privileges.

Consequently illustrates an example of a receipt which may be provided to the user in conjunction with connotation of such a point of sale transaction such as for example purchase of coffee. In the example of the receipt includes information provided to the user which defines a level of printing privileges being provided e.g. you have level one printing rights as well as instructions on how to utilize a provided customized printer identifier e.g. please scan the code below to begin printing .

Thus as described above the code represents a QR code which identifies a corresponding customized URL with embedded printing access rights. As a result the user may utilize corresponding functionality of the device such as may be present on a representative Smartphone tablet or other mobile computing device to thereby scan the QR code for transmission thereof to the cloud print service .

In the simplified example of it may occur that the corresponding printer access rights are provided only with respect to the single cloud aware printer . In such scenarios it may not be necessary for the user to further identify the cloud aware printer . However as also described above it may occur that the QR code is provided with a plurality of printers provided by the provider . In such cases it may occur that the user may be further required to individually identify the cloud aware printer from among the plurality of available printers. For example as referenced above the user may be required to scan a separate QR code provided on the cloud aware printer itself or to otherwise enter a provide identification of the cloud aware printer .

Specifically as shown in the example of the user may utilize a mobile device representing the device to thereby access the cloud print service as shown by a portion of the illustrated screenshot and associated selection of a corresponding print tab. As further illustrated a portion demonstrates selection of a particular document for printing e.g. TTS Report Cover .

As further illustrated the user may perceive to select a desired printer for use in printing the identified document. As shown a portion provides the user with an instruction to scan a QR code associated with a nearby printer e.g. the cloud aware printer while a portion illustrates for the sake of example a separate printer which may be accessible to the user in conjunction with a user account of the user in an individual capacity. Thus as shown and described the user may proceed to select the cloud aware printer for printing of the document identified in section .

Specifically as shown in the example of the user may proceed to scan the QR code on the receipt and optionally a corresponding QR code of the cloud aware printer the latter being illustrated as QR code in the example of . Thus as shown in a portion the mobile device may be utilized to illustrate the customized URL associated with the desired print job and the cloud aware printer . Then an open browser button may be selected by the user to open a browser or other display window illustrating the desired document to be printed so that the user may proceed with printing thereof.

It may be appreciated that although the example of provide a number of illustrative implementations many other embodiments may be implemented as well not all of which are illustrated or described herein. For example in scenarios in which the provider provides printing privileges in conjunction with a customer loyalty or rewards program the user may be enabled to purchase printing privileges directly in conjunction therewith. The user may be provided with a customer rewards card and may update or increase a number of amount of printing privileges associated therewith in conjunction with a point of sale transaction conducted with the provider . Many other example implementations exist and would be apparent to one of skill in the art.
