This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Applications No. 10 2012 0117508 and 10 2012 0099546 filed on Oct. 22 2012 and Sep. 7 2012 respectively in the Korean Intellectual Property Office the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.

The present general inventive concept relates to a method and apparatus to manage a user account required to authenticate a user and limit usage of a device.

In a user environment a plurality of users may commonly use one device. For example a multi function peripheral MFP provided in an office may perform the operations of printing scanning faxing and copying according to requests of many users. An administrator may need to limit functions of the MFP for security purposes such as to prevent leakage of a confidential document or for management purposes. For example User A may be limited to using only printing and copying functions 100 times each and User B may be limited to using a faxing function 50 times according to the users respective responsibilities. To accomplish this firmware of the MFP may be programmed to assign 100 uses of each of the printing and copying functions to an identification ID of User A and 50 times use of the faxing function to an ID of User B.

In firmware generally an operating system and an application of the MFP are not separated but instead are realized as one piece of software. Thus if 100 uses of the printing and copying functions is to be assigned to the ID of User B firmware itself needs to be replaced. In other words it is impossible to amend only the application to assign the printing and copying functions to the ID of User B. However it is technically difficult for a user to personally change the firmware and it is time consuming and expensive for an MFP manufacturer to change the firmware.

The present general inventive concept provides an apparatus and method to manage a user account whereby a change of the user account is applied in real time while a device is operating.

The storage unit stores firmware of the apparatus . In other words the firmware installed in the apparatus is stored in the storage unit .

As shown in the firmware may include an operating system a frame work and applications . Examples of the applications include a functional application that is software for driving the functional modules of according to various purposes and a security application for providing an authentication method for performing user authentication. Moreover the storage unit of may store setting information about an authentication account setting information about an authorization account and information about a standard account mapping an authentication account and an authorization account as information about a user account.

The user interface includes an interface for receiving a predetermined command from a user. For example the user interface may include a key pad a manipulation button or a touch pad or may be an interface that can be connected to a keyboard or a mouse. Also the user interface may provide a graphic user interface GUI to the user. The user interface may include a display device for transmitting a GUI to the user as shown for example in . Alternatively the user interface may include an image output interface for providing a GUI image to an external monitor apparatus.

Referring back to the authentication account manager generates or sets at least one user authentication account based on at least one security application stored in the storage unit . When generating or setting the user authentication account the authentication account manager may generate or set the user authentication account while the operating system of is running. The apparatus operates as long as the operating system is running and when the apparatus is rebooted the operating system is stopped and starts running again.

The user authentication account is an account to identify a user and different user authentication accounts may be assigned according to different users. The user authentication account is used to identify and authenticate a user but does not include information about any rights of an authenticated user. In other words the user authentication account is an account independent from an authorization account to be described later. Accordingly the user authentication account is used to identify the user but does not include information about the rights of the user using the functional module . Information about the user authentication account may be stored in the storage unit .

The authentication account manager performs user authentication according to a setting of the user authentication account and the security application. The authentication account manager performs user authentication according to a request of the controller .

The security application stored in the storage unit provides a user authentication method for the authentication account manager to identify the user through the user authentication account. Examples of the user authentication method include a first authentication method using a barcode a second authentication method using an ID and a password a third authentication method using a fingerprint a fourth authentication method using an encoded authentication key stored in a universal serial bus USB a fifth authentication method using an iris and a sixth authentication method using a radio frequency identification RFID . The apparatus may further include first through sixth authentication modules not shown corresponding to the first through sixth authentication methods. In other words the first through sixth authentication modules may be for example a fingerprint scanner for the third authentication method and an RFID reader for the sixth authentication method.

The security application may be used at least according to each of the first through sixth authentication modules. In other words for example a second security application for the second authentication method using an ID and a password a third security application to drive a fingerprint scanner and a fourth security application for an encoded authentication key may be stored in the storage unit . Security applications to perform complex authentication methods may be stored in the storage unit . For example a security application sequentially performing the second and third authentication methods may be stored in the storage unit .

The security application may be provided to the user via a user interface GUI. shows an embodiment including three security applications through installed in the apparatus .

Referring back to security applications may be downloaded to the apparatus from an external server through the network interface . The external server may provide the security applications to the apparatus . The controller installs the downloaded security application through the network interface . The controller may also remove installed security applications. Referring to an exemplary user interface shown in security application referred to as CDR0310AAPovider is an application downloaded and installed from the external server .

In the authentication account manager selects at least one of the security applications stored in the storage unit and sets the user authentication account based on the selected security application. As shown in the authentication account manager selects any one of the security applications through based on an input of the user and sets the user authentication account.

The authentication account manager sets an authentication method with respect to the user authentication account through the security applications. For example the authentication account manager may select the second security application using an ID and a password and perform user authentication according to the ID and the password provided by the second security application. Referring to the authentication account manager may select an authentication method using both an ID and password as shown in GUI or an authentication method using only an ID as shown in GUI according to the authentication method provided by the second security application. The authentication account manager may change an ID and a password by using the second security application or set a policy regarding an input error of an ID and a password. For example when the input error of the ID or the password occurs at least three times the authentication account manager may block the corresponding user authentication account.

Alternatively for example the authentication account manager may select the fourth security application using an encoded authentication key stored in a USB and set an effective date for using the encoded authentication key. The scope of the general inventive concept is not limited to the above embodiments.

The authentication account manager may change the settings of the security application for example to switch the authentication method of the user authentication account from one security application to another security application during the runtime of the operating system of . Accordingly the first security application used for the user authentication may be changed to the second security application. Referring to the authentication account manager may change the security application that is pre installed for providing the authentication method to the security application or . Here the authentication account manager may change the authentication method without rebooting the apparatus or changing the firmware of the apparatus .

In a general image forming apparatus it is impossible to change only a setting of an application since an operating system and the application are stored together in one piece of firmware. However according to an embodiment of the present general inventive concept since the frame work acts a medium between the operating system and the applications the setting of the application may be changed or a new application may be installed even when the operating system is running.

The authentication account manager may perform remote authentication by using the external server as well as local authentication as described above. The security application of referring to SyncThruAAprovider is an application used for remote authentication by using an ID and a password. In other words the authentication account manager receives an ID and a password of the user from the user according to an authentication method of the security application of SyncThruAAprovider. Then referring to the authentication account manager transmits the ID and the password to the external server through the network interface and receives the result of user authentication from the external server .

The authorization account manager generates or sets a plurality of authorization accounts defining usage rights of the user with respect to the functional modules . The authorization account manager generates or sets the authorization accounts while the operating system is running. Information about the authorization accounts generated or set by the authorization account manager may be stored in the storage unit . The authorization account is an account independent from the user authentication account described above.

The authorization account manager may prohibit use of functional modules such as the scanning module the copying module and the faxing module aside from the printing module of the apparatus through the authorization accounts. Also the authorization account manager may set usage rights of the functional modules in detail. For example the authorization account manager may set usage rights of the printing module by allowing the account user to set sizes of printable printing papers color or mono printing single or double side printing printing resolution and a printable number of pages.

The authorization account manager may receive a selection of all or some of the functional modules from the user through a GUI shown in and receive a detailed setting value. In a usage quota is received according to functions as the detailed setting value.

Also the authorization account manager may set an ID or a password with respect to the authorization account. Since the authorization account is an account independent from the user authentication account the ID and the password set with respect to the authorization account are independent from an ID and a password of the user authentication account. illustrates an ID entry box and a password entry box of the authorization account.

When the authorization account manager sets the ID or password with respect to the authorization account a user has to input the ID or password to change the setting of the authorization account. In other words the authorization account manager may permit or prohibit access to the authorization account based on the ID or the password.

Referring back to functional applications for driving the functional modules are installed in the storage unit . Examples of the functional applications include a copying function application a printing function application a faxing function application and a scanning function application. The controller may install a new functional application in the storage unit or delete a functional application stored in the storage unit . In other words the controller downloads a new functional application through the network interface for example an application having an email transmitting function of a scanned document from the external server . Then the controller installs the downloaded functional application in the storage unit . The installing of the functional application by the controller will be described in detail later.

The controller maps at least one of the plurality of authorization accounts set by the authorization account manager based on the input of the user to the user authentication account. In other words the user interface receives a selection of at least one authorization account from the user. Then the controller maps the at least one authorization account selected by the user to the user authentication account.

If the controller maps two or more authorization accounts to one user authentication account the controller may assign priorities of the authorization accounts according to a selection of the user. In other words a first authorization account and a second authorization account may have setting values different from each other. For example the first authorization account may permit color printing and black and white printing whereas the second authorization account may permit only black and white printing. In this situation the controller may receive an input from the user to determine which setting value from among the first and second authorization accounts is to be applied first.

Likewise a predetermined authorization account may be mapped to the plurality of user authentication accounts. In this situation a plurality of users receive the same usage right. When the authorization account manager changes a setting value of the predetermined authorization account the usage rights of the users are changed en bloc.

The controller stores the result of mapping in the storage unit as a standard account. In other words the standard account is an account in which the user authentication account and the authorization account are mapped to each other. In the standard account the user authentication account and the authorization account may be independently set or changed. The standard account associates a plurality of IDs and passwords when the authentication account manager performs user authentication by using an ID and a password with respect to the user authentication account and the authorization account manager also set an ID and a password for the authorization account.

The controller may receive a selection of the user regarding the using of the standard account through the user input and output interface . Referring to the exemplary GUI shown in the standard account is activated when the user selects Enable and is deactivated when the user selects Disable . When the standard account is deactivated the apparatus may include information about usage rights in the user authentication account.

The controller reflects the result of mapping i.e. the user authentication method according to the standard account and the information about the usage rights for execution of the applications without stopping running of the operating system . In other words while the operating system is running the controller permits or prohibits the execution of the applications through the frame work between the operating system and the applications .

In detail the controller requests the authentication account manager to perform user authentication through the user authentication account. The authentication account manager transmits the result of the user authentication to the controller . In other words the authentication account manager determines whether the user authentication has succeeded or failed through the authentication account manager . When the user authentication has failed the controller provides a message notifying the failure through the user interface . When the user authentication has succeeded the controller analyzes setting of the authorization account mapped to the user authentication account through the information about the standard account stored in the storage unit .

Then the controller determines whether to permit an execution of an application. The controller receives a list of the functional modules usable by the functional applications from the functional applications. Based on the list the controller determines whether to permit the execution of the functional application through the authorization account.

For example in an exemplary embodiment a predetermined authorization account may have the following settings allowed an A4 size double side printing black and white printing and a scanning function. shows an exemplary list of application requests received from a user having an authentication account mapped to the predetermined authorization account. The controller determines to permit execution of the third item with respect to the predetermined authorization account status. On the other hand the controller prohibits execution of the first and second items with respect to the predetermined authorization account status.

In the controller installs the downloaded application through the network interface . The installed application may be a security application or a functional application. The controller may determine whether the downloaded application is suitable to be installed in the apparatus and installs the downloaded application according to a determination result. For example when a function performed by the downloaded application is not included in the functional module included in the apparatus the apparatus determines that the downloaded application is not suitable to be installed. Alternatively the controller determines whether the downloaded application is executable on the frame work . In other words the controller determines whether the downloaded application is suitable to be installed based on whether the downloaded application is generated by an application programming interface API provided by the frame work .

Furthermore the controller may obtain the list of functional modules required to execute a new application and determine whether to permit execution of the new application according to authorization accounts stored in the storage unit based on the list.

The operating system directly drives hardware of the apparatus according to requests of the applications . For example when a printing request is received from the applications the operating system drives a printing module from among the functional modules .

As described above the applications include functional applications and security applications. The functional applications are applications for performing operations by using the functional modules of the apparatus . The security applications are applications providing user authentication methods. The applications may be deleted installed or changed while the operating system is running. The applications use an API provided by the frame work . The applications transmit and receive data to and from the operating system through the frame work .

The frame work is a medium between the operating system and the applications . In other words the frame work arbitrates data exchange between the operating system and the applications . Operations requested by the applications are translated into programming languages readable by the operating system through the frame work . The frame work may install delete or change the applications without stopping the operating system . The frame work may include a first frame work and a second frame work . The first frame work uses an open type frame work and the second frame work more suitable to the apparatus may be built on the open type frame work. The first and second frame works and will now be described in detail with reference to .

In open service gateway initiative OSGi denotes the first frame work and a block denotes the second frame work . The block includes an authentication account manager an authorization account manager and a standard account manager .

The OSGi is a JavaScript based open type frame work and supports functions of remotely installing starting stopping and updating an application during a runtime. In the embodiment shown in the OSGi is a first frame work but the present general inventive concept is not limited thereto.

The block is a frame work built on the OSGi . The authentication account manager authorization account manager and standard account manager respectively correspond to the authentication account manager authorization account manager and controller of the apparatus of .

The authentication account manager may install delete and change the security applications and even during the runtime of the operating system . The authentication account manager performs user authentication through the setting of the user authentication accounts and the security applications and .

The authorization account manager generates or sets the authorization accounts described above. The authorization account manager generates or sets the authorization accounts while the operating system is running.

The standard account manager generates and sets standard accounts by mapping the user authentication accounts generated and set by the authentication account manager and the authorization accounts generated and set by the authorization account manager . The standard account manager may map a plurality of user authentication accounts to one authorization account or a plurality of authorization accounts to one user authentication account. The standard account manager uses a user authentication method according to the standard account and information about usage rights to execution of the applications while the operating system is running. The standard account manager requests the authentication account manager to perform user authentication through the user authentication account. The standard account manager receives the result of user authentication from the authentication account manager . When the user authentication has failed the standard account manager does not perform an operation requested by the user. When the user authentication has succeeded the standard account manager determines the user authentication account used for user authentication and the mapped authorization account. The standard account manager determines whether to perform the operation requested by the user based on a list provided by first through third functional applications through and the setting of the authorization account.

Referring to first in operation S the apparatus sets a plurality of authorization accounts defining usage rights regarding functions of the apparatus . In other words the apparatus generates or sets the authorization accounts defining usage rights regarding the functional modules while the operating system is running. The generated or set authorization accounts may be stored in the apparatus . The apparatus may receive a selection of all or some of the functional modules from the user through the GUI of and may receive detailed setting values as described above. In the limitations are received according to functions as detailed setting values of the functions. The apparatus may set an ID or a password with respect to the authorization account. Since the authorization account is an account independent from a user authentication account the ID or password set with respect to the authorization account is independent from an ID or password of the user authentication account. illustrates the ID entry box and the password entry box of the authorization account.

Then in operation S the apparatus maps at least one of the authorization accounts to one or more user authentication accounts based on an input of the user.
