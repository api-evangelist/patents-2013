title: On-demand custom entitlement cards for products and services
abstract: An entitlement card can be assigned a product key real-time to provide a custom order of benefits including product and/or service, amount, and time. A method facilitating product key assignment for an entitlement can include receiving a request for activating a custom entitlement product key from, for example, a point of purchase. The request includes a request for particular benefits to a redeemer, including the particular product and/or service to be provided and the quantity and time period for the product and/or service. The method further includes assigning the benefits to the product key at the time of the request and activating the product key, which may be later redeemed for the assigned benefits.

As software products are moving from a perpetual license tied to a single machine or being on premise to online subscription services that are associated with a particular user or tenant there becomes a need for infrastructure to support sales outside of online channels license management and purchase paradigms. Entitlement cards and or associated token keys or tokens provide a way to purchase or license software products through retail outlets as well as multitier distribution channels.

Presently entitlement cards are generated for a specific service or product and for a specific amount of licenses and time . For example an entitlement card to a productivity suite of products such as MICROSOFT OFFICE365 may be in the form of one license for one year for a specified cost or in the form of multiple licenses at intervals of 5 25 and 50 licenses for one year for a specified cost.

Customizable entitlement cards and systems for implementing custom entitlement cards are described. An entitlement card may function as the packaging of a token providing permission to access a service or product. As described in detail herein a product key or token which may be embodied in the form of an entitlement card is assigned an offer on demand such as at the point of sale .

The offer includes a product or service quantity or number of licenses and a period of time. An entitlement card can be assigned a product key real time to provide a custom order of product and or service amount and time. The preset and bundled offers of traditional entitlement cards can be replaced with custom offers that enable a service or product provider to activate custom entitlements from a single token.

Tokens a license product key can be assigned to an offer at the time of activation to provide a custom order of product time and number of licenses or subscriptions. A non assigned token may be associated with an entitlement card. At a point of purchase the entitlement card is configurable on activation and assignment of a custom offer to the token so that a custom offer may be redeemed.

A method for managing tokens includes receiving a request for activating a custom entitlement card where the request includes product time and or subscriptions quantity. Once the token management system receives the request the token management system can assign a token an offer corresponding to the request.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Entitlement cards systems for implementing entitlement cards and methods of managing user licenses and terms in an online service are described.

Certain embodiments contemplate using entitlement cards through offline and online retailers to sell subscriptions for online services. The entitlement cards provide product keys for an entitlement. According to various embodiments the entitlements to which the described entitlement cards are directed involve subscriptions to an online service. As described in detail herein each entitlement card is configurable on activation so that a custom offer may be redeemed.

A customer can take the entitlement card having the product key and redeem a requested product from the online service to obtain or renew a subscription to the online service. Using the software as a service model the online service subscription is associated with a user or organization account and not a device package or product key.

Entitlement cards of certain implementations generally involve a substrate on which a product key or token is disposed. The substrate may be a card box paper or other physical implement on which a product key is readable. The product key may be human readable by being printed or stamped or machine readable such as by magnetic strip or radio frequency transmission . In some cases a product key can be provided to a customer in a form that is not on a physical card or substrate. For example the product key may be sent to a customer in a message email or by some other form of communication. Thus an entitlement card may be a physical card or a metaphor used to describe a key in a manner understandable by a human user and the terms token s product key s key s and entitlement card s may be used interchangeably herein.

Gift Cards prepaid cards and other entitlement cards are commonly sold in retail outlets as well as through multitier distribution channels. Unless a gift card is for the retail outlet where the point of sale is occurring gift cards for third party products or services are sold at designated values. Presently a service or product provider receives prepaid cards for a specific service or product and designated amount and time . This limits the service or product provider to only a few combinations for product service and amounts due to for example limited shelf space at a retail outlet for multiple card values and related products and the operational difficulties in generating cards with all permutations that may be desired by a customer.

Often to address the limited shelf space and operational difficulties with generating all potential permutations the service or product provider defines predefined bundles. For example entitlement cards to a 1 license pack a 5 license pack a 25 license pack and a 50 license pack of a given service or software product are generated. These entitlement cards tend to be specific to each service or product offered through this business model. This solution however pushes the complexity to the customer. If a customer wants 66 licenses of the service or product then they will need to buy one 50 license card three 5 license cards and one 1 license card. Then to redeem the 66 licenses of a service or product the customer enters 5 different tokens.

On demand custom entitlement cards are provided that enable a service or product provider to activate custom entitlements from a single token and in some cases provide both a product and a service using a single token . That is the entitlement associated with a token may be assigned at the time of purchase and allows for the service or product as well as the licenses e.g. quantity to be variables. Thus when the customer buys 66 licenses of a specific service or product the token is assigned in real time at the service or product provider. And the customer gets 1 card for 66 licenses for that particular service or product.

The redemption of an entitlement card and its product key as described herein may be applicable to any form of conveying to a customer the product that they purchased and its corresponding product key to enable redemption of the online service or product.

Once purchased the entitlement card represents an offer term for a specified number of user licenses for a subscription to a specified online service or product for a specified period of time. For example an entitlement card may be a 1 year subscription to an online service for 1 user a 1 year 1 user subscription . Until purchase or benefit request an entitlement card or token may be unassigned.

Although an entitlement card of certain embodiments may have a monetary value associated with it the entitlement card of certain embodiments is not redeemable for money or points or other form of credit is not used to store credit and is not reloadable. Rather the entitlement card for online services represents a subscription for one or more specified user licenses or products . As opposed to a gift card that has cash value assigned at the point of purchase an entitlement card of various implementations can have a non cash value benefit of a product service time period and amount assigned at the point of purchase. That is a customer can purchase an entitlement and the benefit remains until it is used regardless of the change in price over time should the cost of the benefits increase before the entitlements are redeemed.

By virtue of assigning the benefits or goods due to customer the price of the benefits may vary or change in the future but those benefits remain the same. To illustrate this point a customer may purchase an entitlement card activate a token for 10 for one license of one product. In the case where the customer waits to redeem the entitlement for example for 2 years the benefit remains even if the price has increased. That is when the customer redeems the entitlement the customer receives the one license of the one product regardless of the new cost.

Further the benefits of the entitlement may be specified at the time of purchase without limitations from pre assigned tokens.

Implementations separate the token activation quantity assignment and service or product assignment from the generating and distribution process of tokens associated with an entitlement.

According to certain implementations token activation quantity assignment and service assignment is made available at the time of purchase. The token may be inactive and not assigned a benefit until the time of purchase. Moreover the token may not be previously assigned to a particular product or service facilitating the use of a token for virtually any product or service .

An application programming interface API can be provided to enable token activation and dynamic assignment of the quantity and particular service or product desired by a customer. Subsequent to activation a customer may redeem the entitlements and receive the specified quantity and service or product.

The order management system can receive the request including information regarding desired product s amount and length of time as non limiting options . The order management system activates the card and assigns the requested benefits to the token or other unique key in the system. Instead of pre assigned benefits that a customer purchases at the point of sale implementations enable a per card assignment when customer expresses their desire for a particular benefit. Once assigned the order management system can inform the point of sale that the card is activated and the customer can receive a custom entitlement card that can be redeemed for the requested benefits.

In some implementations the order management system may be embodied as part of a cloud service or a web service for facilitating entitlement card customization and token activation.

The cloud or web services for facilitating entitlement card customization and token activation including the order management system may be implemented using one or more physical and or virtual servers communicating over a network. The network can include but is not limited to a cellular network e.g. wireless phone a point to point dial up connection a satellite network the Internet a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN a WiFi network an ad hoc network or a combination thereof. Such networks are widely used to connect various types of network elements such as hubs bridges routers switches servers and gateways. The network may include one or more connected networks e.g. a multi network environment including public networks such as the Internet and or private networks such as a secure enterprise private network. Access to the network may be provided via one or more wired or wireless access networks as will be understood by those skilled in the art.

A cloud service generally refers to hosted services providing scalable processing and storage capabilities. Cloud computing may often include virtualized resources. The resources presented by cloud computing are in themselves provided as a service where cloud computing customers rent usage of resources from a third party provider that owns the physical infrastructure. A client organization that is served by a cloud service and shares resources controlled or managed by the cloud service with other client organizations can be referred to as a tenant.

Web services can be provided and or hosted by a cloud service e.g. as part of a large scale distributed computing environment . A web service is a software system that supports interoperable machine to machine interaction over a network and enables software to connect to other software applications.

A web service provides a collection of technological standards and protocols. For example a web service provides functions that may be implemented by a software or hardware agent that sends and receives messages e.g. the computing platforms requesting and providing a particular service . Applications can access web services via ubiquitous web protocols and data formats such as hypertext transfer protocol HTTP XML JavaScript Object Notation JSON Representational state transfer REST protocols and SOAP originally an acronym for simple object access protocol .

A point of sale device may access the order management system via one or more of the web protocols and data formats described above.

Based on the request the system can assign the requested benefits to the custom entitlement product key and activating the custom entitlement product key . In some cases the assignment of the benefits can activate the key.

After the custom entitlement product key is activated a redeemer the customer or another person may redeem the benefits through any suitable channel. For example the redeemer may access an online service portal e.g. via a web browser for the product and or service to which the entitlement is directed. From the portal the redeemer may enter the product key information and redeem the benefits.

Referring to a customer may obtain a custom entitlement card at a kiosk . The customer may enter information regarding a custom benefit of a service and or product via the kiosk which may present a user interface for ease of purchase . The kiosk can call e.g. using a token activation API an order management system with a request for a token or other form of product key and that the token be activated with the benefits that the customer entered via the kiosk user interface. If the Kiosk has a database of inactive tokens then the request to the token management system may be to activate one of the inactive tokens and assign the benefit to that token. The token management system can provide an active token or activate a token that is associated with the requested benefits and the kiosk can vend an entitlement card with the active token that is associated with the requested benefits. In some cases the kiosk may email or text the token to the customer.

Referring to a customer may obtain a custom entitlement card or product key via a call center . The customer may call the call center by phone cellular or voice over IP and speak with a representative or an automated service to provide information regarding a requested custom benefit of a service and or product. The call center can communicate e.g. via the token activation API with the order management system with a request for a token or other form of product key and that the token be activated with the benefits that the customer requested by phone.

If the call center has a database of inactive tokens then the request to the token management system may be to activate one of the inactive tokens and assign the benefit to that token. The token management system can provide an active token or activate a token that is associated with the requested benefits. The representative at the call center can inform the customer of the token information by phone text email or mail and may even mail an entitlement card which may be an electronic or physical card .

In some cases the customer may have purchased or received an entitlement card with an inactive token. In one such case the customer may provide the inactive token information to the call center which then provides the inactive token information to the token management system to have that token assigned to the requested benefits. The token management system can activate the token and the customer s entitlement card can be considered activated and available for redemption.

Referring to a customer may obtain a custom entitlement card or product key via an online retailer . The customer may access the online retailer via a web browser or other application on a computing device to provide information regarding a requested custom benefit of a service and or product. The online retailer can communicate e.g. server to server via the token activation API with the order management system with a request for a token or other form of product key and that the token be activated with the benefits that the customer requested.

If the online retailer has a database of inactive tokens then the request to the token management system may be to activate one of the inactive tokens and assign the benefit to that token. The token management system can provide an active token or activate a token that is associated with the requested benefits. The online retailer can inform the customer of the token information by displaying the information at the customer s computing device or send the information by phone text email or mail and may even mail an entitlement card which may be an electronic or physical card .

In some cases the customer may have purchased or received an entitlement card with an inactive token. In one such case the customer may provide the inactive token information to the online retailer which then provides the inactive token information to the token management system to have that token assigned to the requested benefits. The token management system can activate the token and the customer s entitlement card can be considered activated and available for redemption.

Referring to a customer may be at a retail store and selected an entitlement card in the form of a gift card or other packaging. At a sales terminal the customer may present the inactive entitlement card to be activated. The customer can indicate desired benefits and those benefits may be activated and associated with the card by the sales terminal. The card may be swiped or otherwise have its inactive token information obtained. Then a request from the sales terminal to the order management system may be accomplished for example via a token activation API where the request includes the token information and the benefits information requested by the customer. The order management system can return an indication that the entitlement card is activated for the requested benefits and the customer can receive the entitlement card with the now active token.

In general various implementations involve generating and distributing tokens in inactive state exposing APIs for token activation along with dynamic assignment of quantity service or product desired by the customer on behalf of other customer and allowing customer or someone on behalf of the customer to redeem token for service or product and quantity purchased.

Referring to the process flow diagram shown in tokens may be generated. This process is also referred to as minting because the token generator creates number and or letter keys. Once generated the generated tokens may be imported step into a token management system in an inactive state. In addition to being imported into the token management system in the inactive state the same tokens are sent to a token distribution system for distribution step to the customers directly or to distributors and resellers who can purchase tokens on behalf of the customer. Although importation and distribution are shown with numerals and these steps may be carried out in parallel. In some cases the distribution may even occur at the point of sale e.g. with step .

Implementations of the entitlement cards enable a customer or a distributor or reseller on behalf of the customer to purchase a product key in the form of a token step and specify the benefits they would like to associate with the token. The platform of the product key may be an entitlement card.

According to the implementation illustrated in the service number of subscriptions and length of time may all be independently set at the time of purchase as opposed to having preset entitlement values.

The Token distribution system then activates the token step via the token management system to associate the service and the quantity and length of time requested by the customer with the token in the token management system . The token management system can return a success or error code step back to the token distribution system .

Upon successful activation of the token indicated in step the token distribution system returns the token step to the customer . This token is now associated with the benefit e.g. service quantity time and the like requested by the customer or distributor or reseller acting on behalf of the customer .

The customer or distributor or reseller action on behalf of the customer now in possession of an active token may redeem the token step at a service or product purchase system . The service or product purchase system may be available through an online portal. The person redeeming a token may access the service or product purchase system through the online portal.

The service or product purchase system in turn redeems the token step from the token management system . Upon successful redemption the token management system returns the benefit information step that was earlier used when the token was activated in steps . In addition once the indication of activation of the associated benefit is received the service or product purchase system routes step the request to the appropriate service provider along with the quantity and any other parameter associated with the token. The service provider provisions the service step for the given quantity of licenses. The purchase system then returns step the service instance back to the customer to use as per the specifications of the service. The customer now has access to the requested benefit.

Similar to that described with respect to for the environment shown in tokens may be generated for example by a token generator and imported into a token management system in an inactive state step . In addition to being imported into the token management system in the inactive state the same tokens are sent to a token distribution system for distribution step to the customers directly or to distributors and resellers who can purchase tokens on behalf of the customer. Although importation and distribution are shown with numerals and these steps may be carried out in parallel. In some cases the distribution may even occur at the point of sale e.g. with step .

A customer or distributor or reseller on behalf of the customer may purchase a product key in the form of a token step and specify the benefits they would like associated with the token. The platform of the product key may be an entitlement card.

According to the implementation illustrated in the product amount and time if provided as a subscription or as a periodic distribution of a consumable item such as a magazine may all be independently set at the time of purchase as opposed to having preset entitlement values.

The Token distribution system then activates the token step via the token management system to associate the product and the quantity and time requested by the customer with the token in the token management system . The token management system can return a success or error code step back to the token distribution system .

Upon successful activation of the token indicated in step the token distribution system returns the token step to the customer . This token is now associated with the benefit e.g. product quantity time and the like requested by the customer or distributor or reseller acting on behalf of the customer .

The customer or distributor or reseller action on behalf of the customer now in possession of an active token may redeem the token step at a service or product purchase system . The service or product purchase system may be available through an online portal. The person redeeming a token may access the service or product purchase system through the online portal.

The service or product purchase system in turn redeems the token step from the token management system . Upon successful redemption the token management system returns the associated benefit step that was earlier used when the token was activated in steps . In addition once the indication of activation of the associated benefit is received the service or product purchase system routes step the request to the appropriate product provider along with the quantity associated with the token. The product provider allows access to the product step for the quantity specified in the request. The purchase system then returns step the product details back to the customer to use as per the specifications of the service or product. The customer now has access to the requested benefit.

For the example shown in a similar process is carried out whereby tokens may be generated for example by a token generator and imported into a token management system in an inactive state step . In addition to being imported into the token management system in the inactive state the same tokens can be sent to a token distribution system for distribution step to the customers directly or to distributors and resellers who can purchase tokens on behalf of the customer. Although importation and distribution are shown with numerals and these steps may be carried out in parallel. In some cases the distribution may even occur at the point of sale e.g. with step .

A customer or distributor or reseller on behalf of the customer may purchase a product key in the form of a token step and specify the benefits they would like associated with the token. The platform of the product key may be an entitlement card.

According to the implementation illustrated in a single token may be obtained for both a product and a service as well as specified corresponding quantities and time .

The Token distribution system then activates the token step via the token management system to associate the requested product and service with the token in the token management system . The token management system can return a success or error code step back to the token distribution system .

Upon successful activation of the token indicated in step the token distribution system returns the token step to the customer . This token is now associated with the benefit e.g. service product quantity time and the like requested by the customer or distributor or reseller acting on behalf of the customer .

The customer or distributor or reseller action on behalf of the customer now in possession of an active token may redeem the token step at a service or product purchase system . The service or product purchase system may be available through an online portal. The person redeeming a token may access the service or product purchase system through the online portal.

The service or product purchase system in turn redeems the token step from the token management system . Upon successful redemption the token management system returns a validation of the associated benefit step that was earlier used when the token was activated in steps . In addition once the indication of activation of the associated benefit is received the service or product purchase system routes step the request to the appropriate product provider A and service provider B . The product provider A allows access to the product step for the quantity specified in the request and the service provider B provisions the service step for the given quantity of licenses. The purchase system then returns step the service instance and the product details back to the customer to use as per the specifications of the service or product. The customer now has access to the requested benefit.
