Certain embodiments of the disclosure relate to application permissions on devices. More specifically certain embodiments of the disclosure relate to a method and system for splitting application permissions on devices.

A data processing device such as for example a smart phone a mobile phone a tablet and or other computing device may comprise one or more applications downloaded onto and running on the data processing device. When an application is downloaded onto the data processing device for example from an application distribution server or an application processing device the application may list what usage permissions or privileges that are required for the application running on the device. In some instances some of the required permissions may be associated with some components e.g. other applications that the application relies on or coupled to and may not be required by the application itself.

Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional and traditional approaches will become apparent to one of skill in the art through comparison of such systems with the present disclosure as set forth in the remainder of the present application with reference to the drawings.

Aspects of the present disclosure are directed to a method and system for splitting application permissions on devices. In various embodiments of the disclosure a data processing device may comprise one or more applications downloaded onto and running on the data processing device. The data processing device may determine that a particular application being downloaded onto the data processing device is coupled to one or more other applications. The data processing device may cause display of a set of required usage permissions where the set of required usage permissions may comprise one or more required usage permissions associated with the particular application itself and one or more required permissions for using the corresponding one or more other applications. In this regard the data processing device may cause display of a separate set of required usage permissions associated with each of the one or more other applications.

Various advantages aspects and novel features of the present disclosure as well as details of an illustrated embodiment thereof will be more fully understood from the following description and drawings.

Certain embodiments of the disclosure can be found in a method and system for splitting application permissions on devices. Certain specific details are set forth in the following description and in drawings to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the disclosure. Additional embodiments of the present disclosure may be practiced without several of the details described in the following description.

As utilized herein and or means any one or more of the items in the list joined by and or . As an example x and or y means any element of the three element set x y x y . As another example x y and or z means any element of the seven element set x y z x y x z y z x y z . As utilized herein the terms e.g. and for example set off lists of one or more non limiting examples instances or illustrations. As utilized herein a device module circuitry etc. is operable to perform a function whenever the device module circuitry etc. comprises the necessary hardware and code if any is necessary to perform the function regardless of whether performance of the function is disabled or not enabled by some user configurable setting.

In various embodiments of the disclosure a data processing device may be operable to determine that a particular application being downloaded onto the data processing device may be coupled to one or more other applications. The data processing device may be operable to cause display of a set of required usage permissions where the set of required usage permissions may comprise one or more required usage permissions associated with the particular application itself and one or more required permissions for using the corresponding one or more other applications. In this regard the data processing device may be operable to cause display of a separate set of required usage permissions associated with each of the one or more other applications.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure in instances when the particular application and a first one or more of the coupled one or more other applications are being downloaded onto the data processing device at the same time the data processing device may be operable to cause the display of the set of required usage permissions and the display of the separate set of required usage permissions associated with each of the first one or more of the coupled one or more other applications at the same time.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure a second one or more of the coupled one or more other applications may have been downloaded onto the data processing device or may have been installed as base features in the data processing device before the particular application is downloaded. In such instances the data processing device may be operable to cause the display of the separate set of required usage permissions associated with each of the second one or more of the coupled one or more other applications when each of the second one or more of the coupled one or more other applications is first downloaded onto the data processing device or installed as a base feature in the data processing device. In this regard when the particular application is being downloaded onto the data processing device the data processing device may operable to cause display of at least the set of required usage permissions without the display of the separate set of required usage permissions associated with each of the second one or more of the coupled one or more other applications.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the particular application may comprise for example a calculator application and one of the coupled one or more other applications may comprise for example an advertisement application programming interface API . In this regard the set of required usage permissions for the calculator application may comprise for example a required permission for using a display module and a required permission for invoking the advertisement API. The separate set of required usage permissions associated with the advertisement API may comprise for example required permissions for using a location service accessing contact information and or accessing Internet.

The processor may comprise suitable logic circuitry interfaces and or code that may be operable to process data or signals. The processor may be operable to manage and or control operations of various components or modules in the data processing device such as for example the display module the permission control module and or the GNSS module . The processor may utilize an operating system OS that enables the execution of various applications such as the applications .

The memory may comprise suitable logic circuitry interfaces and or code that may be operable to store information such as executable instructions and or data that may be utilized by the processor and or other modules or components in the data processing device . The memory may comprise RAM ROM low latency nonvolatile memory such as flash memory and or other suitable electronic data storage.

The display module may comprise suitable logic circuitry interfaces and or code that may be operable to display or present processed content to a user. The display module may be integrated within or operatively coupled to the data processing device for example. The display module may comprise for example a presence sensitive screen such as a touchscreen or touch sensitive screen.

The permission control module may comprise suitable logic circuitry interfaces and or code that may be operable to perform usage permissions control and or management for the applications running on the data processing device . For example when a particular application such as the application is being downloaded onto the data processing device the permission control module may be operable to cause display of required usage permissions for the particular application at the display module for a user of the data processing device to review. In an example embodiment of the disclosure the particular application being downloaded onto the data processing device may be coupled to another application such as the application . For example the particular application may comprise the application as a component that it relies on. In such instances the permission control module may be operable to split the display of the required usage permissions in such a way that a first set of the required usage permissions is associated with the particular application itself and a second set of the required usage permissions is associated with the coupled application for example. In this regard the first set of the required usage permissions may comprise a required permission for using the application

The GNSS module may comprise suitable logic circuitry interfaces and or code that may be operable to provide location services for the data processing device . The GNSS module may be operable to detect and receive GNSS signals or data from a plurality of visible GNSS satellites. The received GNSS signals may be utilized by the GNSS module to calculate navigation information such as a position fix and or velocity of the GNSS module for example. The GNSS module may comprise for example a global positioning system GPS unit.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure an application such as the application may require usage of a location service for the application running on the data processing device . In such instances the GNSS module and or other mechanisms e.g. by proximity to certain wireless hotspots or cell phone towers may be utilized to provide the location service for the application

In operation one or more of the applications may be downloaded onto and running on the data processing device . The permission control module may be operable to determine that a particular application such as the application being downloaded onto the data processing device may be coupled to one or more other applications such as the application . The permission control module may be operable to cause display of a set of required usage permissions at the display module where the set of required usage permissions may comprise one or more required usage permissions associated with the particular application itself and one or more required permissions for using the corresponding one or more other applications e.g. the application . In this regard the permission control module may be operable to cause display of a separate set of required usage permissions associated with each of the one or more other applications e.g. the application . The separate set of required usage permissions may be displayed either before the particular application is downloaded or at the same time as the particular application is downloaded.

In an example operation the particular application and the application may be being downloaded onto the data processing device at the same time. The permission control module in the data processing device may be operable to determine that the particular application may be coupled to the application e.g. the application may be a component application that the particular application relies on . The permission control module may be operable to cause display of a set of required usage permissions for the application and display of a separate set of required usage permissions for the coupled application at the display module in the data processing device at the same time. In this regard the set of required usage permissions may comprise one or more required usage permissions associated with the particular application itself plus a required permission for using the coupled application

In this scenario for example the particular application may comprise a calculator application and the coupled application may comprise for example an advertisement API application an advertisement may be shown within the calculator application . In such instances the set of required usage permissions for the calculator application may comprise for example a required permission for using the display module and a required permission for invoking the advertisement API . The separate set of usage permissions for the advertisement API may comprise for example required permissions for using a location service such as provided by the GNSS module in the data processing device accessing contact information or list and or accessing Internet. In this regard for example a user who reviews the usage permissions for the downloaded calculator application may notice that the calculator application itself may not need location information contact information or Internet access. However the advertisement API may need these extra permissions such as for example the location information e.g. a GPS location and the Internet access to be able to fetch the advertisement. For example the location information may be used for showing geographically relevant advertisements to the user or for excluding showing of certain lawfully prohibited items in certain locations. For example the contact information may be used for advertisement sharing or recommendation via for example a social network.

In an example operation the application e.g. an advertisement API application may have been downloaded onto the data processing device or may have been installed as a base feature in the data processing device before the particular application e.g. a calculator application is downloaded. When the application is first downloaded onto the data processing device or is first installed as a base feature in the data processing device the permission control module in the data processing device may be operable to cause display of a set of required usage permissions e.g. permissions for using a location service such as provided by the GNSS module accessing contact information and or accessing Internet associated with the application at the display module in the data processing device . When the particular application is later being downloaded onto the data processing device the permission control module may be operable to determine that the particular application may be coupled to the application . The permission control module may then be operable to cause display of a set of required usage permissions e.g. permissions for using the display module and invoking the advertisement API associated with the particular application at the display module without the display of the set of required usage permissions associated with the coupled application . In this scenario a user who reviews the usage permissions for the downloaded particular application e.g. the calculator application may notice that the particular application may use another application e.g. the advertisement API which may itself already comprise a set of granted usage permissions.

In various embodiments of the disclosure a permission control module in a data processing device may be operable to determine that a particular application or being downloaded onto the data processing device may be coupled to one or more other applications such as the application or . The permission control module may be operable to cause display of a set of required usage permissions or at a display module in the data processing device where the set of required usage permissions or may comprise one or more required usage permissions associated with the particular application or itself and one or more required permissions for using the corresponding one or more other applications e.g. the application or . In this regard the permission control module may be operable to cause display of a separate set of required usage permissions or associated with each of the one or more other applications e.g. the application or at the display module .

In instances when the particular application and a first one or more of the coupled one or more other applications e.g. the application are being downloaded onto the data processing device at the same time the permission control module may be operable to cause the display of the set of required usage permissions and the display of the separate set of required usage permissions associated with each of the first one or more of the coupled one or more other applications e.g. the application at the same time.

A second one or more of the coupled one or more other applications e.g. the application may have been downloaded onto the data processing device or may have been installed as base features in the data processing device before the particular application is downloaded. In such instances the permission control module may be operable to cause the display of the separate set of required usage permissions associated with each of the second one or more of the coupled one or more other applications e.g. the application when each of the second one or more of the coupled one or more other applications e.g. the application is first downloaded onto the data processing device or installed as a base feature in the data processing device . In this regard when the particular application is being downloaded onto the data processing device the permission control module may operable to cause display of at least the set of required usage permissions without the display of the separate set of required usage permissions associated with each of the second one or more of the coupled one or more other applications e.g. the application .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the particular application or may comprise for example a calculator application and one of the coupled one or more other applications e.g. the application or may comprise for example an advertisement API. In this regard the set of required usage permissions or for the calculator application or may comprise for example a required permission for using a display module and a required permission for invoking the advertisement API or . The separate set of required usage permissions or associated with the advertisement API or may comprise for example required permissions for using a location service e.g. provided by a GNSS module in the data processing device and or other mechanisms accessing contact information and or accessing Internet.
