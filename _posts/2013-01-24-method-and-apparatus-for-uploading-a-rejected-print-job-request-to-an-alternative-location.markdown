The present disclosure relates generally to managing print job requests in a managed print environment and more particularly to a method and an apparatus for uploading a rejected print job to an alternative location.

In a managed print environment some documents may be rejected due to a violation of a print rule. Currently if the print job request is rejected the user has no alternative options at the time of the print job request to get a soft copy or a hard copy of the printed document.

The user may try and wait to print out a document when the user arrives home on his or her personal computer and printer. However some documents may only be available for a fixed time period. As a result if the user is unable to print the document at the time of the print job request the document may be lost forever if the user waits until the user arrives home to print the document.

According to aspects illustrated herein there are provided a method a non transitory computer readable medium and an apparatus for uploading a rejected print job request to an alternative location. One disclosed feature of the embodiments is a method that receives a print job request in a managed print environment determines that the print job request violates a rule for printing in the managed print environment displays a print job pop up dialogue that indicates that the print job request has been rejected wherein the print job pop up dialogue provides one or more alternative locations to upload the print job request receives a selection of one of the one or more alternative locations to upload the print job request converts the print job request into an electronic document and uploads the electronic document to the one of the one or more alternative locations that was selected.

Another disclosed feature of the embodiments is a non transitory computer readable medium having stored thereon a plurality of instructions the plurality of instructions including instructions which when executed by a processor cause the processor to perform a method that receives a print job request in a managed print environment determines that the print job request violates a rule for printing in the managed print environment displays a print job pop up dialogue that indicates that the print job request has been rejected wherein the print job pop up dialogue provides one or more alternative locations to upload the print job request receives a selection of one of the one or more alternative locations to upload the print job request converts the print job request into an electronic document and uploads the electronic document to the one of the one or more alternative locations that was selected.

Another disclosed feature of the embodiments is an apparatus comprising a processor that is configured to receive a print job request in a managed print environment determine that the print job request violates a rule for printing in the managed print environment display a print job pop up dialogue that indicates that the print job request has been rejected wherein the print job pop up dialogue provides one or more alternative locations to upload the print job request receive a selection of one of the one or more alternative locations to upload the print job request convert the print job request into an electronic document and upload the electronic document to the one of the one or more alternative locations that was selected.

The present disclosure broadly discloses a method non transitory computer readable medium and apparatus for uploading a rejected print job to an alternative location. As discussed above if a user sends a print job request in a managed print environment to print a document and the print job request is rejected the user may have no alternative options at the time of the print job request. In addition due to the nature of some documents the document in the print job request may only be available for a fixed time period. As a result if the user is unable to print the document at the time of the print job request the document may be lost forever.

One embodiment of the present disclosure resolves this problem by providing an ability to upload a rejected print job in a managed print environment to an alternative location. For example the user may want to print a dynamic electronic document e.g. a time dependent or time limited electronic document that may be constantly changing or only be available temporarily e.g. a front page news story a coupon an online offer a temporary screenshot and the like . However a print job request to print the dynamic electronic document may violate one or more print governance rules of the managed print environment.

Currently the user would be at risk of losing the dynamic electronic document. However one embodiment of the present disclosure provides an option to upload the print job request to an alternative location e.g. a personal website a social networking website an email and the like . As a result the user may still retain a copy of the dynamic electronic document and attempt to print the dynamic electronic document at a later time by retrieving the dynamic electronic document from the alternative location that the user has selected.

To better understand the present disclosure illustrates an example of a communication network . In one embodiment the communication network includes a packet network such as an Internet Protocol IP network . The IP network may be for example the Internet a service provider network an access network a core network a local area network and the like.

In one embodiment the IP network may include an application server AS and a database DB . In one embodiment the AS may host an application for executing a managed print environment. In one embodiment the AS may be located at an enterprise location or located remotely from the enterprise location. In one embodiment the DB may be used to store profile information print governance rules used by the managed print environment configuration information and the like. Although only a single AS and a single DB are illustrated in it should be noted that any number of application servers and or databases may be deployed.

Although the AS and the DB are illustrated as being in the IP network it should be noted that the AS and DB could be located at a third party location outside of the IP network . For example the AS and DB may be at an enterprise location that is in communication with the IP network .

In one embodiment a printer and an end point device may be in communication with the IP network . In one embodiment the printer may include general personal computing capabilities similar to the general computing device described below and illustrated in . In one embodiment the printer may be a multi function device MFD that includes at least two different functions including for example digital image processing capability electronic communication capability e.g. email transmission electronic file transmission and the like scanning capability faxing capability copying capability printing capability interfacing capability with a user via a graphical user interface with or without a touch screen one or more input and output devices and the like.

In one embodiment the end point device may be any device capable of communicating with the IP network . For example the end point device may be a desktop computer a laptop computer a mobile endpoint device a smart phone a tablet computer a netbook computer and the like.

In one embodiment the AS and the end point device may include print spooler components. For example the endpoint device my run a client that includes an application a graphics device interface GDI and a driver e.g. Winspool.dry driver . In one embodiment the application creates a print job by calling the GDI functions. In one embodiment the GDI includes a user mode component and a kernel mode component. The user mode component may be used by Win32 applications that require graphics support. The kernel mode component may include a graphics engine and exports services and functions that graphics device drivers can use. In one embodiment the Winspool.dry driver may be the client interface to the spooler in the AS .

The AS may include one or more functions including a spoolsv.exe a spoolss.dll and one or more print providers . In one embodiment the spoolsv.exe is the spooler s application programming interface API server. It may be implemented as a service when the operating system on the endpoint device is started. In one embodiment the spoolss.dll may act as a router determining which print provider to call based on a printer name or handle supplied with each function call. It then passes the function call to the correct print provider .

In one embodiment a user may send a print job request via his or her end point device to the printer in a managed print environment. In one embodiment the print job request may be any type of document a web page an image a screenshot of a video and the like. In one embodiment the print job request may be a dynamic electronic document that may be only available temporarily e.g. a front page news story a coupon an online offer a temporary screenshot and the like . However due to one or more print governance rules the print job request may be rejected. Consequently if the user is unable to print the dynamic electronic document the opportunity to print the dynamic electronic document may be lost. One embodiment of the present disclosure provides a solution to this problem by providing one or more alternative locations to upload the print job until the dynamic electronic document may be printed at a later time.

In the present example the print job request violates one or more print governance rules as indicated in a recommendations box . Previously the user would be unable to print the document. If the document was a dynamic electronic document the opportunity to print may be lost forever and the document would be lost.

However one embodiment of the present disclosure provides one or more alternative locations and to upload the print job request until the document can be printed e.g. at a later time. Although only two alternative locations and are illustrated in it should be noted that any number of alternative locations may be displayed.

In one embodiment if the print job request is rejected the user may select an alternative location or . In one embodiment the user may select multiple alternative locations and . For example the user may select one or more icons associated with each one of the one or more alternative locations or . The alternative locations may include a social network website e.g. Facebook Twitter Pintrest and the like an email and the like.

In one embodiment when a user logs into the managed print environment the user may also provide login information for the user s social network website account and or the user s email account. For example the login information may include a username and a password. As a result when one or more of the alternative locations or are selected the managed print environment may automatically log the user into the respective account associated with the alternative location or to upload the print job request.

In another embodiment when the user selects one or more of the alternative locations or the user may be prompted to enter his or her login information. For example another pop up dialogue may be displayed to the user to enter his or her login information.

In one embodiment when one of the alternative locations or is selected the managed print environment may convert the print job request into an electronic document. For example the dynamic electronic document in the print job request may be converted into a portable document format PDF . The PDF may then be uploaded to the selected alternative location or . The user may then at a later time e.g. when the print governance rules can be met on a personal printer at home and the like print the PDF of the dynamic electronic document.

In one embodiment the user may select a preference for a particular alternative location or in his or her user profile stored in the DB . As a result when the print job request is rejected by the managed print environment one of the alternative locations or may be automatically selected by the managed print environment based upon the user profile without user interaction.

The pop up dialogue may be presented to the user when changes are recommended to the user before printing. Thus the pop up dialogue includes a print icon to continue with the print job request but may also provide the one or more alternative locations and should the user decide to complete the printing at a later time without risk of losing the dynamic electronic document.

Selecting one of the alternative locations or may then operate similar to how the alternative locations and illustrated in operate as discussed above. For example the user may provide login information associated with the alternative locations and such that the user may be automatically logged in when one or more of the alternative locations or are selected in the pop up dialogue .

In addition when one or more of the alternative locations or are selected the managed print environment may convert the print job request into an electronic document. The user may also select a preference for a particular alternative location or in his or her user profile stored in the DB . As a result when the user decides to print at a later time one of the alternative locations or may be automatically selected by the managed print environment based upon the user profile without additional user interaction.

The method begins at step . The method may perform optional step . At optional step the method may receive login information of a user associated with each one of one or more alternative locations when the user logs into a managed print environment. The login information may be stored in a database by the managed print environment such that the managed print environment may automatically log in the user if the user selects one of the one or more alternative locations. In another embodiment the user may be prompted to provide his or her login information at the time the user selects one of the one or more alternative locations.

At step the method receives a print job request. For example a user may send a print job request to a printer in the managed print environment. A print agent may capture a page description language PDL from a print spooler and hold the print job request until the print job request can be analyzed to determine if the print job request violates one or more print governance rules.

At step the method determines if the print job request violates a rule for printing. For example print governance rules in a managed print environment may define when a document may be printed e.g. non peak hours business hours during a weekday 8 00 am to 6 00 pm and the like what kinds of documents may be printed e.g. text documents documents with no images and the like and how the document can be printed e.g. black and white double sided how many pages which printers can be used and the like .

If the print job request does not violate a rule for printing the method may proceed to step . At step the method lets the print job request go to the printer e.g. a MFD. The method then proceeds to step where the method ends.

However if the print job request does violate a rule for printing the method proceeds to step . At step the method displays a print job pop up dialogue wherein the print job pop up dialogue provides one or more alternative locations to upload the print job request. In one embodiment the alternative locations may include a social network website e.g. Facebook Twitter Pintrest and the like an email and the like. The alternative locations may be presented as icons on the print job pop up dialogue that can be selected by the user.

At step the method determines if an alternative location is selected. If an alternative location is not selected the method proceeds to step where the method ends.

However at step if an alternative location is selected the method may proceed to step . At step the method may convert the print job request into an electronic document. For example the dynamic electronic document in the print job request may be converted into a portable document format PDF .

At step the method uploads the electronic document to the one of the one or more alternative locations that was selected. For example the PDF that was created in step may then be uploaded to the selected alternative location or locations. The user may then at a later time e.g. when the print governance rules can be met on a personal printer at home and the like print the PDF of the dynamic electronic document. The method ends at step .

It should be noted that although not explicitly specified one or more steps functions or operations of the method described above may include a storing displaying and or outputting step as required for a particular application. In other words any data records fields and or intermediate results discussed in the methods can be stored displayed and or outputted to another device as required for a particular application. Furthermore steps functions or operations in that recite a determining operation or involve a decision do not necessarily require that both branches of the determining operation be practiced. In other words one of the branches of the determining operation can be deemed as an optional step.

It should be noted that the present disclosure can be implemented in software and or in a combination of software and hardware e.g. using application specific integrated circuits ASIC a general purpose computer or any other hardware equivalents e.g. computer readable instructions pertaining to the method s discussed above can be used to configure a hardware processor to perform the steps of the above disclosed methods. In one embodiment the present module or process for uploading a rejected print job request to an alternative location can be loaded into memory and executed by processor to implement the functions as discussed above. As such the present method for uploading a rejected print job request to an alternative location including associated data structures of the present disclosure can be stored on a non transitory e.g. physical and tangible computer readable storage medium e.g. RAM memory magnetic or optical drive or diskette and the like. For example the hardware processor can be programmed or configured with instructions e.g. computer readable instructions to perform the steps functions or operations of method .

It will be appreciated that variants of the above disclosed and other features and functions or alternatives thereof may be combined into many other different systems or applications. Various presently unforeseen or unanticipated alternatives modifications variations or improvements therein may be subsequently made by those skilled in the art which are also intended to be encompassed by the following claims.
