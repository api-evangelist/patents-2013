title: Teleproctor reports use of a vehicle and restricts functions of drivers phone
abstract: A device in an automobile includes a camera that takes images of drivers while they are driving. It detects and reports when eyes are not on the road for longer than a glance with automated image processing. It also reports how much the car is driven, by whom, when, where, carrying what load, at what speed compared to the speed limit, with what pattern of hard breaking or hard cornering, whether the driver looked into the blind spot before changing lanes, and whether the driver allowed their phone to enter a restricted state while driving. The device may be built in or retrofit. The retrofit device can detect if it is depowered or removed from the vehicle and report this to the insurance company, rental company, parents, and employers.

This application claims priority from U.S. provisional applications 61 693 079 filed Aug. 24 2012 and 61 728 763 filed Nov. 20 2012.

Auto insurance companies auto rental companies parents and employers would like to know how much a vehicle is driven by whom when where at what speed compared to the speed limit carrying what load and whether any of the drivers take their eyes off the road for too long or engage in other risky driving behaviors. Parents and employers would like reports on some of these items promptly upon occurrence. All four want assurance that the monitoring cannot be avoided by subterfuge.

Insurance companies and auto rental companies would offer lower rates or trip by trip discounts where they are assured that technology is in place to report the above information without possibility of avoidance. To be sure they qualify for lower rates drivers would like immediate feedback on actions that might preclude lower rates.

To reduce annoyance avoid temptation reduce risk and show the vehicle owner and or insurance company that they are a safe driver some drivers would like their phones to automatically detect when they are driving and at those times not ring with an incoming call unless the caller believes the call is important enough to be put though while the driver is driving delay the ring of an incoming text until the vehicle is stopped and display only a simple user interface that can be understood with quick glances. For drivers who do not use a cell phone they would be happy to receive lower insurance rates by accepting a system that proves to the insurance company that they never hold a cell phone while driving 

In the prior art insurance companies incentivize customers to install in their autos cameras that take images of drivers while they are driving and send the images to the insurance companies for human review. An improved device to do this and more called a teleproctor is described. Detection and reporting of when eyes are not on the road for longer than a glance is automated with image processing. The device also reports how much the car is driven by whom when where carrying what load at what speed compared to the speed limit with what pattern of hard breaking or hard cornering whether the driver looked into the blind spot before changing lanes and whether the driver allowed their phone to enter a restricted state while driving. Reports of selected events can be sent to parents or employers promptly upon occurrence. Importantly the removable retrofit device can detect if it is depowered or removed from the vehicle and report this to the insurance company rental company parents and employers.

Systems to provide the monitoring and reporting and screening of calls can be retrofit to existing vehicles at low cost. If there is sufficient demand for the desired features auto manufacturers will pre install the hardware components to run software loaded by insurance companies rental companies parents and employers.

The teleproctor is installed in the vehicle by the insured or built into a new car. Installation for retrofit requires no skills. It is quick and easy and gives immediate feedback whether successful or unsuccessful. The teleproctor merely needs to be adhered to the dashboard or the windshield or the rear view mirror at a spot where the driver can see it and either a power wire is then plugged into a power source such as a USB port or a cigarette lighter receptacle or the teleproctor includes a photovoltaic panel that charges its battery. To verify correct set up the teleproctor sends a message via a radio network to a server and when it receives an acknowledgment beeps and flashes a green light.

The teleproctor collects data and wirelessly sends it to a central repository from which data is provided to the insurance company and or the car owner rental company parents or employer . The teleproctor can be set to give auditory reports and or visual reports to the driver whenever it reports to the insurance company that the driver was exceeding the speed limit by more than a threshold or had eyes looking away from the road for too long while the car is moving or other detected behaviors bad or good.

To report its data the teleproctor can include wireless network communications circuitry and a network account can be maintained for transmission like with the General Motors Onstar system. Alternatively the teleproctor can send the data to a pre identified mobile phone via Bluetooth or WiFi when that phone is in the vehicle and the phone runs an app that forwards the data in SMS messages or via internet to the data repository. A vehicle owner or insurance company can instruct the repository to forward selected data events immediately upon receipt.

Although software in the teleproctor is sophisticated the hardware cost of each teleproctor is low. Most of the hardware is already present in many new vehicles such as the GM Onstar system. The labor cost of retrofit installation is insignificant because each vehicle owner can do it themselves without expert guidance or review. The eye direction recognition software need not be so effective that it detects every too long glance away from the road. It only needs to detect enough of the too long glances away that the driver is deterred from risky behavior and there is no way the driver can consistently avoid detection.

Similarly the most important part of the subterfuge detection system detecting removal of the retrofit teleproctor from the vehicle requires no extra hardware merely sophisticated software. This component of the teleproctor can be a valuable component to add to any device with radio circuits where detection of removal is important.

As shown in the teleproctor includes a camera mounted on a base that includes electronic circuitry. The base need not be larger than a small mobile phone. In new vehicles the base may be built into the dashboard. The camera housing includes an infra red light emitter that shines light not visible to humans toward the camera s field of view. The camera pixel sensors detect both visible and infra red light.

For retrofit as shown in the base may be adhered to the windshield near the rear view mirror. Alternatively it may be adhered to the dashboard or affixed to the mirror. For retrofit it has a wire that leads to a plug for a USB port 5 volts or to a 12 volt outlet cigarette lighter socket or it includes a solar photovoltaic panel that charges a battery.

The teleproctor includes an image processor circuit which may be programmed to use image recognition to determine such events as 

The teleproctor is programmed to learn the necessary recognition details automatically after the teleproctor is installed. Facial image and eye position recognition methods are well known.

If the camera aim is changed so that it is not pointed at a human face and the car is moving faster than a threshold this fact is reported to the driver and to the owner and or insurance company.

When the teleproctor is installed a first listed driver sits in the driver s seat and adjusts the camera angle to point at his or her eyes. The driver clicks a button then looks straight ahead at the road as if driving. Three seconds after the button was clicked the teleproctor captures an image to save data characteristics of this face and these eyes as the first listed driver in correct driving position. The user interface for the teleproctor can be via a mobile phone or laptop or tablet computer with a Bluetooth or WiFi or similar connection. Data to recognize each other pre listed driver number 2 number 3 etc. is also stored in this way the first time each of them drives. The teleproctor then determines when it is looking at one of these drivers and can report the driver s identity with little data transmitted.

If a face is not recognized when the vehicle is moving the teleproctor reports this fact to the driver. The driver will be reported to the owner and or insurance company as a not pre listed driver unless the system is commanded to store the new facial data as the image of a newly listed driver. The image of each face used to train the system is transmitted to the owner and or insurance company and stored in their records for human review if and when necessary. If a person changes their facial appearance by changing their glasses or other features they simply reprogram the teleproctor to store their new facial data characteristics. The teleproctor can keep two or more stored sets of facial data for each driver such as with dark glasses or clear glasses or with a hat etc.

Instead of storing facial recognition data in the teleproctor the entire original images may be uploaded to a central server where the facial recognition processing is done. Then each time the vehicle starts moving from a stop long enough to change drivers an image is taken and uploaded for facial recognition.

In addition to a facial recognition system for determining who is driving the teleproctor includes components for eye direction determination such as by identifying the dark parts of eyes as contrasted against whites of the eyes and computing metrics of the dark parts of eyes and the whites on each side of the dark parts. Any method for making these computations may be used. A suitable method for making these computations is in Appendix A. When the driver slightly changes position while the vehicle is moving the image processor may update the looking at the road eye position data set for the driver by assuming that an eye position that is steady while the car is moving with only short glances in other directions should be the basis for updating the data set.

When the eye direction data changes significantly from the looking at the road data set and then returns to the looking at the road data set within a window of time the system concludes that the eyes were not looking at the road. If the dark parts move to the side and the eye metrics change a large amount the head has turned such as to check the blind spot.

For optimal processing for each of eye direction recognition and facial recognition the effective brightness of the captured data in the visible and infra red spectra may be adjusted independently. In addition the intensity of infra red light emitted by the teleproctor to illuminate the face may be adjusted independently for each data set giving a total of three possible brightness adjustments for each of eye direction recognition and facial recognition purposes. For example for eye direction determination when the driver is wearing dark glasses the three brightnesses will be adjusted for optimal distinction between the dark parts and whites of the eyes as seen through the dark glasses. Brightness adjustments suitable for use with dark glasses will typically be too bright for recognition of other facial features.

The teleproctor includes a determiner of location speed and speed limit which places into the data store location data and speed relative to the local speed limit. For a built in teleproctor the location speed and speed limit determiner may get this data from a GPS with map circuit in the vehicle. In the retrofit teleproctor the location speed and speed limit determiner includes a GPS circuit and a stored digital map with speed limits for each location. The map is periodically updated by download through the radio transceiver . The teleproctor saves in the data store the location speed and speed limit data for reporting.

The teleproctor includes at least two accelerometers. An acceleration data processor can determine when lane changes are made and the image recognition processor can determine whether the driver first looked in the blind spot. If the teleproctor is built into the vehicle it can be coupled to data sources from the vehicle such as whether a turn signal was activated before changing lanes and braking or turning data. The acceleration data processor can determine when the driver causes hard braking or cornering or speeding up. A summary of these determinations can be uploaded to the data repository for review by the insurance company or owner.

Rental companies would like to know how much load their vehicle is carrying on each trip as a gauge of wear. This information can be used to set lower rates for people who carry light loads. Data from the accelerometers on hard acceleration hard cornering and hard braking is also of interest to these companies because it increases tire wear. Parents and employers would like to know when the vehicle is being used to carry extra passengers.

A load computation can be implemented with data showing power or fuel consumption provided by engine sensors. The built in teleproctor receives input from the vehicle engine computer. When the engine power output is high either the vehicle is going up a hill or it is accelerating. Using the speed determining circuits these two factors can be computationally separated. By comparing the power output to change in speed and factoring out any hill incline the load the vehicle is carrying can be computed. Another method to distinguish between climbing a hill and speeding up uses a direction of gravity acceleration sensor. By comparing the output of this sensor to change in speed these two factors can be separated.

A more direct method for obtaining load data to report is to add strain gauges to one or more suspension springs of the vehicle. It may be a tiny strain gauge that directly senses strain in the metal of the spring or it may be a distance sensor that senses the distance that the spring is collapsed overall. Placing the gauge on only one spring a rear spring may be sufficiently accurate. A wire is run from the strain gauge to the teleproctor or to the vehicle s computer which passes the data on to the teleproctor. Of course the teleproctor circuits may be built into the vehicle s computer circuits with only the camera and other sensors being outside the vehicle computer circuits.

Collected data for each trip is stored in a data store shown in . Periodically a radio control processor commands the radio transceiver to send new data in the data store to a central repository where it is repackaged and supplied to the insurance companies and or car owner. The transmission route may go directly from a wireless network transmitter built into the teleproctor or the vehicle in which case an account for the teleproctor is maintained in the radio network or it may pass via Bluetooth or WiFi to a phone or mobile wireless internet device in the car which acts as the first link in a radio network .

Any programmable smart phone or other mobile wireless network device can be programmed with an app to perform this function automatically without the device owner taking any action other than leaving the device and the app turned on whenever the device is in the vehicle. The device automatically detects the Bluetooth or WiFi signal from the teleproctor and connects to it. The teleproctor and app together then determine how often a data bundle is uploaded through the device. For example if the device is in an area with poor reception the uploads may be delayed. This uploading of the data can be programmed to happen the first occasion after a designated time each day that one of the designated device with Bluetooth or WiFi is in the car and the car is turned on or other occasions. It can be programmed to happen immediately when certain events are detected or upon request from the system server .

The teleproctor can be programmed so that when a specified number of events of not looking at the road for longer than a threshold occur within a specified window of time a report is immediately sent via the radio network. Similarly it can be programmed to immediately send a report when speed over the speed limit is maintained for longer than a threshold amount of time or any other event. If the teleproctor detects extreme deceleration suggestive of an accident or upon request from the system server it can transmit images from the teleproctor and sounds collected by a microphone in the teleproctor or the phone for a period of time.

So that the actions of the image processor and the radio control processor can be updated they are each controlled by programs stored in a rewritable program store which can be rewritten by download through the radio network and loaded into the program store .

3. coordinates at each turn relative to mapped roads to show each leg of the route taken on each trip 

5. number of minutes in each leg that the vehicle speed exceeded the speed limit by more than a threshold 

8. number of times in each leg that the driver turned their eyes away from the looking at the road direction for more than a threshold duration and by how many tenths of seconds the threshold was exceeded both a maximum and an average and

9. whether the driver prevented their phone from automatically entering restricted mode controlled by the teleproctor.

The teleproctor can be set to play an auditory message to the driver through a speaker in the teleproctor or the driver s phone and or present a visual message to the driver in a display for the driver whenever speeding or eyes off the road or other events are reported to the insurance company. With each message to the driver the teleproctor can tell the driver how much money the driver lost on insurance costs due to speeding or eyes off the road etc.

Data elements 1 7 above can be reported without adding a teleproctor camera into the vehicle. Some vehicles and mobile telephones already have the required hardware. All that is required is software to be downloaded into them to work as follows. A processor receives vehicle speed from the vehicle from either a speedometer or a GPS circuit in the vehicle. The processor receives a speed limit from the GPS and a stored map. The processor may be in the on board vehicle electronics associated with the GPS or in a mobile telephone that communicates with the on board vehicle electronics via Bluetooth or WiFi. The phone provides acceleration data. The mobile telephone runs an app that receives the data and forwards it to the remote parties.

As described above each phone in the vehicle running an appropriate app can automatically connect to the teleproctor for bi directional communication when the phone is in the vehicle. By facial recognition the teleproctor can know which listed driver is driving the vehicle. With this information and prior cooperation by the usual drivers of the vehicle to load apps in their phones and list a phone identifier with the teleproctor the teleproctor can advise the driver s phone that it should enter a restricted mode when the vehicle is moving. The usual drivers phones are each identified to the teleproctor when they first connect to it. Then with the phone owner s acceptance by user input to load the app the app will put the phone in a restricted mode whenever the teleproctor advises the phone that its owner is in the driver s seat and the vehicle is moving. If the driver s usual phone is not running the app to allow restriction this suspicious circumstance can be reported to the vehicle owner or insurance company which can use this information to set rates or rules.

An optimal form of functionality restriction might block all text message alerts or display and block all reading writing or other user interactions with a display while moving but to accommodate emergencies it should not block all voice communications while moving. Examples of restrictions that can be implemented in the phone include

In restricted mode all screen displays are so simple that a viewer can glean all available information with just a glance no text beyond a few words to read no large sets of items to choose from.

Level of attention required for driving can be approximated with the accelerometers in the teleproctor. The teleproctor can advise the driver s phone to enter a more restricted state when the vehicle is speeding up or slowing down or turning or quickly changing lanes or recently has been doing so. If it is built into the vehicle the teleproctor can receive inputs from various vehicle sensors that suggest when more attention is required for driving. At these times the outgoing voice signal or the incoming voice signal or both can be interrupted or suspended and perhaps replaced with a sound or recorded words to reduce distraction for the driver and inform the other party to the conversation that the driver needs to pay attention to driving at this time.

There can be multiple levels of restriction based on time of day or location on a map in memory based on GPS location or other factors. A restriction might be to stop the handset speaker from working and require use of a headset speaker.

Conversations with a passenger in a car present less of a distraction than telephone conversations because the remote telephone conversant does not know what else the driver is doing simultaneously and what the driver is seeing while the passenger knows these things. The passenger understands what is happening when the driver pauses to concentrate on driving. The concentration demands for a telephone conversation can be reduced and made more like the demands for conversation with a passenger by periodically playing a beep or other signal to the remote telephone party to remind them that the person they are talking to is also driving.

The app running in the driver s phone can be programmed so that when a caller calls while the phone is in a restricted state before the phone rings a message is played to the caller saying The person you are calling is driving. If this call is important enough to interrupt that person while driving press 1 or say yes. The called phone would only ring if the caller presses 1 or says yes. Otherwise the call is rerouted to voice mail.

As described above for independent adult drivers restricting phones that are moving to block texting and display interactions but only temporarily block voice communications while also accelerating may be optimal. However for children or children and certain employees the parent or employer may prefer a greater level of restriction. In this system the phone owner can have a password that allows greater restriction to be placed on the phone. Here are examples of possible voice call restrictions that may be preferred in these situations for outgoing calls.

For the system to be valuable to insurance companies and vehicle rental companies there must be no way to defeat it that would keep low insurance rates or rental rates in place when they should not be kept in place. Parents and employers have similar concerns. Subterfuges that might be attempted include 

The teleproctor includes a rechargeable battery that keeps it working for a length of time after it is depowered. In versions that do not include photovoltaic charging of the battery when power to the teleproctor is lost to determine whether the loss is due to a proper switch off of vehicle power or improper unplugging or removal of a power fuse the teleproctor sends a radio ping out the power wire and measures the radio echo signature by a process described below.

If the echo signature shows that power was lost due to vehicle power switch off the teleproctor takes no action other than going into its normal sleep mode. If the echo signature shows that the teleproctor is unplugged or a fuse is removed whether accidently or otherwise it plays an auditory alert warning to plug it back in. If it is not soon plugged in to the same vehicle as determined by the echo signature methods described below the teleproctor reports this fact to the insurance company and or owner.

To determine the cause of depowering the teleproctor includes a circuit that captures and records a radio echo signature of the power source and its connections. Using its radio transmitter which it has for Bluetooth or WiFi communication with the phone or for wide area data network communication more directly to a server the teleproctor emits a ping or series of pings into the power wire. Using its radio receiver the teleproctor records a signature of the echo to obtain a radio echo signature of the vehicle electronics.

The power wire echo will be different if the power source is a 12 volt to 5 volt converter such as for USB receptacles rather than a 12 volt source such as from a cigarette lighter. It may also be affected by plugging other electronic devices into the vehicle. These changes can be distinguished as not material changes because the echo will be vastly different if the teleproctor is left unplugged or a fuse is removed or blown.

With known signature processing techniques the echo data set may be reduced to a small but distinctive data set known as a signature hash. The algorithm for computing the hash is developed by collecting full signature data sets for many different vehicles and power supplies and developing the algorithm to make the hash data set optimally small while still distinguishing between the plugged and unplugged or no fuse conditions in all cases no matter what else may be plugged in.

Every time the retrofit teleproctor is powered whether from turning on vehicle power or from unplugging and then plugging back in a total vehicle radio echo signature is obtained. For this the radio echo signature is taken using the teleproctor s antenna for both broadcast and reception to obtain a signature of the entire vehicle with a major factor being the shape of and relationship to all metal in the vehicle and a very minor factor being a change in the configuration of what s plugged into the vehicle s power and where it s plugged in. This allows users to unplug the retrofit teleproctor make changes to what s plugged in and where and then plug in the retrofit teleproctor again without a problem. If the total vehicle radio echo signature hash is the same as before no alert is sent to the insurance company. For the built in teleproctor no total vehicle radio echo signature capability is required.

The algorithm for computing the hash for the vehicle radio echo signature is developed by collecting full signature data sets for many different vehicles and developing the algorithm to make the hash data set optimally small while still distinguishing between as many vehicle models as possible and never computing two different hashes for the same vehicle even if the teleproctor s location within the vehicle is moved a small enough amount to have no adverse effect on the functioning of the teleproctor.

A driver might while the vehicle power is off unplug the retrofit teleproctor leave it unplugged for some trips and then plug it back into the same vehicle. To prevent this subterfuge the back up battery has enough power to last several days and while depowered in sleep mode the teleproctor wakes up periodically about every 3 hours and queries the GPS to determine its location. If the location is not the same as where the teleproctor went to sleep the insurance company and or owner is notified.

A driver might while the vehicle power is off unplug the retrofit teleproctor and remove it from the vehicle leaving it in the same location as where the teleproctor went to sleep while the vehicle drives away. To prevent this subterfuge the back up battery has enough power to last several days and while depowered in sleep mode the teleproctor wakes up periodically about every 3 hours and takes a total vehicle radio echo to determine the radio reflection characteristics of its surroundings and computes a hash. If the computed hash is not the same as for the vehicle in which the teleproctor was installed the insurance company and or owner is notified.

For new cars with a built in teleproctor the total vehicle echo signature never needs to be taken because the teleproctor cannot easily be removed. For retrofit teleproctors the original total vehicle echo signature hashes are computed when the teleproctor is initially set up and recomputed if it is set up again.

The teleproctor is programmed to report that the data is likely wrong if the eye direction data does not change with glances away from the road as much as is minimally human.

Unless the passenger is looking at the road as much as the driver should be this will not achieve the driver s objective the glances away from the road by a passenger will be too long. If the driver points the camera at a passenger who is instructed to stare intently at the road ahead the face will not be recognized as a covered driver unless the driver attempted to defraud the employer or insurance company by claiming that the face on which the system was trained is the driver s face but this would be easily caught by a human looking at the photo of the face that was uploaded when the system was trained on that face.

Also if the camera is not moved from its location in front of the driver the angle of looking at the passenger will be too oblique and this will be automatically detectable by the image processor. If the camera is moved from its proper location the echo signature of the total vehicle will be detectably different.

It is necessary to include a method for the data compiling system to authenticate each teleproctor. Otherwise sociopathic entrepreneurs could make and sell bootlegged teleproctors that will give false and prettied up data on use of the vehicle. The authentication method need not be strong. It only needs to be strong enough to make it expensive to make and sell an unauthorized teleproctor that will work adequately to go undetected more than about half of the time.

Crypto authenticating chips are well known. They are designed to receive as input a first data string and in response output a second data string. When both data strings are processed together with a secret key the result will show the second data string to have been produced by the crypto authenticating chip or not. The second string cannot be inexpensively determined from knowing the first string without having the key. The contents of the authenticating chip cannot be read and duplicated because a fusible link was burned after manufacture.

The data compilation server sends a first data string to the teleproctor mounted in the vehicle which replies with a second data string from a crypto authentication circuit included in the teleproctor. If the data compilation server determines that the strings do not match with the key the data is so annotated.

Each teleproctor sends to the data compilation server an identifier for use to determine which key should be used. The identifier may be the teleproctor s mobile number in the network or it may be a separate identifier stored in and sent by the authentication circuit e.g. a serial number .

An alternative design for an authentication circuit uses a clock in the teleproctor that is synchronized with a clock in the central server to periodically change a data string that it sends to the server. Each new data string must match what is expected to achieve authentication. Other authentication circuits are known and may be used.

Although teleproctors require approved authentication circuits to be built in by licensed manufacturers to avoid bootlegging of devices that report false information the authentic teleproctors can be sold freely though all channels of trade and installed by anyone.

The server that checks for the authentication chip is the only component that is permitted to load an updated program into the teleproctor. The authentication chip is programmed to also check the credentials of the server and insure that no other source can supply an updated program.

The image recognition system identifies who is driving. If that person s listed phone is turned off or not running the app such that the teleproctor cannot connect to it this is reported with adverse consequences for the driver.

The image recognition system identifies who is driving. If that person s listed phone is in the vehicle and running the app the phone will enter a restricted state as appropriate. If the driver uses a second non listed phone it will not be in a restricted state but the eye direction monitoring system will still be watching the eyes and reporting too much eyes off the road behavior. Whenever the eyes are off the road too long the system can upload an image of the driver s face and upper body for possible human or automated review.

1. Find the pixels within the top half of the frame and the center half of the frame that are darkest and set this value as the lightness threshold. Raise the lightness threshold until two groups are found a distance apart within the range of possible pupil distances and roughly horizontal to each other. Looking only at pixels contiguous with either group incrementally raise the lightness threshold and count the number of pixels added at each increment until the longest diameter of each group reaches a maximum of possible pupil diameters. Separately for each group identify the lightness increment that added the smallest number of pixels where the longest diameter is within a range of possible diameters. If the longest diameter of each group is different adjust the increment one unit lighter for the smaller group or one unit darker for the larger group or both until the longest diameter of each group is the same. This is the pupil diameter . The boundary of each group defines each pupil .

3. At 35 degrees to the horizontal line look at the lightness of each pixel in each of four directions from each pupil eight rays to a distance from each pupil equal to half the pupil diameter. Raise the lightness threshold incrementally and count the number of pixels added to each ray by each increment until no more pixels are added by an increment. For each of the eight rays the lightness increment that added the largest number of pixels defines the lightness of the whites of the eyes for that ray and the total number of pixels added to this point for each ray is the whites pixel count along that ray.

4. For each eye the whites pixel count for each of the four rays constitutes a four dimensional eye direction metric . When the eye direction metrics for the two eyes change by more than a threshold the eyes are not on the road . The threshold is developed empirically.
