The respective disclosures of these applications patents which this document refers to collectively as the Related Applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The present disclosure relates in general to image and video capture devices and more particularly to tools and techniques for implementing remote control of image and video capture devices and for implementing remote control of processing and sharing functions associated with captured image and or video data.

The proliferation of capable user devices pervasive communication and increased bandwidth has provided opportunity for many enhanced services for users. One example is video calling. Once the domain of high end dedicated systems from vendors such as POLYCOM video calling has become available to the average consumer at a reasonable cost. For example the Biscotti device available from Biscotti Inc. provides an inexpensive tool to allow video calling using a high definition television and an Internet connection. More generally a class of devices which have been described as video calling devices but are referred to herein as video communication devices VCDs can be simultaneously connected to a display such as a television to name one example and a source of content such as a set top box STB to name an example in a pass through configuration and can have a network connection and or sensors such as a camera a microphone infrared sensors and or other suitable sensors. Such devices present a powerful platform for various applications. Examples include without limitation video calling instant messaging presence detection status updates media streaming over the Internet web content viewing gaming and DVR capability. Another example of such value added services is the introduction of online gaming. Rather than playing a game by him or herself a user now can play most games in a multiplayer mode using communication over the Internet or another network.

Enabling such services is a new class of user device which generally features relatively high end processing capability which would have been unthinkable outside supercomputing labs just a few years ago substantial random access memory and relatively vast non transient storage capabilities including hard drives solid state drives and the like. Such user devices can include without limitation the VCDs mentioned above the presence detection devices PDD described in the Mobile Presence Detection Application various video game consoles and the like. Such devices generally have a reliable and relatively high speed connection to the Internet to enable the value added services and significant amounts of downtime in which the processing and other capabilities of the devices are unused.

Additionally several vendors provide security cameras that are capable of communicating over a network. An example of such a device is the Samsung WiFi Surveillance Camera available from Samsung Electronics. Such devices enable a user to remotely monitor a scene via images transmitted over a network.

Existing devices however do not allow access to live images or live videos from the camera via the Internet nor do such devices allow the storage of captured image and or video data on the Internet for future retrieval. Generally such devices further require the camera to be connected to a display device and require configuration using an interface on that display device rather than via the Internet.

Hence there is a need for solutions that allow for more flexible remote access to video and image capture devices and or for more flexible configuration options thereof as well as for more flexible access to remotely captured video and image data and some such solutions can employ the powerful user devices already resident in many users homes.

A set of embodiments provides tools and techniques for providing access to Internet connected cameras including without limitation image capture devices from or over the Internet. In some aspects certain embodiments can provide access from or over the Internet to video and or images captured by such devices.

Various modifications and additions can be made to the embodiments discussed without departing from the scope of the invention. For example while the embodiments described above refer to particular features the scope of this invention also includes embodiments having different combination of features and embodiments that do not include all of the above described features.

While various aspects and features of certain embodiments have been summarized above the following detailed description illustrates a few exemplary embodiments in further detail to enable one of skill in the art to practice such embodiments. The described examples are provided for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the described embodiments. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art however that other embodiments of the present invention may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances certain structures and devices are shown in block diagram form. Several embodiments are described herein and while various features are ascribed to different embodiments it should be appreciated that the features described with respect to one embodiment may be incorporated with other embodiments as well. By the same token however no single feature or features of any described embodiment should be considered essential to every embodiment of the invention as other embodiments of the invention may omit such features.

Unless otherwise indicated all numbers used herein to express quantities dimensions and so forth used should be understood as being modified in all instances by the term about. In this application the use of the singular includes the plural unless specifically stated otherwise and use of the terms and and or means and or unless otherwise indicated. Moreover the use of the term including as well as other forms such as includes and included should be considered non exclusive. Also terms such as element or component encompass both elements and components comprising one unit and elements and components that comprise more than one unit unless specifically stated otherwise.

Presence Detection Devices PDDs provided by various embodiments can contain or communicate with inter alia cameras microphones and or other sensors including without limitation infrared IR sensors . These sensors in conjunction with the internal processing capability of the device can allow the device to detect when a person is in the room. Additionally through means such as facial recognition and voice detection or the like the devices also can automatically recognize who is in the room. More specifically such devices can detect the presence of a particular individual. In some aspects Image Capture Devices ICDs might contain or communicate with inter alia video capture devices for capturing image data and or video data. In some cases ICDs might also contain or communicate with inter alia microphones and or other sensors including without limitation infrared IR sensors . According to some embodiments some ICDs might have similar functionality as PDDs.

In various embodiments presence detection can be local and or cloud based. In the case of local presence detection the PDD itself might keep a list of all user profiles and will attempt to match an individual against its local list of all users. In cloud based detection the functionality of user detection can be moved into servers in the cloud. A cloud based approach allows detection of a user s presence to be mobile among various devices whether owned by and or associated with the user or not . That same user can be detected on their device or on any other device that has the same capability and that is tied into the same cloud infrastructure.

The ability to automatically detect the presence of an individual on any device presents a powerful new paradigm for many applications including automation customization content delivery gaming video calling and others. Advantageously in some embodiments a user s content services games profiles and or preferences etc. can follow that user from device to device including devices that are not owned by or previously associated with the individual as described in detail in the Mobile Presence Detection Application already incorporated herein . Alternatively or in addition presence detection functionality can also allow for mobile presence detection that enables remote access and control of ICDs over a network following automatic identification and authentication of the user by any device e.g. PDD ICD or other device so long as such device has authentication functionality that is or can be tied to the access and control of the ICDs regardless of whether or not such device is owned or associated with the user. In other words the ability to remotely access and control one s ICDs over a network can follow the user wherever he or she goes in a similar manner to the user s content and profiles following the user as described in the Mobile Presence Detection Application.

Various sensors on a PDD and or an ICD can be used for user detection. Facial recognition can be used to identify a particular individual s facial characteristics and or voice detection can be used to uniquely identify a person. Additionally PDDs and or ICDs may also have local data storage. This local data storage can be used to store a database of user profiles. The user profiles can contain the various mechanisms that can be used to identify a person including username and password facial characteristics voice characteristics etc. When sensors detect the facial features or capture the voice of a particular individual that captured presence information can be compared against the characteristics of the users on the local storage. If a match is found then the individual has been successfully identified by the device. As used herein the term presence information can be any data or information that can be used to determine the presence of a user and or to identify and or authenticate such a user. As such presence information can include raw image video or audio data analyzed data e.g. video or image data to which preliminary facial recognition procedures such as feature extraction have been employed as well as verification of audio self identification or verification of audio challenge response information the results of such analysis and even the end result of the detection process i.e. a notification that a user is present and or an identification of the user. 

Detection of a user s presence can also be detected via proximity of a PDD and or an ICD to another device. For example if a user s mobile phone tablet or PC is near the PDD and or the ICD that person is automatically detected. In some instances a unique device identifier for each of a user s device might have previously been associated with the user s profile in a cloud database or the like i.e. making the user s devices known devices and detection of such unique device identifiers might serve as a basis for identifying the user or might streamline the identification process by verifying whether the person with the device owned by or associated with the known device is the user or simply someone in possession of the device s whether lawful or unlawful . Such verification might comprise one or more of facial recognition voice recognition audio challenge response verification biometric analysis or the like. In some cases audio challenge response verification might include analysis of sub vocal responses from the person challenged to prevent undesired casual overhearing of audio passwords audio keyphrases or the like. In some instances biometric analysis might include analysis of any suitable biometric aside from facial and voice recognition selected from a group consisting of fingerprint iris pupil height unique scar s other unique physical characteristics and or any combination of these biometrics. To capture biometric information such as fingerprints iris pupil height scar or other unique physical characteristics which might be image based biometrics which might be captured by a high resolution video capture device of the PDD and or the ICD the PDD and or the ICD might prompt the person being identified to position himself or herself so that his or her fingerprints iris pupil full body scar or other unique physical characteristics respectively are appropriately facing the video capture device of the PDD and or the ICD.

In some embodiments with detection of known devices and with automatic detection identification processes being enabled it may be possible for the system to identify persons not normally associated with a known device being in possession of the known device. In such a case the system might notify the original user via e mail or other forms of communication indicated in the user s profile or the like of the situation. In some instances the user might indicate that the unknown person does have authority or permission to use or be in possession of the user s device. In other cases where the user indicates that the user does not have authority or permission to use the device the user may be given options to proceed including without limitation options to lock data options to lock device functions options to activate location tracking including without limitation global positioning system GPS global navigation satellite system GNSS etc. of the device in case the system loses track of the device e.g. in the case the device moves outside the range of the system s sensor detection communications systems options to contact the unknown person options to activate speakers to emit sirens options to activate displays or lights e.g. light emitting diodes LEDs organic LEDs OLEDs liquid crystal displays LCDs etc. and or options to notify authorities e.g. police or other law enforcement personnel of the situation and or the location of the device e.g. GPS coordinates or the like etc.

Additionally and or alternatively proximity detection can be done using GNSS location tracking functionality which can be found in many electronic devices and authenticating the user when the secondary device is within a predefined distance of the PDD and or ICD. Proximity detection can also be done wirelessly via Bluetooth or WiFi. With respect to Bluetooth if the secondary device pairs with the PDD and or the ICD the user can be considered detected. With respect to WiFi one approach could be to see if the secondary device associates with the same WiFi access point that the PDD and or the ICD is connected to. Another approach to proximity detection is the use of near field communications NFC commonly found in many electronic devices. When the secondary device is within range of the PDD and or ICD a NFC detector can be used to determine that the user is in the room. From these examples a skilled reader should appreciate that many different techniques can be used to detect presence based on device proximity.

In some embodiments detection of an individual can be fully automatic and might in some instances require no user interaction. For example the system can characterize an individual s facial features and or unique physical characteristics or other biometrics automatically detect the presence of a secondary device characterize an individual s voice print automatically etc. Several detection methods can be used in combination to reduce errors in the detection process. For example if the system detects a person in the room and first identifies that person s facial features it can then prompt them for voice e.g. Bob is that you . Once the user s voice is captured that audio sample can be compared against the stored voice characteristics for that user to reduce false detection. Another approach for the second step may be to prompt the user to speak a PIN or password to be compared against what is stored in the user profile. Using this approach the characteristics of the speech e.g. user s voice cadence syntax diction and the content of the speech e.g. a PIN or password can be jointly used to reduce false detections. To prevent eavesdropping of passwords or PINs the audio capture device might be configured to capture subvocalizations of the passwords or PINs for analysis. Alternatively and or additionally the system can prompt the user to position his or her body so as to allow the video capture device to face one or more of the user s fingers e.g. for fingerprint analysis the user s eyes e.g. for iris and or pupil analysis the user s full body e.g. for height analysis portions of the user s body e.g. for analysis of scars or other unique physical characteristics or the like etc.

In some embodiments physical geography can be used as a metric in detection to reduce the possibility of errors. For example if a user is known to use the system in Dallas Tex. and then is detected in Madrid Spain the system can weigh detection in Spain lower than detection in Dallas. Additionally if the user is detected in Spain a secondary authentication method may optionally be invoked to reduce false detection. According to some embodiments in the case that the system has access to profile or other personal information of the user such as communications calendar items contacts list travel itinerary information or the like that might indicate that the user might be visiting a friend or relative in Spain having a similar PDD and or ICD linked to a common network or cloud server the system might determine that the user is or will be in Spain. In such a case the user s profiles media content or the like or access thereto might be sent to the friend s or relative s device in Spain or to a local data center or the like to allow the user to access the user s own content or profiles on the friend s or relative s device during the visit in particular embodiments the user s profiles might include access and control information for remotely accessing and controlling the user s ICDs over a network while the user s content might include image data and or video data captured by the user s ICDs either in raw or processed form . After the scheduled visit it may be determined using any combination of the user s personal information the user s devices including the user s PDD and or ICD mobile devices etc. and or the friend s or relative s device whether the user has left the friend s or relative s location in this example Spain . If so determined the content and profiles or access thereto as the case may be might be removed from the friend s or relative s device and or from the data center or the like that is local to said device .

In particular embodiments a PDD and or an ICD can also be connected to a network such as the Internet. In such a scenario the database of user profiles including identifiable facial and or voice characteristics as well as other identifying information e.g. passwords identifying information for other devices owned by the user etc. can be stored on servers located in the cloud i.e. on the network or in a distributed computing system available over the network. In some cases the distributed computing system might comprise a plurality of PDDs and or a plurality of ICDs in communication with each other either directly or indirectly over the network. The distributed computing system in some instances might comprise one or more central cloud servers linking the plurality of PDDs and or the plurality of ICDs and controlling the distribution and redundant storage of media content access to content user profiles user data and or the like. When an individual s facial features are detected by a PDD and or an ICD those features and or an image captured by the PDD and or the ICD can be sent to a server on the network. The server then can compare the identifiable facial features against the database of user profiles. If a match is found then the server might inform the device of the identity of the user and or might send a user profile for the user to the device.

User profiles including facial characteristics can be stored both locally on the device and on a server located in the cloud. When using both device based and cloud based databases user identification can be performed by first checking the local database to see if there is a match and if there is no local match then checking the cloud based database. The advantage of this approach is that it is faster for user identification in the case where the user profile is contained in the local database. In some embodiments the database on the device can be configured to stay synchronized with the database in the cloud. For example if a change is made to a user profile on the device that change can be sent to the server and reflected on the database in the cloud. Similarly if a change is made to the user profile in the cloud based database that change can be reflected on the device database.

Matching presence information or identifying information with an individual having a user profile can be a form of authentication in some embodiments. User profiles can also contain information necessary for many authentication mechanisms. Such information may include challenge response pairs such as username and password combinations security question pass phrase combinations or the like facial recognition profiles voice recognition profiles and or other biometric information such as fingerprints etc. An individual may be authenticated using any combination of such techniques.

In some cases the system can also determine when a user is no longer present. Merely by way of example a PDD and or an ICD might continually or periodically monitor for the user s presence. For instance in the case of facial recognition the device can continually check to detect whether a captured image includes the user s face. With voice recognition after a period of inactivity the device might prompt the user if they are there e.g. Bob are you still there .

According to some embodiments user profiles can work across heterogeneous networks. Not all user devices need to be the same. Some user devices might be PDDs and or ICDs. Other user devices might be computers tablets mobile phones etc. Each can use any appropriate method based on device capabilities to determine the presence of identify and or authenticate the user of the device with a user profile.

In an aspect this automated presence detection can be used to provide user information e.g. content or services to an identified user. With a PDD and or an ICD when a user enters the room and the camera sensors detect that user s facial features or other biometric features and authenticates the individual the content associated with that user profile including without limitation profile information for remotely accessing and or control the user s ICD s over a network can automatically become available to that individual. Additionally with the cloud based authentication approach described herein that user s content and or profiles can become available on any device. More specifically if a user is identified by another PDD and or ICD then his or her content e.g. image or video data captured by the user s ICD s either in raw or processed form and or the like becomes available to him or her even if the PDD and or ICD that he or she is in front of is not the user s own device. This functionality allows a new paradigm in which the user s content and or profiles follow the user automatically. Similarly when upgrading PDDs and or ICDs detection identification and authentication of the user on the new device can allow automatic and easy porting of the user s content and or profiles to the new device allowing for an ultimate type of plug and play functionality especially if the profiles include information on configurations and settings of the user devices and interconnections with other devices .

PDDs and or ICDs also are capable of handling transmitting and or distributing image captured content which can include but is not limited to video data and or image data captured by the ICDs. In some cases the video data and or image data might be raw data while in other cases they might be post processed data. In some instances post processed data might include time lapse video segments and or the like. Image captured content can be stored on servers in the cloud on PDDs ICDs in the cloud and or locally on a particular user device. When accessing image captured content from another device the first PDD and or ICD that has the image captured content stored thereon needs to serve the content to the new device that the content owner is using. In order to do this the new PDD and or ICD might need to get a list of image captured content that is stored on the first PDD and or ICD. This can in some embodiments be facilitated via a server that is in the cloud that all PDDs and or ICDs are always or mostly connected to. The server can communicate with all PDDs and or ICDs and help send messages between PDDs and or ICDs. When a user is authenticated with a new PDD and or ICD the new device can request the content list from the first device. If the content owner requests content from the new device then the first PDD and or ICD or the other user device can serve the content to the new device. This can be done either directly in a peer to peer fashion or can be facilitated by the server. In some embodiments this communication can be accomplished by using protocols such as XMPP SIP TCP IP RTP UDP etc.

As discussed above identification and authentication of a user by a PDD whether or not associated with or owned by the user can provide the user with remote access and control of the user s ICD s over a network e.g. by porting the user s profiles associated with remote access and control of the user s ICD s and or the like to the current PDD in front of which the user is located . This functionality allows the user to remotely monitor the user s premises or office or other location at which the user s ICD s are located . In some embodiments for ICD s having similar functionality as the PDD such ICD s can detect and or identify people at the user s premises or office or other location at which the user s ICD s are located . By similar identification processes as discussed herein or in the Mobile Presence Detection Application it may be determined whether such people are known and or authorized to be at the user s premises or office etc. i.e. whether such people are family or friends etc. or whether such people are unauthorized e.g. burglars robbers unauthorized family or friends etc. . Automatic notifications may be sent to the user e.g. via e mail text message etc. when unauthorized people are detected and or identified by the user s ICD s . In some embodiments certain users might have subscriptions or other access to certain criminal databases e.g. databases compiled by watchdog groups private citizens police etc. in which case identification of people in the user s premises or office or other location at which the user s ICD s are located might include comparing identifying information obtained by the ICD s with information in these criminal databases. In the case that a known criminal or even an unknown unauthorized person is detected and identified by the ICD s the system might automatically notify the user and or police or other authorities .

Some embodiments employ a master account for access to an ICD. In an aspect a master account can be created on a per user basis. This master account might serve as the top level identifier for a particular user. The master account is used to manage control and monitor a user s camera s . Additionally the master account can be used to control any account or device level services that are available.

For example an email account and password can be used as a master account to manage a user s camera s .

For proper management and control of a camera some embodiments provide the ability to reliably associate a camera with a master account i.e. assign the camera to the master account . When a camera is associated with an account then it can be managed and controlled from within the master account. Association ensures that a camera is being controlled by the appropriate user and not an unauthorized user.

A camera may be associated with a particular master account at the time of the device setup. During device setup the user is prompted to enter a master account and password. When doing so a secure communications channel may be opened up between camera and servers. Then a unique and difficult to guess key can be sent from the device to the server. Servers that have a master list of all keys then can associate that particular device via its serial number to a particular master account. A feature of this approach is that a user only needs to enter a password at the time of device setup. The user never needs to enter a password again and in fact passwords do not need to be stored on the device at all making them very secure.

Once a device has been associated with a master account it may be managed from the master account via an interface such as a web interface in accordance with some embodiments. The communication link between the device and server may in some cases be always encrypted and authenticated. This ensures that messages between device and server are secure and ensures that the device knows it is communicating with the server on behalf of the appropriate master account. Once the secure and authenticated link is established devices can connect to the server and are able to send and receive commands.

The device and server can have a common set of command codes and responses. Servers can send commands down to the camera s to enact specific behavior. For example the server can send remote configuration commands. These commands can be items such as changing the device address changing the nickname that is associated with the device changing the avatar image associated with the device. In addition to configuration the commands can be used to enact specific behavior on the device such as running network tests or taking a live image s from the camera. New commands and features can be added by extending the set of command codes on the device and server.

One command that can be issued from the server to the camera is a request for a live image s from the camera itself. When received by the device it turns on its camera takes an image s and proceeds to upload it the server in a secure location in a manner such that the images cannot be read or opened by others. Images for a particular device are all uploaded into a directory that is specific for that device.

In one embodiment when the master account user logs into the web interface the server sends a command to each of the camera devices that are associated with the master account to upload its live image. Each time an image is received by the server the web interface updates the live shot that is displayed for that device and sends a request to the camera to upload another live image shot.

Cameras can be configured to continuously upload their live images to the server. This can be done by configuring the device via its on screen user interface UI or by sending the appropriate command from the server to configure the camera to continuously upload its image. Images are uploaded in a manner in which the time the image was taken is marked. The frequency of image upload can be configured as well.

Once images are uploaded to the servers they can be post processed into time lapse videos. The start and end time of videos is configurable. For example videos can be generated for a day hour or week. Additionally the length of videos also depends on the frequency of image upload as well. In a non limiting example if a device uploads an image every 10 seconds and the server is configured to process images at a rate of 30 frames second and time lapse videos are being generated for each day then the length of videos are approximately 1 10 images sec 86400 sec day 1 30 sec image 1 60 min sec 4.8 minutes.

In an aspect of some embodiments the image upload and video creation architecture is designed to be highly scalable. The cameras are designed to upload directly to the cloud storage. They do not need to upload to an intermediary server s and therefore avoids unnecessary bandwidth bottlenecks. The video creation architecture is also designed to be highly parallelizable. Servers process videos completely independently of one another. This is key as no centralized server is required to coordinate video creation amongst the worker servers. As the camera user base scales more worker servers can be brought online instantly to handle the video processing workload.

The web interface is engineered to easily share user generated time lapse videos with others. All videos that are generated are private by default i.e. only the master account owner can view videos generated by devices associated with the master account. The videos which are stored on the server can only be played when the master account owner is logged into the web interface for instance .

However if the master account owner desires he or she can share videos with others. When a video is shared a public link to the video is generated. This link can be emailed to others and allows others to click on a link to the video to access it.

An ICD or a PDD can be any device that is capable of communicating with a control server over a network and can provide any of a variety of types of video communication functionality Merely by way of example in some aspects an ICD or a PDD can be capable of providing pass through video audio to a display device and or audio playback device from another source such as a local content source and or overlaying such video audio with additional content generated or received by the ICD or the PDD . In other aspects an ICD or a PDD can comprise one or more sensors e.g. digital still cameras video cameras webcams security cameras microphones infrared sensors touch sensors and or the like and or can be capable using data acquired by such sensors of sensing the presence of a user identifying a user and or receiving user input from a user further an ICD or a PDD can be capable of performing some or all of the other functions described herein and or in the Related Applications. Hence in various embodiments an ICD or a PDD can be embodied by a video calling device such as any of the VCDs described in the 182 patent a video game console a streaming media player to name a few non limiting examples.

In one aspect of certain embodiments as described more fully with respect to below an ICD or a PDD can be placed functionally inline between a local content source and a display device. A local content source can be any device that provides an audio or video stream to a display device and thus can include without limitation a cable or satellite set top box STB an Internet Protocol television IPTV STB devices that generate video and or audio and or acquire video and or audio from other sources such as the Internet and provide that video audio to a display device hence a local content source can include devices such as a video game console a Roku streaming media player an AppleTV and or the like. When situated functionally inline between a local content source and a display device the ICD or the PDD can receive an audiovisual stream output from the local content source modify that audiovisual stream in accordance with the methods described herein in the 182 patent and or in the Mobile Presence Detection Application and provide the perhaps modified audiovisual stream as input to the display device. It should be noted however that in some cases the functionality of a local content source can be incorporated within an ICD or a PDD and or the functionality of an ICD or a PDD can be incorporated within a local content source further it should be appreciated that an ICD or a PDD which might or might not include local content source functionality can be disposed inline with one or more other local content sources or one or more other ICDs PDDs. Hence for example an ICD or a PDD with some local content source functionality such as a video game console might be disposed inline between one or more other local content sources or one or more other ICDs PDDs such as a cable STB satellite STB IPTV STB and or a streaming media player and a display device.

In an aspect of some embodiments the system can include a software client that can be installed on a computing device e.g. a laptop computer wireless phone tablet computer etc. that has a built in camera and or has a camera attached e.g. a USB webcam . This client can act as an interface to allow remote control of the built in and or attached camera on the computing device. In some embodiments the computing device might have a built in microphone s and or has a microphone s attached e.g. a table top microphone a wall mounted microphone and or a microphone removably mountable on a television on the ICD on the PDD and or on some other suitable user device or the like . The software client can alternatively and or additionally act as an interface to allow remote control of the built in and or attached microphone on the computing device. In some cases the camera and or microphone can be automatically or autonomously controlled to obtain optimal video and or audio input.

The system can further include a control server which can have any suitable hardware configuration and an example of one such configuration is described below in relation to . In one aspect the control server is a computer that is capable of receiving user input via a user interface and or performing operations for controlling the ICD s and or the PDD s for example as described in further detail below. As used with regard to the relationship between the control server and an ICD or a PDD the term control should be interpreted broadly to include any operations that operate configure or directly control the ICD or the PDD as well as operations that facilitate communication between the ICD or the PDD and other devices networks content sources and the like and or operations that provide processing support to an ICD and or a PDD . Merely by way of example however the control server can detect user presence identify authenticate users and or obtain and distribute content to present users. In other cases the control server can receive and or store user input and or user preferences that can specify whether and how presence information should be used whether and how the user s ICD s and or PDD s may be used in the distributed infrastructure whether and how the user s content and profiles should be handled under certain situations and or the like.

For example preferences might specify which content or other information should be delivered to a user when present at a device not owned by the user whether presence information should be collected for that user at all and or where such information should be collected for example a user might specify that his presence should only be monitored in selected locations or from selected devices and the control server might remove that user s profile from the search universe when provided with presence information from a device not at the selected location or from a device other than one of the selected devices. More generally the user preference can include any types of parameters related to collecting presence information using presence information and or serving content. These preferences might be stored in a user profile at the control server which might also include other user specific information such as the user s normal location s identifying information such as MAC address etc. of other user devices owned by or associated with the user lists of or links to content owned by the user and or the like.

In some embodiments user preferences might specify how the user would like his or her user devices to participate or not in a distributed infrastructure arrangement. For instance the user preferences might include without limitation preferences indicating whether or not to allow a user device owned by the user to be used for distributed infrastructure preferences indicating what type of software applications customer data and or media content of other user device users and or subscribers of a cloud service are permitted to be hosted on a user device owned by the user and or preferences indicating amount of resources of a user device to dedicate to the distributed infrastructure etc. In some embodiments in addition to indicating how a user s user device may be used in distributed infrastructure implementation user preferences might allow a user to indicate how the user s own applications data and or media content may be hosted on other users user devices. For example the user might be given the option to encrypt any and or all personal data any and or all personal applications and or any and or all files or lists indicating which media content are associated with the user. Common media content which might include popular media content or any other media content may remain unencrypted for common usage by any number of users on any number of user devices subject only to any subscription rental or purchase restrictions on the particular media content as associated with any user and or any user device.

In some examples the user might indicate that her user device may be used for distributed processing but not distributed cloud based data storage or vice versa. Alternatively the user might indicate that her user device may be used for both distributed processing and distributed cloud based data storage. In some embodiments the user might allow the hosting on his or her user device of at least portions of software applications that are published by known and reputable software companies or published by companies on behalf of governmental agencies or the like while blocking hosting of software applications associated with marketing spam data mining and or potential copyright violations etc. These and other preferences related to distributed infrastructure functionality are described in greater detail in the Distributed Infrastructure Application which is already incorporated herein by reference .

With respect to video capture processing and distribution functionality user preferences might include without limitation preferences indicating one or more ICD s to associate with a master account preferences indicating under what conditions the one or more ICD s should automatically capture image data and or video data preferences indicating whether presence detection functionality as described in detail in the Mobile Presence Detection Application should or should not be enabled in a particular one s of the one or more ICD s preferences associated with transfer of captured image data and or captured video data preferences indicating whether or not and under what conditions captured image data and or video data should be post processed and how preferences indicating whether or not and under what conditions time lapse video segments should be generated based on captured image data and or video data and how and or the like.

The control server can provide a user interface which can be used by users of the ICDs and or the PDDs advertisers and or the like . The control server might also provide machine to machine interfaces such as application programming interfaces APIs data exchange protocols and the like which can allow for automated communications with the ICDs and or the PDDs etc. In one aspect the control server might be in communication with a web server and or might incorporate the web server which can provide the user interface e.g. over the network to a user computer not shown in and or a machine to machine interface. In another aspect the control server might provide such interfaces directly without need for a web server . Under either configuration the control server provides the user interface as that phrase is used in this document. In some cases some or all of the functionality of the control server might be implemented by the ICD and or the PDD itself.

In an aspect the user interface allows users to interact with the control server and by extension the ICDs and or the PDDs . A variety of user interfaces may be provided in accordance with various embodiments including without limitation graphical user interfaces that display for a user display fields on display screens for providing information to the user and or receiving user input from a user.

Merely by way of example in some embodiments the control server may be configured to communicate with a user computer not shown in via a dedicated application running on the user computer in this situation the user interface might be displayed by the user computer based on data and or instructions provided by the control server . In this situation providing the user interface might comprise providing instructions and or data to cause the user computer to display the user interface. In other embodiments the user interface may be provided from a web site e.g. by providing a set of one or more web pages which might be displayed in a web browser running on the user computer and or might be served by the web server . As noted above in various embodiments the control system might comprise the web server and or be in communication with the web server such that the control server provides data to the web server to be incorporated in web pages served by the web server for reception and or display by a browser at the user computer.

The network specific examples of which are described below with regard to can be any network wired or wireless that is capable of providing communication between the control server and the ICDs and or the PDDs and or of providing communication between the control server and or the web server and a user computer. In a specific embodiment the network can comprise the Internet and or any Internet service provider ISP access networks that provide Internet access to the control server the user computer and or the ICDs and or the PDDs .

In some embodiments the system can include a cloud storage system which can be used as described in further detail below to store advertisements presence information images and or video that are captured and uploaded by the ICDs and or the PDDs and or the like. In some cases the cloud storage system might be a proprietary system operated by an operator of the control server . In other cases the cloud storage system might be operated by a third party provider such as one of the many providers of commercially available cloud services. In yet a further embodiment the cloud storage system might be implemented by using resources compute memory storage network etc. shared by a plurality of ICDs and or by a plurality of PDDs that are distributed among various users of the system. Merely by way of example as described in further detail below and in the Distributed Infrastructure Application already incorporated by reference herein a plurality of user ICDs and or PDDs might each have some dedicated resources such as a storage partition which are dedicated for use by the system and or some ad hoc resources such as network bandwidth memory compute resources etc. that are available to the system when not in use by a user. Such resources can be used as cloud storage and or can be used to provide a distributed cloud like platform on which a control server can run as a virtual machine cloud container and or the like.

According to some embodiments ICD might comprise a first video input interface to receive first video input from a first local content source which in some embodiments can include a STB and or the like and a first audio input interface to receive first audio input form the first local content source. ICD might further comprise a first video output interface to provide first video output to a first video display device and a first audio output interface to provide first audio output to a first audio receiver. In some cases the first video display device and the first audio receiver might be embodied in the same device e.g. a TV with built in speaker system or the like . With the input and output interfaces ICD might provide pass through capability for video and or audio between the first local content source and the first display device. In some instances high definition multimedia interface HDMI cables or other suitable HD signal cables may be used to provide the interconnections for the pass through. ICD may in some cases comprise a first video capture device to capture at least one of first image data or first video data and a first audio capture device to capture first audio data. ICD may also comprise a first network interface at least one first processor and a first storage medium in communication with the at least one first processor.

In some aspects a plurality of ICDs might be communicatively coupled together in a network e.g. network each ICD being located in one of a plurality of customer premises. For implementing distributed infrastructure for cloud computing cloud based application hosting and or cloud based data storage a computer might establish one or more ICDs of the plurality of ICDs as distributed infrastructure elements and might provide at least one of one or more software applications customer data and or media content to the one or more ICDs for hosting on the one or more ICDs . These and other functionalities of the ICDs related to distributed infrastructure are described in greater detail in the Distributed Infrastructure Application already incorporated by reference herein .

Merely by way of example in some aspects a user can remotely access and control one or more ICDs over a network. For example in a web based implementation a user could log into the user s master account by accessing a website hosted on a web server e.g. web server which might be hosted on a cloud server hosted on distributed PDDs hosted on distributed ICDs and or the like and entering commands into a user interface e.g. user interface associated with access and control of the user s ICD s . In some instances the user might access and interact with the user interface over the network e.g. network by using a user computer selected from a group consisting of a laptop computer a desktop computer a tablet computer a smart phone a mobile phone a portable computing device and or the like. In an application based or app based implementation the user might interact with a software application or app running on the user s user device which might include without limitation a laptop computer a desktop computer a tablet computer a smart phone a mobile phone a portable computing device and or the like. The app might include another user interface similar to the web based user interface that might allow for access and control of the user s ICD s or any paired ICD s over the network e.g. network .

In some embodiments access and control of one or more ICD s may be permitted in response to identification and or authentication of the user by a PDD PDD as described in detail herein and in the Mobile Presence Detection Application. In some embodiments a PDD might comprise a second video input interface to receive second video input from a second local content source which in some embodiments might include a STB and or the like and a second audio input interface to receive second audio input from the second local content source. PDD might further comprise a second video output interface to provide second video output to a second video display device and a second audio output interface to provide second audio output to a second audio receiver. In some cases as with ICD above the second video display device and the second audio receiver might be embodied in the same device e.g. a TV with built in speaker system or the like . With the input and output interfaces PDD might provide pass through capability for video and or audio between the second local content source and the second display device. In some instances high definition multimedia interface HDMI cables or other suitable HD signal cables may be used to provide the interconnections for the pass through. PDD may in some cases comprise a second video capture device to capture at least one of second image data or second video data and a second audio capture device to capture second audio data. PDD might also comprise a second network interface at least one second processor and a second storage medium in communication with the at least one second processor. Similar to the ICDs a plurality of PDDs may be communicatively coupled together in a network e.g. network as distributed infrastructure elements for implementing distributed infrastructure for cloud computing cloud based application hosting and or cloud based data storage.

Once a user has been automatically identified and or authenticated by a user device having identification and or authentication functionality e.g. by a PDD as described herein or as described in the Mobile Presence Detection Application regardless of whether or not the user is associated with or owns such user device the user may be provided with access and control of the ICD s over the network. Such access and control as discussed above may be in the form of web based user interfaces app based user interfaces or other suitable user interfaces. Such user interfaces might be customized automatically based on the user preferences i.e. based on the video capture processing and distribution user preferences discussed above . In some instances the user interfaces might be configured to allow addition modification and or deletion of such user preferences. According to some embodiments the user interfaces might provide the user with options for uploading locally storing cloud storing distributing sharing processing and or otherwise handling captured image data and or video data from the ICD s . Some of these options may be preselected or established as default settings in the user preferences. In some cases processing of captured image data and or video data from the ICD s might include without limitation annotating sharpening and or otherwise manipulating the captured image data and or video data and in some embodiments might also include generating time lapse video clips segments based on the captured image data and or video data.

In some cases the user device e.g. PDD might be configured to determine whether the user is no longer present. Based on such a determination access and control of the ICD s over the network as well as access and control over any image data and or video data captured by said ICD s whether in the raw or processed state may be blocked. Blocking such access and control may include automatically logging out of the web based or app based user interface or the like.

Turning to the method might comprise registering a master account for a user block . In accordance with various embodiments registering a master account for a user can comprise a variety of operations. Merely by way of example registering a master account can comprise creating a database entry for a particular user and or assigning authentication credentials to that user these credentials can be used to access the master account as described in further detail below.

The method can also include assigning one or more ICDs to the master account block . For instance the user might identify any ICDs that the user owns or is otherwise associated with e.g. members of the user s family might be associated with the devices owned by the user and the system can assign those ICDs to the user s master account. According to some embodiments the user s master account might include any suitable number of sub accounts. In one example each member of the user s family might be associated with a sub account linked with the master account. In some instances the user or some members of his or her family might have a work school sub account and a home sub account the former being associated with profiles and or media content appropriate for school or work while the latter being associated with all or all other profiles and or media content. In some embodiments the master account and the plurality of sub accounts might be organized as a hierarchy with the master account being at the top of the hierarchical structure having full access to profiles and media content of each sub account the sub accounts at the next level having access to profiles and or media content of only those sub accounts that the master account has given access to and the sub accounts at lower levels having limited access to profiles and or media content. For example the user s master account might have access to all profiles and or media content associated with the master account and the sub accounts. The user can provide his or her spouse with a sub account having the same access to profiles and or media content while providing limited access to profiles and or media content to each of the user s children s sub account s . In some instances the user and or the user s spouse might impose limits on access to profiles and or media content for each of their work sub accounts.

In some cases each ICD might have an identifier such as a hardware identifier IP address nickname and or the like by which the system can address the ICD and assigning an ICD to the master account can comprise associating that identifier with the master account. When an ICD is assigned to a master account the user of that account will be able to access configure and or control the ICD through the control server for example as described in further detail below. In some cases the user might own a plurality of ICDs and might wish to control all of the ICDs from a single master account. In an aspect a user can identify such devices through a user interface to the control server.

In another aspect as described briefly above the assignment process can be simplified. When the user first configures an ICD usually locally but perhaps over the network the user can provide credentials to the ICD that associate the device with the master account. Thereafter the ICD might be configured to communicate with the control server and identify itself using those credentials at that point the control server can assign the ICD to the master account and no credentials need to be stored on the ICD from that point forward other than perhaps the ICD s own identifying information .

The method in the illustrated embodiment might further comprise providing a user interface to allow interaction between the user and the control server block . For example the user interface can be used to output information for a user e.g. by displaying the information on a display device printing information with a printer playing audio through a speaker etc. the user interface can also function to receive input from a user e.g. using standard input devices such as mice and other pointing devices motion capture devices touchpads and or touchscreens keyboards e.g. numeric and or alphabetic microphones etc. The procedures undertaken to provide a user interface therefore can vary depending on the nature of the implementation in some cases providing a user interface can comprise displaying the user interface on a display device in other cases however in which the user interface is displayed on a device remote from the computer system such as on a client computer wireless device etc. providing the user interface might comprise formatting data for transmission to such a device and or transmitting receiving and or interpreting data that is used to create the user interface on the remote device. Alternatively and or additionally the user interface on a client computer or any other appropriate user device might be a web interface in which the user interface is provided through one or more web pages that are served from a computer system and or a web server in communication with the computer system and are received and displayed by a web browser on the client computer or other capable user device . The web pages can display output from the computer system and receive input from the user e.g. by using Web based forms via hyperlinks electronic buttons etc. . A variety of techniques can be used to create these Web pages and or display receive information such as JavaScript Java applications or applets dynamic Hypertext Markup Language HTML and or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML or extensible markup language AJAX technologies to name but a few examples.

In many cases providing a user interface will comprise providing one or more display screens each of which includes one or more user interface elements. As used herein the term user interface element also described as a user interface mechanism or a user interface device means any text image or device that can be displayed on a display screen for providing information to a user and or for receiving user input. Some such elements are commonly referred to as widgets and can include without limitation text text boxes text fields tables and or grids menus toolbars charts hyperlinks buttons lists combo boxes checkboxes radio buttons and or the like. While any illustrated exemplary display screens might employ specific user interface elements appropriate for the type of information to be conveyed received by computer system in accordance with the described embodiments it should be appreciated that the choice of user interface elements for a particular purpose is typically implementation dependent and or discretionary. Hence the illustrated user interface elements employed by any display screens described herein should be considered exemplary in nature and the reader should appreciate that other user interface elements could be substituted within the scope of various embodiments.

As noted above in an aspect of certain embodiments the user interface provides interaction between a user and a computer system. Hence when this document describes procedures for displaying or otherwise providing information to a user or to receiving input from a user the user interface may be the vehicle for the exchange of such input output. Merely by way of example in a set of embodiments the user interface allows the user to log on to a master account access ICDs via the control server etc.

In an aspect of some embodiments the user logs onto his or her master account at the control server in order to access and or control ICDs assigned to that account. Accordingly at block the method can include authenticating the user with a set of credentials associated with the master account e.g. with any of several known authentication schemes such as a userid password challenge a certificate exchange process and or the like as well as authentication techniques described in further detail below that employ sensors on an ICD such as facial recognition voiceprint analysis gesture based identification spoken identifiers and or the like . Once the user has been authenticated the user interface can present the user with a variety of different information including without limitation information about status of ICDs assigned to the master account to which the user has logged on options for controlling such ICDs and or the like.

Thus in some aspects the method might further comprise receiving e.g. via a network such as the Internet to name one example user preferences block and in particular user preferences relating to the access and control of ICD s and or access and control of image data and or video data captured by the ICD s including without limitation preferences such as those described above.

In some aspects the method might further comprise receiving e.g. via a network such as the Internet to name one example a request from the user to remotely access an ICD s block . In an aspect the user can request such remote access by logging into his or her master account and requesting such access through the user interface. The user interface can provide many different mechanisms to allow the user to request access to an ICD s . Merely by way of example the user interface might provide a button or other widget associated with each ICD assigned to the account and the user can select the button widget associated with the ICD s the user would like control. The user interface then can provide options for different types of control that the user can impose on ICD s . For instance the user interface might have a list of commands from which the user can choose text input fields and or other widgets to select parameters such as image resolution number of images to capture link the video to capture time and or interval at which to capture images video and or the like . Based on these examples the skilled reader can appreciate that the user interface can provide any number of options to allow the user to control the selected ICD s .

If the user has assigned multiple ICDs to the master account the user might be presented with a list of the assigned devices in the user interface and receiving the user s request for access to one or more ICDs can include receiving a selection in the user interface of the one or more ICDs that the user would like to access. In accordance with some embodiments the user can access and or control multiple ICDs at once as long as those devices are assigned to the same master account . For example in a security setting the user might wish to configure multiple security cameras in the same way e.g. to collect images and or video on a particular interval and the user interface can allow the user to select all desired cameras and control all of the selected cameras in the same way or in different ways. This functionality can also be used for example to update settings in multiple ICDs at the same time to update firmware and or software in multiple ICDs at the same time and or the like.

In a set of embodiments the method can include accessing the selected ICD s from the control server over the network block . Accessing an ICD s can comprise any operation that establishes communication between the control server and the ICD s . For instance as noted above an ICD s often will be identifiable and or addressable by an identifier such as an IP address etc. and accessing the device can comprise communicating with the ICD s using any suitable protocol at the appropriate IP address. In some cases the control server will establish a secure connection with the ICD s . Merely by way of example in one embodiment the control server will authenticate the ICD s and or the ICD s will authenticate the control server e.g. using a mutual authentication protocol such as certificate exchange and or the like and or the control server will establish an encrypted communication session with the ICD s e.g. using any of a variety of known security techniques such as secure sockets layer communications IPSec tunnels and or the like .

As noted above in a set of embodiments the system can include a software client that can be installed on a computing device that comprises or is in communication with an ICD s . Examples of such ICD s can include without limitation an onboard camera on a tablet wireless phone laptop etc. and or a separate USB camera such as a webcam to provide a couple of examples. Any number of devices that have a software controllable camera and supports software installation can serve as such a computing device in accordance with different embodiments. In such embodiments accessing an ICD s can comprise the control server communicating with that software client which in turn can provide the control server with indirect access to the ICD s e.g. by interfacing with the computing device s operating system framework for controlling the ICD s .

The method can also include controlling the ICD s over the network block based on the user input received via the user interface. Although the method describes the control operations from the perspective of the control server it should be appreciated that certain embodiments feature ICDs that operate in response to control by the control server. So for example when this document refers to causing an ICD to take some action the skilled reader will appreciate that certain embodiments include ICDs that perform the described action in response to the control input from the control server.

Controlling the ICD can comprise a variety of operations and those operations often will depend on what the user has requested. Merely by way of example in some cases controlling the ICD can comprise receiving user input for remotely configuring the ICD s block . The control server might configure a behavior of the ICD s based on the received user input block . Such functionality can include causing the ICD s to capture images or video as described above but can also include changing an operating parameter of the ICD s such as an address e.g. IP address or other identifier of the device changing or assigning a nickname of the device changing or assigning an avatar image associated with the device and or the like.

In some cases the control server controls the ICD s by sending one or more command codes to the ICD s . These command codes can be used to provide the control described above such as causing the ICD s to capture images configuring the ICD s and or the like as well as to provide other commands such as causing the ICD s to perform a network test and or perform other suitable operations such as those described above as well as operations like checking WiFi signal strength adjusting camera orientation e.g. pan tilt and or capture e.g. focal length white balance parameters changing device configuration e.g. time zone parameters restarting the device and or the like. In an aspect the control server and the ICD s might share a set of command codes which both devices understand to represent desired commands and the method can include modifying the set of command codes and or transmitting the modified set of codes to the ICD s block . This capability can provide for upgradability and or advanced remote functionality as new features are developed. Similarly the control server can transmit updated firmware software to the ICD s and or control the ICD s to update its firmware as necessary.

Merely by way of example in some cases controlling the ICD s can comprise causing the ICD s to capture an image and or a video segment block . Additionally and or alternatively controlling the ICD s can include at block causing the ICD s to upload the captured image or video segment to the control server and or to a specified location on the network which might be specified by the user e.g. via the user interface and or might be specified by the system itself without user input which might then be received at block . In some cases the specified location might be a cloud storage system such as that provided by Amazon Web Services and or the like. In an aspect of some embodiments the system can cause the ICD s to upload the image and or video directly to the cloud environment without transmitting the image video to any intermediary server including the control server itself or any other device preventing bottlenecks in the upload process. Merely by way of example the command from the control server might include a URL pointing to a location in the cloud environment to which the image video should be uploaded.

In a particular set of embodiments the system might segment the storage environment whether a cloud storage environment or otherwise into partitions e.g. directories etc. that are assigned to particular master accounts and or within such partitions subpartitions assigned to individual ICDs assigned to those master accounts. Hence the method might comprise storing the video image in a location assigned to that master account and or ICD s . In a particular set of embodiments the system might provide the master account with control over access to the uploaded files e.g. by allowing the authenticated user to specify whether a given file or set of files should be available only to the user to others specified by the user or to the public. In any case the system might assign a uniform resource locator URL to the uploaded images video and or might provide that URL to the user e.g. via the user interface so that the user can access the files at a later time share the URL with others and or the like. The URL might be private e.g. accessible only to the master account or public e.g. accessible to anyone and in particular to whom the user gives the URL .

In some embodiments the control server might perform post processing of captured image video data block . Post processing of captured image video data might include without limitation annotating sharpening and or otherwise manipulating the captured image data and or video data. In some cases the control server might instruct the ICD s to capture images at a specified interval and or might create a time lapse video from the captured images block .

According to some aspects the method at block can comprise providing one or more of the processed image video data the captured image video data the time lapse video and or live image video data feeds over the network for display e.g. on a display device of a user computing device associated with the user and or the like . For example the method might include displaying the processed image video segment the captured image video data the time lapse video and or the live image video segment via the user interface. For example a web page that provides the user interface might include a frame window or applet that displays an image or video segment uploaded from the ICD s . In a particular aspect the control server might obtain the image video from the location to which the ICD s uploaded the image segment and or the control server and or web server might insert into the web page an anchor that references the image video in another location such as a location in a cloud storage system where the image video was uploaded . In an embodiment in which the system causes the ICD s to capture a plurality of images the system might refresh the user interface to display each image as it is uploaded.

In one aspect method might further comprise at block receiving user input from the user for remote sharing of selected image video data including without limitation one or more of the processed image video data the captured image video data the time lapse video and or the live image video data feeds etc. . In some instances a user interface either web based or app based user interface which might be the same or different from the user interfaces described above might be used to receive said user input. At block method might further comprise distributing the selected image video data to identified recipients for sharing with these identified recipients.

The amount of control imposed by the control server can vary according to embodiment and implementation. Merely by way of example as noted above in some embodiments there might be no control server and the ICD s might incorporate all the functionality described herein with regard to the control server including peer to peer functionality with other ICDs. In other embodiments the control server might provide fairly fine grained control over the ICD s such as instructing the camera to capture images for purposes of determining presence and or the control server may receive the images directly and perform the presence determination identification and or authentication procedures at the controls server. The division of responsibility between the control server and the ICD s can fall anywhere along this spectrum. In some cases for instance the control server might provide the user preferences to the ICD s which then is responsible for collecting presence information in accordance with those preferences and transmitting the presence information to the control server which takes the appropriate action in response to the presence information such as selecting an advertisement based on the presence information. Alternatively and or additionally the ICD s itself might be responsible for taking such actions.

Turning to the method might comprise registering a master account for a user block . This master account may be the same master account as the master account described in block or may be a different master account. In accordance with various embodiments registering a master account for a user can comprise a variety of operations. Merely by way of example registering a master account can comprise creating a database entry for a particular user and or assigning authentication credentials to that user these credentials can be used to access the master account as described in further detail below.

The method can also include assigning one or more PDDs PDDs to the master account block . As discussed above the one or more PDDs can be embodied by a video calling device such as any of the VCDs described in the 182 patent a laptop computer a desktop computer a mobile phone a smart phone a tablet computer a video game console and or a streaming media player to name a few non limiting examples. For instance the user might identify any PDDs that the user owns or is otherwise associated with e.g. members of the user s family might be associated with the devices owned by the user and the system can assign those PDDs to the user s master account. According to some embodiments the user s master account might include any suitable number of sub accounts. In one example each member of the user s family might be associated with a sub account linked with the master account. In some instances the user or some members of his or her family might have a work school sub account and a home sub account the former being associated with profiles and or media content appropriate for school or work while the latter being associated with all or all other profiles and or media content. In some embodiments the master account and the plurality of sub accounts might be organized as a hierarchy with the master account being at the top of the hierarchical structure having full access to profiles and media content of each sub account the sub accounts at the next level having access to profiles and or media content of only those sub accounts that the master account has given access to and the sub accounts at lower levels having limited access to profiles and or media content. For example the user s master account might have access to all profiles and or media content associated with the master account and the sub accounts. The user can provide his or her spouse with a sub account having the same access to profiles and or media content while providing limited access to profiles and or media content to each of the user s children s sub account s . In some instances the user and or the user s spouse might impose limits on access to profiles and or media content for each of their work sub accounts.

In some cases each PDD might have an identifier such as a hardware identifier IP address nickname and or the like by which the system can address the PDD and assigning a PDD to the master account can comprise associating that identifier with the master account. When a PDD is assigned to a master account the user of that account will be able to access configure and or control the PDD through the control server for example as described in further detail below. In some cases the user might own a plurality of PDDs and might wish to control all of the PDDs from a single master account. In an aspect a user can identify such devices through a user interface to the control server.

In another aspect as described briefly above the assignment process can be simplified. When the user first configures a PDD usually locally but perhaps over the network the user can provide credentials to the PDD that associate the device with the master account. Thereafter the PDD might be configured to communicate with the control server and identify itself using those credentials at that point the control server can assign the PDD to the master account and no credentials need to be stored on the PDD from that point forward other than perhaps the PDD s own identifying information .

Hence the method in the illustrated embodiment might further comprise providing a user interface to allow interaction between the user and the control server block . For example the user interface can be used to output information for a user e.g. by displaying the information on a display device printing information with a printer playing audio through a speaker etc. the user interface can also function to receive input from a user e.g. using standard input devices such as mice and other pointing devices motion capture devices touchpads and or touchscreens keyboards e.g. numeric and or alphabetic microphones etc. The procedures undertaken to provide a user interface therefore can vary depending on the nature of the implementation in some cases providing a user interface can comprise displaying the user interface on a display device in other cases however in which the user interface is displayed on a device remote from the computer system such as on a client computer wireless device etc. providing the user interface might comprise formatting data for transmission to such a device and or transmitting receiving and or interpreting data that is used to create the user interface on the remote device. Alternatively and or additionally the user interface on a client computer or any other appropriate user device might be a web interface in which the user interface is provided through one or more web pages that are served from a computer system and or a web server in communication with the computer system and are received and displayed by a web browser on the client computer or other capable user device . The web pages can display output from the computer system and receive input from the user e.g. by using Web based forms via hyperlinks electronic buttons etc. . A variety of techniques can be used to create these Web pages and or display receive information such as JavaScript Java applications or applets dynamic Hypertext Markup Language HTML and or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML or extensible markup language AJAX technologies to name but a few examples.

In many cases providing a user interface will comprise providing one or more display screens each of which includes one or more user interface elements. As used herein the term user interface element also described as a user interface mechanism or a user interface device means any text image or device that can be displayed on a display screen for providing information to a user and or for receiving user input. Some such elements are commonly referred to as widgets and can include without limitation text text boxes text fields tables and or grids menus toolbars charts hyperlinks buttons lists combo boxes checkboxes radio buttons and or the like. While any illustrated exemplary display screens might employ specific user interface elements appropriate for the type of information to be conveyed received by computer system in accordance with the described embodiments it should be appreciated that the choice of user interface elements for a particular purpose is typically implementation dependent and or discretionary. Hence the illustrated user interface elements employed by any display screens described herein should be considered exemplary in nature and the reader should appreciate that other user interface elements could be substituted within the scope of various embodiments.

As noted above in an aspect of certain embodiments the user interface provides interaction between a user and a computer system. Hence when this document describes procedures for displaying or otherwise providing information to a user or to receiving input from a user the user interface may be the vehicle for the exchange of such input output. Merely by way of example in a set of embodiments the user interface allows the user to log on to a master account access PDDs via the control server etc.

In an aspect of some embodiments the user logs onto his or her master account at the control server in order to access and or control PDDs assigned to that account. Accordingly at block the method can include authenticating the user with a set of credentials associated with the master account e.g. with any of several known authentication schemes such as a userid password challenge a certificate exchange process and or the like as well as authentication techniques described in further detail below that employ sensors on a PDD such as facial recognition voiceprint analysis gesture based identification spoken identifiers and or the like . Once the user has been authenticated the user interface can present the user with a variety of different information including without limitation information about status of PDDs assigned to the master account to which the user has logged on options for controlling such PDDs and or the like.

Thus in some aspects the method might further comprise receiving e.g. via a network such as the Internet to name one example user preferences block and in particular user preferences relating to the collection and or use of presence information including without limitation preferences such as those described above. The method then can further include controlling and or configuring the PDD in some cases based at least in part on the user preferences block . Merely by way of example the user might have specified in the user preferences that the PDD should not be used to collect presence information at all in which case that feature might be turned off at the PDD. In the case that the user preferences indicate that presence information should be turned off e.g. privacy settings may be set high either permanently or temporarily and or with respect to certain user established and or preset conditions or the like some embodiments might establish a blocking feature for the user when other PDDs send presence information for comparison matching processes with database user biometrics the effect of which being that no match can be made and thus the user s profiles and or media content and or access thereto is not ported to the other PDDs. Alternatively and or additionally the user might have specified some limitations on the collection of presence information such as about whom such information may be collected times at which information can be collected and or purposes for which information may be collected to name a few examples . Of course in some embodiments these preferences can be set directly at the PDD e.g. through a menu system displayed on a video device. It should also be recognized that some preferences such as with whom presence information can be shared might not affect the PDD and might be saved and or operated on at the control server instead.

The amount of control imposed by the control server can vary according to embodiment and implementation. Merely by way of example as noted above in some embodiments there might be no control server and the PDD might incorporate all the functionality described herein with regard to the control server including peer to peer functionality with other PDDs. In other embodiments the control server might provide fairly fine grained control over the PDD such as instructing the camera to capture images for purposes of determining presence and or the control server may receive the images directly and perform the presence determination identification and or authentication procedures at the control server. The division of responsibility between the control server and the PDD can fall anywhere along this spectrum. In some cases for instance the control server might provide the user preferences to the PDD which then is responsible for collecting presence information in accordance with those preferences and transmitting the presence information to the control server which takes the appropriate action in response to the presence information such as selecting an advertisement based on the presence information. Alternatively and or additionally the PDD itself might be responsible for taking such actions.

At block the method can comprise collecting presence information. A variety of operations might be involved in the collection of presence information. For example in some cases the PDD captures one or more images of at least a portion of a room where it is located and or of a user present in the room block . Such images can be digital still images a digital video stream and or the like. In other cases the method can include capturing audio samples block identifying devices in proximity to the capturing device block and or the like for example as described above .

The method can further comprise analyzing one or more of the collected presence information block including one or more of the images video samples audio samples etc. Merely by way of example the images and or video samples might be analyzed with facial recognition software and or other biometric physiological recognition software which can be used to determine the number of people in the room with the PDD and or to identify any of such people e.g. by determining a name an age range a gender and or other identifying or demographic information about a user based on the output of the facial recognition software and or other biometric physiological recognition software . Alternatively and or additionally analyzing the images can comprise determining that a person is watching a display device for example using eye tracking software to identify a focus area of the person s eyes and correlating that focus area with the location on a screen or display of a television or other suitable display device . In some cases if the number of people and the identities or at least demographic characteristics of each of the people in the room can be determined analyzing the images can further include determining a collective demographic of the people in the room based for example on the demographic characteristics of a majority of people in the room . In further cases the method might analyze audio samples using voiceprint analysis compare user responses to stored challenge response information and or the like. As yet another example a camera of a PDD might capture user gestures which can be compared with stored gestures e.g. a particular pattern of hand waving a pattern of fingers displayed by the user etc. in a gesture based identification and or authentication scheme. It should be noted that many embodiments can use various combinations of such techniques such as a combination of facial analysis and spoken gestured or typed identifiers to name a few examples to provide two factor authentication.

Such analysis can be performed at the PDD and or at the control server. Accordingly in some embodiments the PDD will transmit presence information or other identifying information that can be used in part or in whole for identifying the user. Such identifying information can include raw or analyzed presence information as well as information derived from the presence information such as to name some examples extracted features from an image audio segment and or video segment an excerpted image video and or audio segment and or the like. Such presence information and or identifying information can be transmitted from the PDD to the control server block although as noted above this is not necessary in some embodiments e.g. where identifying the user or other analysis is performed at the PDD . Such transmission might comprise IP communications over the Internet perhaps over a secure channel such as a virtual private network VPN and as noted above the presence identifying information can include a wide variety of different types of information that enable the control server to determine presence and or identify authenticate a user. Hence at block the control server in a cloud based presence detection scheme might receive the transmitted presence information. In the case that raw presence information is received by the control server the control server might analyze the raw presence information in a similar manner as described above at block . At block the method comprises detecting and or determining presence of a user. This determination can be made by the PDD and or by the control server. In one case for example the PDD might transmit raw video segments raw images raw audio samples etc. to the server which might perform all analysis and presence determination. In another case the PDD might perform this analysis and might notify the control server that a user is present. Receiving such a notification at the control server can be considered to be the control server detecting presence of a user.

At block the method can include identifying and or authenticating a user. In some cases this identification and or authentication can be implicit in the operation of detecting user presence. For example in performing facial recognition to detect that a user is present the PDD and or control server might further analyze the same image to determine an identity of the present user. Alternatively however detection of user presence and identification authentication of the user might be performed as discrete steps and might depend on device capabilities . For example a PDD might have sufficient capabilities to detect the presence of the user and if so might send identifying information such as a captured image video sample audio sample etc. to the control server to actually identify the user. Alternatively the PDD might be capable of identifying the user on its own and might merely send the identity of the user i.e. data identifying the user such as a name username etc. to the server.

In some instances the PDD and or the control server i.e. in a cloud based presence scheme might have access to the user s profile or other personal information of the user including without limitation communications calendar items contacts list travel itinerary information IP address of user s PDD s or the like . Such profile or other personal information might indicate that the user is visiting a friend or relative in a different city state or country. In the case that the friend or family member has a similar PDD linked to a common network with the control server or other PDDs i.e. in a peer to peer or distributed computing scheme the user s PDD and or the control server if present might facilitate identification and or authentication of the user at the friend s or relative s PDD other PDD by for example sending the user s biometric physiological information to the other PDD and or to a data center local to the other PDD so as to reduce comparison matching times for identification authentication of the user at the other PDD. Such proactive autonomous facilitation functionality might in some cases be subject to the user s selection of such option in the user preferences e.g. at block above . In some cases the user might disable and or limit such functionality e.g. for privacy reasons for security reasons and or the like . In some embodiments the IP address of a PDD at which a user attempts to log in might be analyzed to determine the city in which the PDD is located. If the city or neighborhood or customer premises of the last PDD at which the user logged in or is otherwise authenticated by is determined to be different from the city or neighborhood or customer premises of the current PDD then it can be inferred that the user has moved or is travelling. Such inference may be used in some embodiments to further infer a general direction in which the user is travelling or to infer a potential destination s if sufficient numbers of data points locations are determined and can be used to send ahead the user s profile and or content to control servers and or PDDs that are at or near the determined potential destination s .

Once the present user has been identified and or authenticated the control server and or the PDD at which the user is present might control the ICD s ICD s over the network block in accordance with any or all of the processes in blocks as described in detail above with respect to .

Alternatively in some embodiments the PDD and the ICD might be the same user device in which case the ICD might detect presence of a user as described in detail above with respect to the PDD and might notify a computer about the detected presence of a user. Such an ICD might then receive over a network control instructions from the computer to capture image data or video data of the user based on the detected presence of the user and might control the ICD based at least in part on the control instructions received from the computer over the network. In a non limiting example a parent might desire retaining parental controls over a gaming console. So in the case that the parent is in his or her bedroom or out of town on a business trip for example a child who sneaks into the living room game room to play a game on the gaming console might trigger detection of the child s presence which might trigger a notification message to the parent e.g. an e mail message text message and or the like on the parent s mobile device including without limitation smart phone mobile phone portable computer tablet computer laptop computer and or the like or on a computing device including but not limited to a laptop computer a desktop computer and or the like . The parent can then send control instructions to the gaming console to take images or videos of the child and in some cases to initiate a video chat through the gaming console to tell the child to go to bed and or the like . The parent can thus remotely monitor the child through the video capture functionality of the gaming console to ensure that the child does go to bed or at least leaves the living room game room regardless of whether the child turns off the video capture functionality of the gaming console i.e. the parent can override the child s controls of at least the video capture feature of the gaming console etc. . The parent in some cases can even remotely turn off the gaming function of the gaming console and watch as the frustrated child returns to bed. In this example the transmission of the control instructions to the ICD in this case gaming console can be peer to peer from the parent s user device which can include e.g. a second ICD or second PDD or any of the mobile or computing devices discussed above and or the like or it can be via a central or control server over the network.

In some embodiments the method might further comprise determining that a user is no longer present at the PDD block . For example as noted above the system might continuously and or periodically capture images and perform presence determination techniques e.g. as described above to determine whether the user is still present and or might actively query the user after some period of time to determine whether the user is still present. If the system determines that the user is no longer present the system can block remote access and control of the ICD s from the PDD over the network block for example the system might delete any image or video content transmitted from the ICD s to the device log out of any services for controlling the ICD s that the system had logged into from the PDD revoke access to image and or video content captured by the ICD s and or post processed using raw captured image data or raw captured video data from the ICD s stored in the cloud and or the like. This functionality is particularly useful and applicable to PDDs or other devices that are neither owned nor associated with the user e.g. a friend s or relative s device devices at a vacation hotel or vacation rental property etc. . Such determination and content access removal might in some instances be based on a time out system e.g. 5 15 30 or 60 minutes etc. in which the system might account for the user s temporary absence from the room while protecting the access to profiles with which accessing and control of the ICD s may be associated and or content. In some cases the user can select specific time out periods which can be stored in the user s profile and such specific time out periods can be universally applicable to some or all profiles some or all media content or some or all profiles and media content or can be specific to particular profiles and or media content. In some cases user profiles might be associated with a much shorter time out period a time between 1 5 minutes compared with media content which might have a time out period ranging from 15 minutes to 3 hours or the like . The time out system might be based on a counter or clock system that starts counting from the last time the system recognized that the user was in range of any of the sensors of the PDD. Any suitable techniques other than the time out system described above may be implemented as appropriate.

The reader should note that a wide variety of presence based functions including without limitation those described in the Related Applications can be performed by the system in conjunction with various techniques described as part of the methods and or and that such functions can be combined in any suitable way. Merely by way of example the 603 Application described advertising techniques that can be implemented based on detected presence and such techniques can be integrated with various techniques described as part of the method and or method . For instance the system e.g. the control server the PDD the ICD etc. might obtain relevant advertising material as described in the 603 Application and display such advertising over content obtained and delivered using the techniques of the method and or method . Based on this disclosure the skilled reader will understand that such techniques can be combined in a number of different ways.

In a first ICD might correspond to ICD and or PDD while user device might correspond to non ICD or non PDD user device as described in detail above with respect to . Control server network and cloud storage system in the example of might correspond to control server network and cloud storage system respectively as described in detail above with respect to .

System might further comprise a local content source e.g. a local content source as described above a display device including without limitation a television TV and high definition HD data cables or any other suitable data transmission media . In some cases the HD data cables might include without limitation high definition multimedia interface HDMI cables. One or more of the first ICDs as shown in might be configured to provide pass through audio and or video from a local content source to a display device e.g. using data cables . Merely by way of example in some embodiments an HDMI input port in the first ICD allows HD signals to be input from the corresponding local content source and an HDMI output port in the first ICD allows HD signals to be output from the first ICD to the corresponding display device e.g. TV which might include but is not limited to an Internet Protocol TV IPTV an HDTV a cable TV or the like . The output HD signal may in some cases be the input HD signal modified by the first ICD . Local content source might be any suitable local content source. An noted above a local content source can be any device that provides an audio or video stream to a display device and thus can include without limitation a cable or satellite STB an IPTV STB devices that generate video and or audio and or acquire video and or audio from other sources such as the Internet and provide that video audio to a display device hence a local content source can include devices such as a video game console a Roku streaming media player an AppleTV and or the like. Hence when situated functionally inline between a local content source and a display device the first ICD can receive an audiovisual stream output from the local content source modify that audiovisual stream in accordance with the methods described in the 182 patent and provide the perhaps modified audiovisual stream as input to the display device . In some embodiments first ICD local content source display device and user device if any might be located at a first customer premises while first ICD local content source display device and user device if any might be located at a second customer premises

According to some embodiments system might further comprise one or more access points not shown each of which might be located in proximity to or in the first customer premises and or the second customer premises . The access point s can allow wireless communication between each first ICD and network . Of course a first ICD might also have a wired connection to an access point router residential gateway etc. such as via an Ethernet cable which can provide similar communication functionality In some cases as shown each first ICD might be communicatively coupled to network via either wired or wireless connection without routing through any access points. In some cases wired or wireless access to network allows first ICD to obtain profiles from cloud storage system and or media content from content server and media content database independent of the corresponding local content source which is in communication with a television TV distribution network either via wireless connection or via wired connection . In some cases not shown TV distribution network which could be for example a cable television distribution network a satellite television distribution network an Internet Protocol television IPTV distribution network and or the like might be communicatively coupled with content server and thus local content source might obtain media content from content server and media content database independently of ICD . Alternatively or in addition the television distribution network might be communicatively coupled to other content servers and or other media content sources not shown .

In this manner first ICD can overlay the input signal from the corresponding local content source with additional media content to produce an augmented output HD signal to the corresponding display device via data cables . This functionality allows for supplemental content which may be associated with the media content accessed by the local content source for display on display device to be accessed and presented using the first ICD in some cases as a combined presentation on the display device which may be one of an overlay arrangement e.g. a picture in picture PIP display with the supplemental content overlaid on the main content a split screen arrangement with the supplemental content adjacent to but not obscuring any portion of the main content a passive banner stream with non interactive supplemental content streaming in a banner s along one or more of a top bottom left or right edge of a display field in which the main content is displayed on display device and or an interactive banner stream with interactive supplemental content streaming in a banner s along one or more of a top bottom left or right edge of a display field in which the main content is displayed on display device . Herein examples of interactive supplemental content might include without limitation content that when streamed in a banner can be caused to slow stop and or replay within the banner in response to user interaction with the content and or the banner as opposed to passive banner streaming in which information is streamed in a manner uncontrollable by the user . The interactive supplemental content that is streamed in the banner may in some instances also allow the user to invoke operations or functions by interacting therewith for example by the user highlighting and or selecting the supplemental content e.g. an icon or still photograph of a character actor actress scene etc. associated with the main content links for related webpages links to further content stored in media content database or operations to display related content on display device and or user device may be invoked.

In some instances first ICD might detect the presence and or proximity of one or more user devices associated with the user and might based on user profile information associated with the user that is stored e.g. in cloud storage system automatically send supplemental media content via wireless link directly from first ICD or indirectly via an access point not shown for display on a display screen s of the one or more user devices . In one non limiting example a user associated with first ICD might have established a user profile stored in cloud storage system that indicates a user preference for any and all supplemental content for movies and television programs to be compiled and displayed on one or more user devices including but not limited to a tablet computer a smart phone a laptop computer and or a desktop computer etc. concurrent to display of the movie or television program being displayed on display device . In such a case when a movie is playing on display device broadcast or streamed via local content source from content server and media content database and or from some other content server and some other media content source via network first ICD accesses supplemental content if available from content server and media content database via network and sends the supplemental content to the users tablet computer and or smart phone via wireless link s . For example bios of actors actresses and or crew might be sent to the user s smart phone for display on the screen thereof while schematics of machines weapons robots tools etc. associated with the movie or television show might be sent to and displayed on the user s tablet computer behind the scenes videos or information news reviews associated with the main content and or music videos associated with the main content may also be sent to the user s smart phone and or tablet computer and so on.

In some embodiments system might further comprise one or more second ICDs including second ICD and second ICD which might be located in customer premises and respectively . The one or more second ICDs might have functionality similar to ICD and or PDD but may or may not necessarily possess pass through capability between a display device and a local content source as described above.

In some embodiments gaming may be enhanced by the functionality described above. For example a role player game RPG may be enhanced by supplemental content including but not limited to player statistics buy sell upgrade options for tools and weapons communications with other in game characters and or live friends playing the game etc. may be routed through the user s smart phone tablet computer or other suitable user device while the user is playing the RPG via the local content source game console and the display device . In some cases the video game in this case an RPG could be played on the ICD which as noted above can be embodied by a video game console. This allows for player multitasking without taking away from the gameplay on the main display screen i.e. the display device . For a first person shooter game similar multitasking functionality may be achieved. Cooperative game play may also be achieved using the functionality described above. In a non limiting example the user might control the shooting and the direct interactions with elements in the game using the main controls of the local content source game console while a friend uses the tablet computer for example to buy sell upgrade equipment and weapons to communicate with other characters and or players to keep track of enemies or the like. In an example of a jet fighter tank and or space ship shooter game or the like the user might control the flight and weapons as displayed on display device while the friend s keeps an eye on radar lidar sonar or other sensor readings of enemy craft handles status checks of weapons and ammunition takes care of maintenance and repairs and or establishes communications with in game characters and or players as displayed on one or more user device . These are merely some examples of the myriad arrays of possibilities enabled by the functionalities described above and thus are limited only by the imaginations of game developers and players for enhancing multiplayer multitasking game play.

According to some embodiments the detection of the presence of the user device by the first ICD might allow identification of a user and thus access of profiles and or content associated with the user s account regardless of whether the first ICD is owned by and or associated with the user. Herein the user s media content might include without limitation at least one of purchased video content purchased audio content purchased video game purchased image content rented video content rented audio content rented video game rented image content user generated video content user generated audio content user generated video game content user generated image content and or free media content while the user s profiles might include but is not limited to one or more of user profile information for a video game or video game console web browser history and or bookmarks contact information for the user s contacts user profile information for video or audio content including without limitation recommended content device preferences user profile information for cloud services and or the like. In some cases the user s profile might also include identifying information including but not limited to the user s biometric information e.g. facial characteristics voice characteristics fingerprint characteristics iris characteristics pupil characteristics retinal characteristics etc. or the like. In some examples the user profile information for cloud services might include user log in information e.g. username account number and or password passphrase etc. or other suitable credentials for cloud services which might include without limitation video calling service voice calling service video broadcast streaming service audio broadcast streaming service on line gaming service banking financial services travel accommodation rental vehicle services and or dining entertainment event reservation ticketing services or the like.

In one example a user might be associated with first ICD located in the first customer premises while her friend might be associated with first ICD located in the second customer premises and the user and the friend are both subscribers of a similar service provided by control server and or the cloud service provider associated with control server . When the user visits her friend the friend s first ICD might first detect presence of the user by querying and or obtaining the identification information for the user s smart phone and or tablet computer or the like by capturing video image and or voice data of the user by infrared detection of a living person in the room and or by audio detection of a living person in the room etc. The friend s first ICD might then identify the user using the user s device s identification information and or the captured video image and or voice data or might send such presence information to control server for identification and authentication analysis. In some cases detecting presence of or identifying authenticating the user might include without limitation analyzing captured images or video segments using one or more of facial recognition software pupil iris recognition software retinal identification software fingerprint analysis software and or physiology recognition software analyzing captured audio samples using one or more of voiceprint analysis and or comparison with stored challenge response information and or identification of a user device owned by and or associated with the user e.g. based on identification information of the device which may be previously associated with the user or the user s profile s etc. . In terms of detection of the presence of the user s device any suitable technique may be implemented including but not limited to at least one of detecting a Bluetooth connection of the user device detecting that the user device is associated with a WiFi access point with which the ICD has associated and or communicating with the user device using near field communication NFC .

Once the user has been identified and authenticated control server might send copies of the user s profiles and or content to first ICD either from first ICD and or from cloud storage system or the like or at least provide the user with access to her profiles and or content from her friend s first ICD . In some embodiments the identification and authentication processes might include comparing the user device identification information and or the captured video image and or voice data against all similar identification data for all users subscribers of the cloud service that are stored in cloud storage system . In some cases the process might be facilitated where first ICDs and might already be associated with each other e.g. where the user has previously made a video call from first ICD to her friend on first ICD where the user might have added the friend to the user s contact list and or where the friend might have added the user to the friend s contact list . In other cases the user s first ICD might have access to the user s calendar and or communications which might indicate that the user is visiting the friend. The first ICD might query control server to determine whether the friend has a first ICD associated with the cloud service provider. In this example the first ICD determines that first ICD is part of the same service and or is in communication with control server and based on such determination first ICD and or control server might send the user s profiles and or content to first ICD and or provide first ICD with access to the user s profiles and or content. In some embodiments the user s profiles and or content or access to profiles and or content might be encrypted and might be released decrypted upon identification and or authentication by first ICD and or by control server when the user is detected by first ICD . In this manner the user s profiles and or content can follow the user wherever she goes so long as there is a device e.g. first ICD that is associated with the same or affiliate cloud service provider at her destination and so long as the device can recognize and authenticate the user.

By the same token if the user is no longer detected by the first ICD either after a predetermined number of prompts or queries for the user and or after a predetermined period of time e.g. after a specified number of minutes hours days weeks months etc. first ICD and or control server might determine that the user is no longer present at the location of first ICD . Based on such a determination first ICD and or control server might remove the user s profiles and or media content or access thereto from first ICD . As described above a time out system might be utilized. Alternatively other suitable systems may be used for determining the user is no longer present and removing the user s profiles and or media content or access thereto from the first ICD
