The present technology pertains to suggesting content and more specifically pertains to recommending applications compatible with a content management system.

Online content storage is becoming more popular. People frequently store access or otherwise interact with content stored at online content management systems. Documents pictures music videos and other types of files or data can be stored at online content management systems to be accessed by users of the content management systems. Similarly applications are becoming more commonplace. People use applications on their computing devices every day and applications are growing in number and in function.

In some cases applications can be configured to be compatible or operable with an online content management system. For example third party software developers can create applications to be used in conjunction with the online content management system. Some applications can enhance or add functionality to the online content management system. However as the number of applications being created and developed for the online content management system is increasing users of the online content management system may not think of know of or otherwise recognize applications that might be of interest to them.

Downloading applications that are of little or no interest to a particular user can be inefficient in terms of utilizing computing resources of the particular user s computing device. Applications that are of little or no interest to the particular user can also cause negative results for the applications developers. Thus applications that are of little or no interest to the particular user can reduce the overall experience associated with using applications.

Additional features and advantages of the disclosure will be set forth in the description which follows and in part will be obvious from the description or can be learned by practice of the herein disclosed principles. The features and advantages of the disclosure can be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. These and other features of the disclosure will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims or can be learned by the practice of the principles set forth herein.

Disclosed are systems methods and non transitory computer readable storage media for recommending applications compatible with a content management system. In some embodiments the present disclosure can utilize a collaborative filtering approach and obtain e.g. receive information about associations between users e.g. user accounts of the content management system and applications also referred to as Apps compatible with the content management system. The information about the associations can be obtained by the content management system because developers of the applications must communicate with and get permission from the content management system in order to make applications that are compatible with the content management system. Analysis of the information about the associations between the users e.g. user accounts and the applications can lead to recognition of correlations among certain applications and or users e.g. user accounts .

In some cases patterns between users and applications can be determined based on analysis of the information about the associations between the users e.g. user accounts and the applications. For example if a sufficiently large quantity of users e.g. user accounts who are engaged with Apps A B and E are also engaged with App F then it can be determined that there is likely a pattern or correlation between Apps A B E and F. In this example the pattern correlation can suggest that users who are engaged with Apps A B and E also tend to be engaged with App F. In some embodiments engaging with an application can refer to having installed the application interacting with the application and or using the application.

In some cases automatic predictions can be made based on the information about the associations. Continuing with the previous example if a new user e.g. new user account not yet processed user account etc. engages with Apps A B and E but not yet with App F then App F can be recommended to the user.

It is important to note that the examples discussed herein are for illustrative purposes only. A person having ordinary skill in the art would recognize various other manners or approaches that can be utilized consistent with the scope of the present disclosure.

In some embodiments the present disclosure can utilize a classifier approach and obtain information about a plurality of attributes also known as signals related to usage of the content management system by the users. In one example an attribute can indicate a type of a computing device used by each user e.g. used with each user account to interact with the content management system. Another example attribute can indicate an operating system running on the computing device used by each user. A further example attribute can indicate how many files are stored and or shared by each user e.g. each user account via the content management system. Based on at least some of the plurality of attributes the disclosed technology can attempt to identify correlations among the attributes applications and or users e.g. user accounts . For instance various embodiments can observe that users who use tablet devices running Operating System B OS B and who share large image files with other users tend to be engaged with App D. As such App D can be recommended to a user who uses the content management system with an OS B tablet device and who also shares large image files with other users.

Moreover in some embodiments a social connection approach can be utilized by the disclosed technology. Various embodiments can obtain data about social connections associated with each user e.g. each user account . A user can be socially connected to another user if they have shared content e.g. shared files shared folders shared data etc. . The content management system can have access to the data about the social connections associated with the users e.g. user accounts of the content management system. Various embodiments of the present disclosure can take into consideration applications that are used by the user s social connections e.g. other users with whom the user has shared content . Recommending applications to the user e.g. user account can be based at least in part on what applications the user s social connections have.

In some embodiments the information about the associations the information about the plurality of attributes and or the data about the social connections can be input into one or more machine learning algorithms to produce one or more models that can find or identify correlations between the associations attributes social connections users and or applications. Recommendations for applications can then be based on the one or more models. For example supervised learning can be utilized to generate the one or more models. The information about the associations the information about the plurality of attributes and or the data about the social connections can be already labeled classified or known. In other words the information and data can include various inputs as well as the appropriate outputs that should result from those inputs e.g. if User J engages with App X and runs a OS A device then he should likely be interested in App Y . Then using a supervised learning algorithm the models can be inferred from the information about the associations the information about the plurality of attributes and or the data about the social connections. In other words in this example the supervised learning algorithm can analyze the various information and data to generate the models. It is further contemplated that a person having ordinary skill in the art would recognize various other manners or approaches that can be utilized consistent with the scope of the present disclosure.

In some embodiments a first model can be generated based on the information about the associations a second model can be generated based on the information about the plurality of attributes and a third model can be generated based on the data about the social connections. Applications can then be recommended for a selected user based on the first second and or third models independently or in any combined manner . In some embodiments the information about the associations the information about the plurality of attributes and the data about the social connections can be used in conjunction to produce a collective model for recommending applications to the selected user.

Various embodiments can also enable the enhancement or refinement of application recommendation. Application recommendation can be improved and or refined over time to make better recommendations e.g. to recommend more relevant applications . In some embodiments the one or more models and or the collective model can be trained in an iterative manner. For example there can be new and or additional data e.g. new training data that can be used to modify rebuild refine and or improve the models.

Various other functions and advantages are described and suggested below as may be provided in accordance with the various embodiments.

Various embodiments of the disclosure are discussed in detail below. While specific implementations are discussed it should be understood that this is done for illustration purposes only. A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other components and configurations may be used without parting from the spirit and scope of the disclosure.

The disclosed technology addresses the need in the art for application recommendation using files stored with a networked environment. The disclosed technology can obtain information about associations between users of a content management system and applications compatible with the content management system. The disclosed technology can also obtain information about a plurality of attributes associated with usage of the content management system by the users. In some embodiments the attributes can include a device property a usage pattern an account property a content property a profile property a preference property or a domain property. Moreover data about social connections of the users can also be obtained. Based at least in part on at least one of the information about the associations the information about the plurality of attributes or the data about the social connections one or more applications can be recommended to a selected user.

An exemplary system configuration is shown in wherein electronic devices communicate via a network for purposes of exchanging content and other data. The system can be configured for use on a wide area network such as that illustrated in . However the present principles are applicable to a wide variety of network configurations that facilitate the intercommunication of electronic devices. For example each of the components of system in can be implemented in a localized or distributed fashion in a network.

In system a user can interact with content management system through client devices . . . collectively connected to network by direct and or indirect communication. Content management system can support connections from a variety of different client devices such as desktop computers mobile computers mobile communications devices e.g. mobile phones smart phones tablets smart televisions set top boxes and or any other network enabled computing devices. Client devices can be of varying type capabilities operating systems etc. Furthermore content management system can concurrently accept connections from and interact with multiple client devices .

A user can interact with content management system via a client side application installed on client device . In some embodiments the client side application can include a content management system specific component. For example the component can be a stand alone application one or more application plug ins and or a browser extension. However the user can also interact with content management system via a third party application such as a web browser that resides on client device and is configured to communicate with content management system . In either case the client side application can present a user interface UI for the user to interact with content management system . For example the user can interact with the content management system via a client side application integrated with the file system or via a webpage displayed using a web browser application.

Content management system can make it possible for a user to store content as well as perform a variety of content management tasks such as retrieve modify browse and or share the content. Furthermore content management system can make it possible for a user to access the content from multiple client devices . For example client device can upload content to content management system via network . The content can later be retrieved from content management system using the same client device or some other client device .

To facilitate the various content management services a user can create an account with content management system . The account information can be maintained in user account database . User account database can store profile information for registered users. In some cases the only personal information in the user profile can be a username and or email address. However content management system can also be configured to accept additional user information.

User account database can also include account management information such as account type e.g. free or paid usage information e.g. file edit history maximum storage space authorized storage space used content storage locations security settings personal configuration settings content sharing data etc. Account management module can be configured to update and or obtain user account details in user account database . The account management module can be configured to interact with any number of other modules in content management system .

An account can be used to store content such as digital data documents text files audio files video files etc. from one or more client devices authorized on the account. The content can also include folders or other mechanisms of grouping content items together with different behaviors such as collections playlists albums etc. For example an account can include a public folder that is accessible to any user. The public folder can be assigned a web accessible address. A link to the web accessible address can be used to access the contents of the public folder. In another example an account can include a photos folder that is intended for photos and that provides specific attributes and actions tailored for photos an audio folder that provides the ability to play back audio files and perform other audio related actions or other special purpose folders. An account can also include shared folders or group folders that are linked with and available to multiple user accounts. The permissions for multiple users may be different for a shared folder.

The content can be stored in content storage . Content storage can be a storage device multiple storage devices or a server. Alternatively content storage can be a cloud storage provider or network storage accessible via one or more communications networks. Content management system can hide the complexity and details from client devices so that client devices do not need to know exactly where the content items are being stored by content management system . In one variation content management system can store the content items in the same folder hierarchy as they appear on client device . However content management system can store the content items in its own order arrangement or hierarchy. Content management system can store the content items in a network accessible storage SAN device in a redundant array of inexpensive disks RAID etc. Content storage can store content items using one or more partition types such as FAT FAT32 NTFS EXT2 EXT3 EXT4 ReiserFS BTRFS and so forth.

Content storage can also store metadata describing content items content item types and the relationship of content items to various accounts folders or groups. The metadata for a content item can be stored as part of the content item or can be stored separately. In one variation each content item stored in content storage can be assigned a system wide unique identifier.

Content storage can decrease the amount of storage space required by identifying duplicate files or duplicate segments of files. Instead of storing multiple copies content storage can store a single copy and then use a pointer or other mechanism to link the duplicates to the single copy. Similarly content storage can store files more efficiently as well as provide the ability to undo operations by using a file version control that tracks changes to files different versions of files including diverging version trees and a change history. The change history can include a set of changes that when applied to the original file version produce the changed file version.

Content management system can be configured to support automatic synchronization of content from one or more client devices . The synchronization can be platform agnostic. That is the content can be synchronized across multiple client devices of varying type capabilities operating systems etc. For example client device can include client software which synchronizes via a synchronization module at content management system content in client device s file system with the content in an associated user account. In some cases the client software can synchronize any changes to content in a designated folder and its sub folders such as new deleted modified copied or moved files or folders. The client software can be a separate software application can integrate with an existing content management application in the operating system or some combination thereof. In one example of client software that integrates with an existing content management application a user can manipulate content directly in a local folder while a background process monitors the local folder for changes and synchronizes those changes to content management system . Conversely the background process can identify content that has been updated at content management system and synchronize those changes to the local folder. The client software can provide notifications of synchronization operations and can provide indications of content statuses directly within the content management application. Sometimes client device may not have a network connection available. In this scenario the client software can monitor the linked folder for file changes and queue those changes for later synchronization to content management system when a network connection is available. Similarly a user can manually stop or pause synchronization with content management system .

A user can also view or manipulate content via a web interface generated and served by user interface module . For example the user can navigate in a web browser to a web address provided by content management system . Changes or updates to content in the content storage made through the web interface such as uploading a new version of a file can be propagated back to other client devices associated with the user s account. For example multiple client devices each with their own client software can be associated with a single account and files in the account can be synchronized between each of the multiple client devices .

Content management system can include a communications interface for interfacing with various client devices and can interact with other content and or service providers . . . collectively via an Application Programming Interface API . Certain software applications can access content storage via an API on behalf of a user. For example a software package such as an app on a smartphone or tablet computing device can programmatically make calls directly to content management system when a user provides credentials to read write create delete share or otherwise manipulate content. Similarly the API can allow users to access all or part of content storage through a web site.

Content management system can also include authenticator module which can verify user credentials security tokens API calls specific client devices and so forth to ensure only authorized clients and users can access files. Further content management system can include analytics module module that can track and report on aggregate file operations user actions network usage total storage space used as well as other technology usage or business metrics. A privacy and or security policy can prevent unauthorized access to user data stored with content management system .

Content management system can include sharing module for managing sharing content publicly or privately. Sharing content publicly can include making the content item accessible from any computing device in network communication with content management system . Sharing content privately can include linking a content item in content storage with two or more user accounts so that each user account has access to the content item. The sharing can be performed in a platform agnostic manner. That is the content can be shared across multiple client devices of varying type capabilities operating systems etc. The content can also be shared across varying types of user accounts.

In some embodiments content management system can be configured to maintain a content directory identifying the location of each content item in content storage . The content directory can include a unique content entry for each content item stored in the content storage.

A content entry can include a content path that can be used to identify the location of the content item in a content management system. For example the content path can include the name of the content item and a folder hierarchy associated with the content item. For example the content path can include a folder or path of folders in which the content item is placed as well as the name of the content item. Content management system can use the content path to present the content items in the appropriate folder hierarchy.

A content entry can also include a content pointer that identifies the location of the content item in content storage . For example the content pointer can include the exact storage address of the content item in memory. In some embodiments the content pointer can point to multiple locations each of which contains a portion of the content item.

In addition to a content path and content pointer a content entry can also include a user account identifier that identifies the user account that has access to the content item. In some embodiments multiple user account identifiers can be associated with a single content entry indicating that the content item has shared access by the multiple user accounts.

To share a content item privately sharing module can be configured to add a user account identifier to the content entry associated with the content item thus granting the added user account access to the content item. Sharing module can also be configured to remove user account identifiers from a content entry to restrict a user account s access to the content item.

To share content publicly sharing module can be configured to generate a custom network address such as a uniform resource locator URL which allows any web browser to access the content in content management system without any authentication. To accomplish this sharing module can be configured to include content identification data in the generated URL which can later be used to properly identify and return the requested content item. For example sharing module can be configured to include the user account identifier and the content path in the generated URL. Upon selection of the URL the content identification data included in the URL can be transmitted to content management system which can use the received content identification data to identify the appropriate content entry and return the content item associated with the content entry.

In addition to generating the URL sharing module can also be configured to record that a URL to the content item has been created. In some embodiments the content entry associated with a content item can include a URL flag indicating whether a URL to the content item has been created. For example the URL flag can be a Boolean value initially set to 0 or false to indicate that a URL to the content item has not been created. Sharing module can be configured to change the value of the flag to 1 or true after generating a URL to the content item.

In some embodiments sharing module can also be configured to deactivate a generated URL. For example each content entry can also include a URL active flag indicating whether the content should be returned in response to a request from the generated URL. For example sharing module can be configured to only return a content item requested by a generated link if the URL active flag is set to 1 or true. Thus access to a content item for which a URL has been generated can be easily restricted by changing the value of the URL active flag. This allows a user to restrict access to the shared content item without having to move the content item or delete the generated URL. Likewise sharing module can reactivate the URL by again changing the value of the URL active flag to 1 or true. A user can thus easily restore access to the content item without the need to generate a new URL.

While content management system is presented with specific components it should be understood by one skilled in the art that the architectural configuration of system is simply one possible configuration and that other configurations with more or less components are also possible.

With reference now to shows an exemplary system embodiment for recommending applications compatible with a content management system e.g. content management system in . Exemplary system embodiment can utilize collaborative filtering module to determine recommendations for applications compatible or operable with the content management system. Collaborative filtering module can obtain or receive training data i.e. test data known data preconfigured data data that has already been classified etc. . Training data can include information about a plurality of users of the content management system e.g. User A User B User C User D etc. a plurality of applications compatible with the content management system e.g. App W App X App Y App Z etc. and the associations or lack thereof between the users and the applications. In some embodiments matrix can be generated based on training data to hold information about the users the applications and the associations or lack thereof . It is also contemplated that other suitable data structures can be utilized to hold maintain and or present at least a portion of training data .

In one example training data can include information about which user of the content management system is associated with e.g. has installed which application s . Each cell in matrix can indicate whether or not a particular user is associated with e.g. is engaged with has installed a particular application. In this example User A has installed e.g. has engaged with App X App Y and App Z but has not installed e.g. has not engaged with App W. This is because User A is represented by Row in matrix while App X App Y and App Z are represented by Column Column and Column respectively. App W is represented by Column . The cell located at Row Column or in matrix is a 1 which in this example indicates that User A has installed App X. Each of cells 1 3 and 1 4 also contains a 1 indicating that User A has installed App Y and App Z. Cell 1 1 is a 0 which means that User A has not installed App W.

Similarly shows that User B has installed Apps W and Y but not Apps X and Z. User C has installed Apps W X Y and Z. User D has installed Apps X Y and Z but not App W.

Continuing with the example based on training data or the information stored at matrix system can generate predictive model . As discussed previously in some cases predictive model can be generated using a machine learning algorithm such as a supervised learning algorithm. Predictive model can identify one or more correlations within training data or the information stored at matrix . In this example predictive model can calculate estimate or predict that if a user has installed App X and App Z then App Y should likely be of interest to the user. This is because based on training data or the information maintained by matrix predictive model can identify correlations between Apps X Y and Z. With respect to matrix in every instance where a user e.g. User A User C and User D has installed App X and App Z the user has also installed App Y. This and other correlations can be identified by predictive model which can be utilized to analyze new or unknown data and provide application recommendations.

Continuing with the example new data e.g. data to be analyzed unknown data unclassified data etc. can be received by exemplary system . New data can include information about at least one user and one or more associations or lack thereof between the at least one user and the plurality of applications. In this example new data can correspond to User J. New data can indicate that User J has installed Apps X and Z but not Apps W and Y. Predictive model can analyze new data recognize that User J has installed Apps X and Z but not Y and predict that User J should likely be interested in App Y. System can then make a recommendation to User J suggesting that User J might be interested in App Y .

In some embodiments the associations or lack thereof between the plurality of users of the content management system and the plurality of applications operable with the content management system can indicate a level of engagement between each user and each application as shown in the example of .

For example as shown in there can be a value on a scale of 0 to 5 contained in each cell of matrix . A cell containing a 0 value indicates that the cell s corresponding user has not installed the cell s corresponding application whereas a 1 indicates that the user has installed but does not frequently interact with e.g. engage in using access utilize etc. the application while a 5 indicates that the user has installed and frequently interacts with the application etc. Accordingly in the example of User A has installed but rarely uses if at all App W but frequently uses App X and even more frequently uses Apps Y and Z. Likewise User B has App W but rarely uses it does not have App X has App Y and occasionally uses it and has App Z but uses it less than App Y. User C occasionally uses App W frequently uses Apps X and Z and most frequently uses App Y. User D frequently uses Apps Y and Z most frequently uses App X but does not have App W.

Based on training data or the information in matrix predictive model can be generated and configured to determine any correlations between the users and the applications. In this example predictive model can determine e.g. observe estimate predict etc. that users who frequently use Apps X and Z also frequently use App Y. As such when new data e.g. data to be analyzed is received by system predictive model can analyze new data and recognize that User J has App W but rarely uses it that User J uses Apps X and Z frequently and that User J does not have App Y . As discussed above predictive model had previously identified correlations between Apps X Y and Z e.g. predictive model predicted that users who frequently use Apps X and Z would likely be interested in App Y . Accordingly system can make a recommendation suggesting that User J might be very interested in App Y .

In some embodiments training data can include a plurality of attributes related to usage of the content management system by a plurality of users. The plurality of attributes can be organized structured and or stored in matrix . The rows of matrix can correspond to the users and the columns can correspond to the attributes. For example as shown in Column can correspond to an attribute for verifying whether users devices used with the content management system run Operating System A.

In the example cell Row Column has a value of 1 which can mean that User A s device used with the content management system is running Operating System A. Similarly matrix shows that User B s and User C s devices used with the content management system are not running Operating System A but Operating System B instead. User D s device is also running Operating System A and not Operating System B. Moreover the devices of Users A B and D are phones whereas User C s device is not a phone e.g. perhaps a tablet laptop etc. . Furthermore Users A and D have installed App W whereas Users B and C have not.

Continuing with the example predictive model can be generated based on training data or the attributes related to usage of the content management system by the users. Predictive model can recognize and incorporate correlations among the attributes the users and applications for the content management system. In this example predictive model can observe that users who use an Operating System A phone tend to have App W installed. Accordingly when new data is received predictive model can predict that App W should be recommended to User J because User J is using the content management system with a phone running Operating System A but does not have App W installed yet.

In some embodiments other example attributes not shown in can include but is not limited to device attributes information e.g. device identification device brand device manufacturer etc. patterns associated with using the content management system e.g. quantity and or type of content items stored and or shared by the users etc. account information for the users of the content management system e.g. free account paid account team account email domain etc. preferences of the users accounts with the content management system e.g. language location time etc. user profile information associated the users of the content management system e.g. gender age etc. . For example a device identification such as a serial number a unique string a name or another tag or code associated with each device can enable the content management system and or applications to identify a device and to distinguish between multiple devices. It is further contemplated that a person having ordinary skill in the art would recognize various other attributes or information that can be utilized or implemented with the various embodiments of the present disclosure.

To reiterate the various attributes can be useful for providing indications of which applications for the content management system are likely to be useful and or of interest to a user of the content management system. For example the attributes might indicate that a particular user has an email domain designer.com shares numerous large size image files with other users having the designer.com email domain and has a paid account with the content management system. In this example the attributes can suggest that the particular user is likely a designer and thus applications for design can be recommended to the particular user. Moreover the attributes can indicate that this particular user might be interested in paid applications as well.

In some embodiments training data need not be represented as binary values in the matrix or other data structure. With reference now to there can be an exemplary system embodiment for recommending applications compatible with a content management system. In exemplary system embodiment can comprise classifier module . Classifier module can obtain or receive training data and generate matrix based on training data .

As shown in the example of matrix can include a plurality of attributes related to usage of the content management system by a plurality of users. In some embodiments the cells of matrix can but need not hold binary values. For example Column can correspond to the operating systems of the users devices used with the content management system. Column can correspond to device types for the users devices e.g. phone tablet laptop PC etc. . Column can correspond to the number of files each user has under his account with the content management system. Column can correspond to whether or not each user is associated with e.g. has installed App W.

As shown in the example of User A is using the content management system with a phone that runs Operating System A OS A has 11 files stored under his account with the content management system and has installed App W compatible with the content management system. Moreover User B is using the content management system with a tablet that runs Operating System B OS B has 2 files stored under his account with the content management system and has not installed App W for the content management system. User C is using a laptop that runs OS B has 9 files stored under his content management system account and has installed App W. User D is using a PC with OS A has 19 files under his account and has installed App W.

Continuing with the example predictive model can analyze the attributes and identify correlations between the attributes users and or applications. In this example predictive model can observe a correlation between users with OS A devices having more than 10 files on their content management system accounts and App W. In other words predictive model can predict that users with devices running OS A and having more than 10 files tend to have App W installed. As such predictive model can be used to analyze new data and observe that User J uses the content management system with an OS A tablet has 14 files on his account with the content management system but does not have App W installed. As such system can recommend App W to User J.

Referring now to exemplary system embodiment for recommending applications compatible with a content management system is shown. Exemplary system embodiment can include social connection module configured to obtain or receive social data . Social data can include at least in part information about social connections associated with a plurality of users of the content management system. Two users can be socially connected with respect to the content management system if at least one of them has shared some data with the other via the content management system.

In one example the information about the social connections can include information about the plurality of users of the content management system information about a plurality of applications for the content management system installed by each user and information about contents i.e. content items that are shared among the users via the content management system. The information about the social connections can be organized stored and or represented in a graph e.g. a social graph . It is contemplated that other appropriate data structures can be used as well.

Continuing with the example predictive model can be generated based on graph . In some cases machine learning can be utilized to facilitate in the generating of predictive model . Predictive model can analyze the information about the social connections and or graph to identify correlations among a user other users with whom he has shared one or more contents e.g. files folders data etc. and applications associated with e.g. installed by used by accessed by etc. the users. In this example predictive model can recognize that User D has installed Apps W Y and Z. Predictive model can also recognize that all other users e.g. Users A B C E F and G with whom User D has directly shared at least some data have installed App X. As such system can recommend App X to User D.

In some embodiments different social connections can be weighted differently. For example if a first user shares a large amount of data with a second user but only shares a small amount of data with a third user then the social connection between the first and second users can be weighted more significantly than the social connection between the first and third users.
