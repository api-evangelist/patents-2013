title: Systems and methods for secure file portability between mobile applications on a mobile device
abstract: Systems and methods for secure file portability between mobile applications in a cloud-based environment or cloud-based collaboration and file sharing environment. In one embodiment, a server-based key generation service generates an encryption key that is unique to each file transfer transaction between mobile applications accessed via a mobile device. Data packages leaving a mobile application are then encrypted using the encryption key to provide secure file portability between mobile applications. In another embodiment, a background service triggered by a mobile application detects when a user is logged out of the mobile application and revalidates the user session with the mobile application to maintain portability of files between mobile applications. The background service presents a minimal user interface to get the user's credentials for the mobile application, without the user having to switch to the mobile application, and obtains an authentication token from a remote server using the user's credentials.

The present application claims priority to and benefit from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 697 437 titled Secure File Portability Between Mobile Applications Using A Server based Key Generation Service filed on Sep. 6 2012 the content of which is incorporated by reference herein. This application also claims priority to and benefit from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 650 840 titled PLATFORM AND APPLICATION AGNOSTIC METHOD FOR FILE ACCESS IN A MOBILE ENVIROMENT .

The present application is related to co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 776 535 titled System and Method for Creating a Secure Channel for Inter Application Communication Based on Intents filed on Feb. 25 2013 the content of which is incorporated by reference herein.

The Android operating system Android OS relies on a rich inter application messaging system called Intents for communication between applications. The messaging system promotes collaboration between applications by allowing applications to leverage existing data or services from each other. For example a restaurant directory application can ask one application to launch the a restaurant website another application to call a restaurant another application to display directions to a restaurant and so on.

The Intents based messaging system can pass data between applications. However the default mechanisms for passing data between the application are generally insecure. The default mechanisms expose the data to not just the applications involved in the passing of the data but also to any other applications on the mobile device.

Embodiments of the present disclosure include systems and methods for secure file portability between mobile applications accessed via a mobile device. In one embodiment secure file portability between mobile applications is supported by a server based key generation service.

When a mobile operating system passes data between applications running on its platform the default mechanism is usually insecure and exposes the data openly to any application on the system not just the ones involved in the passing of the data. In one embodiment the disclosed systems and methods include having a mobile application or client on the device make requests to one or more host servers e.g. servers enabling or providing cloud services cloud based storage collaboration and or file sharing services for individual encryption keys to be used for each transaction involving a file transfer hereinafter transaction . The keys are used to encrypt packages of data before they leave the mobile application so that they are unreadable in transit. Because the keys are unique per transaction even if one transaction is compromised the risk does not spread to subsequent transactions.

In one embodiment the host servers can be for example equipped to generate many keys for use in transactions and the platform application programming interfaces APIs are augmented to provide methods to retrieve these keys on a per transaction basis. While a server side only component implementation provides additional security over client side only solutions in some instances a combination of server and client side solutions can be implemented and is considered within the scope of the innovation. The uniqueness of the keys per transaction even though there are potentially thousands of them that occur per hour can be critical to ensuring the safety of data each time it is accessed from the system e.g. any cloud environment cloud service or cloud based collaboration environment .

As a file is transferred between mobile applications installed on a mobile device the file receiving mobile application hereinafter receiving application becomes the active application or comes to the foreground while the file sending mobile application hereinafter sending application . stays in the background. In one implementation the sending application can include a mobile application for accessing servers providing cloud services cloud based storage collaboration and or file sharing services. In a further implementation the sending application can include mobile applications that transfer or export files or other data to another mobile application where the files or other data are viewed modified processed or manipulated. In one implementation the receiving application can include any mobile application for viewing modifying processing or manipulating files or other data obtained from the sending application. For example a user may have a Box mobile application and a QuickOffice mobile application installed on his or her mobile device. In one implementation Box can be a sending application providing the user access to files stored locally in Box or remotely in Box servers. QuickOffice can be a receiving application that allows the user to edit files e.g. Word Excel PowerPoint and other documents . The user can thus open a Word document from Box i.e. the sending application in QuickOffice i.e. the receiving application edit the Word document in QuickOffice and save the edited Word document in Box locally in Box or remotely in Box servers .

The sending application can be running even when it is not being actively used by a user. The operating system OS however can terminate the sending application when there is not enough memory or the sending application can simply crash. When the sending application crashes or is terminated the user can be logged out of the application and the receiving application may not be able to upload the file back to the sending application. By way of an example the situation may also arise when the application is configured to log the user out whenever the application is not active. Mobile devices usually allow users to toggle between applications but cannot make two applications visible at the same time. If the user tries to log back in by switching to the sending application the user incurs the risk of the receiving application getting terminated or killed by the OS.

In one embodiment the disclosed systems and methods can support file portability between mobile applications by running a background service that keeps in contact with the host servers to keep the user logged in to the sending application even when it is not the active application. By re validating the user session any files from the receiving application can be safely transferred back into the sending application. In one implementation the background service detects the log out event or expiration of the auth token or authentication token and presents a minimal user interface for the user to input login credentials such as a username email address password pin code gesture and or the like without having to exit out of the receiving application user interface. The background service sends a request to the remote servers to obtain a new auth token to log the user back in and allow transfer of files into the sending application.

Various aspects of the cloud based platform and the systems and methods for secure file portability between mobile applications will now be described. In general the routines executed to implement the embodiments of the disclosure may be implemented as part of an operating system or a specific application component program object module or sequence of instructions referred to as computer programs. The computer programs typically comprise one or more instructions set at various times in various memory and storage devices in a computer and that when read and executed by one or more processing units or processors in a computer cause the computer to perform operations to execute elements involving the various aspects of the disclosure.

The client devices can be any system and or device and or any combination of devices systems that is able to establish a connection including wired wireless cellular connections with another device a server and or other systems such as host server and or notification server . Client devices will typically include a display and or other output functionalities to present information and data exchanged between among the devices and or the host server and or notification server .

For example the client devices can include mobile hand held or portable devices or non portable devices and can be any of but not limited to a server desktop a desktop computer a computer cluster or portable devices including a notebook a laptop computer a handheld computer a palmtop computer a mobile phone a cell phone a smart phone a PDA a Blackberry device a Treo a handheld tablet e.g. an iPad a Galaxy Xoom Tablet etc. a tablet PC a thin client a hand held console a hand held gaming device or console an iPhone and or any other portable mobile hand held devices etc. running on any platform or any operating system e.g. Mac based OS OS X iOS etc. Windows based OS Windows Mobile Windows 7 etc. Android Blackberry OS Embedded Linux platforms Palm OS Symbian platform. In one embodiment the client devices host server and app server are coupled via a network . In some embodiments the devices and host server may be directly connected to one another.

The input mechanism on client devices can include touch screen keypad including single touch multi touch gesture sensing in 2D or 3D etc. a physical keypad a mouse a pointer a track pad motion detector e.g. including 1 axis 2 axis 3 axis accelerometer etc. a light sensor capacitance sensor resistance sensor temperature sensor proximity sensor a piezoelectric device device orientation detector e.g. electronic compass tilt sensor rotation sensor gyroscope accelerometer or a combination of the above.

Signals received or detected indicating user activity at client devices through one or more of the above input mechanism or others can be used in the disclosed technology by various users or collaborators e.g. collaborators for accessing through network a web based collaboration environment or online collaboration platform e.g. hosted by the host server .

The collaboration platform or environment hosts workspaces with work items that one or more users can access e.g. view edit update revise comment download preview tag or otherwise manipulate etc. . A work item can generally include any type of digital or electronic content that can be viewed or accessed via an electronic device e.g. device . The digital content can include .pdf files .doc slides e.g. Powerpoint slides images audio files multimedia content web pages blogs etc. A workspace can generally refer to any grouping of a set of digital content in the collaboration platform. The grouping can be created identified or specified by a user or through other means. This user may be a creator user or administrative user for example.

In general a workspace can be associated with a set of users or collaborators e.g. collaborators which have access to the content included therein. The levels of access e.g. based on permissions or rules of each user or collaborator to access the content in a given workspace may be the same or may vary among the users. Each user may have their own set of access rights to every piece of content in the workspace or each user may be different access rights to different pieces of content. Access rights may be specified by a user associated with a work space and or a user who created uploaded a particular piece of content to the workspace or any other designated user or collaborator.

In general the collaboration platform allows multiple users or collaborators to access or collaborate efforts on work items such each user can see remotely edits revisions comments or annotations being made to specific work items through their own user devices. For example a user can upload a document to a work space for other users to access e.g. for viewing editing commenting signing off or otherwise manipulating . The user can login to the online platform and upload the document or any other type of work item to an existing work space or to a new work space. The document can be shared with existing users or collaborators in a work space.

A diagrammatic illustration of the online collaboration environment and the relationships between workspaces and users collaborators are illustrated with further reference to the example of . A diagrammatic illustration of a workspace having multiple work items with which collaborators can access through multiple devices is illustrated with further reference to the example of .

In one embodiment the host server of cloud based services and or cloud storage such as an online or web based collaboration environment is able to track or monitor the devices used by users to access content or activities. In one implementation such tracking or monitoring may be performed upon receiving explicit permission or authorization from users.

In one embodiment client devices communicate with the host server and or notification server over network . In general network over which the client devices the host server and or notification server communicate may be a cellular network a telephonic network an open network such as the Internet or a private network such as an intranet and or the extranet or any combination thereof. For example the Internet can provide file transfer remote log in email news RSS cloud based services instant messaging visual voicemail push mail VoIP and other services through any known or convenient protocol such as but is not limited to the TCP IP protocol Open System Interconnections OSI FTP UPnP iSCSI NSF ISDN PDH RS 232 SDH SONET etc.

The network can be any collection of distinct networks operating wholly or partially in conjunction to provide connectivity to the client devices and the host server and may appear as one or more networks to the serviced systems and devices. In one embodiment communications to and from the client devices can be achieved by an open network such as the Internet or a private network such as an intranet and or the extranet. In one embodiment communications can be achieved by a secure communications protocol such as secure sockets layer SSL or transport layer security TLS .

In addition communications can be achieved via one or more networks such as but are not limited to one or more of WiMax a Local Area Network LAN Wireless Local Area Network WLAN a Personal area network PAN a Campus area network CAN a Metropolitan area network MAN a Wide area network WAN a Wireless wide area network WWAN enabled with technologies such as by way of example Global System for Mobile Communications GSM Personal Communications Service PCS Digital Advanced Mobile Phone Service D Amps Bluetooth Wi Fi Fixed Wireless Data 2G 2.5G 3G 4G IMT Advanced pre 4G 3G LTE 3GPP LTE LTE Advanced mobile WiMax WiMax 2 WirelessMAN Advanced networks enhanced data rates for GSM evolution EDGE General packet radio service GPRS enhanced GPRS iBurst UMTS HSPDA HSUPA HSPA UMTS TDD 1xRTT EV DO messaging protocols such as TCP IP SMS MMS extensible messaging and presence protocol XMPP real time messaging protocol RTMP instant messaging and presence protocol IMPP instant messaging USSD IRC or any other wireless data networks or messaging protocols.

The web based platform for collaborating on projects or jointly working on documents can be used by individual users and shared among collaborators. In addition the collaboration platform can be deployed in an organized setting including but not limited to a company e.g. an enterprise setting a department in a company an academic institution a department in an academic institution a class or course setting or any other types of organizations or organized setting.

When deployed in an organizational setting multiple workspaces e.g. workspace A N may be created to support different projects or a variety of work flows. Each workspace may have its own associate work items. For example work space A may be associated with work items work space B may be associated with work items and work space N may be associated with work items . The work items and may be unique to each work space but need not be. For example a particular word document may be associated with only one work space e.g. work space A or it may be associated with multiple work spaces e.g. Work space A and work space B etc. .

In general each work space has a set of users or collaborators associated with it. For example work space A is associated with multiple users or collaborators . In some instances work spaces deployed in an enterprise may be department specific. For example work space B may be associated with department and some users shown as example user A and workspace N may be associated with departments and and users shown as example user B .

Each user associated with a work space may generally access the work items associated with the work space. The level of access may depend on permissions associated with the specific work space and or with a specific work item. Permissions may be set for the work space or set individually on a per work item basis. For example the creator of a work space e.g. one of user A who creates work space B may set one permission setting applicable to all work items for other associated users and or users associated with the affiliate department for example. Creator user A may also set different permission settings for each work item which may be the same for different users or varying for different users.

In each work space A B . . . N when an action is performed on a work item by a given user or any other activity is detected in the work space other users in the same work space may be notified e.g. in real time or in near real time or not in real time . Activities which trigger real time notifications can include by way of example but not limitation adding deleting or modifying collaborators in the work space uploading downloading adding deleting a work item in the work space creating a discussion topic in the work space.

Specifically items or content downloaded or edited in accordance with the techniques described in the present disclosure can be cause notifications to be generated. Such notifications can be sent to relevant users to notify them of actions surrounding a download an edit a change a modification a new file a conflicting version an upload of an edited or modified file.

In one embodiment in a user interface to the web based collaboration platform where notifications are presented users can via the same interface create action items e.g. tasks and delegate the action items to other users including collaborators pertaining to a work item for example. The collaborators may be in the same workspace A or the user may include a newly invited collaborator. Similarly in the same user interface where discussion topics can be created in a work space e.g. work space A B or N etc. actionable events on work items can be created and or delegated assigned to other users such as collaborators of a given work space or other users. Through the same user interface task status and updates from multiple users or collaborators can be indicated and reflected. In some instances the users can perform the tasks e.g. review or approve or reject etc. via the same user interface.

Each of users and may individually use multiple different devices to access and or manipulate work items in the work space with which they are associated with. For example users may be collaborators on a project to which work items are relevant. Since the work items are hosted by the collaboration environment e.g. a cloud based environment each user may access the work items anytime and from any physical location using any device e.g. including devices they own or any shared public loaner device .

Work items to be edited or viewed may be accessed from the workspace in accordance with the platform and or application independent mechanisms. Users may also be notified of access edit modification and or upload related actions performed on work items by other users or any other types of activities detected in the work space . For example if user modifies a document one or both of the other collaborators and can be notified of the modification in real time or near real time or not in real time. The notifications can be sent through any of all of the devices associated with a given user in various formats including one or more of email SMS or via a pop up window in a user interface in which the user uses to access the collaboration platform. In the event of multiple notifications each notification may be depicted preferentially e.g. ordering in the user interface based on user preferences and or relevance to the user e.g. implicit or explicit .

For example a notification of a download access read write edit or upload related activities may be presented in a feed stream among other notifications through a user interface on the user device according to relevancy to the user determined based on current or recent activity of the user in the web based collaboration environment.

In one embodiment a notification feed stream includes updates when an invited user accepts an invitation and or successfully creates a new account through receipt of an invitation from an existing user. The invited user upon creation of the new account receives the account having enhanced features. The new user can automatically be connected to the existing user who sent the invitation. The system can also automatically prompt both users to query they wish to be collaborators in a common work space.

In one embodiment a mobile device which can be any of the client devices includes a sending application and a receiving application . The sending application can be associated with the host server and can be in communication with the host server . The sending application includes a background service that requests an auth token from the host server by providing the user credentials input by the user. The user credentials can include a username email address password pin code gesture and or the like that are associated with the user and the sending application . In response to the request the host server sends the sending application an auth token to validate re validate the user session with the sending application .

The sending application when instructed by a user can send a user selected file or files to a receiving application . The sending application can rely on the operating system OS or mobile platform communication mechanism such as the Intents in the Android platform to broadcast a request to open a file in a receiving application. By using custom Intents only sanctioned or authorized receiving applications that are qualified to interact with the sending application or participate in transactions with the sending application can be detected. Once a receiving application is selected a secure channel between the sending application and the receiving application can be opened to allow passage of encrypted file to the receiving application where the file can be decrypted and viewed edited or manipulated in various ways. Further details regarding the secure channel can be found in co pending US application entitled System and Method for Creating a Secure Channel for Inter Application Communication Based on Intents which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In one implementation the encrypted file can be encrypted using a key that is a hash of the auth token . In an alternate implementation the auth token can be hashed together with a time stamp. Any appropriate hash function such as MD5 SHA 1 2 3 and the like can be used to generate the hash. In one implementation advanced encryption standard AES with a key size of 128 192 or 256 bits can be used to encrypt the data file before it is sent to the receiving application . In one implementation the key e.g. hash of auth token can be communicated to the receiving application . The key is a shared secret key that can be used to encrypt and decrypt the file being transferred.

Once the file is received and decrypted the receiving application can display the file and allow the user to perform the desired manipulations. The receiving application becomes the active application and the sending application becomes the inactive application. The inactive application can run on the background of the OS but can be terminated by the OS when there are too many processes running and or when the memory is limited. Once the user has made the desired changes or processed the file in the receiving application the file can be uploaded back to the sending application via the same channel or a new channel. The background service that obtains the auth token to re validate user session whenever the user is logged out of the sending application e.g. due to application crashing application being terminated by OS for memory management application having an auto log out setting and the like allows the receiving application to upload the file back to the sending application. As before the updated file can be encrypted and sent as a data stream to the sending application . In one implementation the encryption of the updated file may be using the same key that was used to decrypt the file. In an alternate implementation the updated file can be encrypted using a hash of the new auth token if the user session was re validated following the file transfer to the receiving application.

In one embodiment a mobile device which can be any of the client devices includes a sending application and a receiving application . In one implementation a user using his or her mobile device sends a transaction request message from the sending application . In one implementation the sending application is associated with the host server and thus communicates with the host server to obtain a key for the transaction request . The key can be used to encrypt one or more files associated with the transaction request. In one implementation an encryption key can be derived from the key obtained from the host server . For example when the key is an auth token a hash of the auth token or hash of the auth token and time stamp can be determined and the hash can be used as an encryption key.

A file associated with the transaction request and encrypted with the key is passed to the receiving application via a secure channel. The key for the transaction request that the receiving application would need to decrypt the file is also passed to the receiving application . The receiving application can decrypt the file using the key and open the file for editing by the user. In one implementation the edited or updated file is encrypted using the same key and then passed back to the sending application over the same secure channel or a new secure channel. Alternately the sending application can obtain a new key from the host server and pass the new key or a hash of the new key to the receiving application . The receiving application can use the new key to encrypt the updated file and the updated file is passed back to the sending application. In yet another implementation the receiving application can obtain a new key for the second leg of the transaction request directly from the host server e.g. by making an API call and use the new key to encrypt the updated file.

The mobile device platform can include an application layer a framework layer libraries runtime engine and a kernel . The application layer includes native or core applications and other applications which can include for example the cloud based collaboration platform application white listed applications unauthorized or malicious application and the like. The core applications includes a set of applications such as email SMS calendar maps browsers camera alarm media player clock voice dial contacts calculator and the like.

The framework layer includes framework application programming interfaces APIs that are used by the core applications but can also be used by other applications to take advantage of the mobile device hardware access location information store data in internal or external storage on the mobile device run background services add notifications e.g. to the status bar and the like. All applications are supported by a set of services and systems. For example the view system can be used to build application user interface elements such as lists text boxes buttons and the like. Content providers allow applications to access data from other applications or share their own data. A resource manager provides access to non code resources such as localized strings graphics and layout files. A notification manager enables applications to display custom alerts in the status bar. An activity manager manages the lifecycle of applications and provides common navigation elements. The framework layer may include additional components that have not been specifically described.

A set of core and other libraries are used by various components of the mobile device platform and provides many of the functionality. Example core libraries include media libraries that support playback and recording of audio video and images surface manager that manages access to the display subsystem and seamlessly compounds 2D and 3D graphic layers from multiple applications a web browser engine that powers browsers and an embeddable web view e.g. LibWebCore 3D libraries e.g. OpenGL ES 1.0 APIs libraries for bitmap and vector font rendering SQLite which is a powerful and lightweight relational database engine available to all applications system C library and the like.

Each mobile application can run in its own process with its own instance of the Virtual Machine such as the Dalvik VM. The Dalvik VM for example executes files in the Dalvik Executable .dex format which is optimized for minimal memory footprint. The OS or the kernel is the Linux kernel that acts as an abstraction layer between the hardware and the rest of the stack including the application layer the framework layer the libraries and the virtual machine . The kernel supports core system services such as memory and process management network stack driver model and security. The kernel includes drivers for display camera USB keypad Wi Fi and the like and an inter process communication IPC layer that includes a binder driver to provide an IPC mechanism to facilitate communication e.g. exchange of data between processes within an application intra application communication and between applications inter application communication . The IPC mechanism includes the Intent mechanism using which the IPC layer sends Intents to communicate data. The IPC layer via the Intent mechanism can start an activity bring another activity to the front start or stop a service query and obtain results from a content provider e.g. a data storehouse deliver Intents to broadcast receivers and the like.

The other applications can include one or more user installed sending and receiving applications including the sending application . In one implementation the sending application can include example components such as an inter application transaction request detector module a custom Intent module a secure channel creator module a data stream module a remote communication service an authentication module an encryption decryption module and other application specific modules . The application specific modules include components such as but not limited to a user interface module application logic engines upload download managers notification engines and the like that perform the various functions of the sending application.

The inter application transaction request detector module detects transaction requests initiated by a user of the mobile device. For example a user can select a document from a user interface of the sending application to open the document in another mobile application i.e. receiving application . The user request to open the document can be detected and identified as an inter application transaction request by the detector module . The detector module can then notify or kick off the custom Intent module .

The custom Intent module can include the custom Intent creator module and the custom Intent broadcast module . The custom Intent creator module can create a custom Intent to identify a receiving application and request the receiving application to perform a specific action. In some implementations the custom Intent can include data or other extras. A custom action is different from other general actions such as ACTION VIEW ACTION EDIT ACTION MAIN etc. that are defined in the Android API and thus can be understood by all applications. A custom action on the other hand can be understood by those applications that recognize the request and know how to respond to the request. The custom Intent from the custom Intent creator module can request a receiving application to perform custom actions including but not limited to modify an existing file create a new file upload the new file open and show contents of a file launch application and the like.

The custom Intent broadcast module can broadcast the created Intent to all applications including white listed and unauthorized applications. The broadcasting may be achieved by using the broadcast method provided by the Android API.

The secure channel creator module can create a secure channel between the sending application and a receiving application. The secure channel creator module can allocate an area on the device s storage as a staging area for data to be passed between the sending and receiving applications. The storage area can be an internal storage area that can be accessed by both sending and receiving applications. Alternately the storage area can be an external storage area such as an SD card. The storage area is effectively the channel between the applications. The channel is secure since only the sending and receiving applications have access to it. Furthermore the files that go into the storage area are securely encrypted providing an added layer of security. Files that are passed between applications may be sent as whole files or as data stream to obfuscate the inter application communication. The data stream module includes methods for opening input and output streams to read and write data. The data stream module can also automatically encrypt the data streams for passage through the secure channel between the sending and receiving applications. The data stream module in one implementation can leverage the encryption decryption module to encrypt or decrypt data stream using various encryption methods. In one implementation advanced encryption standard AES with a key size of 128 192 or 256 bits can be used to encrypt the data stream. Alternately any other symmetric or asymmetric encryption decryption methods can be implemented in other embodiments.

The remote communication service is an application component including instructions code that can run in the background as its own process. In other words a new thread can be created within the remote communication service to do the operations of the service. As the service runs in a thread that is separate from the sending application s main thread if the sending application is terminated the service can continue to run in the background. The remote communication service in other words can run in the background even when a user is not directly interacting with the application. The remote communication service may have a small memory footprint to ensure that the service itself is not terminated by the OS for memory recovery. In one implementation the remote communication service can be made high priority such that the OS in the event of intense memory pressure can terminate other low priority processes before the remote communication service .

The remote communication service provides secure file portability between the sending application and a receiving application. One embodiment of the remote communication service can include a transaction key request module a user session monitoring module an authentication user interface UI module and an auth token request module . Implementation of one or more of these modules may be optional in some embodiments. In some embodiments one or more of these modules may be configured to run in the sending application s main thread instead of the thread created within the service. For example the transaction key request module may be implemented on the application s main thread. In a further implementation instead of being implemented as a service the transaction key request module can be implemented as a process.

In one embodiment the transaction key request module maintains or establishes a connection with the host server or another server generating or providing keys for the sending application transactions . When a transaction request is detected e.g. by the inter application transaction request detector module the transaction key request module can request a key from the host server. The key obtained from the host server can be unique for each transaction request. The key obtained by the transaction key request module can be provided to the encryption decryption module to encrypt files associated with the transaction request and not any other transactions for passage via the secure channel to a receiving application. Each transaction request can be identified by a transaction ID and or any other information relating to the transaction request such as the user ID file name s file ID time of transfer receiving application ID and the like.

Alternately the transaction key request module can be configured to request a key for a transaction request only under certain conditions. For example in one implementation if a second transaction occurs within one hour or any other time period of a first transaction the key obtained for the first transaction can be used for the second transaction and any other subsequent transactions occurring within the predefined time period. In one implementation the number of transaction requests or file items to which the key can be applied to may be limited. In another implementation the transaction key request module can be configured to request a key for one or more transactions with a specific receiving application. For example if the sending application performs a first transaction with a receiving application A a second transaction with a receiving application B and third and fourth transactions with the receiving application A the key requested for the first transaction with receiving application A can be applied to the third and fourth transactions with the same receiving application. In a further implementation the number of transaction requests or file items associated with transactions with a specific receiving application to which the key can be applied to may be limited.

In one implementation of the transaction key request module the key obtained from the host server can include a token e.g. an auth token and a time stamp. The key request module or the encryption decryption module can hash the token time stamp and or other information and use the hash value as the key for encryption. Any appropriate hash function such as MD5 SHA 1 2 3 and the like can be used to generate the hash value.

One implementation of the transaction key request module can also pass the key obtained or generated to a receiving application associated with the transaction request. The passing of the key may be via the secure channel or via an alternate mechanism e.g. explicit Intent for example.

File portability between mobile applications can be affected when a user is logged out of the sending application and the file exported to the receiving application for editing or other manipulation cannot be uploaded back to the sending application because of the user being logged out. In one embodiment the user session monitoring module can monitor the user session with the sending application. In one implementation the user session monitoring module can detect when the sending application s process is terminated for various reasons including user setting e.g. log out when the application is not active and low memory or when the auth token for the sending application is expired e.g. based on time stamp for the auth token or based on error code when auth token is used .

When the end of the user session is detected the authentication user interface UI module can generate and or present a minimal UI to the user to obtain the user s credentials. The authentication UI can have one or more fields for the user to enter login credentials such as a username password a pin code a gesture and the like. Alternately other authentication techniques such as fingerprinting retina scan facial recognition voice recognition and the like can also be used to identify the user. The UI that is presented is not a part of the sending application user interface and as such the user does not need to switch from the current application i.e. the receiving application to the sending application to log in. After the submission of the user credentials via the UI the user is returned to the user interface where he or she was before the authentication UI was presented.

The user credentials input by the user can be packaged into an authentication token request message by the authentication token request module and sent to the host server. The host server can receive and parse the request message and authenticate the user by comparing the user credentials against a repository. If the user credentials are correct the host server can generate and send an auth token that is received by the auth token request module . The authentication module can then use the auth token to revalidate the user session with the sending application. The sending application can then receive any files sent by a receiving application.

The host server of the web based or online collaboration environment can generally be a cloud based service. The host server can include for example a network interface an upload request processor having a drag drop manager an upload engine having a multi file upload manager and or a folder upload manager and a user interface module having a navigation manager and an upload content access module . The host server can also include for example an inter application transaction processor having a transaction key request detector and a key generator and or an auth token request detector and an auth token generator . One embodiment of the host server can also include an authentication module an SDK provisioning module and a white list manager . Another embodiment of the host server further includes a notification engine having for example a feed stream updator and or a recipient selector . Additional or less components modules engines can be included in the host server and each illustrated component.

The network interface can be a networking module that enables the host server to mediate data in a network with an entity that is external to the host server through any known and or convenient communications protocol supported by the host and the external entity. The network interface can include one or more of a network adaptor card a wireless network interface card e.g. SMS interface WiFi interface interfaces for various generations of mobile communication standards including but not limited to 1G 2G 3G 3.5G 4G LTE etc. Bluetooth a router an access point a wireless router a switch a multilayer switch a protocol converter a gateway a bridge bridge router a hub a digital media receiver and or a repeater.

One embodiment of the host server includes the upload request processor which can receive detect process identify parse translate and or determine an activity request. An upload request can be submitted by a user through a user interface of the collaboration platform to upload one or multiple items.

The user can identify the files content or work items to be uploaded to the host server one by one and queue up multiple items e.g. including but not limited to files folders documents images audio etc. to be uploaded in a single request. The user can also select all of the items to be uploaded in a single action e.g. via highlighting or otherwise selecting of icons corresponding to each of the items . In one embodiment the upload request is generated via a drag and drop action of the multiple work items to be uploaded to the host server into a portion of a user interface. Drag and drop activated uploaded requests can be detected handled received processed and or otherwise managed by the drag drop manager .

In one embodiment the upload request is generated via a drag and drop action of a single folder which includes the multiple work items to be uploaded to the host server . For example the upload request can be generated when a folder having the multiple items on a client device that is to be uploaded is identified through the user interface. In some instances the folder can include additional folders in a folder hierarchy of multiple items.

In some instances the user can generate an upload request by activating the upload feature in a tab on a user interface and initiate uploading by selecting e.g. clicking on or otherwise activating a button tab. Once selected another user interface or a pop up window may appear allowing the user to navigate through files or folders to select the items to be uploaded.

Once upload requests have been detected and processed the upload engine can upload the requested item or multiple requested items. The upload engine can in one embodiment upload a single item or multiple items e.g. sequentially or simultaneously to the host server . A multiple item upload may be initiated via a single step or multi step user request. A multi file upload request can be handled processed and executed for example through the multi file upload manager .

In one embodiment the multi file upload manager receives an identification of each of the multiple files to be uploaded e.g. from the upload request processor and sequentially prepares each individual file for uploading and uploads each file independently. For example the upload manager can compress one of the multiple files individually upload it to the host server and decompress the file when uploaded and proceed to perform the same steps with the next file. Preprocessing a file can include for example analyzing the file size and type to determine if it is acceptable valid and or to identify how best to compress the file. Post processing can include for example performing one or more of decompressing the file validating the file size and name checking permissions potentially scanning for malicious software and or moving to permanent storage. The step of moving to storage can further include one or more of adding the file metadata to the database creating thumbnails creating previews indexing for search encrypting the file and or storing in multiple locations for redundancy. Note that the above processes can occur in any order or synchronously in any combination with one another. The process continues until all items in the request have been uploaded to the host server . The upload may automatically progress from one file when completed to the next one in sequence when the user initiates a multi file upload request.

In one embodiment the upload engine uploads multiple items in a folder hierarchy based on a single request to upload a folder which has a hierarchy of folders inside for example via the folder upload manager . In one embodiment the folder upload manager compresses the multiple items in the folder hierarchy in a single process into a single item and uploads the single item in a single upload process rather than one by one to the host server . After the merged file of multiple items has been uploaded the folder upload manager can decompress and subsequently parse the single upload of the single item into the original individual files that were stored as multiple items in the folders in the hierarchy. By merging multiple files into one and performing a single compression and decompression step the uploading process can be expedited since the overhead in time to compress and decompress multiple files is mostly eliminated. Some additional benefits of bulk uploading allow the following overhead to be partially or wholly eliminated repeatedly creating TCP connections for each upload repeatedly checking the same permissions and storage quotas when processing the files on the server.

One embodiment of the host server includes a notification engine . The notification engine can for example update a feed stream to include an updated feed indicate that an item or multiple items have been uploaded for example via the feed stream updator . The users that are notified can be selected for example by the recipient selector and can include collaborators or the user or other users meeting a criterion. In some instances the feed stream is updated in real time or near real time relative to when the upload of the item completed. For real time updating the notification engine can utilize another server or another engine in the same server which provides push functionality.

The notification engine can generally notify users which can be collaborators of the user who performed the activity in the work space via one or more of many mechanisms including but not limited to email SMS voice message text based message RSS feed etc. as described in detail with further reference to related co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 152 982 filed on Jun. 3 2011. The contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

In one embodiment the notification is depicted through a web browser used by the other user to access the web based collaboration environment for access in real time or near real time to when the activity was performed by the user. When notifying a user in real time through a web browser the notification engine can utilize a push enabled service to ensure real time notification. In one embodiment the notification is sent by a component or another server which implements push technology e.g. the notification server shown in the example of . The push enabled service can be implemented via long poll or HTTP streaming for example by the notification server or another component device which may be internal to or external to the host server . In addition the host server could utilize other push servers including third party push servers to implement push technology including but not limited to mobile platform push systems and services e.g. via smart phones or tablets or other portable devices such as iPhone Android phones Blackberry iPad Galaxy or other tablets etc. .

One embodiment of the host server includes the user interface module which preserves or enhances user experience before during or after an upload request. For example the user interface module can allow the user to engage in other activities in the collaboration platform while an upload is in progress so as to prevent the user from having to wait for the completion to work in the platform.

In one embodiment during the upload of a single file before completion the user can generally navigate away from the user interface through which the upload request was submitted for example via the navigation manager in the user interface module . In other words while a file or item upload is in progress the user can navigate to other pages to perform other actions or initiate additional actions on the current page without interrupting stopping or pausing the in progress upload.

Similarly when a multi file or multi item upload request is in progress the user can also navigate away from the user interface which the upload request was submitted prior to completion of the uploading of each of the multiple items to the host server . Navigation between pages during an upload of multiple files can also be managed by the navigation manager . For example the upload of the multiple items can continue to proceed and is not interrupted if the user accesses a link on the user interface causing another user interface to launch in a browser. To enable bulk uploading a new browser window is opened so it operates independently of user navigation. In addition the web application for uploading and access of the collaboration environment is pageless meaning it can be updated asynchronously without a browser page refresh. This allows navigation and to start new uploads in other folders which can be added to the upload queue.

In addition during a multi file upload an item of the multiple items that has been uploaded to the host server available for access through the user interface even when some of the multiple items have not yet been uploaded to the host server via the upload content access module for example. Thus during an active upload individual files which have completed uploading can be accessed or interacted with by the user in the collaborative environment without having to wait for the full upload to complete.

In some instances the item which has been uploaded to the host server is manipulatable by the user through the user interface without a need for browser refresh. This enhances the user experience by allowing the user to work on the file or otherwise interact with it once it has been uploaded without waiting for other files to finish uploading. For example the user can view edit preview or comment on the item that has been uploaded prior to completion of uploading all of the multiple items in an upload request. In one embodiment buffer space in memory for storage of the individual work items are created in response to the upload request such that when individual items have been uploaded they can be moved into the created buffer space and subsequently permanent storage. When the file is in permanent storage the user can then access and work on the individual item while others are still being uploaded. In one embodiment metadata for the file can be created before it is fully uploaded or processed allowing faster user interaction. However to actually interact with the file content full content search download or preview the file generally needs to be processed as usual and be stored in permanent storage.

One embodiment of the host server can include an SDK provisioning module and a whitelist application manager . The SDK provisioning module can provision SDKs API keys tokens and the like to applications that have been approved for integration with the sending application. The SDK can include certain methods iconography and the like that allow inter application communication and make the inter application communication capability apparent to users of both applications. For example the SDK can recognize encoded messages e.g. custom Intents broadcast by the sending application e.g. the cloud based collaboration platform application and include response to method calls to facilitate various data access and transfer scenarios discussed above. The SDK can also include method calls to request keys from the host server for example.

Applications that have integrated with the sending application by implementing the SDK can be designated as a whitelisted application by the whitelist application manager . The whitelisted applications can receive automatic notifications of updates to SDKs can make API calls to the host server receive and respond to custom Intents and the like.

In one embodiment of the host server the inter application transaction processor can include a transaction key request detector and a key generator . The transaction key request detector can detect a key request for a transaction from a sending application and or a receiving application. The detector can identify a transaction request by a transaction ID and or any other information relating to the transaction request such as the user ID file name s file ID time of transfer receiving application ID and the like. The transaction key request detector can then trigger the key generator to generate a key that can be directly used as an encryption key or that can be used to derive an encryption key for encrypting decrypting the files associated with the transaction request. In one implementation the transaction key request detector can trigger the key generator to generate a key for a transaction request only under certain conditions as discussed with respect to the transaction key request module . The transaction request detector or another module can also send the generated key to the requesting application and in some cases to both applications involved in the transaction.

In one implementation the key may be generated using a random number generator or a pseudorandom number generator that uses seed data that can be a piece of user identifying information for example. Alternately any other key generation algorithms available in the art can be used. In one implementation the encryption key may have an associated time stamp which can be used to determine the expiration date time. In one implementation the key generator may generate a key suitable for an encryption method used. For example if 256 bit AES encryption method is used in the mobile applications for encryption a 256 bit key is generated.

In another embodiment the inter application transaction processor can include an auth token request detector and an auth token generator . The authentication token request detector can receive an auth token request from a sending application and parse the request to obtain a user s credentials such as a username password a pin code a gesture a fingerprint retina scan facial voice recognition data and the like. The authentication module can obtain the parsed data and compare the data against data stored in a repository to verify that the user s credentials are correct. The authentication module can trigger the token generator to generate an auth token. The auth token generated by the token generator can be sent to the sending application by the authentication module the auth token request detector module or another module. The auth token can be generated using various methods and can be a numeric or alphanumeric string for example. In one implementation the auth token may be generated using a random number generator a pseudorandom number generator with at least one piece of user identifying information as a seed a hash and or the like.

At block the sending application receives a transaction request that includes a request to open a file for editing in a receiving application. In response to the transaction request the sending application creates and sends an Intent e.g. a custom Intent to detect and launch a receiving application qualified to handle the transaction request at block . For example if the file is a PDF document a mobile application that can open and allow editing of PDF files can be launched. By way of another example if the file is an image file an image processing application can be identified and or selected as a receiving application. When a qualified receiving application is detected at block the file associated with the transaction request is sent to the receiving application for viewing and editing. The file is encrypted and sent as a data stream over a secure communication channel.

The receiving application can display the file and allow editing and or other manipulation on the file. The sending application can receive the edited file from the receiving application at block . The edited file can be a new version of the file sent or a new file in one implementation. At block the sending application can send the edited file to a host server e.g. host server for cloud storage.

Referring to a logic flow diagram of an example method implemented by the background service for revalidation of the user session with the sending application is depicted. At block the sending application can detect expiration of an auth token for a user session with the sending application or end of a user session with the sending application. In one implementation whenever a termination event or a log out event is detected the background service may check if the auth token is still valid e.g. by using the auth token in a request to the host server checking the time stamp and the like and may proceed to block only if the auth token is invalid. Alternately the background service may automatically proceed to block if a termination or log out event is detected.

At block the background service may launch a minimal user interface to request user credentials from the user to revalidate the user s session with the sending application. The minimal user interface may have the necessary fields for the requested credential such as an email address user name ID password pin code gesture and the like. In one implementation the launching of the minimal user interface is via an Intent started by the service. At block the background service can use the user credentials to request a new auth token from a host server such as the host server . The request may be made using an API call to the host server for example.

In one implementation if the authentication is successful as determined at decision block based on a response from the host server the process moves to block where the new auth token is received from the host server. Alternately the minimal user interface can be presented again for the user to re enter the login credentials at block . Using the new auth token the background service can revalidate the user session with the sending application at block . In one implementation the background service can invoke a module e.g. the authentication module to revalidate the user session. In one implementation evaluation of the authentication credentials e.g. decision block may be carried out on the client side or the server side.

The sending application receives a file transfer transaction request at block from a user. In one implementation a transaction request can include transfer of other data when commenting assigning tasks editing deleting writing sharing emailing posting and the like. The transaction request can include indications of one or more files to be transferred an action to be performed on the files and the like. At block the sending application can evaluate the transaction request to determine if a key should be requested from the host server for encrypting the files associated with the transaction request. In one implementation the evaluation may be based on configurations defined by the sending application. For example if the sending application is configured to request keys on a per transaction basis the process moves to block where a key request is created and sent to the host server . Alternately if the sending application is configured to request a key when certain conditions are met the transaction request is evaluated at block to determine if the one or more conditions are met. For example in one implementation if a previously obtained key has been used a pre defined number of times e.g. 10 files or for a predefined number of transaction requests e.g. 10 transaction requests a new key can be requested. In another implementation a new key may be requested if the transaction request includes a receiving application with which the sending application has not transacted within a predefined time period e.g. in the last hour . For example a user may open a document from Box i.e. sending application in EchoSign i.e. receiving application to sign the document. The first transaction between Box and EchoSign can trigger acquisition of a new key while subsequent transactions between the two applications occurring with an hour of the first transaction may be encrypted using the previously acquired key. Various other conditions including those discussed with respect to the transaction key request module can be implemented.

Based on the evaluation of the conditions for a key request if a new key is required the sending application creates and sends a key request to the host server at block . In one implementation the transaction key request may be made via an API call to the host server . Information such as transaction ID or other identifying information may be supplied along with the transaction key request.

At block the host server receives the transaction key request and parses the request at block to extract details of the request. The extracted information can be used as seed data when generating a new key at block . In one implementation the seed data can be any piece of data such as transaction ID file ID user ID sending receiving application ID time stamp and the like. As previously described with respect to the key generator module various methods can be used to generate the key for the transaction. At block the generated key can be packaged and sent to the sending application .

The sending application receives the key at block . The sending application then encrypts the file s associated with the transaction request using the received key at block . Alternately if a new key was not requested the previously obtained key may be used to encrypt the transaction file s at block . At block the encrypted files are sent to a receiving application to complete the transaction request.

In one implementation of the method the key received from the host server can be hashed to generate the encryption key for encrypting the file s in the transaction request. In yet another implementation of the method the host server may receive all transaction requests from the sending application and may perform the processed of block and .
