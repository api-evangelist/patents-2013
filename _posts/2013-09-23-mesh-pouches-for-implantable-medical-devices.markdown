abstract: Biodegradable polymer-coated surgical meshes formed into pouches are described for use with cardiac rhythm management devices (CRMs) and other implantable medical devices. Such meshes are formed into a receptacle, e.g., a pouch or other covering, capable of encasing, surrounding and/or holding the cardiac rhythm management device or other implantable medical device for the purpose of securing it in position, inhibiting or reducing bacterial growth, providing pain relief and/or inhibiting scarring or fibrosis on or around the CRM or other implantable medical device. Preferred embodiments include surgical mesh pouches coated with one or more biodegradable polymers that can act as a stiffening agent by coating the filaments or fibers of the mesh to temporarily immobilize the contact points of those filaments or fibers and/or by increasing the stiffness of the mesh by at least 1.1 times its original stiffness. The pouches of the invention can also provide relief from various post-operative complications associated with their implantation, insertion or surgical use, and, optionally, include one or more drugs in the polymer matrix of the coating to provide prophylactic effects and/or alleviate side effects or complications associated with the surgery or implantation of the CRM or other implantable medical device.

Biodegradable polymer coated surgical meshes formed into pouches are described for use with cardiac rhythm management devices CRMs and other implantable medical devices IMDs . Such meshes are formed into a receptacle e.g. a pouch or other covering capable of encasing surrounding and or holding the CRM or other IMD for the purpose of securing it in position inhibiting or reducing bacterial growth providing pain relief and or inhibiting scarring or fibrosis on or around the CRM or other IMD. Preferred embodiments include surgical mesh pouches coated with one or more biodegradable polymers that can act as a stiffening agent by coating the filaments or fibers of the mesh to temporarily immobilize the contact points of those filaments or fibers and or by increasing the stiffness of the mesh by at least 1.1 times its original stiffness. The pouches of the invention can also provide relief from various post operative complications associated with their implantation insertion or surgical use and optionally include one or more drugs in the polymer matrix of the coating to provide prophylactic effects and or alleviate side effects or complications associated with the surgery or implantation of the CRM or other IMD.

Prosthetic implants such as meshes combination mesh products or other porous prostheses are commonly used to provide a physical barrier between types of tissue or extra strength to a physical defect in soft tissue. However such devices are often associated with post surgical complications including post implant infection pain excessive scar tissue formation and shrinkage of the prosthesis or mesh. Excessive scar tissue formation limited patient mobility and chronic pain are often attributed to the size shape and mass of the implant and a variety of efforts have been undertaken to reduce the amount of scar tissue formation. For example lighter meshes using smaller fibers larger weaves and or larger pore sizes as well as meshes woven from both non resorbable and resorbable materials are in use to address these concerns.

For treating acute pain and infection patients with implanted prostheses are typically treated post operatively with systemic antibiotics and pain medications. Patients will occasionally be given systemic antibiotics prophylactically however literature review of clinical trials does not indicate that systemic antibiotics are effective at preventing implant related infections.

In 1992 it was reported that nosocomial infections involved over 2 million patients each year and cost the healthcare systems over 4.5 billion dollars annually.Today these numbers are undoubtedly much higher. Surgical site infections involving approximately 500 000 patients represent the second most common cause of nosocomial infections and approximately 17 of all hospital acquired infections.The incidence of infections associated with the placement of pacemakers has been reported as 0.13 to 19.9 at an average cost of 35 000 to treat these complications which most often involves complete removal of the implant.

Post operative infection is tied to three elements lack of host defense mechanisms surgical site and bacteria present at the time of device implantation.The general health of the patient i.e. the host factor is always important however since many patients requiring surgery are compromised in some way and there is little that can be done to mitigate that factor controlling the other two factors becomes important.

Studies have shown that patients are exposed to bacterial contamination in the hospital especially in the operating room OR and along the route to the OR.In fact bacterial counts of up to 7.0 10CFU mhave been found in the OR dressing area.Recent improvements in air handling and surface cleansing have reduced the environmental levels of infectious agents but not eliminated them. Consequently further means to reduce bacterial contamination or to reduce the potential for bacterial infection are desirable.

Controlling the inoculation levels is the third component to the intra and post operative surgical infection control triad. One aspect to microbial control is the use antibiotics. For example one practice advocates the administration of systemic antibiotics within 60 minutes prior to incision with additional dosing if the surgery exceeds 3 hours.Such pre incision administration has shown some positive effects on the incidence of infection associated with the placement of pacemakers.An adjunctive approach to managing the potential for implant contamination has been the introduction of antimicrobial agents on implantable medical devices.

This approach was initially developed to create a barrier to microbial entry into the body via surface penetrating devices such as indwelling catheters The antimicrobial agents were applied in solution as a direct coating on the device to prevent or reduce bacterial colonization of the device and therefore reduce the potential for a device related infection. While a number of clinical trials have demonstrated that antimicrobial coating on devices such as central venous catheters reduce device colonization reduction of infection has not been statistically significant although the numerical trends show a reduction in patient infection.These results are highly relevant since they tend to establish that with proper aseptic and surgical techniques as well as administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy the use of surface modified devices has a positive impact on the overall procedural patient outcome.

The development of post operative infection is dependent on many factors and it is not clear exactly how many colony forming units CFUs are required to produce clinical infection. It has been reported that an inoculation of 10bacteria at the surgical site produces a wound infection rate of 20 .And while current air handling technology and infection control procedures have undoubtedly reduced the microbial levels in the hospital setting microbial contamination of an implantable device is still possible. It is known that bacteria such as can produce bacteremia within a short time after implantation i.e. within 90 days with a device or lay dormant for months before producing an active infection so eradication of the bacterial inoculum at the time of implantation is key and may help to reduce late stage as well as early stage device related infections.

For example the combination of rifampin and minocycline has demonstrated antimicrobial effectiveness as a coating for catheters and other implanted devices including use of those drugs in a non resorbable coating such as silicone and polyurethane.The combination of rifampin and minocycline has also been shown to reduce the incidence of clinical infection when used as a prophylactic coating on penile implants.

The parent case of this application U.S. Ser. No. 11 672 929 describes a bioresorbable polymer coating on a surgical mesh as a carrier for the antimicrobial agents rifampin and minocycline. Such meshes can be fashioned into a pouch of various sizes and shapes to match the implanted pacemakers pulse generators defibrillators and other implantable medical devices. The addition of the antimicrobial agents permits the pouch to deliver antimicrobial agents at the implant site and thus to provide a barrier to microbial colonization of a CRM during surgical implantation as an adjunct to surgical and systemic infection control.

The present invention addresses these needs preventing or inhibiting infections as well as others such as pain relief and inhibition or reduction of scar tissue fibrosis and the like by providing temporarily stiffened meshes formed into pouches or other receptacles to hold an implantable medical device upon implantation.

The present invention relates to pouches coverings and the like made from implantable surgical meshes comprising one or more biodegradable polymer coatings. The mesh pouches of the invention can be shaped as desired into pouches bags coverings shells skins receptacles and the like to fit any implantable medical device. Preferred meshes of the invention are comprised of woven polypropylene coated with one or more biodegradable polymer to impart drug elution or other temporary effects.

As used herein pouch pouches mesh pouch mesh pouches pouch of the invention and pouches of the invention means any pouch bag skin shell covering or other receptacle made from an implantable surgical mesh comprising one or more biodegradable polymer coatings and shaped to encapsulate encase surround cover or hold in whole or in substantial part an implantable medical device. The pouches of the invention have openings to permit leads and tubes of the IMD to extend unhindered from the IMD though the opening of the pouch. The pouches may also have porosity to accommodate monopolar devices that require the IMD to be electrically grounded to the surrounding tissue. An IMD is substantially encapsulated encased surrounded or covered when the pouch can hold the device and at least 20 30 50 60 75 85 90 95 or 98 of the device is within the pouch or coverd by the pouch.

In accordance with this invention the coated surgical meshes can be formed to encapsulate a pacemaker a defibrillator a generator an implantable access system a neurostimulator or any other implantable device for the purpose of securing them in position providing pain relief inhibiting scarring or fibrosis and or inhibiting bacterial growth. Such coated meshes are formed into an appropriate shape either before or after coating with the biodegradable polymers.

In one aspect the pouches of the invention may act as medical prostheses providing support to the device and the tissue surrounding the area of implant and are thus also referred to as medical prostheses.

Hence the pouches of the invention comprise a mesh and one or more coating which temporarily stiffens the mesh to at least 1.1 times its original stiffness. The coatings on such meshes do not alter the integrity of the mesh and thus allow the mesh to remain porous. In general the coatings do not substantially alter the porosity of the mesh. More particularly the pouches of the invention comprise a mesh with one or more coatings with at least one of the coatings comprising a stiffening agent s that coats the filaments or fibers of the mesh so to temporarily immobilize the contact points of those filaments or fibers. Again the coatings on such meshes do not alter the integrity or strength of the underlying mesh and allow the mesh to remain porous after coating. In general the coatings do not substantially alter the porosity of the mesh. The meshes are capable of substantially reverting to their original stiffness under conditions of use.

The stiffening agents i.e. as applied in the coatings of the invention can selectively partially or fully coat the contact points of the filaments or said fibers of the mesh to create a coating. The contact points generally include the knots of woven meshes. Such coating are can be positioned on the mesh in a templated pattern or in an array such as might be deposited with ink jet type technology including computer controlled deposition techniques. Additionally the coatings can be applied on one or both sides of the mesh.

In some embodiments the stiffening agents include hydrogels either alone or in combination with one or more biodegradable polymers. In some embodiments the stiffening agent is one or more biodegradable polymers and can be applied in layers. One or more biodegradable polymers can be used per individual coating layer. Preferred biodegradable polymer comprises one or more tyrosine derived diphenol monomer units as polyarylates polycarbonates or polyiminocarbonates.

In another aspect of the invention the pouches of the invention have at least one of the coatings that further comprises one or more drugs. Such drugs include but are not limited to antimicrobial agents anesthetics analgesics anti inflammatory agents anti scarring agents anti fibrotic agents leukotriene inhibitors as well as other classes of drugs including biological agents such as proteins growth inhibitors and the like.

The biodegradable polymer coatings are capable of releasing one or more drugs into surrounding bodily tissue and proximal to the device such that the drug reduces or prevents implant or surgery related complications. For example by including an anesthetic agent in the coating that predictably seeps or elutes into the surrounding bodily tissue bodily fluid or systemic fluid one has a useful way to attenuate pain experienced at the implantation site. In another example replacing the anesthetic agent with an anti inflammatory agent provides a way to reduce the swelling and inflammation associated implantation of the mesh device and or pouch. In yet another example by delivering an antimicrobial agent in the same manner one has a way to provide a rate of drug release sufficient to prevent colonization of the mesh pouch the CRM or other IMD and or the surgical implantation site by bacteria for at least the period following surgery necessary for initial healing of the surgical incision.

The coatings on the pouches of the invention can deliver multiple drugs from one or more independent layers some of which may contain no drug.

The invention thus provides a method of delivering drugs at controlled rates and for set durations of time using biodegradable resorbable polymers from a coating on a surgical mesh formed as a pouch of the invention.

The pouches of the invention are formed from the coated implantable surgical meshes and comprise a surgical mesh and one or more biodegradable polymer coating layers with each coating layer optionally and independently further containing a drug. The physical mechanical chemical and resorption characteristics of the coating enhance the clinical performance of the mesh and the surgeon s ability to implant the device. These characteristics are accomplished by choosing a suitable coating thickness and the biodegradable polymer.

A mesh in accordance with the invention is any web or fabric with a construction of knitted braided woven or non woven filaments or fibers that are interlocked in such a way to create a fabric or a fabric like material. As used in accordance with the present invention mesh also includes any porous prosthesis suitable for temporarily stiffening.

Surgical meshes are well known in the art and any such mesh can be coated as described herein. The meshes used in the present invention are made from biocompatible materials synthetic or natural including but not limited to polypropylene polyester polytetrafluroethylene polyamides and combinations thereof. One of the advantages of the present invention is that the coatings can be used with any commercially available mesh. A preferred mesh is made from woven polypropylene. Pore sizes of meshes vary. For example the Bard Marlex mesh has pores of 379 143 micrometers or approx. 0.4 mm whereas the Johnson and Johnson Vypro mesh has pores of 3058 62 micrometers or approx. 3 mm.

The stiffening agents of the invention include hydrogels biodegradable polymers and any other compound capable of imparting temporary stiffness to the mesh in accordance with the invention. Temporary stiffness means that relative to the corresponding uncoated mesh material there is an increase in stiffness when one or more coatings are applied in accordance with the invention. Upon use those coatings then soften or degrade over time in a manner that causes the mesh to revert back to its original stiffness revert nearly back to its original stiffness or sufficient close to its original stiffness to provide the desired surgical outcome and the expected patient comfort. To determine if the medical prosthesis has temporary stiffness the prosthesis can be evaluated in vitro or in vivo. For example a coating can be applied to the mesh and then the mesh left in a physiological solution for a period of time before measuring its stiffness. The time period of stiffness is controlled by the degradation rate for biodegradable polymers or absorption ability for hydrogels . The time period can vary from days to weeks or even a few months and is most conveniently determined in vitro. Meshes with that revert to their original stiffness in vitro within a reasonable time from 1 day to 3 4 months are considered to be temporarily stiffened. Additionally animal models can be used to assess temporary stiffness by implanting the mesh and then removing it from the animal and determining if its stiffness had changed. Such in vivo results can be correlated with the in vitro results by those of skill in the art. Methods to measure stiffness of a mesh or a coated mesh are known in the art.

A hydrogel is composed of a network of water soluble polymer chains. Hydrogels are applied as coatings and dried on the mesh. Upon use e.g. implantation in the body the hydrogel absorbs water and become soft hydrogels can contain over 99 water thereby increasing the flexibility of the mesh and reverting to the original or near original stiffness of the mesh. Typically hydrogels possess a degree of flexibility very similar to natural tissue due to their significant water content. Common ingredients for hydrogels include e.g. polyvinyl alcohol sodium polyacrylate acrylate polymers and copolymers with an abundance of hydrophilic groups.

Meshes can have one or more polymer coatings and can optionally include drugs in the coatings. Meshes with a single coating are useful to improve handling of the mesh during surgical implantation and use. Meshes with drugs can be coated with single or multiple layers depending on the amount of drug to be delivered the type of drug and desired release rate. Each layer can contain the same or different polymers the same or different drugs and the same or different amounts of polymers or drugs. For example a first coating layer can contain drug while the second layer coating layer contains either no drug or a lower concentration of drug.

The biodegradable coating deposited onto the surface of the mesh gives the mesh superior handling characteristics relative to uncoated meshes and facilitates surgical insertion because it imparts stiffness to the mesh and thereby improves handling thereof. Over time however the coating resorbs or the stiffening agents degrades or softens to leave a flexible mesh that provides greater patient comfort without loss of strength.

The surgical mesh can be coated with the biodegradable polymer using standard techniques such as spray or dip coating to achieve a uniform coating having a thickness that provides at least 1.1 to 4.5 and more preferably 1.25 to 2 times the stiffness of the uncoated mesh. In addition the coating is optimized to provide for a uniform flexible non flaking layer that remains adhered to the mesh throughout the implantation and initial wound healing process. Typically the polymer coating must maintain its integrity for at least 1 week. Optimal coating solutions are obtained by choosing a biodegradable polymer with a solubility between about 0.01 to about 30 in volatile solvents such as methylene chloride or other chlorinated solvents THF various alcohols or combinations thereof. Additionally it is preferred to use biodegradable polymers with a molecular weight between about 10 000 and about 200 000 Daltons. Such polymers degrade at rates that maintain sufficient mechanical and physical integrity over about 1 week at 37 C. in an aqueous environment.

Additionally a biodegradable polymer coated implantable mesh is described in which the biodegradable polymer layer i.e. the coating has a chemical composition that provide relatively good polymer drug miscibility. The polymer layer can contain between 1 80 drug at room temperature as well as between 1 95 2 80 2 50 5 40 5 30 5 25 and 10 20 drug or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 drug as well as 5 increments from 10 95 i.e. 10 15 20 25 etc. In one embodiment the biodegradable polymer coating releases drug for at least 2 3 days. Such release is preferred for example when the drug is an analgesic to aide in localized pain management at the surgical site. Such loading and release characteristics can be also be obtained for drug polymer combinations that do not have good miscibility by using multiple layering techniques.

Additionally the biodegradable polymer for use with the mesh pouch has a chemical composition complementary to the drug so that the polymer layer can contain between 2 50 drug at room temperature. For certain types of drug the layer can contain as much as 80 90 drug and acts as drug reservoir or depot layer and drug release can be controlled by using multiple layers with varying amounts of drug from none to a few percent saturation or above the solubility limit for the drug in the polymer .

To achieve an analgesic affect the anesthetic and or analgesic should be delivered to the injured tissue shortly after surgery or tissue injury. A drug or drugs for inclusion in the coatings on the pouches of the invention include but are not limited to analgesics anti inflammatory agents anesthetics antimicrobial agents antifungal agents NSAIDS other biologics including proteins and nucleic acids and the like. Antimicrobial and antifungal agents can prevent the mesh pouch the device and or the surrounding tissue from being colonized by bacteria. One or more drugs can be incorporated into the polymer coatings on the mesh pouches of the invention.

In another embodiment a mesh pouch of the invention has a coating comprising an anesthetic such that the anesthetic elutes from the implanted coated mesh to the surrounding tissue of the surgical site for between 1 and 10 days which typically coincides with the period of acute surgical site pain. In another embodiment delivery of an antimicrobial drug via a mesh pouch of the invention can create an inhibition zone against bacterial growth and colonization surrounding the implant during the healing process e.g. usually about 30 days or less and or prevent undue fibrotic responses.

Using biodegradable polymer coatings avoids the issue of drug solubility impregnation or adherence in or to the underlying device since a coating having suitable chemical properties can be deposited onto the mesh optionally in concert with one or more drugs to provide for the release of relatively high concentrations of those drugs over extended periods of time. For example by modulating the chemical composition of the biodegradable polymer coating on the mesh pouch and the coating methodology a clinically efficacious amount of anesthetic drug can be loaded onto a mesh pouch to assure sufficient drug elution and to provide surgical site post operative pain relief for the patient.

To provide such post operative acute pain relief the mesh pouch should elute from about 30 mg to about 1000 mg of anesthetic over 1 10 days including e.g. about 30 50 100 200 400 500 750 or 1000 mg over that time period.

The pouch should elute clinically effective amounts of anesthetic during the acute post operative period when pain is most noticeable to the patient. This period defined in several clinical studies tends to be from 12 hours to 5 days after the operation with pain greatest around 24 hours and subsiding over a period of several days thereafter. Prior to 12 hours the patient is usually still under the influence of any local anesthetic injection given during the surgery itself. After the 5 day period most of the pain related to the surgery itself i.e. incisional pain and manipulation of fascia muscle nerves has resolved to a significant extent.

Bupivacaine has a known toxicity profile duration of onset and duration of action. Drug monographs recommend the daily dose not to exceed 400 mg. Those of skill in the art can determine the amount of anesthetic to include in a polymer coating or a hydrogel coating to achieve the desired amount and duration of pain relief. Moreover anesthetics that contain amines such as lidocaine and bupivacaine are hydrophobic and are difficult to load in sufficient amounts into the most commonly used plastics employed in the medical device industry such as polypropylene and other non resorbable thermoplastics. When in their hydrochloride salt form anesthetics cannot be effectively loaded in significant concentration into such non resorbable thermoplastics because of the mismatch in hydrophilicity of the two materials.

There are numerous reports of reduction or complete elimination of narcotic use and pain scores after open hernia repair during days 2 5 with concomitant use of catheter pain pump system. In these cases the pump delivers either a 0.25 or 0.5 solution of bupivacaine to the subfascial area Sanchez 2004 LeBlanc 2005 and Lau 2003 . At a 2 mL hour flow rate this translates into constant elution of approximately 120 mg of bupivacaine per day. However this system purportedly suffers from leakage so the 120 mg per day may only serve as an extremely rough guide for the amount of bupivacaine that should be delivered to provide adequate post operative pain relief.

One of the most well characterized sustained release depot systems for post operative pain relief reported in the literature is a PLGA microsphere based sustained release formulation of bupivacaine. This formulation was developed and tested in humans for relief of subcutaneous pain as well as neural blocks. Human trials indicated that subcutaneous pain was relieved via injection of between 90 to 180 mg of bupivacaine which then eluted into the surrounding tissue over a 7 day period with higher concentrations in the initial 24 hour period followed by a gradual taper of the concentration. Other depot sustained release technologies have successfully suppressed post operative pain associated with inguinal hernia repair. For example external pumps and PLGA microsphere formulations have each purportedly release drug for approximately 72 hours.

To achieve loading at the lower limit of the elution profile for example one can choose a relatively hydrophilic biodegradable polymer and combine it with the anesthetic hydrochloride salt so that the anesthetic dissolves in the polymer at a concentration below the anesthetic s saturation limit. Such a formulation provides non burst release of anesthetic. To achieve loading at the upper limit of the elution profile one can spray coat a layer of an anesthetic polymer mixture that contains the anesthetic at a concentration above its saturation limit. In this formulation the polymer does not act as a control mechanism for release of the anesthetic but rather acts as a binder to hold the non dissolved anesthetic particles together and alters the crystallization kinetics of the drug. A second coating layer which may or may not contain further anesthetic is sprayed on top of the first layer. When present in the second coating the anesthetic concentration is at a higher ratio of polymer to anesthetic e.g. a concentration at which the anesthetic is soluble in the polymer layer.

The top layer thus can serve to control the release of the drug in the bottom layer aka depot layer via the drug polymer solubility ratio. Moreover it is possible to alter the release rate of the drug by changing the thickness of the polymer layer and changing the polymer composition according to its water uptake. A polymer that absorbs a significant amount of water within 24 hours will release the contents of the depot layer rapidly. However a polymer with limited water uptake or variable water uptake changes as a function of its stage of degradation will retard release of the water soluble anesthetic agent.

In one embodiment the biodegradable polymer coating releases drug for at least 2 3 days. Such release is preferred for example when the drug is an analgesic to aide in localized pain management at the surgical site. To achieve an analgesic affect the anesthetic and or analgesic should be delivered to the injured tissue shortly after surgery or tissue injury.

In another embodiment the coating comprises an anesthetic such that the anesthetic elutes from the implanted coated mesh to the surrounding tissue of the surgical site for between 1 and 10 days which typically coincides with the period of acute surgical site pain. In another embodiment delivery of an antimicrobial drug via a mesh of the invention can create an inhibition zone against bacterial growth and colonization surrounding the implant during the healing process e.g. usually about 7 30 days or less and or prevent undue fibrotic responses.

Using biodegradable polymer coatings avoids the issue of drug solubility impregnation or adherence in or to the underlying device since a coating having suitable chemical properties can be deposited onto the mesh pouch optionally in concert with one or more drugs to provide for the release of relatively high concentrations of those drugs over extended periods of time. For example by modulating the chemical composition of the biodegradable polymer coating and the coating methodology a clinically efficacious amount of anesthetic drug can be loaded onto a mesh pouch to assure sufficient drug elution and to provide surgical site post operative pain relief for the patient.

Other elution profiles with faster or slower drug release over a different longer or shorter times can be achieved by altering the thickness of the layers the amount of drug in the depot layer and the hydrophilicity of the biodegradable polymer.

The coatings on the pouches of the invention are formed from biodegradable polymeric layers that optionally contain one or more drugs. Methods of making biodegradable polymers are well known in the art.

Surg. 112 1455 1461 and may thus act as an anti fibrosis agent.

Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that any of the foregoing disclosed drugs can be used in combination or mixture in coatings of the present invention.

In accordance with the invention one method to coat the mesh with a stiffening agent is to spray a solution of polymer to coat the filaments or fibers of the mesh to temporarily immobilize contact points of the filaments or fibers of said mesh. This method comprises a preparing a coating solution comprising a solvent and the stiffening agent b spraying a mesh one or more times to provide an amount of solution on the mesh to produce a coating having a thickness and placement sufficient to temporarily immobilize contact points of the filaments or fibers of the mesh that coats filaments or fibers and c drying the mesh to produce said coating. An example of ratio of coating thickness to polymer coating is shown in the scanning electron micrograph of . When used with a drug or combination of drugs the drug is included in the coating solution at the desired concentration.

Spraying can be accomplished by known methods. For example the coating can be applied to the entire mesh or to that portion of the mesh necessary to stiffen it. One technique is to dip the mesh in the coating material another is to push the mesh through rollers that transfer the coating on the mesh. Spraying the mesh with a microdroplets is also effective. Techniques for selectively coating only those areas necessary to stiffen the mesh include deposition the coating through a template or mask that exposes only the desired areas of coverage for the coating including dispensing the coating with micro needles or similar means. More preferably the coating can be applied using a photoresist like mask that expose the desired portions applying the coating over the photomask and the removing the photomask.

The coated meshes can be laser cut to produce the desired shaped and sized pouches coverings and the like. The pouches can be shaped to fit relatively snugly or more loosely around the implantable medical device. Two pieces can be sealed by heat by ultrasound or other method known in the art leaving one side open to permit insertion of the device at the time of the surgical procedure and to allow the leads or other wires to extend out of the pouch stick out protrude.

Additionally the mesh pouches of the invention have a space or opening sufficient to allow the leads from the device to pass through the pouch. The number of spaces or opening in the pouch that are provided can match the number and placement of the leads or other tubes extending from the CRM or other IMD as applicable for the relevant device.

In preferred embodiments the shape and size of the pouch of the invention is similar to that of the CRM or IMD with which it is being used and the pouch has a sufficient number of openings or spaces to accommodate the leads or tubings of the particular CRM or other IMD.

The pouches of the invention are porous from the mesh but can have additional prosity. For example additional porosity can be imparted by laser cutting additional holes in the coated. mesh Porous pouches Hence the pouch need not completely encase or surround the IMD. An IMD is thus substantially encapsulated encased surrounded or covered when the pouch can hold the device and at least 20 30 50 60 75 80 85 90 95 or 98 of the device is within the pouch. Porous pouches and partially encased pouches permit contact with tissue and body fluids and are particularly useful with monopole CRM or other IMD devices. Porosity will contribute to the percentage of the IMD covered by the pouch. That is an IMD is considered to be 50 covered if it is completely surrounded by a pouch that is constructed of a film with 50 voids or holes.

The CRMs and other IMDs used with the pouches of the invention include but are not limited to pacemakers defibrillators implantable access systems neurostimulators other stimulation devices ventricular assist devices infusion pumps or other implantable devices or implantable components thereof for delivering medication hydrating solutions or other fluids intrathecal delivery systems pain pumps or any other implantable system to provide drugs or electrical stimulation to a body part.

Implantable cardiac rhythm management devices CRMs are a form of IMDs and are life long medical device implants. CRMs ensure the heart continually beats at a steady rate. There are two main types of CRM devices implantable cardiac rhythm management devices and implantable defibrillators.

The ICDs or implantable cardioverter defibrillator and pacemakers share common elements. They are permanent implants inserted through relatively minor surgical procedures. Each has 2 basic components a generator and a lead. The generator is usually placed in a subcutaneous pocket below the skin of the breastbone and the lead is threaded down and into the heart muscle or ventricle. The common elements of placement and design result in shared morbidities including lead extrusion lead tip fibrosis and infection. Although infection rates are purportedly quite low infection is a serious problem as any bacterial contamination of the lead generator or surgical site can travel directly to the heart via bacterial spreading along the generator and leads. Endocarditis or an infection of the heart has reported mortality rates as high as 33 .

An ICD is an electronic device that constantly monitors heart rate and rhythm. When it detects a fast abnormal heart rhythm it delivers energy to the heart muscle. This action causes the heart to beat in a normal rhythm again in an attempt to return it to a sinus rhythm.

The ICD has two parts the lead s and a pulse generator. The lead s monitor the heart rhythm and deliver energy used for pacing and or defibrillation see below for definitions . The lead s are directly connected to the heart and the generator. The generator houses the battery and a tiny computer. Energy is stored in the battery until it is needed. The computer receives information on cardiac function via the leads and reacts to that information on the basis of its programming.

The different types of ICDs include but are not limited to single chamber ICDs in which a lead is attached in the right ventricle. If needed energy is delivered to the ventricle to help it contract normally dual chamber ICDs in which the leads are attached in the right atrium and the right ventricle. Energy is delivered first to the right atrium and then to the right ventricle to ensure that the heart beats in a normal sequence and biventricular ICDs in which leads are attached in the right atrium the right ventricle and the left ventricle. This arrangement helps the heart beat in a more balanced way and is specifically used for patients with heart failure.

A pacemaker is a small device that sends electrical impulses to the heart muscle to maintain a suitable heart rate and rhythm. A pacemaker can also be used to treat fainting spells syncope congestive heart failure and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Pacemakers are generally implanted under the skin of the chest during a minor surgical procedure. The pacemaker is also comprised of leads and a battery driven pulse generator. The pulse generator resides under the skin of the chest. The leads are wires that are threaded through the veins into the heart and implanted into the heart muscle. They send impulses from the pulse generator to the heart muscle as well as sense the heart s electrical activity.

Each impulse causes the heart to contract. The pacemaker may have one to three leads depending on the type of pacemaker needed to treat your heart problem.

The different types of pacemakers include but are not limited to single chamber pacemakers which use one lead in the upper chambers atria or lower chambers ventricles of the heart dual chamber pacemakers which use one lead in the atria and one lead in the ventricles of your heart and biventricular pacemakers which use three leads one placed in the right atrium one placed in the right ventricle and one placed in the left ventricle via the coronary sinus vein .

The pouches of the invention can thus be designed to fit a wide range of pacemakers and implantable defibrillators from a variety of manufacturers see Table 1 . Sizes of the CRMs vary and typically size ranges are listed in Table 1.

Implantable neurostimulators are similar to pacemakers in that the devices generate electrical impulses. These devices send electrical signals via leads to the spine and brain to treat pain and other neurological disorders. For example when the leads are implanted in the spine the neurostimulation can be used to treat chronic pain especially back and spinal pain when the leads are implanted in the brain the neurostimulation can be used to treat epilepsy and essential tremor including the tremors associated with Parkinson s disease and other neurological disorders. Neurostimulation can be used to treat severe chronic nausea and vomiting as well as urological disorders. For the former electrical impulses are sent to the stomach for the latter the electrical impulses are sent to the sacral nerves in the lower back. The implant location of the neurostimulator varies by application but in all cases is placed under the skin and is susceptible to infection at the time of implantation and pos implantation. Likewise reintervention and replacement of batteries in the neurostimulators can occur at regular intervals.

The pouches of the invention can thus be designed to fit a wide range of neurostimulators from a variety of manufacturers see Table 2 . Sizes of the neurostimulators vary and typically size ranges are listed in Table 2.

Reported infection rates for first implantation are usually quite low less than 1 however they increase dramatically when a reintervention is necessary. Reintervention often requires the removal of the generator portion of the ICD pacemaker neurostimulator drug pump or other IMD and having a resorbable pouch enhances that process.

Other IMDs for use in the invention are drug pumps especially pain pumps and intrathecal delivery systems. These devices generally consist of an implantable drug pump and a catheter for dispensing the drug. The implantable drug pump is similar in size to the neurostimulators and CRMs. Further implantable medical devices include but are not limited to implantable EGM monitors implantable access systems or any other implantable system that utilizes battery power to provide drugs or electrical stimulation to a body part.

Antimicrobial efficacy of the pouches of the invention can be demonstrated in laboratory in vitro for example using the modified Kirby Bauer Antibiotic Susceptibility Test Disk Diffusion Test in vitro to assess bacterial zones of inhibitions or by the Boburden Test Method in vitro . In such experiments a small disk of the pouch is cut and used Antimicrobial efficacy can also be demonstrated in vivo using animal models of infection. For example a pouch and device combination are implanted in an animal the surgical site is deliberately infected with a pathogenic microorganism such as or and the animal is monitored for signs of infection and inflammation. At sacrifice the animal is assessed for inflammation fibrosis and bacterial colonization of the pouch device and the surrounding tissues.

It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various omissions additions and modifications may be made to the invention described above without departing from the scope of the invention and all such modifications and changes are intended to fall within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.

A 1 solution containing a ratio of 1 1 8 rifampin minocycline polymer in 9 1 tetrahydrofuran methanol was spray coated onto a surgical mesh by repeatedly passing the spray nozzle over each side of the mesh until each side was coated with at least 10 mg of antimicrobial embedded polymer. Samples were dried for at least 72 hours in a vacuum oven before use.

The polymers are the polyarylates P22 xx having xx being the DT indicated in Table 3. In Table 3 Rxx or Mxx indicates the percentage by weight of rifampin R or minocycline M in the coating i.e. R10M10 means 10 rifampin and 10 minocycline hydrochloride with 80 of the indicated polymer. Table 3 provides a list of these polyarylates with their DT content exact sample sizes final coating weights and drug coating weights.

The ZOI for antibiotic coated meshes was determined according to the Kirby Bauer method. or were inoculated into Triplicate Soy Broth TSB from a stock culture and incubated at 37 C. until the turbidity reached McFarland 0.5 standard 1 2 hours . Plates were prepared by streaking the bacteria onto on Mueller Hinton II agar MHA three times each time swabbing the plate from left to right to cover the entire plate and rotating the plate between swabbing to change direction of the streaks.

A pre cut piece 1 2 cm of spray coated mesh was firmly pressed into the center of pre warmed Mueller Hinton II agar plates and incubated at 37 C. Pieces were transferred every 24 h to fresh pre warmed Mueller Hinton II agar plates using sterile forceps. The distance from the sample to the outer edge of the inhibition zone was measured every 24 h and is reported on the bottom row in Table 4 and 5 for each sample. The top row for each sample represents difference between the diameter of the ZOI and the diagonal of the mesh. Table 4 shows the ZOI results for meshes placed on lawns and Table 5 show s the ZOI results for meshes placed on lawns. Additionally three pieces were removed every 24 h for analysis of residual minocycline and rifampin.

Table 6 shows that the duration of in vitro drug release increases with the hydrophilicity of the resorbable polymer. Solvent cast films were soaked in PBS and antibiotic release was monitored by HPLC.

For the experiment shown in a first depot coating containing 540 mg of bupivacaine HCl as a 4 solution with 1 P22 27.5 polyarylate in a mixture of THF Methanol was spray coated onto a mesh. A second layer consisting of 425 mg of the same polyarylate alone was deposited on top of the first layer.

For the experiment shown in a solution of approximately 4 bupivacaine in DTE DT succinate polymer having 27.5 DT was sprayed onto a mesh using the indicted number of passes followed by the indicated number of dips into a solution of the same polyarylate in THF Methanol 9 1 

Pre weighed pieces of mesh were placed in PBS at 37 C. and a sample withdrawn periodically for determination of bupivacaine by HPLC. shows the cumulative release of bupivacaine into PBS from the multilayer polyarylate coating as a function of time. Nearly 80 of the bupivacaine had been released after 25 hours of incubation.

Rats with jugular cannulas for pharmacokinetic studies were surgically implanted with a 1 2 cm P22 27.5 polyarylate coated mesh containing 7.5 mg of bupivacaine cm. Before surgery baseline pin prick responses to nociception were measured at the planned surgical incision site and baseline blood samples were obtained. A hernia was created by incision into the peritoneal cavity during via subcostal laparotomy and a Lichtenstein non tension repair was performed using the bupivacaine impregnated polyarylate coated mesh. Blood samples were drawn at 3 6 24 48 72 96 and 120 hours after implantation. Prior to drawing blood the rats were subjected to a pin prick test to assess dermal anesthesia from bupivacaine release. The behavioral results indicate that moderate levels of dermal anesthesia appeared from 3 to 120 hours with the amount at 6 and 48 hours significantly above baseline p

A polypropylene mesh was spray coated as described in the first paragraph of Example 2. Individual meshes were cut to 1 2 cm individually packaged and sterilized by gamma irradiation. The mesh was loaded with 7.5 mg cmof bupivacaine HCl for a total of 15 mg of bupivacaine loaded per 1 2 cm mesh.

Eight male rats 59 63 days old and weighing from 250 275 g were obtained from Taconic Laboratory Germantown N.Y. with an external jugular cannula SU007 . Each rat was anesthetized with isoflurane to a plane of surgical anesthesia as determined by the absence of a response to toe pinch and corneal reflex and maintained at 2 isoflurane during surgery. The subcostal site was shaved washed with 10 providone iodine and rinsed with 70 ethanol. Sterile drapes were used to maintain an aseptic surgical field and sterilized instruments were re sterilized between rats using a hot bead sterilizer. A 2.5 cm skin incision was made 0.5 cm caudal to and parallel to the last rib. The underlying subcutaneous space 1 cm on both sides of the incision was loosened to accommodate the mesh. A 2 cm incision was made through the muscle layers along the same plane as the skin incision penetrating the peritoneal cavity and the peritoneum was closed with 6 0 Prolene sutures in a continuous suture pattern. Rather than suturing the inner and outer oblique muscles using the classic tension closure a Lichtenstein non tension repair was undertaken using the mesh as the repair material. The mesh prepared in Section A was positioned over the incisional hernia and sutured into the internal and external oblique muscles using 6 0 Prolene sutures. The subcutaneous tissue was then sutured in a continuous pattern with 6 to 8 6 0 Prolene sutures to prevent the rats from accessing the mesh followed by 6 to 8 skin sutures. Total surgical time was 10 min for anesthetic induction and preparation and 20 min for the surgery.

The rats were allowed to recover in their home cages and monitored post surgically until they awoke. Blood samples were drawn for determination of plasma bupivacaine levels at 3 6 24 48 72 96 and 120 hours after surgery. The rats were assessed for guarding the incision and the incision was assessed for signs of inflammation swelling or other signs of infection. No rats exhibited toxicity or seizures or were in a moribund state from infection or the release of bupivacaine.

The nociceptive pin prick test was used to assess dermal anesthesia Morrow and Casey 1983 Kramer et al. 1996 Haynes et al. 2000 Khodorova and Strichartz 2000 . Holding the rat in one hand the other hand was used to apply the pin. Nociception was indicated by a skin flinch or by a nocifensive i.e. startle or attempt to escape response from the rat. While the presence of the mesh interfered with the skin flinch response nocifensive response remained completely intact.

Baseline nocifensive responses to 10 applications of the pin from a Buck neurological hammer were obtained at the planned incision site prior to mesh implantation. After surgery the pin prick test was applied rostral to the incision. The nerves caudal to the incision were transected during the procedure and therefore did not respond to pin application and were not tested. The post implantation test was repeated using the same force as before surgery and with 10 pin applications and the percent inhibition of nocifensive responding was calculated by 1 test responses 10 base responses 100. The data was analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA followed by post hoc analysis using the Tukey s test. The results are shown in .

A. Meshes prepared as described in Example 1 were subject to stiffness testing according to the method of TyRx Pharma Inc. Mesh Stiffness Test Protocol ATM 0410 based on ASTM 4032 94. Meshes were sealed in foil bags before sterilization using gamma irradiation. Where indicated by Gamma N the bags were flushed with nitrogen before sealing and irradiation. Meshes were tested in triplicate. The results are shown in Table 7 and indicate that aging does not affect the flexibility of the coated meshes.

B. Meshes were prepared by spray coating a solution of P22 27.5 onto a PPM3 mesh as generally described in Example 1. the coated meshes were cut into 3 by 3 squares to provide 80 mg polymer coating per square. The squares were incubated in 1 L of 0.01 M PBS for the indicated times then removed for stiffness testing as described in part A of this Example. All experiments were done in triplicate. As a control non coated PPM3 meshes were incubated under the same conditions. The stiffness of the control when dry was 1.42 0.23 N when dry and 1.12 N after both 1 hour and 24 hour in 0.01 M PBS. The results are shown in .

A tyrosine polyarylate coated mesh without antibiotics i.e. only a polymer coating was prepared as described in Example 1 and omitting the antibiotics in the spray coating solution. An optical image of the coated mesh is shown in the top left panel of at a magnification that readily shows the woven nature of the mesh and the contact points of the filaments. A close up of a contact point is shown in the bottom left panel of and demonstrates that the coating immobilizes the contact points of the mesh filaments. The right panel of is a scanning electron micrograph of a coated filament.

The antimicrobial pacemaker pouch is a dual component resorbable and non resorbable sterile prosthesis designed to hold a pacemaker pulse generator or defibrillator to create a stable environment when implanted in the body. The pouch is constructed of a non resorbable mesh comprised of knitted filaments of polypropylene and a bioresorbable polyarylate coating on the mesh containing the antimicrobial agents rifampin and minocycline. The antimicrobial agents are released for a minimum of 7 days followed by full resorption of the polymer leaving a light weight permanent mesh incorporated into the tissue and providing a stable environment for the pacemaker or defibrillator see .

The mesh for the pouch can be prepared in the same manner as antimicrobial polymer coated surgical meshes described in U.S. provisional application 60 771 827 filed Feb. 8 2006. The pouch is constructed of two pieces of flat coated mesh placed one on top of the other and sealed and cut into the shape using an ultrasonic weld. This results in the formation of a pouch 2.5 2.75 in size sealed on approximately 3 and one half sides and coated with approximately 50 to 75 mg of polymer and 6.1 mg of rifampin and 6.1 mg of minocycline of 86.11 g cmfor each drug . Such pouches can be designed to fit a wide range of pacemakers implantable defibrillators neurostimulators and other IMDs see Table 1 and 2 .

Antimicrobial efficacy was demonstrated in laboratory in vitro and in animal in vivo testing. Results indicate that coated mesh pouch is effective in preventing microbial colonization of the mesh and generator see Table 8 .

Histological results from a dog study show that the pouch is rapidly incorporated into the tissue surrounding the pacemaker facilitating the formation of a stable environment for holding the pacemaker .
