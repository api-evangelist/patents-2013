In some embodiments the DYNAMIC TURBULENCE ENGINE CONTROLLER DTEC as disclosed herein transforms weather terrain and flight parameter data via DTEC components into turbulence avoidance optimized flight plans. In one implementation the DTEC comprises a processor and a memory disposed in communication with the processor and storing processor issuable instructions to receive anticipated flight plan parameter data obtain terrain data based on the flight plan parameter data obtain atmospheric data based on the flight plan parameter data and determine a plurality of four dimensional grid points based on the flight plan parameter data. The DTEC may then determine a non dimensional mountain wave amplitude and mountain top wave drag an upper level non dimensional gravity wave amplitude and a buoyant turbulent kinetic energy. The DTEC determines a boundary layer eddy dissipation rate storm velocity and eddy dissipation rate from updrafts maximum updraft speed at grid point equilibrium level and storm divergence while the updraft speed is above the equilibrium level and identify storm top. The DTEC determines storm overshoot and storm drag Doppler speed eddy dissipation rate above the storm top and determine eddy dissipation rate from downdrafts. The DTEC then determines the turbulent kinetic energy for each grid point and as illustrated in identifies an at least one enhanced flight plan based on the flight plan parameter data and the determined turbulent kinetic energy.

Turbulence forecasting methods may focus on discrete areas of turbulence such as clear air turbulence CAT or thunderstorm regions and rely primarily on pilot reports PIREPS and other subjective observational data for determining turbulent airspace regions. The DTEC as disclosed herein utilizes unique predictive components and determinations of turbulence in four dimensional space time and utilizes these predictive models to generate a comprehensive forecasting map display and or overlay that is not merely the visual combination of disparate turbulence projections but is a multi hazard calculated integration of enhanced turbulent regions providing an accurate multi dimensional model of turbulence over a specified spatial temporal area.

The term turbulence as a haphazard secondary motion caused by the eddies of a fluid system has often been treated as a singular event in casual connotation caused by passage through an entropic weather system or by proximity to shifting air flow patterns. This definition is commonly perpetuated by many turbulence forecast platforms that focus on a specific type of turbulence such as CAT without accounting for additional turbulence factors nor how multi hazards conflagrate into not just a series of turbulence events but an enhanced system which continues to flux. In wind thunderstorms and gravity waves the interaction of media such as the ocean and the atmosphere caused by energy transfer on which gravity acts as a restoring force can all be turbulence contributors to a region of three dimensional space over a specified time. An aircraft traveling through this region may experience multiple turbulence hazards . A turbulence forecast display that indicates only CAT with gravity wave interference may display a low hazard area into which an aircraft may be moving. Similarly a weather prediction display may also fail to factor in the additional risk of CAT. In one embodiment of the disclosed DTEC a CAT component producing color coded terminal display of turbulence hazard over a specified area where clear may indicate no turbulence green may indicate low turbulence hazard yellow may indicate medium turbulence hazard and red may indicate high turbulence hazard may be integrated with a mountain wave forecasting component which produces a similar color coded terminal display resulting in an integrated display where the resulting hazard matrix may not be an overlay of the individual turbulence predictions but an enhanced turbulence forecast where individual areas of low or no hazard turbulence may now indicated high hazard turbulence . In some embodiments multiple turbulence overlay displays may be available showing individuated turbulence forecasts without enhancement. In some embodiments of the disclosure only enhanced turbulence forecast displays may be available. In some embodiments of the disclosure users may be able to switch between individuated turbulence forecasts and enhanced turbulence forecasts.

In some embodiments of the disclosure the DTEC may be available to aircraft air traffic controllers flight planning tools and software third party applications where turbulence feed incorporation is contributing and the like. shows that in some embodiments of the disclosure PIREPS and sensor data of aircraft in real time turbulence conditions may send data to the DTEC to be incorporated into the DTEC aggregate data analysis. Similarly in some embodiments of the disclosure additional other sources of input may be weather stations and satellites which may provide numerical weather forecast model data to the DTEC. In one embodiment an array of sensors both local and remote may be periodically polled by the aircraft itself directly by the DTEC and or the like. The polled array of sensors may include for example sensors for measuring altitude heading speed pitch temperature barometric pressure fuel consumption fuel remaining for flight number of passengers aircraft weight and or the like. In some embodiments of the DTEC additional other sources of input may be topological data which may provide terrain characteristic data to the DTEC. In some embodiments of the DTEC the receipt of this input may occur prior to requests to the DTEC for turbulence forecasting. In some embodiments of the DTEC the receipt of this input may be ongoing during requests to the DTEC for turbulence forecasting. In some embodiments of the DTEC receipts of input may be both before requests to the DTEC for turbulence forecasting and ongoing during forecasting requests. In some embodiments an aircraft may request near real time localized turbulence data an air traffic control system may request predictive regional turbulence data as an updating feed and or a near real time regional turbulence data request a flight planning tool or software may request predictive turbulence within a flight path region or along a flight path course . In some embodiments the DTEC may direct such requests through a turbulence integration component e.g. where DTEC components such as MWAVE component INTTURB component and VVTURB2 component process input into eddy dissipation rate EDR values and render them for terminal standard high definition and or displays of the like. An example real time turbulence request substantially in the form of an HTTP S POST message including XML formatted data is provided below 

In some embodiments the DTEC may return a real time near real time turbulence map terminal display to an aircraft a predictive and updating regional data feed to an air traffic controller a predictive flight path turbulence display to a flight planning tool software a turbulence data feed to a third party application displaying turbulence data and or the like. An example predictive flight path turbulence response substantially in the form of an HTTP S POST message including XML formatted data is provided below 

In one embodiment of the DTEC s turbulence integration component is put forth. Beginning with turbulence data input as derived from such sources as user application input weather terrain PIREPs aircraft sensors and or the like which may provide the DTEC with four dimensional grid points three dimensional space plus time temperature winds humidity topography current turbulent conditions historical conditions and or the like the DTEC may first process the input through a mountain wave turbulence component MWAVE . The system computes the non dimensional mountain wave amplitude and computes the mountain top wave drag . The following example code fragment shows one embodiment of a methodology for such processing 

In some embodiments of the DTEC output obtained from the MWAVE component may then be directed into an integrated turbulence calculation component INTTURB which will compute upper level non dimensional gravity wave amplitude and sum and into a to determine buoyant turbulent kinetic energy TKE . If a is greater than 1 then TKE TKE TKE. Otherwise TKE 0 . If a greater than then TKE TKE. The boundary layer eddy dissipation rate EDR is computed and if EDRis greater than zero and is not enhanced then the EDR EDR else the EDR is the TKE.

The following example code fragment shows one embodiment of a methodology for processing of the INTTURB determination request 

In some embodiments of the DTEC output obtained from the MWAVE and INTTURB components may then be processed through a vertical velocity turbulence with perimeter turbulence integration component VVTURB2 . The storm velocity is computed as is the EDR from computed updrafts . The maximum updraft speed at the grid point equilibrium level EL is computed . While the updraft speed is above the EL the storm s divergence is calculated after which the storm top is identified . Storm overshoot the storm top minus the storm EL and storm drag the overshoot squared multiplied by the stability between the EL and storm up squared are calculated . The magnitude of the wind velocity minus the storm velocity is calculated known as the Doppler speed . The EDR above the storm top is computed . If there is turbulence within a set distance or radius by way of example thirty kilometers of the storm then the EDR near the storm is also computed . Otherwise only the EDR from downdrafts is additionally computed . Finally all EDRs computed from INTURB and VVTURB2 components are summed and converted to TKE .

The following exemplary code fragment shows one embodiment of a methodology for processing of the VVTURB2 component 

The following code fragment shows an additional or alternative embodiment of component embodiments to address above storm turbulence for some embodiments an example image resulting for which is shown in 

In some embodiments of the disclosure this initial input component may then be followed by DTEC turbulence integration of the generated geospatial grid region some examples of which have been described in . The DTEC may create an overlay to the generated grid region and may request additional information about the desired parameters of the flight path through this grid region . In some embodiments of the disclosure these parameters may include schedule based path finding shortest path immediacy schedule based but with circumvention of acute turbulence shortest path avoiding high hazard turbulence areas discursive turbulence circumvention navigating out of turbulence areas and or any combination of or intermediate stage to these parameters. The DTEC may then use available input as described in the input component to determine all flight path creation parameters . The DTEC may then create a flight path over the integrated turbulence grid region considering flight path creation parameters . The DTEC may then display the proposed flight path to the user as a terminal overlay standard or high definition map overlay and or the like as is applicable to the flight planning tool. If the flight path is satisfactory the user may then exit the flight path planning component of the DTEC as an incorporated flight planning tool option In some embodiments of the disclosure the DTEC may allow the user to export the determined flight path to other media save the flight path to the user profile share the flight path with additional users and or the like. In some embodiments of the disclosure if the proposed flight path is not satisfactory the DTEC may allow the user to modify flight path creation parameters . In some embodiments of the disclosure the user may reenter a flight path creation component as specified in earlier steps . In some embodiments of the disclosure users may be allowed to visually manipulate flight path options using the proposed flight path turbulence grid overlay. In some embodiments of the disclosure the user may be able to reenter flight path creation visually manipulate the proposed flight path and or combine these methods in any intermediate path modification.

In some embodiments the DTEC may provide a file or data stream as output in which values of the DTEC during component production including but not limited to EDR finalization may be recorded or provided. One example of a DTEC CSV output file is provided below showing an in flight time sequence of forecasted turbulence 

In some embodiments of the DTEC a file or feed e.g. a CSV file output from the DTEC may be provided as input to a geometric vector data generator which may provide additional data output options. In some embodiments of the DTEC the geometric vector data generator may output geometric vector data files to a file server which may provide the data output to an alert server which may provide the output a communications networks to such partners third parties software applications end users and or the like as described. In some embodiments of the DTEC the geometric vector data generator may output geometric vector data files such as shapefiles for storage in GIS database s . In some embodiments of the DTEC Web Mapping Services WMS and or Web Feature Services WFS may obtain the geometric vector data files from GIS database s and provide geographic service integrators with DTEC output data through various communication networks as described. In some embodiments of the DTEC file server s and or WMS may incorporate the DTEC output data into a DTEC integrated server with application data and or network components. A DTEC integrated server may employ such output data from DTEC determination components in proprietary software tools web services mobile applications and or the like. In one embodiment of the DTEC a DTEC integrated server may employ DTEC component output for use in flight planning tools such as AviationSentry Online .

As shown in the figure the DTEC alerting component receives and or retrieves via response to a database query current aircraft position e.g. flight profile data from a flight profile database and may also receive the previously predicted turbulence for that route or for an anticipated route if the actual flight plan is not provided . The DTEC then determines real time turbulence for the planned route and compares the predicted turbulence to the real time turbulence . If the newly determined real time turbulence does not deviate notably from the previously predicted anticipated turbulence then the process cycles e.g. for a certain period 1 min 2 min 5 min 10 min etc. or for some other measure such as location of one or more aircraft weather events and or the like. If the newly determined real time turbulence is a notable deviation or significant difference from the previously predicted turbulence then the turbulence is updated and the process continues. Note that the threshold difference or deviation may be set by the DTEC or DTEC user subscriber and in some embodiments may be any numerical change while in other embodiments may be a change or certain magnitude or percentage.

When the turbulence is updated the DTEC determines if there is a known or determinable turbulence threshold for the flight aircraft. For example a commercial passenger aircraft that subscribes to the DTEC may have set a particular turbulence threshold in the profile reflecting that passenger aircraft may wish to avoid significant turbulence for safety and comfort reasons while a cargo aircraft may have a much higher threshold and be willing to undertake more turbulence to save time and or money. The threshold may also be predicted determined based on the airframe and or airfoil type the user the flight plan fuel resources alternative routes etc. For flights aircraft that the turbulence threshold either is not known or is not determinable the DTEC may have a default i.e. safety threshold and if that default threshold is exceeded may issue an alert or notification to the aircraft and or ground control .

If the flight turbulence threshold is known i.e. the flight has a subscription or is otherwise registered with the DTEC the DTEC determines whether the turbulence exceeds the specified threshold and if so determines if the flight s route can be adjusted or updated by the DTEC e.g. using the flight path component discussed in and to find the optimal path based on the desired turbulence profile threshold and various flight parameters such as fuel reserves destination aircraft type etc. If the DTEC is unable or is not configured to provide an alternative or adjusted flight plan an alert or notification is generated issued. If the DTEC can adjust or update the flight s route the adjusted modified route is determined and the flight plan is adjusted accordingly and updated . Note that in some embodiments an adjusted or modified flight plan or a selection of plans may be provided for approval or selection

In some embodiments the DTEC server may issue PHP SQL commands to query a database table such as Profile for profile data. An example profile data query substantially in the form of PHP SQL commands is provided below 

The DTEC server may store the profile data in a DTEC database. For example the DTEC server may issue PHP SQL commands to store the data to a database table such as Profile . An example profile data store command substantially in the form of PHP SQL commands is provided below 

Various embodiments of the DTEC may be used to provide real time pre flight and or in flight turbulence reporting planning and response. The integrated unified turbulence system provided by the DTEC may be used in flight equipment and or ground equipment. The DTEC may provide weather aviation decision support e.g. via graphical displays and or provide alerts triggers. Although it is discussed in terms of re routing in time of increased turbulence in some embodiments the DTEC may identify more efficient paths based on real time updates where there is decreased turbulence over a shorter physical distance and may update a flight plan accordingly. The DTEC identifies 4D areas for flight hazards and a user may choose or set their profile based on particular hazards e.g. a passenger airline would have a different hazard turbulence profile than an air freight company and a large airliner would have a different profile from a small plane or helicopter . Various cost calculations and risk calculations may also be used in determining alerts and or flight paths. In some embodiments real time feedback may come from plane mounted instrument sensors and provide updates to predicted turbulence. Such information may be used to refine component configurations for turbulence determination. Although examples were discussed in the context of jet airliners it is to be understood that the DTEC may be utilized for low level services such as helicopters unmanned aerial vehicles as well as high speed and or military aircraft and may even have potential ground applications especially in mountainous terrain. The DTEC may work with air traffic control particularly in management of routing. In some embodiments the DTEC may input directly in avionics systems to guide planes.

Prior to the DTEC forecasts of turbulence if even available were generally qualitative e.g. light heavy independent of aircraft type and did not include all sources of turbulence e.g. they specifically exclude thunderstorms or interactions of turbulence thus making them unusable for most practical applications such as flight planning. The integrated turbulence forecast of the DTEC is unique because it dynamically determines the location and level at which each comprehensive turbulence determination is made based on the meteorological conditions at that point in space and time. In some embodiments the result is a single integrated forecast that includes all sources of turbulence and is produced in quantitative units such as Eddy Dissipation Rate EDR thus making it suitable for practical uses such as flight planning applications and allows for categorical flexibility specific to an aircraft.

In some embodiments the DTEC integrates three DTEC turbulence components ULTURB BLTURB and MWAVE into one component program called INTTURB. In some additional or alternative embodiments the DTEC integrates VVTURB with ULTURB and BLTURB into a component program called VVINTTURB. Output from all components may in EDR an aircraft independent metric of turbulence intensity. The DTEC may assign an EDR value at each model grid point and at each flight level. Observations of turbulence may also be used for further tuning of the forecast where and when they are available.

An FPGA s logic blocks can be programmed to perform the operation of basic logic gates such as AND and XOR or more complex combinational operators such as decoders or simple mathematical operations. In most FPGAs the logic blocks also include memory elements which may be circuit flip flops or more complete blocks of memory. In some circumstances the DTEC may be developed on regular FPGAs and then migrated into a fixed version that more resembles ASIC implementations. Alternate or coordinating implementations may migrate DTEC controller features to a final ASIC instead of or in addition to FPGAs. Depending on the implementation all of the aforementioned embedded components and microprocessors may be considered the CPU and or processor for the DTEC.

Generally any mechanization and or embodiment allowing a processor to affect the storage and or retrieval of information is regarded as memory . However memory is a fungible technology and resource thus any number of memory embodiments may be employed in lieu of or in concert with one another. It is to be understood that the DTEC controller and or a computer systemization may employ various forms of memory . For example a computer systemization may be configured wherein the operation of on chip CPU memory e.g. registers RAM ROM and any other storage devices are provided by a paper punch tape or paper punch card mechanism however such an embodiment would result in an extremely slow rate of operation. In a typical configuration memory will include ROM RAM and a storage device . A storage device may be any conventional computer system storage. Storage devices may include a drum a fixed and or removable magnetic disk drive a magneto optical drive an optical drive i.e. Blueray CD ROM RAM Recordable R ReWritable RW DVD R RW HD DVD R RW etc. an array of devices e.g. Redundant Array of Independent Disks RAID solid state memory devices USB memory solid state drives SSD etc. other processor readable storage mediums and or other devices of the like. Thus a computer systemization generally requires and makes use of memory.

The memory may contain a collection of program and or database components and or data such as but not limited to operating system component s operating system information server component s information server user interface component s user interface Web browser component s Web browser database s mail server component s mail client component s cryptographic server component s cryptographic server the DTEC component s and or the like i.e. collectively a component collection . These components may be stored and accessed from the storage devices and or from storage devices accessible through an interface bus. Although non conventional program components such as those in the component collection typically are stored in a local storage device they may also be loaded and or stored in memory such as peripheral devices RAM remote storage facilities through a communications network ROM various forms of memory and or the like.

The operating system component is an executable program component facilitating the operation of the DTEC controller. Typically the operating system facilitates access of I O network interfaces peripheral devices storage devices and or the like. The operating system may be a highly fault tolerant scalable and secure system such as Apple Macintosh OS X Server AT T Plan 9 Be OS Unix and Unix like system distributions such as AT T s UNIX Berkley Software Distribution BSD variations such as FreeBSD NetBSD OpenBSD and or the like Linux distributions such as Red Hat Ubuntu and or the like and or the like operating systems. However more limited and or less secure operating systems also may be employed such as Apple Macintosh OS IBM OS 2 Microsoft DOS Microsoft Windows 2000 2003 3.1 95 98 CE Millenium NT Vista XP Server Palm OS and or the like. An operating system may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or the like. Most frequently the operating system communicates with other program components user interfaces and or the like.

The information server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers and allows for the manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components. After a Domain Name System DNS resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the DTEC controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example a request such as http 123.124.125.126 myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request 123.124.125.126 resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the myInformation.html portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information myInformation.html. Additionally other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports e.g. FTP communications across port and or the like. An information server may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the information server communicates with the DTEC database operating systems other program components user interfaces Web browsers and or the like.

Access to the DTEC database may be achieved through a number of database bridge mechanisms such as through scripting languages as enumerated below e.g. CGI and through inter application communication channels as enumerated below e.g. CORBA WebObjects etc. . Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into appropriate grammars as required by the DTEC. In one embodiment the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields and parsed as such. The entered terms are then passed along with the field tags which act to instruct the parser to generate queries directed to appropriate tables and or fields. In one embodiment the parser may generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join select commands based on the tagged text entries wherein the resulting command is provided over the bridge mechanism to the DTEC as a query. Upon generating query results from the query the results are passed over the bridge mechanism and may be parsed for formatting and generation of a new results Web page by the bridge mechanism. Such a new results Web page is then provided to the information server which may supply it to the requesting Web browser.

Also an information server may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses.

Computer interfaces in some respects are similar to automobile operation interfaces. Automobile operation interface elements such as steering wheels gearshifts and speedometers facilitate the access operation and display of automobile resources and status.

Also in place of a Web browser and information server a combined application may be developed to perform similar operations of both. The combined application would similarly affect the obtaining and the provision of information to users user agents and or the like from the DTEC enabled nodes. The combined application may be nugatory on systems employing standard Web browsers.

Employing such encryption security protocols the DTEC may encrypt all incoming and or outgoing communications and may serve as node within a virtual private network VPN with a wider communications network. The cryptographic component facilitates the process of security authorization whereby access to a resource is inhibited by a security protocol wherein the cryptographic component effects authorized access to the secured resource. In addition the cryptographic component may provide unique identifiers of content e.g. employing and MD5 hash to obtain a unique signature for a digital audio file. A cryptographic component may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. The cryptographic component supports encryption schemes allowing for the secure transmission of information across a communications network to enable the DTEC component to engage in secure transactions if so desired.

The DTEC database component may be embodied in a database and its stored data. The database is a stored program component which is executed by the CPU the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be a conventional fault tolerant relational scalable secure database such as Oracle or Sybase. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field i.e. the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely they uniquely identify rows of a table on the one side of a one to many relationship.

Alternatively the DTEC database may be implemented using various standard data structures such as an array hash linked list struct structured text file e.g. XML table and or the like. Such data structures may be stored in memory and or in structured files. In another alternative an object oriented database may be used such as Frontier ObjectStore Poet Zope and or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are grouped and or linked together by common attributes they may be related to other object collections by some common attributes. Object oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data but may have other types of capabilities encapsulated within a given object. If the DTEC database is implemented as a data structure the use of the DTEC database may be integrated into another component such as the DTEC component . Also the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures objects and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated and or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions of databases e.g. tables may be exported and or imported and thus decentralized and or integrated.

In one embodiment the database component includes several tables .

In one embodiment the DTEC database may interact with other database systems. For example employing a distributed database system queries and data access by search DTEC component may treat the combination of the DTEC database an integrated data security layer database as a single database entity.

In one embodiment user programs may contain various user interface primitives which may serve to update the DTEC. Also various accounts may require custom database tables depending upon the environments and the types of clients the DTEC may need to serve. It should be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative embodiment these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective database controllers i.e. individual database controllers for each of the above tables . Employing standard data processing techniques one may further distribute the databases over several computer systemizations and or storage devices. Similarly configurations of the decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and or distributing the various database components . The DTEC may be configured to keep track of various settings inputs and parameters via database controllers.

The DTEC database may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the DTEC database communicates with the DTEC component other program components and or the like. The database may contain retain and provide information regarding other nodes and data.

The DTEC component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. In one embodiment the DTEC component incorporates any and or all combinations of the aspects of the DTEC discussed in the previous figures. As such the DTEC affects accessing obtaining and the provision of information services transactions and or the like across various communications networks.

The DTEC component may transform weather data input via DTEC components into real time and or predictive turbulence feeds and displays and or the like and use of the DTEC.

In one embodiment the DTEC server employs a cryptographic server to encrypt and decrypt communications. The DTEC component may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the DTEC component communicates with the DTEC database operating systems other program components and or the like. The DTEC may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses.

The structure and or operation of any of the DTEC node controller components may be combined consolidated and or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development and or deployment. Similarly the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and or development. To accomplish this one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.

The component collection may be consolidated and or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node and or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load balancing and or data processing techniques. Furthermore single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and or storage devices e.g. databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.

The configuration of the DTEC controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as but not limited to the budget capacity location and or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and or integrated program components results in a more distributed series of program components and or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration data may be communicated obtained and or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate obtain and or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra application data processing communication techniques such as but not limited to data referencing e.g. pointers internal messaging object instance variable communication shared memory space variable passing and or the like.

If component collection components are discrete separate and or external to one another then communicating obtaining and or providing data with and or to other components may be accomplished through inter application data processing communication techniques such as but not limited to Application Program Interfaces API information passage distributed Component Object Model D COM Distributed Object Linking and Embedding D OLE and or the like Common Object Request Broker Architecture CORBA Jini local and remote application program interfaces JavaScript Object Notation JSON Remote Method Invocation RMI SOAP process pipes shared files and or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using development tools such as lex yacc XML and or the like which allow for grammar generation and parsing capabilities which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components.

where Value1 is discerned as being a parameter because http is part of the grammar syntax and what follows is considered part of the post value. Similarly with such a grammar a variable Value1 may be inserted into an http post command and then sent. The grammar syntax itself may be presented as structured data that is interpreted and or otherwise used to generate the parsing mechanism e.g. a syntax description text file as processed by lex yacc etc. . Also once the parsing mechanism is generated and or instantiated it itself may process and or parse structured data such as but not limited to character e.g. tab delineated text HTML structured text streams XML and or the like structured data. In another embodiment inter application data processing protocols themselves may have integrated and or readily available parsers e.g. JSON SOAP and or like parsers that may be employed to parse e.g. communications data. Further the parsing grammar may be used beyond message parsing but may also be used to parse databases data collections data stores structured data and or the like. Again the desired configuration will depend upon the context environment and requirements of system deployment.

For example in some implementations the DTEC controller may be executing a PHP script implementing a Secure Sockets Layer SSL socket server via the information server which listens to incoming communications on a server port to which a client may send data e.g. data encoded in JSON format. Upon identifying an incoming communication the PHP script may read the incoming message from the client device parse the received JSON encoded text data to extract information from the JSON encoded text data into PHP script variables and store the data e.g. client identifying information etc. and or extracted information in a relational database accessible using the Structured Query Language SQL . An exemplary listing written substantially in the form of PHP SQL commands to accept JSON encoded input data from a client device via a SSL connection parse the data to extract variables and store the data to a database is provided below 

Also the following resources may be used to provide example embodiments regarding SOAP parser implementation
