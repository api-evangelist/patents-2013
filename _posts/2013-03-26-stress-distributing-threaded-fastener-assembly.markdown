abstract: An improved nut-and-bolt assembly reduces tensile stress concentration on the bolt. The assembly has a specially designed nut with a tapered region extending from the nut crown and threaded with the first several bolt threads. The cross sectional area of the tapered region decreases linearly as a function of distance from the crown whereby the tapered region has a convex profile. Each of the bolt threads engaging the tapered region take up an approximately equal amount of longitudinal stress on the bolt.

The invention described here may be made used and licensed by and for the U.S. Government for governmental purposes without paying royalty to me.

The invention relates generally to fasteners and particularly relates to nut and bolt connections in articles or structures subjected to shock loads or subjected to severe conditions tending to fatigue fasteners.

The invention teaches a fastener assembly where a specially designed tapered nut reduces concentration of longitudinal stress on bolt threads engaged with the nut. A relevant item of prior art is an article entitled Reduction of Stress Concentration in Bolt Nut Fasteners by Srinan Venkatesan and Gary L. Kinzel published in the November 2006 issue of the . That article discusses various modifications to nuts and bolts to reduce stress concentration on fastener threads. The most relevant modification is Model F shown in Table 1 of the article. Model F shows a bevel on the nut in conjunction with a groove on the end of the bolt the article dismisses the Model F construction as unworthy of further study because a Model E which has a notch on the nut as opposed to a bevel was more effective. An article dealing generally with longitudinal stress on fastener threads is Notes on Nuts and Bolts at http www.gizmology.netinuts bolts.htm. Tapered nuts are commonly used in a fashion wherein the outer surface of the nut bears against a complimentary tapered seat or socket as seen for example in FIG. 6 of U.S. Pat. No. 5 279 407 to Shoback.

Taught herein is an improved fastener assembly for connecting structural elements together wherein tensile stress distribution is controlled to minimize failures of the assembly. The assembly has a fastener such as a bolt having a head and a threaded shank passing through the elements. Engaging the bolt is a specially designed nut having a crown and a tapered region threaded with several of the bolt threads the tapered region extending from the crown toward one of the elements. The cross sectional area of the tapered region decreases linearly as a function of distance from the crown and the tapered region has a convex profile. The end of the tapered region distal from the crown is spaced from the elements and this end has a collar region with apertures to reduce the collar region s stiffness. Either a spacer or one of the structural elements surrounds and encloses the tapered region and forms a radial gap therewith so that the outer diametrical surface of the tapered region is a free or nonbearing surface. Each of the bolt threads engaging the tapered region takes up an approximately equal amount of longitudinal stress on the bolt. This phenomenon differs from what occurs in conventional fastener arrangements wherein the first few bolt threads at the bolt entry side of the nut take up the majority of the longitudinal stress.

The following definitions and terminology are applied as understood by one skilled in the appropriate art.

The singular forms such as a an and the include plural references unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. For example reference to a material includes reference to one or more of such materials and an element includes reference to one or more of such elements.

As used herein substantial about and approximately when used in reference to a quantity or amount of a material dimension characteristic parameter and the like refer to an amount that is sufficient to provide an effect that the material or characteristic was intended to provide as understood by one skilled in the art. The amount of variation generally depends on the specific implementation. Similarly substantially free of or the like refers to the lack of an identified composition characteristic or property. Particularly assemblies that are identified as being substantially free of are either completely absent of the characteristic or the characteristic is present only in values which are small enough that no meaningful effect on the desired results is generated.

Concentrations values dimensions amounts and other quantitative data may be presented herein in a range format. One skilled in the art will understand that such range format is used for convenience and brevity and should be interpreted flexibly to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub range is explicitly recited. For example a size range of about 1 dimensional unit to about 100 dimensional units should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited limits but also to include individual sizes such as 2 dimensional units 3 dimensional units 10 dimensional units and the like and sub ranges such as 10 dimensional units to 50 dimensional units 20 dimensional units to 100 dimensional units and the like.

Each point on graph line indicates the stress level on bolt at the position on shank where the point is located. The stress level falls abruptly from left to right in just after shank passes through the entry side of nut which is the first part of the nut engaged by shank as the nut is placed thereon. Typically the first thread takes about one third of the stress the second thread takes about another one fourth of the stress and the third thread takes about another one sixth of the stress. Typically too the first six threads together in a conventional nut bolt connection take up about 98 of the bolt s longitudinal stress. The abrupt change in the stress just described creates a complex local stress state including elevated shear stresses which lead to local failure. Consequently bolt tends to fail at the first few threads such as threads and . If a nut and bolt assembly such as assembly is used in a military vehicle the assembly may be subjected to shock loads when explosions occur under or near the vehicle or when the vehicle is struck by an incoming projectile. When bolt fails at one of the first few threads due to these shock loads nut and the severed portion of the bolt are propelled away from element which in the case of a military vehicle could be the interior hull or wall panel of the vehicle crew compartment. Thus a bolt failure is a risk to the crew and contents of the vehicle.

In addition to the hazard of the nuts and bolt portions becoming projectiles bolt failures can lead to structural failures of vehicle components wherein for example critical blast shielding is no longer held in place or critical automotive functions of the vehicle are disabled. These failures can occur not only when the vehicle is impacted by explosions or projectiles but also can occur due to fatiguing of the bolt during normal operation of the vehicle.

To avoid the foregoing hazard and failures a nut and bolt assembly has been created in which the tensile stiffness of the nut is reduced where the bolt enters the nut. This assembly distributes the axial or longitudinal stress on the bolt more evenly over a greater number of threads and avoids an abrupt change in that longitudinal stress level. The improved assembly s design is shown generally as assembly in wherein a bolt threads into a specially designed nut . It will be understood that bolt has a conventional bolt head not shown similar to bolt head in . Threaded shaft or shank can be replaced by a simple threaded rod and the bolt head can be replaced by a second nut or a similar bearing fastening element which functions as a bolt head. It will also be understood that assembly is used to fasten any two elements together such as elements and shown in however for convenience only one such element designated as in is shown in connection with assembly .

Nut has a polygonal region or crown shaped similarly to a conventional nut and typically has a generally hexagonal cross sectional shape but other crown shapes can be employed. Extending from crown is an elongate tapered region elongate here meaning that the axial or longitudinal dimension of region is greater than its largest outer diameter. Region has its largest diameter where it joins crown and has its smallest diameter at bolt receipt end which is the part of region most distal from crown region . End is spaced from and does not contact element so that region is free to stretch axially toward that element. Preferably the taper has a convex profile as shown in exaggerated fashion in and preferably but not necessarily engages six or more threads. The threads at or near end are designated as first distal thread second distal thread and third distal thread wherein distal thread is the most remote from crown thread is the next most distal and so on.

The convex taper profile occurs because the cross sectional area of region decreases linearly with or in direct proportion to a factor determined by two variables. The first variable is the difference in tensile stiffness or tensile modulus between the materials of the nut and bolt. The second variable is the distance from crown . In the case where the bolt and nut are of the same material it is preferred that the cross sectional area of end be 15 or less than the cross sectional area of the shank or threaded portion of bolt .

If bolt has a greater or lesser tensile stiffness or tensile modulus than nut the rate at which the cross sectional area of region changes is still linear but is multiplied by a constant value representing the differential in tensile stiffness of the bolt and nut. For example if the tensile stiffness of bolt is three times as great as the nut the cross sectional area of region would be three times greater and end would preferably have a cross sectional of no more than 45 the cross sectional area of the shank or threaded portion of the bolt. But if the tensile stiffness of bolt were one third that of nut then the cross sectional area would be three times smaller and end would preferably have a cross sectional area of no more than 5 of the shank of bolt .

For purposes of comparing the cross sectional areas of region and the shank of bolt two different methods are contemplated although other methods can be applied. The cross sectional areas used can be the minimum cross sectional areas of the bolt s shank and of the nut at a given distance from crown these would be calculated using the minimum pitch diameter of the shank and the maximum pitch diameter of the nut. Alternately the average cross sectional areas of the shank and nut can be used.

Tapered region has a collar or collar zone located at end zone typically having the same taper as the rest of region but alternately having no taper such that the outer diameter of zone is parallel to the longitudinal axis of nut . Zone defines a plurality of either blind holes or through holes about its circumference these holes reducing the tensile stiffness of the zone. Holes obviate the need to taper region to a sharp edge at end so that end has a blunt edge whereby entry of bolt into nut is facilitated and nut is safer to use.

A cylindrical spacer is disposed between crown and element the spacer enclosing region and enclosing the threaded portion of bolt between end and element . Spacer preferably defines a radial gap with tapered region so that the spacer does not support or reinforce tapered region whereby the outer diametrical surface of region is a free surface in the sense that it does not bear against another surface or contact other components. In particular region does not contact a complimentarily tapered seat as is the case with some conventional lug nuts. Spacer need not be cylindrical but it does need to have an internal bore where tapered region is located.

Similarly to superimposed on the depiction of assembly is a nominal graph of axial or longitudinal stress on bolt as a function of position along the bolt s longitudinal axis about which bolt is centered. Note that the Position abscissa in does not represent zero values for longitudinal stress but abscissa does represent in conjunction with line the stress value for a several thread engagement between nut and bolt . Each point on graph line indicates the longitudinal stress level on bolt at the position along axis where the point is located. Typically each engaged thread such as threads and will take up an approximately equal percentage of the longitudinal stress. Preferably under ideal thread mating conditions the variation is no more than two percent between adjacent threads. However the precise percentage of the longitudinal stress taken up by each thread will depend on details of construction that will vary for specific applications. Such details include for example the material of nut which can be different than the material of which bolt is made. Other details include without limitation the maximum outer diameter of region the size and shape of apertures thread size thread pitch and fit quality between the nut and bolt.

In is shown an alternate arrangement for the new nut and bolt assembly which is designated as reference numeral . Assembly features a nut which is identical to nut in except that the convex profile of the nut s tapered region is not exaggerated for effect as is tapered region in . However region does have a convex profile. Assembly has a threaded rod or shank as opposed to a bolt engaged with nut . Instead of a bolt head there is a second conventional female threaded fastener such as standard nut . Clamped between nut and crown of nut are two structural elements and which can be walls panels plates bracket arms or other component of an article of manufacture or a building. One of the structural elements can be replaced by a spacer element such as a washer or spacer shown in .

It will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention and it is understood this invention is limited only by the following claims.
