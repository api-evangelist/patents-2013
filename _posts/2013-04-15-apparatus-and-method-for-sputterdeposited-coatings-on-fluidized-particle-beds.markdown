This patent application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 324 613 titled Apparatus and Method for producing sputter deposited coatings on fluidized particle beds filed on Apr. 16 2012 the entire contents which are hereby incorporated by reference herein including all attachments and other documents that were incorporated by reference in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 324 613.

Governmental Interest The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.

Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to an apparatus that transfers vibratory motion through a wall of a deposition chamber to produce a fluidized bed of particles or fibers inside the chamber. The present invention also provides a method of making coated particles coated fibers and other structures.

Coated particles especially microparticles have many fields of application advanced composite materials medicine paints and other coatings with controlled optical properties. In composites conformal coatings can improve chemical compatibility or adhesion between the filler particles and the matrix material. Such coatings can also act as barriers preventing reaction between particles and the surrounding environment. Barrier coatings can also be semi permeable allowing slowed or controlled reactions such as time release medicine microparticles. Coatings on microparticles can also be tailored to produce specific desired optical properties. By carefully tuning coating properties particles can be designed to reflect specific colors for instance. The coated particles can then be mixed into a matrix material to produce paint or a composite with very specific optical properties.

Such diverse applications demand a coating system that can produce a wide variety of coatings on a wide variety of particles. Physical vapor deposition PVD including techniques such as sputtering and evaporation can produce such varied coatings using metals and ceramics. PVD also allows for careful control of deposition rate and thus coating thickness and composition. Multilayer coatings and custom alloy coatings can be created using multiple PVD sources. When coating particles the coatings must be conformal and uniform on large numbers of particles. Combining a PVD coating system with a fluidized bed system allows large numbers of particles to be conformally and uniformly coated as required.

A fluidized bed of solid particles can be formed by applying a mechanical vibration to the bed. Under the right vibration conditions the particle bed reaches a dynamic state in which the particles move rapidly and randomly throughout the material volume and the system appears to flow like a fluid. The frequency amplitude and waveform of the vibration can be used to tune the behavior of the fluidized bed. Different bed masses particle sizes shapes and densities can be fluidized by tuning the driving frequency and amplitude of the vibration. The random dynamic mixing achieved in a fluidized bed makes it an ideal platform for creating full coverage particle coatings from line of sight deposition techniques such as sputtering. Additionally the random motion of the particle bed results in uniform and consistent particle coatings even if the deposition source is spatially non uniform.

Previous systems have utilized vibratory motion to create a fluidized bed inside a PVD chamber by placing vibratory sources within the PVD chamber see for example and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 506 053 and 6 288 837 to Hubbard and U.S. Pat. No. 7 312 097 to Hammerbacher et al. However as many PVD operations require controlled environments and sub ambient pressures these previous methods have required specialized vibratory sources that can withstand vacuum conditions and material released from the deposition source. These constraints limit the size and flexibility of the coating system and add considerable expense and maintenance requirements.

The present invention provides a novel method and a novel apparatus for transferring vibratory motion from outside to inside the vacuum chamber to produce a fluidized bed. The method allows the use of non vacuum rated vibratory sources thus reducing complexity and cost compared to systems in the previously described patents. The present system also allows a wider variety of coatings to be produced on particles having a larger range of shapes and sizes compared to systems of the previously described patents. Sputter deposition using multiple sputter sources is employed to produce single and multi layer coatings on the fluidized particles. Simultaneous co sputtering can also produce custom alloy coatings on the fluidized particles. The technique also allows for the randomization of a very high number of particles for example millions whereas simpler shaking or tumbling techniques can only effectively agitate tens or hundreds of particles.

Therefore the inventors have provided an improved apparatus and methods for coating particles and or fibers within a chamber which vibratory motion for a fluidized bed is generated externally to a chamber and transmitted into the chamber via a mechanical linkage.

Embodiments of the present provide an apparatus for physical vapor deposition of coatings onto a fluidized bed of particles. A method is also provided that utilizes two systems a novel system for producing the fluidized bed and a physical vapor deposition PVD system to produce coatings. In one exemplary embodiment the fluidized bed system consists of a function generator a vibratory shaker and a series of mechanical linkages including a rotary motion feedthrough rated to high vacuum for example less than 10Torr to transfer the vibratory motion to the inside of the PVD chamber. The PVD system consists of an evaporation source or multiple sputter sources as well as the associated power supplies these devices require for DC or RF deposition.

Embodiments of the present invention include methods for physical vapor deposition of one or more coatings onto a plurality of particles or fibers that include placing a plurality of particles or fibers in a holder in a chamber sealing the chamber reducing the pressure inside the chamber to create a vacuum vibrating the holder and the plurality of particles or fibers in the holder with a means for generating vibration wherein the means for generating vibration is external to the chamber and is connected to the holder through the wall of the chamber via a sealed mechanical linkage that extends through a wall of the chamber and then depositing a metal or a ceramic coating onto the plurality of particles or fibers. Desirably the magnitude and frequency of the vibrations is such that the particles or fibers vibrate in a fluid like random motion that facilitates physical deposition.

An exemplary apparatus of the present invention includes a shaker device that produces controlled mechanical vibration. Suggested shaker devices include but are not limited to an electromagnetic or piezoelectric shaker or any other known means of providing vibration. Generally the shaker should be capable of providing shaking in the approximate range of 2 1000 Hz at least 5 lbf and at least 0.25 inch peak to peak displacement. A suggested commercially available shaker includes but is not limited to a PM25A shaker by MB Dynamics. The output head A of shaker device is rigidly coupled to a first rigid angled rod . First rod may be composed of metal or composite materials. A first shaft coupler A rigidly joins first rod to a vacuum rated rotary motion feedthrough . A second shaft coupler B rigidly couples feedthrough to a second rigid metal rod . Second rod is rigidly connected to the sample holder assembly . One or multiple deposition sources are directed at sample holder . Exemplary deposition sources include but are not limited to RF magnetron sputtering DC magnetron sputtering ion beam assisted sputtering HiPIM high power impulse magnetron sputtering and evaporation deposition sources. Desirably coupler B shaft and sample holder assembly are all completely contained within vacuum chamber . Desirably the vacuum chamber can be operated at sub atmospheric pressure preferably below 10Torr and more preferably below 10Torr.

Shaker shaft and coupler A are all desirably completely outside of chamber . Rotary feedthrough transfers motion through the chamber wall and deposition source may have power and water connections through the walls of chamber . Shaker vibrates one end of rod which becomes a rotational motion at the other end of rod . Coupler A transmits the rotational motion to feedthrough . Feedthrough transmits the rotary motion through the wall of chamber to coupler B. Preferably the feedthrough is vacuum rated to 10Torr or lower and has a one piece shaft so that very small and very fast motion can be transmitted into the vacuum chamber. An exemplary feedthrough is a CF Flanged Solid Shaft KJLC Standard ferro magnetic fluid rotary feedthrough purchased from Kurt J. Lesker Company of Jefferson Hills Pa. that is designed to provide rotary motion under high vacuum. Coupler B transmits the rotary motion to one end of shaft . The other end of shaft effectively vibrates in an up and down motion thus vibrating the sample holder assembly and ultimately creating a fluidized bed of particles . This arrangement simplifies shaker selection design and maintenance as the shaker does not require seals oils electronics and other parts that can withstand high vacuum for extended periods of time.

Suggested uses for particles produced by the methods and or apparatus described herein include but are not limited to paint additives pigments reflective paints coatings dyes metal matrix composites polymer matrix composites specialty metal alloys specialty ceramics time release drugs and passivated catalytic particles.
