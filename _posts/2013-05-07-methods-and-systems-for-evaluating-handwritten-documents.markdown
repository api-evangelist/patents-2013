The presently disclosed embodiments are directed to processing of handwritten documents. More particularly the presently disclosed embodiments are related to a technique for digitizing handwritten documents.

Currently many applications facilitate form filling such as but are not limited to bank account opening mobile connection electricity connection health or insurance claim forms digitization by manually filling each field in the respective forms or applying OCR techniques. The processing of such hand filled forms is usually performed in the back office of respective organizations which may be costly in terms of both time and money. In addition various state of the art processing techniques determines the completeness of the form by checking if there is any content filled in one or more text fields of the hand filled form. However the existing processing techniques have the limitation that it assumes the form to be complete and correct even if there is a scribble or wrongly filled in the one or more text fields.

In addition during the auto population of hand written content in the forms in the back office transcription scenarios for a given hand filled form a data entry operator either fills the whole content of the form manually or gets a set of options to choose from. The latter approach is an automatic way but it is very hard to recommend a correct word based on a word image especially for the hand written content. Therefore even if one character is incorrectly recognized the data entry operator usually deletes the whole recommendation and types it afresh. Thus this requires at least as many keystrokes if not more for using backspace to delete the recommendation and time as it would take in manual data entry.

The image processing module may also employ a format conversion system which can selectively separate handwritten notes from hand drawn sketches in the handwritten document and convert the handwritten notes to typewritten text and the hand drawn sketches to easily editable vector based computer drawings.

The image processing module processes the digital image by separating the text and the images from the digital image. In an embodiment the image processing module implements a MRC technique on the digital image to separate the text and the pictures pictorial content. Based on the MRC technique the image processing module extracts the character with different text fonts colors into separate planes. In another embodiment the image processing module implements the auto windowing technique to separate the text and the pictures in images of the digital image. However it will be apparent to a person having ordinary skill in the art that any other suitable technique for separating the text and the pictorial content can be implemented by the image processing module without limiting the scope of the ongoing description.

In another embodiment the image processing module is further configured for identifying a character in each of the one or more text fields from the digital image by applying a character recognition technique. The character recognition technique employs a character recognition technique for optically reading the handwritten document using an image scanner the scanning equipment generating image data and recognizing a handwritten character from the image data. The character recognition tool for recognizing a handwritten character requires a configuration with which a character recognition ratio can be enhanced by taking the unique features of characters handwritten by the user.

In an embodiment the mark lift optimized image pre processing technique is suitable mainly for recognizing various marks and various hand drawn drawings including but not limited to lines shapes boxes arrows and the like. Various known mark lift optimized image pre processing techniques can be used without limiting the scope of the ongoing description.

Further the Intelligent Character Recognition ICR technique is illustrated for simplicity of explanation however the image processing module is not limited with respect to this technique for identifying the characters in the one or more text fields from the digital image. The number of techniques in cascade in series or one after another i.e. if a former technique fails to correctly determine the characters then a next technique can be applied to determine the characters can be used by the image processing module to determine the characters in the one or more text fields from the digital image.

The validation module obtains the identified characters in the one or more text fields of the digital image from the database . The validation module also retrieves a predefined character type corresponding to the associated text field of the one or more text fields from the database .

The validation module then facilitates comparing of the character type of the identified characters with the predefined character type corresponding to the associated text field of the one or more text fields of the digital image. The results of the comparison are stored in the database .

The validation module is then configured to validate the character in each of the one or more text fields based on the comparison results of the character type of the identified character with the predefined character type corresponding to the associated text field of the one or more text fields.

In an embodiment the validation module checks whether the input character in each of the one or more text fields is legible or a scribble. In an embodiment the text field of the one or more text fields in the digital image where letters and digits are expected as inputted characters each inputted character in said text fields is classified in one of the two classes a letter A Z a z or a digit 0 9 . depicts a snap shot of a digital image in accordance with at least one embodiment. The digital image includes a date field which is to be filled in DDMMYYYY format. However as shown the given user has filled date section as 9021980 in . The validation module will check whether the inputted character 9021980 matches the character type of the format DDMMYYYY of the identified character. As the character type of the format DDMMYYYY is digit 0 9 therefore the validation module will highlight the inputted character 9021980 as an error and not legible in accord with required format e.g. DDMMYYYY . depicts a snap shot of a digital image in accordance with at least one embodiment. The digital image includes a date field which is to be filled in DDMMYYYY format. However as shown the given user has filled the date field as 9FEB1980 in . The validation module will check whether the inputted character 9FEB1980 matches with the associated character types of the format DDMMYYYY of the identified character. As the character type of the format DDMMYYYY is digit 0 9 therefore the validation module will highlight the inputted character 9FEB1980 as an error and not legible in accord with required format e.g. DDMMYYYY .

Referring back to the validation module further creates an evaluation report based on the validating. The evaluation report is stored in the database . For example if the character type of the identified character in the one or more text fields by applying the character recognition technique matches with the predefined character type corresponding to the associated text field of the one or more text fields then the validation module determines that the corresponding character written by the user is correct. For example if the character type of the identified character in the one or more text fields by applying the character recognition technique does not match with the predefined character type corresponding to the associated text field of the one or more text fields then the validation module determines that the corresponding character written by the user is incorrect. The validation module thus generates the evaluation report based on the comparison. In an embodiment the evaluation report includes information such as whether each character filled in the one or more text fields is correct or wrong. In an embodiment the validation module initiates a print command for printing the evaluation report. Thus a printed evaluation report may be provided to the user e.g. a customer who filled the form so that the user can rectify the errors and fill a fresh new form with appropriate entries. In an embodiment the evaluation report may indicate e.g. by marking various places in the form where errors have been made.

The recommendation module is configured for recommending the character in each of the one or more text fields. During digitization a data entry user who is entering the content from the electronic document receives recommendations for the character in each of the one or more text fields from the recommendation module . The recommendation module obtains the identified characters for each of the one or more text fields from the database which are then recommended to the data entry user. depicts a display showing auto fill recommendation for handwritten content in a digital image electronic document in accordance with at least one embodiment. As shown the recommendation module provides recommendation for a company name 2044 PRESTIGE SHANTINIKETAN and a road name WHITLEFIELD MAIN ROAD as mentioned in the digital image. This implies that the image processing module was able to identify and recognize the inputted characters in the company name and the road name field of the handwritten document scanned to the digital image .

In one embodiment the recommendation is provided in a color other than the color of the actual entered character. In another embodiment the recommendation module provides the recommendation at each keystroke while digitization to the data entry user. The data entry user can either accept or over write the recommendation provided by the recommendation module at each keystroke.

Referring back to the recommendation module employs several auto fill techniques that may be configured to update the character in each of the one or more text fields while digitization of the handwritten document. The characters that auto fill techniques may update as herein described is for illustrative purposes only and in no way should be construed as limiting. The data character that is entered into the one or more text fields may be stored in the database and or communicated from processor OCR or any of the other previously described devices or modules.

As shown in the recommendation module provides incorrect recommendation for a name field ADHISHEK TRIPATHI as mentioned in the digital image. This implies that the image processing module was not able to correctly identify and recognize the inputted characters in the name field of the handwritten document scanned to the digital image .

In an embodiment if the image processing module does not correctly recognize all the characters in a given field the recommendation module will still provide the recommendations in a subtle text but the data entry user can over write the recommendations until the recommendation module is recommending the incorrect character. Thereafter the data entry user may use the special key provided in the keyboard or any other interface being used to type the hand written content to accept the remaining correctly recognized characters.

At step the handwritten document is scanned to generate a corresponding digital image. In an embodiment the scanning of the handwritten document is facilitated by the image processing module in conjunction with hardware such as scanners and digital cameras not shown . The digital image is then stored in the database by the image processing module . For example a new account opening form filled by a customer may be processed by a bank executive using the system .

In an embodiment the digital image is obtained by the system from various other computing devices such as computing device or the server and hence the step can be avoided.

At step the character is identified in each of the one or more text fields in the digital image. In an embodiment identification of the character is facilitated by applying the character recognition technique by the image processing module . The character type of the identified character includes at least one of a letter a symbol a number or a special character. In an embodiment the character recognition technique is implemented using various known ICR engines such as various suitable solutions provided by Pegasus Nuance and LeadTools . In another embodiment the character recognition technique is implemented using the ICR optimized image pre processing technique in combination with the various ICR engines such as various suitable solutions provided by Pegasus Nuance and LeadTools . In this case the ICR optimized image pre processing technique is first applied to pre process the electronic document so as to facilitate better extraction of the alphabetic and numeric characters from the one or more text fields. Then any suitable ICR engine is executed to determine the characters contained in each of the one or more text fields.

At step the character type of the identified character is compared with the predefined character type corresponding to the associated text field of the one or more text fields. In an embodiment the comparison of the character type of the identified character with the predefined character type corresponding to the associated text field is facilitated by the validation module .

At step the character type in each of the one or more text fields is validated based on the comparison. In an embodiment the validation module is configured to validate the character in each of the one or more text fields based on the comparison results of the character type of the identified character with the predefined character type corresponding to the associated text field of the digital image. In one embodiment the validated character in each of the one or more text fields is stored in the database . In an embodiment the validation module also generates the evaluation report based on the validation. As discussed earlier the evaluation report represents various errors made in the electronic document e.g. the new account opening form .

In an embodiment if all entries are correct e.g. the character type for each written character matches with the corresponding character type of the field the bank executive may accept the new account opening form. If there are errors in an embodiment the bank executive may explain the error as mentioned in the evaluation form to the customer and ask the customer to fill a new form with appropriate entries. In alternative embodiment the evaluation report can be printed and provided to the customer so that he can know the places where he need to provide appropriate inputs and can fill a new form.

The bank executive may again scan the new form to check if the entries are correct. In this case the steps will be repeated again.

Thereafter at the time of digitization at step the identified character in each of the one or more text fields is recommended to the data entry user e.g. an associated BPO employee a backend user a bank employee a data entry operator or the same bank executive who accepted the form . In one embodiment the recommendation module recommends the identified inputted characters in each of the one or more text fields while digitalization of the handwritten document. The recommendation is provided in a color other than the color of the actual entered character. The data entry user can either accept if the recommendations are correct or over write the recommendations if the recommendations are incorrect provided by the recommendation module .
