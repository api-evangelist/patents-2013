This application is a continuation in part of U.S. Ser. No. 13 691 349 filed Nov. 30 2012 entitled MESENCHYMAL STROMAL CELLS AND USES RELATED THERETO now pending which claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 565 358 filed Nov. 30 2011 entitled METHODS OF GENERATING MESENCHYMAL STROMAL CELLS USING HEMANGIOBLASTS each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to the use of cell based therapies to reduce the manifestations of a pathology such as that characterized by an inappropriate immune response in a subject and also to affect the origin of a pathology such that the abnormality defining the pathology is returned to a normal posture. In particular the present invention relates to mesenchymal stromal cells MSCs that retain a phenotype of youthful cells that imparts a high potency in the reduction of a manifestation of a pathology in a subject.

Many pathologies manifest clinically through unwanted or excessive immune responses within a host e.g. transplant rejection inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Immunosuppressive therapies have been developed to treat the symptoms but not the underlying cause of pathologies characterized by excessive immune responses. These therapies are effective at down modulating immune function and as such carry the potential for severe adverse events including cancer and opportunistic infection as well as side effects such as cataracts hyperglycemia bruising and nephrotoxicity from agents such as prednisone cyclosporine and tacrolimus.

Although therapies that do not suppress the entire immune system have been developed there are limitations associated with these regimens as well. These immunomodulatory treatments target a narrower point of intervention within the immune system and as such have different sometimes less severe side effects. Examples of such immunomodulatory therapies include the use of antibodies e.g. anti CD3 or anti IL2R. While successful at inducing a heightened state of non responsiveness the withdrawal of these immunomodulatory therapies results in a reversion to the unwanted pathology.

Mesenchymal stem cells MSC or MSCs are multipotent stem cells with self renewal capacity and the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts chondrocytes and adipocytes among other mesenchymal cell lineages. In recent years the intense research on the multilineage differentiation potential and immunomodulatory properties of human MSC has indicated that these cells can be used to treat a range of clinical conditions including immunological disorders as well as degenerative diseases. Consequently the number of clinical studies with MSC has been steadily increasing for a wide variety of conditions graft versus host disease GVHD myocardial infarction and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and disorders among others. Currently clinical programs utilizing MSCs rely on isolation of these cells from adult sources and cord blood. The high cell doses required for MSC clinical applications up to several million cells per kg of the patient demands a reliable reproducible and efficient expansion protocol capable of generating a large number of cells from those isolated from the donor source.

To reach the clinically meaningful cell numbers for cellular therapy and tissue engineering applications MSC ex vivo expansion is mandatory. Sequential ex vivo cell passaging of MSCs from cord blood fetal and adult sources such as bone marrow or adipose tissues can cause replicative stress chromosomal abnormalities or other stochastic cellular defects resulting in the progressive loss of the proliferative clonogenic and differentiation potential of the expanded MSCs which ultimately can jeopardize MSC clinical safety and efficacy. The issues with use of senescent MSCs in treatment should not be underestimated since cells lose part of their differentiation potential and their secretory profile is also altered. MSC senescence during culture was found to induce cell growth arrest concurrently with telomere shortening. A continuous decrease in adipogenic differentiation potential was reported for bone marrow BM MSC along increasing passages whereas the propensity for differentiation into the osteogenic lineage increased.

Accordingly some essential problems remain to be solved before the clinical application of MSC. MSCs derived from ESCs can be generated in sufficient quantities and in a highly controllable manner thus alleviating the problems with donor dependent sources. Since long term engraftment of MSCs is not required there is basically no concern for mismatch of major histocompatibility MHC 7 8 . In the art MSCs derived from ESCs have been obtained through various methods including co culture with murine OP9 cells or handpicking procedures 9 13 . These methods however are tedious and generate MSCs with a low yield varying quality and a lack of potency. Moreover maximizing the potency of the injected cells is desirable in terms of being able to provide a cellular product with a better therapeutic index ability to be used at a reduce dosage number of cells relative to CB derived BM derived or adipose derived MSCs and or the ability for the MSCs to provide a tractable therapy for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases for which CB derived BM derived or adipose derived MSCs are not efficacious enough.

The present invention relates to mesenchymal stromal cells MSCs and methods for generating MSCs. The methods of the present invention produce substantial numbers of high quality mesenchymal stromal cells characterized by the phenotype of youthful cells that imparts a high potency.

For example the subject MSC preparation has a proteasome 26S subunit non ATPase regulatory subunit 11 PSMD11 protein content that is less than 75 percent of the content in MSCs from donated human tissue particularly derived from adult bone marrow or adult adipose tissue and even more preferably less than 60 50 40 30 20 or even 10 percent.

In certain embodiments the MSC preparation of the present invention such as cultures having at least 10 10 10 10 10or even 10MSCs have a statistically significant decreased content and or enzymatic activity of proteins involved in energy and or lipid metabolism of the cell relative to passage 1 P1 passage 2 P2 passage 3 P3 passage 4 P4 and or passage 5 P5 MSC preparations derived from other sources e.g. cultures derived from donated human tissue such as fetal infant child adolescent or adult tissue and particularly bone marrow derived MSCs and adipose derived MSCs. To illustrate the subject MSC preparation has a protein content that is less than 90 percent of the content in MSCs from donated human tissue particularly derived from adult bone marrow or adult adipose tissue and even more preferably less than 60 50 40 30 20 or even 10 percent for one or more proteins involved in metabolic pathways for ATP or NADPH synthesis such as glycolysis such as fructose biphosphate aldolase A ALDOA aldo keto reductase family 1 member A1 AKR1A1 glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate GAPDH the tricarboxylic acid cycle TCA cycle such as isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 IDH1 the pentose phosphate pathway such as glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase G6PD and the biosynthesis of UDP glucose in the glucuronic acid biosynthetic pathway such as UDP glucose 6 dehydrogenase UGDH . To further illustrate the subject MSC preparation has a protein content that is less than 90 percent of the content in MSCs from donated human tissue particularly derived from adult bone marrow or adult adipose tissue and even more preferably less than 60 50 40 30 20 or even 10 percent for one or more proteins involved in lipid metabolism such as enoyl CoA hydratase short chain 1 ECHS1 and or acetyl CoA acetyltransferase ACAT2 .

In certain embodiments the MSC preparation of the present invention such as cultures having at least 10 10 10 10 10or even 10MSCs have a statistically significant decreased content and or enzymatic activity of proteins involved in apoptosis of the cell relative to passage 1 P1 passage 2 P2 passage 3 P3 passage 4 P4 and or passage 5 P5 MSC preparations derived from other sources e.g. cultures derived from donated human tissue such as fetal infant child adolescent or adult tissue and particularly bone marrow derived MSCs and adipose derived MSCs. To illustrate the subject MSC preparation has a protein content that is less than 90 percent of the content in MSCs from donated human tissue particularly derived from adult bone marrow or adult adipose tissue and even more preferably less than 60 50 40 30 20 or even 10 percent for one or more proteins annexin A1 ANXA1 A2 ANXA2 A5 ANXA5 the voltage dependent anion selective channel protein 1 VDAC1 and or glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH .

Without being bound by theory it is believed that the statistically significant difference in content and or enzymatic activity of proteins involved in energy and or lipid metabolism and or apotosis of the cell displayed by the hemangioblast derived MSCs of the present invention is attributable at least in part to the homogeneous nature of the preparations. For example hemangioblast derived MSCs of the present invention have homogeneous MHC gene expression i.e. completely MHC matched unlike adult derived MSC banks in which the cells are derived from multiple different donors i.e. MHC mismatched. A therapeutic dose of MSCs is about 2 8 million cells kg or about 130 500 million cells per dose .

 Pluripotent cells and pluripotent stem cells as used herein refers broadly to a cell capable of prolonged or virtually indefinite proliferation in vitro while retaining their undifferentiated state exhibiting a stable preferably normal karyotype and having the capacity to differentiate into all three germ layers i.e. ectoderm mesoderm and endoderm under the appropriate conditions. Typically pluripotent cells a are capable of inducing teratomas when transplanted in immunodeficient SCID mice b are capable of differentiating to cell types of all three germ layers e.g. ectodermal mesodermal and endodermal cell types and c express at least one hES cell marker such as Oct 4 alkaline phosphatase SSEA 3 surface antigen SSEA 4 surface antigen NANOG TRA 1 60 TRA 1 81 SOX2 REX1 .

Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2009 Mar. 24 106 12 4822 7 etc.

 Embryo or embryonic as used herein refers broadly to a developing cell mass that has not implanted into the uterine membrane of a maternal host. An embryonic cell is a cell isolated from or contained in an embryo. This also includes blastomeres obtained as early as the two cell stage and aggregated blastomeres.

 Embryonic stem cells ES cells or ESC encompasses pluripotent cells produced from embryonic cells such as from cultured inner cell mass cells or cultured blastomeres as well as induced pluripotent cells further described below . Frequently such cells are or have been serially passaged as cell lines. Embryonic stem cells may be used as a pluripotent stem cell in the processes of producing hemangioblasts as described herein. For example ES cells may be produced by methods known in the art including derivation from an embryo produced by any method including by sexual or asexual means such as fertilization of an egg cell with sperm or sperm DNA nuclear transfer including somatic cell nuclear transfer or parthenogenesis. As a further example embryonic stem cells also include cells produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer even when non embryonic cells are used in the process. For example ES cells may be derived from the ICM of blastocyst stage embryos as well as embryonic stem cells derived from one or more blastomeres. Such embryonic stem cells can be generated from embryonic material produced by fertilization or by asexual means including somatic cell nuclear transfer SCNT parthenogenesis and androgenesis. As further discussed above see pluripotent cells ES cells may be genetically modified or otherwise modified to increase longevity potency homing or to deliver a desired factor in cells that are differentiated from such pluripotent cells for example MSCs and hemangioblasts .

ES cells may be generated with homozygosity or hemizygosity in one or more HLA genes e.g. through genetic manipulation screening for spontaneous loss of heterozygosity etc. ES cells may be genetically modified or otherwise modified to increase longevity potency homing or to deliver a desired factor in cells that are differentiated from such pluripotent cells for example MSCs and hemangioblasts . Embryonic stem cells regardless of their source or the particular method used to produce them typically possess one or more of the following attributes i the ability to differentiate into cells of all three germ layers ii expression of at least Oct 4 and alkaline phosphatase and iii the ability to produce teratomas when transplanted into immunocompromised animals. Embryonic stem cells that may be used in embodiments of the present invention include but are not limited to human ES cells hESC or hES cells such as CT2 MA01 MA09 ACT 4 No. 3 H1 H7 H9 H14 and ACT30 embryonic stem cells. Additional exemplary cell lines include NED1 NED2 NED3 NED4 NED5 and NED7. See also NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry. An exemplary human embryonic stem cell line that may be used is MA09 cells. The isolation and preparation of MA09 cells was previously described in Klimanskaya et al. 2006 Human Embryonic Stem Cell lines Derived from Single Blastomeres. Nature 444 481 485. The human ES cells used in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be derived and maintained in accordance with GMP standards.

Exemplary hES cell markers include but are not limited to alkaline phosphatase Oct 4 Nanog Stage specific embryonic antigen 3 SSEA 3 Stage specific embryonic antigen 4 SSEA 4 TRA 1 60 TRA 1 81 TRA 2 49 6E Sox2 growth and differentiation factor 3 GDF3 reduced expression 1 REX1 fibroblast growth factor 4 FGF4 embryonic cell specific gene 1 ESG1 developmental pluripotency associated 2 DPPA2 DPPA4 telomerase reverse transcriptase hTERT SALL4 E CADHERIN Cluster designation 30 CD30 Cripto TDGF 1 GCTM 2 Genesis Germ cell nuclear factor and Stem cell factor SCF or c Kit ligand . Additionally embryonic stem cells may express Oct 4 alkaline phosphatase SSEA 3 surface antigen SSEA 4 surface antigen TRA 1 60 and or TRA 1 81.

The ESCs may be initially co cultivated with murine embryonic feeder cells MEF cells. The MEF cells may be mitotically inactivated by exposure to mitomycin C prior to seeding ESCs in co culture and thus the MEFs do not propagate in culture. Additionally ESC cell cultures may be examined microscopically and colonies containing non ESC cell morphology may be picked and discarded e.g. using a stem cell cutting tool by laser ablation or other means. Typically after the point of harvest of the ESCs for seeding for embryoid body formation no additional MEF cells are used.

 Embryo derived cells EDC as used herein refers broadly to pluripotent morula derived cells blastocyst derived cells including those of the inner cell mass embryonic shield or epiblast or other pluripotent stem cells of the early embryo including primitive endoderm ectoderm and mesoderm and their derivatives. EDC also including blastomeres and cell masses from aggregated single blastomeres or embryos from varying stages of development but excludes human embryonic stem cells that have been passaged as cell lines.

Exemplary ESC cell markers include but are not limited to alkaline phosphatase Oct 4 Nanog Stage specific embryonic antigen 3 SSEA 3 Stage specific embryonic antigen 4 SSEA 4 TRA 1 60 TRA 1 81 TRA 2 49 6E Sox2 growth and differentiation factor 3 GDF3 reduced expression 1 REX1 fibroblast growth factor 4 FGF4 embryonic cell specific gene 1 ESG1 developmental pluripotency associated 2 DPPA2 DPPA4 telomerase reverse transcriptase hTERT SALL4 E CADHERIN Cluster designation 30 CD30 Cripto TDGF 1 GCTM 2 Genesis Germ cell nuclear factor and Stem cell factor SCF or c Kit ligand .

 Potency as used herein refers broadly to the concentration e.g. molar of a reagent such as hemangioblast derived MSCs that produces a defined effect. Potency may be defined in terms of effective concentration EC50 which does not involve measurements of maximal effect but instead the effect at various locations along the concentration axis of dose response curves. Potency may also be determined from either graded EC50 or quantal dose response curves ED50 TD50 and LD50 however potency is preferably measured by EC50. The term EC50 refers to the concentration of a drug antibody or toxicant which induces a response halfway between the baseline and maximum effect after some specified exposure time. The EC50 of a graded dose response curve therefore represents the concentration of a compound where 50 of its maximal effect is observed. The EC50 of a quantal dose response curve represents the concentration of a compound where 50 of the population exhibit a response after a specified exposure duration. The EC50 may be determined using animal studies in which a defined animal model demonstrates a measurable physiological change in response to application of the drug cell based assays that use a specified cell system which on addition of the drug demonstrate a measureable biological response and or enzymatic reactions where the biological activity of the drug can be measured by the accumulation of product following the chemical reaction facilitated by the drug. Preferably an immune regulatory assay is used to determine EC50. Non limiting examples of such immune regulatory assays include intracellular cytokine cytotoxicity regulatory capacity cell signaling capacity proliferative capacity apoptotic evaluations and other assays.

 Mesenchymal stem cells MSC as used herein refers to multipotent stem cells with self renewal capacity and the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts chondrocytes and adipocytes among other mesenchymal cell lineages. In addition to these characteristics MSCs may be identified by the expression of one or more markers as further described herein. Such cells may be used to treat a range of clinical conditions including immunological disorders as well as degenerative diseases such as graft versus host disease GVHD myocardial infarction and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and disorders among others. Except where the context indicates otherwise MSCs may include cells from adult sources and cord blood. MSCs or a cell from which they are generated such as a pluripotent cell may be genetically modified or otherwise modified to increase longevity potency homing or to deliver a desired factor in the MSCs or cells that are differentiated from such MSCs. As non limiting examples thereof the MSCs cells may be genetically modified to express Sirt1 thereby increasing longevity express one or more telomerase subunit genes optionally under the control of an inducible or repressible promoter incorporate a fluorescent label incorporate iron oxide particles or other such reagent which could be used for cell tracking via in vivo imaging MRI etc. see Thu et al. Nat Med. 2012 Feb. 26 18 3 463 7 express bFGF which may improve longevity see Go et al. J. Biochem. 142 741 748 2007 express CXCR4 for homing see Shi et al. Haematologica. 2007 July 92 7 897 904 express recombinant TRAIL to induce caspase mediatedx apoptosis in cancer cells like Gliomas see Sasportas et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2009 Mar. 24 106 12 4822 7 etc.

 Therapy therapeutic treating treat or treatment as used herein refers broadly to treating a disease arresting or reducing the development of the disease or its clinical symptoms and or relieving the disease causing regression of the disease or its clinical symptoms. Therapy therapeutic treating treat or treatment encompasses prophylaxis prevention treatment cure remedy reduction alleviation and or providing relief from a disease signs and or symptoms of a disease. Therapy therapeutic treating treat or treatment encompasses an alleviation of signs and or symptoms in patients with ongoing disease signs and or symptoms e.g. muscle weakness multiple sclerosis. Therapy therapeutic treating treat or treatment also encompasses prophylaxis and prevention . Prophylaxis includes preventing disease occurring subsequent to treatment of a disease in a patient or reducing the incidence or severity of the disease in a patient. The term reduced for purpose of therapy therapeutic treating treat or treatment refers broadly to the clinical significant reduction in signs and or symptoms. Therapy therapeutic treating treat or treatment includes treating relapses or recurrent signs and or symptoms e.g. retinal degeneration loss of vision. Therapy therapeutic treating treat or treatment encompasses but is not limited to precluding the appearance of signs and or symptoms anytime as well as reducing existing signs and or symptoms and eliminating existing signs and or symptoms. Therapy therapeutic treating treat or treatment includes treating chronic disease maintenance and acute disease. For example treatment includes treating or preventing relapses or the recurrence of signs and or symptoms e.g. muscle weakness multiple sclerosis .

 Normalizing a pathology as used herein refers to reverting the abnormal structure and or function resulting from a disease to a more normal state. Normalization suggests that by correcting the abnormalities in structure and or function of a tissue organ cell type etc. resulting from a disease the progression of the pathology can be controlled and improved. For example following treatment with the ESC MSCs of the present invention the abnormalities of the immune system as a result of autoimmune disorders e.g. MS may be improved corrected and or reversed.

Further exemplary pluripotent stem cells include induced pluripotent stem cells iPS cells generated by reprogramming a somatic cell by expressing or inducing expression of a combination of factors reprogramming factors . iPS cells may be generated using fetal postnatal newborn juvenile or adult somatic cells. iPS cells may be obtained from a cell bank. Alternatively iPS cells may be newly generated by processes known in the art prior to commencing differentiation to RPE cells or another cell type. The making of iPS cells may be an initial step in the production of differentiated cells. iPS cells may be specifically generated using material from a particular patient or matched donor with the goal of generating tissue matched RPE cells. iPS cells can be produced from cells that are not substantially immunogenic in an intended recipient e.g. produced from autologous cells or from cells histocompatible to an intended recipient. As further discussed above see pluripotent cells pluripotent cells including iPS cells may be genetically modified or otherwise modified to increase longevity potency homing or to deliver a desired factor in cells that are differentiated from such pluripotent cells for example MSCs and hemangioblasts .

As a further example induced pluripotent stem cells may be generated by reprogramming a somatic or other cell by contacting the cell with one or more reprogramming factors. For example the reprogramming factor s may be expressed by the cell e.g. from an exogenous nucleic acid added to the cell or from an endogenous gene in response to a factor such as a small molecule microRNA or the like that promotes or induces expression of that gene see Suh and Blelloch Development 138 1653 1661 2011 Miyosh et al. Cell Stem Cell 2011 doi 10.1016 j.stem.2011.05.001 Sancho Martinez et al. Journal of Molecular Cell Biology 2011 1 3 Anokye Danso et al. Cell Stem Cell 8 376 388 Apr. 8 2011 Orkin and Hochedlinger Cell 145 835 850 Jun. 10 2011 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . Reprogramming factors may be provided from an exogenous source e.g. by being added to the culture media and may be introduced into cells by methods known in the art such as through coupling to cell entry peptides protein or nucleic acid transfection agents lipofection electroporation biolistic particle delivery system gene gun microinjection and the like. iPS cells can be generated using fetal postnatal newborn juvenile or adult somatic cells. In certain embodiments factors that can be used to reprogram somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells include for example a combination of Oct4 sometimes referred to as Oct 3 4 Sox2 c Myc and Klf4. In other embodiments factors that can be used to reprogram somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells include for example a combination of Oct 4 Sox2 Nanog and Lin28. In other embodiments somatic cells are reprogrammed by expressing at least 2 reprogramming factors at least three reprogramming factors or four reprogramming factors. In other embodiments additional reprogramming factors are identified and used alone or in combination with one or more known reprogramming factors to reprogram a somatic cell to a pluripotent stem cell. iPS cells typically can be identified by expression of the same markers as embryonic stem cells though a particular iPS cell line may vary in its expression profile.

The induced pluripotent stem cell may be produced by expressing or inducing the expression of one or more reprogramming factors in a somatic cell. The somatic cell is a fibroblast such as a dermal fibroblast synovial fibroblast or lung fibroblast or a non fibroblastic somatic cell. The somatic cell is reprogrammed by expressing at least 1 2 3 4 5 reprogramming factors. The reprogramming factors may be selected from Oct 3 4 Sox2 NANOG Lin28 c Myc and Klf4. Expression of the reprogramming factors may be induced by contacting the somatic cells with at least one agent such as a small organic molecule agents that induce expression of reprogramming factors.

The somatic cell may also be reprogrammed using a combinatorial approach wherein the reprogramming factor is expressed e.g. using a viral vector plasmid and the like and the expression of the reprogramming factor is induced e.g. using a small organic molecule. For example reprogramming factors may be expressed in the somatic cell by infection using a viral vector such as a retroviral vector or a lentiviral vector. Also reprogramming factors may be expressed in the somatic cell using a non integrative vector such as an episomal plasmid. See e.g. Yu et al. Science. 2009 May 8 324 5928 797 801 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. When reprogramming factors are expressed using non integrative vectors the factors may be expressed in the cells using electroporation transfection or transformation of the somatic cells with the vectors. For example in mouse cells expression of four factors Oct3 4 Sox2 c myc and Klf4 using integrative viral vectors can be used to reprogram a somatic cell. In human cells expression of four factors Oct3 4 Sox2 NANOG and Lin28 using integrative viral vectors can be used to reprogram a somatic cell.

Once the reprogramming factors are expressed in the cells the cells may be cultured. Over time cells with ES characteristics appear in the culture dish. The cells may be chosen and subcultured based on for example ES morphology or based on expression of a selectable or detectable marker. The cells may be cultured to produce a culture of cells that resemble ES cells these are putative iPS cells. iPS cells typically can be identified by expression of the same markers as other embryonic stem cells though a particular iPS cell line may vary in its expression profile. Exemplary iPS cells may express Oct 4 alkaline phosphatase SSEA 3 surface antigen SSEA 4 surface antigen TRA 1 60 and or TRA 1 81.

To confirm the pluripotency of the iPS cells the cells may be tested in one or more assays of pluripotency. For example the cells may be tested for expression of ES cell markers the cells may be evaluated for ability to produce teratomas when transplanted into SCID mice the cells may be evaluated for ability to differentiate to produce cell types of all three germ layers. Once a pluripotent iPS cell is obtained it may be used to produce hemangioblast and MSC cells.

Hemangioblasts are multipotent and serve as the common precursor to both hematopoietic and endothelial cell lineages. During embryonic development they are believed to arise as a transitional cell type that emerges during early mesoderm development and colonizes primitive blood islands Choi et al. Development 125 4 725 732 1998 . Once there hemangioblasts are capable of giving rise to both primitive and definitive hematopoietic cells HSCs and endothelial cells Mikkola et al J. Hematother. Stem Cell Res 11 1 9 17 2002 .

Hemangioblasts may be derived in vitro from both mouse ESCs Kennedy et al Nature 386 488 493 1997 Perlingeiro et al Stem Cells 21 272 280 2003 and human ESCs ref. 14 15 Yu et al. Blood 2010 116 4786 4794 . Other studies claim to have isolated hemangioblasts from umbilical cord blood Bordoni et al Hepatology 45 5 1218 1228 circulating CD34 lin CD45 CD133 cells from peripheral blood Ciraci et al Blood 118 2105 2115 and from mouse uterus Sun et al Blood 116 16 2932 2941 2010 . Both mouse and human ESC derived hemangioblasts have been obtained through the culture and differentiation of clusters of cells grown in liquid culture followed by growth of the cells in semi solid medium containing various cytokines and growth factors Kennedy Perlingeiro ref 14 15 see also U.S. Pat. No. 8 017 393 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. For the purposes of this application the term hemangioblasts also includes the hemangio colony forming cells described in U.S. Pat. No. 8 017 393 which in addition to being capable of differentiating into hematopoietic and endothelial cell lineages are capable of becoming smooth muscle cells and which are not positive for CD34 CD31 KDR and CD133. Hemangioblasts useful in the methods described herein may be derived or obtained from any of these known methods. For example embryoid bodies may be formed by culturing pluripotent cells under non attached conditions e.g. on a low adherent substrate or in a hanging drop. In these cultures ES cells can form clumps or clusters of cells denominated as embryoid bodies. See Itskovitz Eldor et al. Mol Med. 2000 February 6 2 88 95 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Typically embryoid bodies initially form as solid clumps or clusters of pluripotent cells and over time some of the embryoid bodies come to include fluid filled cavities the latter former being referred to in the literature as simple EBs and the latter as cystic embryoid bodies. Id. The cells in these EBs both solid and cystic forms can differentiate and over time produce increasing numbers of cells. Optionally EBs may then be cultured as adherent cultures and allowed to form outgrowths. Likewise pluripotent cells that are allowed to overgrow and form a multilayer cell population can differentiate over time.

Additionally the kits may comprise cryopreserved MSCs or preparations of cryopreserved MSCs frozen MSCs or preparations of frozen MSCs thawed frozen MSCs or preparations of thawed frozen MSCs.

It will be understood that the embodiments and concepts described herein may be used in combination. For example the instant invention provides for a method of generating MSCs comprising generating hemangioblasts from ESCs culturing the hemangioblasts for at least four days harvesting the hemangioblasts re plating the hemangioblasts on a Matrigel coated plate and culturing the hemangioblasts as described herein for at least fourteen days wherein the method generates at least 85 million MSCs that are substantially free of ESCs.

Hemangioblasts were generated from the clinical grade single blastomere derived ESC line MA09 16 as follows 

First early stage clusters of cells were generated from MA09 ESC cultured in serum free medium supplemented with a combination of morphogens and early hematopoietic cytokines specifically bone morphogenetic protein 4 BMP 4 vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF basic fibroblast growth factor bFGF stem cell factor SCF thrombopoietin Tpo and fms related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand FL . More specifically ESCs from one well of a 6 well tissue culture treated plate were plated in one well of a six well ultra low adherence place Corning in 3 ml Stemline II medium Sigma supplemented with 50 ng ml of VEGF and 50 ng ml of BMP 4 R D and incubated at 37 C. with 5 CO2. Clusters of cells were formed within the first 24 hr. After 40 48 hours half of the medium 1.5 ml was replaced with fresh Stemline II medium supplemented with 50 ng ml of VEGF 50 ng ml of BMP 4 and 20 22.5 ng ml bFGF and incubation continued for an additional 40 48 hours i.e. 3.5 4 days total .

Clusters of cells were dissociated and plated as single cells in serum free semisolid blast colony growth medium BGM . Specifically clusters of cells were dissociated by 0.05 trypsin 0.53 mM EDTA Invitrogen for 2 5 min. The cell suspension was pipetted up and down and then DMEM 10 FCS was added to inactivate the trypsin. Cells were then passed through a 40 m strainer to obtain a single cell suspension. Cells were then counted and resuspended in Stemline II medium at 1 1.5 10cells ml.

The single cell suspension 0.3 ml 3 to 4.5 10cells was mixed with 2.7 ml of hemangioblast HB Growth Medium H4536 based medium recipe base medium methycellulose product H4536 StemCell Technologies plus penicillin streptomycin pen strp Excyte growth supplement Millipore and the cytokines Flt3 ligand FL at 50 ng ml vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF at 50 ng ml thrombopoietin TPO at 50 ng ml and basic fibroblast growth factor bFGF at 20 ng ml with a brief vortex and let stand for 5 min. The cell mixture was then transferred to one well of a six well ultra low adherence plate by using a syringe 3 ml attached with an 18G needle and incubated at 37 C. with 5 CO2.

Some of the cells developed into grape like blast colonies BCs . Specifically BCs were visible at 3 days typically contained less than 10 cells at the beginning of day 3 and after 4 6 days grape like hES BCs were easily identified under microscopy containing greater than 100 cells per BC . The number of BCs present in the culture gradually increased over the course of several days. After 6 7 days BCs could be picked up using a mouth glass capillary.

Hemangioblasts can be harvested between days 7 12 of culture and replated onto Matrigel coated tissue culture plates in MEM 20 FCS. Flow cytometry analysis shows that expression levels of 5 cell surface markers typically found on MSCs are relatively low in the starting hemangioblast population. left panel average of 4 experiments standard deviation . However after three weeks of culture in MSC growth conditions a homogenous adherent cell population arises that stains 90 positive for these 5 characteristic MSC markers right panel 22 23 days average of 4 experiments standard deviation . Upon MSC culture conditions the amount of time it takes for differentiating cells to acquire MSC surface markers may vary depending on the specific ESC line used the day of hemangioblast harvest and the number of hemangioblasts plated onto Matrigel. In some experiments markers arise in 90 of the cells by 7 14 days whereas in other experiments it may take 22 24 days for this many cells to acquire these MSC markers.

Relating to the above experiments shows the generation of FM MA09 MSC from pluripotent cells and a microscopic view of generating mesenchymal stromal cells from ESCs via hemangioblasts. In addition contains a phenotype of FM MA09 MSC obtained from pluripotent cell derived hemangioblasts produced as above described. This figure shows the percentage of cells positive for MSC surface markers in the initial hemangioblast population left side of graph day 7 11 hemangioblast and after culturing hemangioblasts on Matrigel coated plates right side of graph and a microscopic view of the mesenchymal stromal cells derived from the hemangioblasts right panel photograph . Also relating to the above experiments depicts the process of FM MA09 MSC generation and the effects of Matrigel i.e. that removing cells from Matrigel at an early passage ie p2 may temporarily slow MSC growth as compared to those maintained on Matrigel until p6.

This example describes comparison of the differentiation of ESCs into MSCs by two methods either direct differentiation in which ESCs were directly plated on gelatin or Matrigel or the hemangioblast method in which ESCs were first differentiated into hemangioblasts and then plated on Matrigel as described in Example 1 . Direct differentiation on gelatin gave rise to MSC like cells but the cells lacked CD105 expression suggesting incomplete adoption of MSC fate left panel . When ESCs were plated directly on Matrigel the resulting cells did express CD105 as expected for MSCs middle panel . However compared to MSCs produced by the hemangioblast method the directly differentiated MSCs cells grew in clumps were more difficult to disperse when splitting and did not generate nearly as many MSCs when starting from equivalent numbers of ESCs .

MSCs differentiated directly from ESCs also took longer to acquire characteristic MSC cell surface markers . Once MSCs were obtained extended immunophenotyping shows that MSCs from both methods are positive for other markers typically found on MSCs such as HLA ABC while negative for hematopoiesis associated markers such as CD34 and CD45 . These results suggest that use of a hemangioblast intermediate stage permits robust production of homogeneous MSCs from ESCs. Given these findings additional studies on MSCs will be conducted with hemangioblast derived MSCs.

In addition experiments the results of which are contained in and described supra compare different properties of ESC MSCs or BM MSCs versus hemangioblast derived MSC s and reveal that these cells exhibit significant differences which may impact therapeutic efficacy of these cells and compositions derived therefrom. Particularly shows the percentage of cells positive for MSC surface markers after culturing human embryonic stem cells ESC on gelatin coated plates left panel ESC on Matrigel coated plates middle panel and hemangioblasts on Matrigel coated plates right panel . Additionally shows the MSC yield from pluripotent cells illustrates the acquisition of mesenchymal stromal cell markers and shows phenotypes of mesenchymal stromal cells derived from different culture methods including expression of MSC markers and lack of expression of hematopoiesis and endothelial markers. Further FM MA09 MSCs were assayed to detect notable differences relative to BM MSCs in potency and inhibitory effects stimulation of Treg expansion proliferative capacity PGE2 secretion Stro 1 and CD10 expression maintenance of size during passaging CD10 and CD24 expression Aire 1 and IL 11 expression Ang 1 and CXCL1 expression and IL6 and VEGF expression .

MSCs by definition should be able to give rise to adipocytes osteocytes and chondrocytes. Using standard methods shows the ability of hemangioblast derived MSCs to differentiate into adipocytes and osteocytes while shows their potential to differentiate towards chondrocytes via the expression of chondrocyte specific genes and shows their potential to differentiate towards chondrocytes via safranin O staining of pellet mass cultures.

MSCs derived from hemangioblasts are expected to differentiate into adipocytes osteocytes and chondrocytes. These differentiation pathways may be examined using methods previously reported in the art. See Karlsson et al Stem Cell Research 3 39 50 2009 for differentiation of the hemangioblast derived and direct ESC derived MSCs into adipocytes and osteocytes . Particularly FM MA09 MSC display differentiation capabilities including the ability to differentiate into adipocytes and osteocytes . For chondrocyte differentiation methods have been adapted from Gong et al J. Cell. Physiol. 224 664 671 2010 to study this process and continue to examine the acquisition of chondrocyte specific genes e.g. Aggrecan and Collagen IIa as well as glycosaminoglycan deposition through safranin O alcian blue and or toluene blue staining Particularly chondrogenic differentiation of MA09 ESC hemangioblast derived mesenchymal stromal cells FM MA09 MSC was detected by mRNA expression of Aggrecan chondroitin proteoglycan sulfate 1 and Collagen IIa . It has been reported in the literature that none of these three cell types adipocytes osteocytes or chondrocytes derived from MSCs will express the immunostimulatory HLA DR molecule Le Blanc 2003 Gotherstrom 2004 Liu 2006 . Immunostaining and or flow cytometry will be performed on these fully differentiated MSC cell types to confirm these reported observations. This is important to confirm so that differentiation of MSCs in an in vivo environment will not induce an immune response from the host recipient. Of these three cell types chondrogenic differentiation may be of particular interest due to its potential to be used in cartilage replacement therapies for sports injuries aging joint pain osteoarthritis etc. For such therapies MSCs may not need to be fully differentiated into chondrocytes in order to be used therapeutically.

MSCs should also be devoid of the ESC propensity to form teratomas. MSCs were confirmed to contain normal karyotypes data not shown by passage 12 50 days in culture . To confirm that the blast derived MSCs do not contain trace amounts of ESCs teratoma formation assays were performed in NOD SCID mice. 5 10MSCs are injected subcutaneously into the left thigh muscle of 3 mice. CT2 ECs were used as positive controls and the mice will be monitored over the course of 6 weeks to compare teratoma formation in MSC versus ESCC injected mice. No teratomas formed in the mice injected with MSCs.

A pilot study to treat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE on 6 8 weeks old C57BL 6 mice with the hemangioblast derived ESC MSCs was conducted. EAE was induced by s.c. injection into the flanks of the mice on day 0 with 100 pL of an emulsion of 50 pg of myelin oligodentricyte glycoprotein MOG 35 55 peptide and 250 pg of in adjuvant oil complete Freund s adjuvant CFA the mice were also i.p. injected with 500 ng of pertussis toxin. Six days later the mice were i.p. injected with either one million ESC MSCs in PBS n 3 or the vehicle as a control n 4 . The clinical scores of the animals were recorded for 29 days post the immunization. A remarkable reduction of the disease scores was observed data not shown .

To confirm the results obtained in Example 5 additional tests are conducted with increased animal numbers varying cell doses different administration protocols and more controls. Clinical score and mortality rate are recorded. The degree of lymphocyte infiltration in the brain and spinal cord of mice will also be assessed. MSC anti EAE effects are generally thought to involve immunosuppressive activities such as the suppression of Th17 cells and would be expected to reduce the degree of lymphocyte infiltration in the CNS.

B. Compare ESC MSCs with Mouse Bone Marrow BM MSCs Human BM MSCs and Human Umbilical Cord Derived UCB MSCs.

Mouse BM MSCs were the first to be used for EAE treatment and have been thoroughly studied 1 . ESC MSCs given their xenogenic nature may be directly compared with murine BM MSCs for anti EAE efficacy. Human UCB MSCs have been shown to also possess immunosuppressive activity 19 . The anti EAE activity of human UCB MSCs and human BM MSCs may also be compared with that of ESC MSCs in the EAE mouse models. The age or passage number of these various cell types may influence their anti EAE behavior thus we will also evaluate the consequences of age on the efficacy of MSCs in the EAE mouse model system.

Injection of the ESC MSCs can reduce the scores of EAE as recorded within 29 days after immunization. To study long term prevention and cure of disease ESC MSCs may be administered at various doses routes and times.

MSCs have been generated from H1gfp ESCs and confirmed that they still express GFP in the MSC state. EAE mice can be injected with these GFP ESC MSCs and their distribution can be tracked in vivo by using a Xenogen In Vivo Imaging System. Through these approaches various administration doses routes and timing of ESC MSCs will be analyzed and provide information as to the mechanism of action for MSCs anti EAE activity ie paracrine or endocrine effects longevity of the MSCs within the mice and MSC biodistribution and routes of elimination clearance.

Anti EAE effects may be reflected by one or more of reduced clinical scores increased survival and or attenuated lymphocyte infiltration and demyelination of the CNS. Different ESC lines may have different intrinsic abilities to generate MSCs. Therefore multiple ESC lines may be used in this study and acquisition of MSC markers can be monitored over time and compared for each ESC line. To further reduce variations between experiments with ESC MSCs large stocks of frozen ESC MSCs can be made in aliquots and each stock of aliquots can be used in multiple experiments.

As mentioned above MSCs may also have therapeutic activity against other types of autoimmune disorders such as Crohn s disease ulcerative colitis and the eye disorder uveitis. Animal models for these diseases exist and are well known in the art see e.g. Pizarro et al 2003 Duijvestein et al 2011 Liang et al 2011 Copland. et al 2008 . In vivo studies may be expanded to include an assessment of MSC therapeutic utility in one or more of these animal model systems. Such models may allow us to examine the cytokine secretion profile of human MSCs by isolating and screening the serum of injected animals for human cytokines Particularly the uveitis model may be useful as a local intravitreal injection may allow us to study the effects of MSCs in a non systemic environment.

MSCs may also have great therapeutic utility in treating osteoarthritis conditions including those that involve loss of articular cartilage and inflammation of the affected joints Noth et al 2008 . Models for examining osteoarthritis cartilage loss and joint inflammation are well known in the art see e.g. Mobasheri et al 2009 . In some of these studies human BM MSCs are encapsulated in semi solid scaffolds or microspheres and transplanted into an affected joint in human subjects to determine if the MSCs have a local non systemic therapeutic effect in terms of reduced inflammation and or restoration of cartilage Wakitani et al 2002 . Such methods will assist in determining the therapeutic utility of our ESC hemangioblast derived MSCs for treating degenerative joint conditions.

The life span of injected MSCs is very short 8 which indicates that long term survival of the transplanted cells is not required. Thus mitotically inactivated ESC MSCs e.g. irradiated or treated with mitomycin C may also be tested for an anti EAE effect or other anti disease effect in the animal models mentioned above. If so live ESC MSCs may not be needed thus further decreasing the biosafety concern from potential residual ESC contamination in the transplanted ESC MSCs.

MSCs from different donor derive sources mouse BM MSCs human BM MSCs and human UCB MSCs are expected to harbor anti EAE effects. However their effects may vary between experiments as the MSCs are from donor limited sources. In contrast the ESC MSCs of the present disclosure may have more consistent effects. Because many cell surface markers are used to characterize MSCs and not every MSC expresses all the markers a subset of markers e.g. CD73 and CD45 may be used in order to compare efficacy of MSCs from different sources.

ESC MSCs are expected to have therapeutic utility in animal models of Crohn s Disease ulcerative colitis and uveitis as these contain autoimmune components and inflammatory reactions.

Mitotically inactivated MSCs e.g. irradiated or mitomycin C inactivated MSCs and or ESC MSCs may retain at least partially the immunosuppressive function since they still secret cytokines and express cell surface markers that are related to the function 29 . Their effect may however be decreased due to their shortened life span in vivo. If so the dose of irradiated or other mitotically inactived cells and administration frequency may be increased to enhance the immunosuppressive function.

A second pilot study to treat EAE was conducted. Eight to ten week old C57BL 6 mice were immunized with the MOG35 55 peptide in complete Freund s adjuvant via subQ injection. Thus was done in conjunction with Intraperitoneal injection of pertussis toxin. Six days later 1 million live or 2 million irradiated hemangioblast derived pluripotent cell mesenchymal stromal cells were injected intraperitoneally per mouse. Disease severity was scored on a scale of 0 5 by monitoring mouse limb body motion as previously published. Results demonstrated a significant reduction in clinical score as compared to vehicle control with hemangioblast derived pluripotent cell mesenchymal stromal cells at passage 4 and irradiated hemangioblast derived pluripotent cell mesenchymal stromal cells data not shown . Scoring for both pilot studies was performed according to the following protocol a score of 1 indicates limp tail 2 indicates partial hind leg paralysis 3 is complete hind leg paralysis 4 is complete hind and partial front leg paralysis 5 is moribund.

In addition the efficacy of MSC s according to the invention and products derivable therefrom for use in different therapies may be confirmed in other animal models e.g. other transplantation or autoimmune models depending on the contemplated therapeutic indication.

MSCs may be defined as plastic adherent cells that express the following cell surface markers CD105 CD73 CD29 CD90 CD166 CD44 CD13 and HLA class I ABC while at the same time being negative for CD34 CD45 CD14 CD19 CD11b CD79a and CD31 when cultured in an uninduced state e.g. culture in regular MEM 20 FCS with no cytokines . Under these conditions they must express intracellular HLA G and be negative for CD40 and HLA class II DR . Functionally such cells must also be able to differentiate into adipocytes osteocytes and chondrocytes as assessed by standard in vitro culture assays. After 7 days stimulation with interferon gamma IFN MSCs should express HLA G on their cell surface as well as CD40 and HLA class II DR on their cell surface. Despite these requirements MSCs derived from any source may contain some heterogeneity and due to the pluripotency of ESCs it is possible that MSC cultures derived from ESCs may contain cells of any lineage from the three germ layers. While the culture system described herein indicated that 90 of cells routinely display the above mentioned immunophenotype and functional characteristics small subpopulation s of cells within the MSC culture may exist that lack expression of one or more of the MSC cell surface markers or express one or more of the markers that should be absent. The extent of such subpopulations within our MSC cultures will be determined by examining the degree of contaminating heterogeneity. Multicolor flow cytometry 8 colors simultaneously can be performed on a BD LSR II flow cytometer in order to determine the overlap between the above mentioned markers. This may also help pinpoint the exact cell surface marker profile that is required for the greatest immunosuppressive activity.

A. Characterize the Differentiation Stage Subpopulations and Activation Status of ESC MSCs in Relevance to their Immunosuppressive Effects.

There is a large time window e.g. at least from day 14 to 28 in the MSC differentiation medium to harvest ESC MSCs see e.g. . Several studies have indicated that MSCs tend to lose their immunosuppressive functions and may senesce as they are continually passaged and age during long culture periods. As such the cells may be harvested at different time points in order to determine if a specific number of days in MSC Medium affords greater immunosuppressive activity. Indeed MSCs collected at an early time point e.g. 14 days in MSC culture conditions may contain precursor cells that have not yet fully acquired all of the characteristic MSC cell surface markers but that harbor highly potent immunosuppressive effects. To define potentially useful MSC precursor populations the expression of a wide range of cell surface markers are being tracked throughout the MSC differentiation process from day 7 through day 28. It has been observed that at least 50 of the culture will acquire the cell surface marker CD309 other names include VEGFR2 KDR within 14 days of MSC culture conditions. CD309 is largely absent from the starting hemangioblast population first time point MA09 hemangioblasts harvested at day 7 and day 8 but rises within the first two weeks of MSC culture conditions and then declines again back to less than 5 of the cells by day 28 second third and fourth time points . This pattern has been found to occur not only with MA09 hemangioblast derived MSCs but also with those from MA01 H1gfp and H7 ESCs. In these experiments hemangioblasts are routinely negative less than 5 of cells stain positive for CD309 regardless of their harvest date day 6 14 . However the percentage of developing MSCs that acquire CD309 expression may be reduced when developing from older hemangioblasts e.g. d10 or d12 blasts . In a similar fashion it has been observed that the expansion properties of hemangioblast derived MSCs may differ depending on the harvest date of hemangioblasts. MSCs developing from younger hemangioblasts day 6 or 7 do not continue to expand as robustly as MSCs developing from older day 8 12 hemangioblasts. The optimal date of hemangioblast harvest may be an intermediate one day 8 10 as they may allow adequate acquisition of CD309 as a surrogate marker of MSC development while still maintaining a robust ability to expand through day 28 and beyond.

Except CD105 CD90 and CD73 that have proved the most typical markers for MSCs as noted by the International Society for Cellular Therapy as the minimum classification of MSCs Dominici et al. Cytotherapy 8 4 315 317 2006 many other cell surface molecules not mentioned above such as CD49a CD54 CD80 CD86 CD271 VCAM and ICAM have also been proposed or used as MSC markers 22 . It is therefore possible that ESC MSCs may contain subpopulations that express various combinations of other markers during the differentiation from hemangioblasts which may possess varying immunosuppressive activities. Subpopulations may be sorted e.g. using FACS based one or more markers individually or in combination for analysis to compare their immunosuppressive activity using in vitro or in vivo methods.

B. Optimize Differentiation and Expansion Conditions to Obtain Large Quantities of Functional ESC MSCs.

Preliminary experiments have indicated that MSCs may be maintained in IMDM 10 heat inactivated human serum. Different culture conditions are tested to determine whether substituting culture components eg base medium serum source serum replacement products human serum platelet lysate may enrich the effective subpopulations described herein. Different basal medium including animal free and a defined culture without FBS system to culture ESCs and prepare MSCs are evaluated. Specifically StemPro MSC SFM from Invitrogen and the MSCM bullet kit from Lonza are examined to see if a serum free defined culture system would generate ESC MSCs with desired quality and quantity. Also various growth factors such as FGFs PDGF and TGFI3 as well as small chemicals that regulate signaling pathways or cell structures are used to enhance the quality and quantity of ESC MSCs.

The ESC MSCs express the typical markers CD73 ecto 5 nucleotidase 26 CD90 and CD105. Also shows that FM MA09 MSCs produced according to the invention maintain their phenotype over time based on marker expression detected during flow cytometry analysis of different MSC populations over time and successive passaging .

A general response of T cells within PBMC is to proliferate when they are induced with mitotic stimulators such as phytohemaglutinin PHA or phorbol myristate acetate PMA ionomycin or when they encounter antigen presenting cells APCs such as dendritic cells. This is best exemplified by the general proliferation of CD4 and CD8 T cells in a mixed leukocyte reaction MLR assay. Prior studies indicate that MSCs can suppress T cell proliferation in an MLR assay.

The ability of our ESC hemangioblast derived MSCs to inhibit T cell proliferation caused by either chemical stimulation PMA ionomycin and PHA or exposure to APCs dendritic cells and was examined. It was observed that MSCs dampened the proliferative response of T cells due to either chemical stimulation or co culture with APCs and that this suppression occurred in a dose dependent manner graph on right Moreover it was found that mitotically inactivated MSCs were able to suppress T cell proliferation to an equivalent degree as live MSCs suggesting that mitotically inactivated MSCs may indeed be useful in vivo for immunosuppression.

Various functional subsets of T cells exist and they carry out specific roles involved in proinflammatory responses anti inflammatory responses or induction of T cell anergy. Regulatory T cells Tregs can be thought of as naturally occurring immunosuppressive T cells and in a normal setting are responsible for dampening hypersensitive auto reactive T cell responses. They usually represent only a small proportion of the body s T cells but their prevalence can be influenced by various environmental factors. MSCs have been shown to induce peripheral tolerance through the induction of Treg cells 33 35 .

In a short 5 day co culture assay it was found that similar to prior studies the hemangioblast derived MSCs were able to increase the percentage of CD4 CD25 double positive Tregs that are induced in response to IL2 stimulus . Co culture of a mixed T cell population from non adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs with MSCs at a ratio of 10 PBMCs 1 MSC shows that Treg induction nearly doubled when MSCs were included in the IL2 induced culture. This degree of Treg induction is similar to that observed in the highly cited Aggarwal et al study published in Blood 2005. The amount of FoxP3 induced within the CD4 CD25 double positive population was examined to confirm that these are indeed true Tregs . Intracellular flow cytometry was used to study FoxP3 induction in the absence and presence of MSCs in the IL2 induced T cell cultures. Both non adherent PBMCs and purified CD4 T cell populations may be used to study Treg induction in these assays. Without intent to be limited by theory it is believed that ES MSC are more effective at inducing Tregs because they increase expression of CD25 more effectively than BM MSCs 

Th1 and Th17 cells are thought to play important roles in MS and in other autoimmune diseases. The differentiation and function of Th1 and Th17 CD4 T cells will be analyzed first and foremost using in vitro assays they may also be examined in the EAE model or in other animal models we may employ. The effects of MSCs on Th1 induction in vitro have begun to be examined. Culture conditions that promote Th1 specification from na ve CD4 T cells are known in the field Aggarwal et al . These culture conditions which include anti CD3 anti CD28 and anti CD4 antibodies together with human IL3 and IL12 have been employed to induce Th1 cells from na ve non adherent PBMCs in the absence or presence of MSCs 10 PBMCs 1 MSC . After 48 hours of co culture non adherent cells were isolated rinsed and stimulated with PMA ionomycin for 16 hours in a new well. After the 16 hour induction supernatants were collected and analyzed for secretion of the Th1 cytokine IFN . As anticipated it was found that the PBMCs cultured with MSCs in the 48 hr Th1 inducing conditions did not produce as much IFN as those cultured without MSCs. This indicates that MSCs can suppress a major Th1 cell function i.e. IFN secretion. Similar studies will be performed by differentiating Th17 cells in vitro and determining the effects of MSCs on pro inflammatory IL17 secretion using an ELISA assay on culture supernatants.

Th2 cells are known to secrete cytokines that have anti inflammatory effects such as IL4. MSCs may be able to enhance Th2 differentiation and secretion of IL4. Similar to the experiment described above for Th1 cells Th2 inducing conditions will be used in a 48 hour culture system to stimulate Th2 differentiation from na ve PBMC containing T cells. The effects of MSC co culture on IL4 secretion will be examined using an ELISA assay.

Recently studies have suggested that CD8 T cells also play a pivotal role in EAE models and the underlying mechanism of MS 30 . The inventor will examine if co culture with ESC MSCs in vitro may affect the function of CD8 T cells. To do this non adherent PBMCs or purified CD8 T cells will be exposed to EAE associated MBP110 118 peptide through the use of APCs. This will cause an antigen specific CD8 T cell population to emerge and such a population can be expanded using CD3 CD28 expander beads Invitrogen . Existence of the antigen specific CD8 T cells can be verified using a pentamer reagent specific for the MBP peptide Proimmune in flow cytometry. Re stimulation with MBP110 118 loaded APCs will be performed in order to induce an antigen specific immune response which includes both expansion of the antigen specific CD8 T cells and secretion of IFN . The response from T cells cultured in the absence or presence of MSCs will be compared to determine if the MSCs can suppress the induction of these cytotoxic EAE associated antigen specific T cells. Pentamer specific flow cytometry BrdU incorporation and ELISA assays will be employed for this purpose.

B. Determine if Inflammatory Factors and Inter Cellular Adhesion Molecules ICAMs Contribute to the Immunosuppresive Effect of ESC MSCs.

It has been shown that TGFbeta PGE2 IDO nitric oxide NO and ICAMs are important for the immunosuppressive function of MSCs 7 . The secretion of these molecules and expression of ICAMs by ESC MSCs will be examined using ELISA assays and flow cytometry.

It has been shown that the pro inflammatory cytokine IFN is required for the activation of MSCs 23 and various agonists for Toll like receptors TLRs such as LPS and poly I C can induce different subsets of MSCs 24 . For example it has recently been shown that IFN activated MSCs have greater therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model of colitis than do untreated MSCs Duijvestein et al 2011 . The effects of IFN on MSC properties have begun to be examined. FM MA09 MSCs were treated in vitro with IFN for up to seven days and striking changes in cell surface marker expression resulted. These findings are consistent with observations made in previous studies Gotherstrom et al 2004 Rasmusson et al 2006 Newman et al 2009 and confirm that the hemangioblast derived ESC MSCs function similarly to MSCs isolated from the body. For example in a resting state MSCs typically do not express much 

It was shown that the CD4 CD25 double positive population of Tregs induced by MSCs also express the transcription factor FoxP3 as it has been reported that functional Tregs upregulate its expression in response to inducing stimuli .

It is expected that MSCs will inhibit to some degree the pro inflammatory secretion of IL17 by Th17 cells and that MSCs can also significantly enhance IL4 secretion by anti inflammatory Th2 cells. Such observations have been made in previous studies and will assist in confirming the true functionality of the hemangioblast derived MSCs.

The ESC MSCs should inhibit at least partially the antigen induced activation of CD8 T cells. The function of NK cells macrophages and dendritic cells after ESC MSC co culture may also be examined. The effects of ESC MSCs on maturation cytotoxicity and or specific cytokine production by these other types of immune cells will be examined.

For example the experiments in show that FM MA09 MSCs increase the percentage of CD4 CD25 double positive Tregs that are induced in response to IL2 stimulus. Also the experiments in show that the proinflammatory cytokine IFNg stimulates changes in FM MA09 MSC surface marker expression and that interferon gamma stimulates changes in MSC surface marker expression and may enhance MSC immunosuppressive effects.

Moreover the experiments in show that FM MA09 MSCs enhance Treg induction and particularly that early passage MSCs had greater effects than late passage MSCs. Non adherent PBMCs different donors were cultured with or without IL2 for 4 days in the absence or presence of FM MA09 MSCs. The percentage of CD4 CD25 double positive Tregs was assessed by flow cytometry. Young p6 or old p16 18 FM MA09 MSCs were used. The black bars indicate the average of 6 experiments. MSCs as a whole had a statistically significant effect on induction of Tregs. p 0.02 .

A mixed lymphocyte reaction MLR assay was performed to determine if different MSC populations have different abilities to inhibit T cell proliferation. Results suggest that FM MA09 MSCs are more potent than BM MSCs in their ability to inhibit T cell proliferation in response to either mitogenic stimulus one way MLR see and or to antigen presenting cells dendritic cells DCs two way MLR see .

The one way MLR assay was performed as follows Human PBMCs were purchased from AllCells. Upon thawing a frozen vial PBMCs were plated for at least 1 hour or overnight in IMDM 10 heat inactivated human serum to selectively adhere monocytes. The non adherent cells containing T cells were used as a crude source of T cell responders. FM MA09 MSCs or BM derived MSCs were used as inhibitors. These MSCs were either live or mitotically arrested with mitomycin C. Non adherent PBMCs and MSCs were mixed together at varying ratios and allowed to co culture for 5 days. On day 3 the mitogens phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate PMA and ionomycin or phytohemagglutinin PHA were added to the cultures to induce T cell proliferation. On day 4 bromodeoxyuridine BrdU was added. On day 5 T cell proliferation was assessed through flow cytometric staining with antibodies directed against CD4 CD8 and BrdU using the BrdU incorporation kit B D Biosystems . T cell proliferation was assessed as the of CD4 and or CD8 cells that had incorporated BrdU into their DNA ie BrdU shown in and . In MA09 MSCs p7 show an approximately 40 decrease in T cell activation compared to BM MSCs.

In the two way MLR FM MA09 MSCs or BM derived MSCs were used as inhibitors non adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs were used as a crude source of T cell responders and monocyte derived dendritic cells DCs were used as stimulators. To derive DCs plastic adherent monocytes were isolated from PBMCs PBMCs were plated for at least 1 hour or overnight in IMDM 10 heat inactivated human serum 10 HuSer to selectively adhere monocytes. Non adherent cells were removed and the adherent cells were cultured in IMDM 10 HuSer for 4 days with SCF FL GM CSF IL3 and IL4. In this variation of the assay no mitogen is added on day 3. BrdU is simply added 16 24 hours before harvesting the cells for flow cytometry as above. Both MSCs and DCs were mitotically inactivated with Mitomycin C in this assay shown in . In the percent BRDU incorporation of the T cells does not substantially increase preferably remains the same more preferably decreases the DC T cell ratio in the presence of the MA09 MSCs as compared to the BM MSCs.

Co culture experiments were performed with PBMCs and FM MA09 MSCs to determine if the presence of these MSCs can induce regulatory T cell Treg expansion within the PBMC population. Results suggest that young FM MA09 MSCs induced Treg expansion better than both BM MSCs and old FM MA09 MSCs see and .

Co cultures were established with non adherent PBMCs and different types of FM MA09 MSCs young ESC derived p5 6 old ESC derived p12 or higher BM derived at a 10 1 ratio PBMC MSC . Co cultures were incubated in IMDM 10 heat inactivated Human Serum 300 units ml recombinant human IL2 for 4 days. The presence of Tregs was determined by the percentage of PBMCs that stained positive for CD4 CD25 and FoxP3 using a FoxP3 intracellular flow cytometry staining kit Biolegend .

The growth rates of different MSC populations were monitored over time to determine if the source of MSCs affects their proliferative capacity. Results show that FM MA09 MSCs have greater proliferative capacity than BM derived MSCs. Results also suggest that culturing FM MA09 MSCs on a substrate such as Matrigel for a longer period of time up to 6 passages may help maintain a higher growth rate than if the cells are moved off of the substrate at an earlier passage such as p2 see and .

ESC derived hemangioblasts were seeded onto Matrigel coated tissue culture plastic at 50 000 cells cmin MEM 20 Hyclone FBS 1 glutamine non essential amino acids MSC growth medium at p0. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were seeded onto regular tissue culture plastic at 50 000 cells cmin MSC medium at p0. Cells were harvested with 0.05 trypsin edta Gibco when they reached 50 60 confluence at p0 or at 70 80 confluence from p1 onwards usually every 3 5 days . Upon harvest cells were spun down counted and replated at 7000 cells cm. ESC MSCs were removed from Matrigel and subsequently grown on regular tissue culture plastic starting at p3 unless otherwise indicated. Cumulative population doublings over time are plotted to show the rate of cell growth as the MSCs are maintained in culture.

To determine the chondrogenic potential of different MSC populations FM MA09 MSCs or BM MSCs were seeded as pellet mass cultures and induced to differentiate into chondrocytes with differentiation medium or kept in regular MSC growth media as negative controls . Results suggest that FM MA09 MSCs undergo chondrogenesis in a manner similar to that of BM MSCs. Both ESC MSC and BM MSC pellets reveal cartilaginous matrix proteoglycan deposition via Safranin O staining see .

To form chondrogenic pellet culture 2.5 10cells FM MA09 MSCs were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min in a 15 mL conical tube. Culture medium was aspirated and 0.5 mL of chondrogenic culture medium consisting of DMEM HG Life Technologies Gaithersburg Md. supplemented with 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate Life Technologies 0.1 mM ascorbic acid 2 phosphate Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. 0.1 M dexamethasone Sigma Aldrich 1 ITS Collaborative Biomedical Products Bedford Mass. 10 ng mL TGF 3 Peprotech Rocky Hill N.J. or culture medium control was added to the pellet. Pellet cultures were maintained for 21 days with medium changes every 2 3 days. At the end of the 21 days pellets were fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde and sent to MassHistology Worcester Mass. for paraffin embedding sectioning and Safranin O staining using standard procedures.

ESC MSCs exert immunomodulatory effects in part through the secretion of PGE2. Conditioned medium collected from FM MA09 MSCs and BM MSCs show that BM MSCs secrete higher levels of PGE2 in the basal state than FM MA09 MSCs. Experiments to determine PGE2 secretion under stimulated conditions various concentrations of IFN and or TNF show that FM MA09 MSCs greatly increase their secretion of PGE2 in response to stimulation see . In fact the fold induction for PGE2 secretion from a basal to stimulated state is much greater for FM MA09 MSCs than for BM MSCs. However the actual raw amounts of PGE2 secretion in pg ml under stimulated conditions is similar for FM MA09 MSCs and BM MSCs.

FM MA09 MSCs were plated at 7.5 10cells cmin 6 well plates BD Falcon Franklin Lakes N.J. . Cultures were maintained in culture medium for 24 hrs followed by stimulation with 10 50 100 or 200 ng ml IFN and or 10 25 50 ng mL TNF Peprotech . Supernatant was collected after 3 days of induction and stored at 20 C. FM MA09 MSCs were harvested and counted to normalize PGE2 levels to cell number. PGEconcentration was measured with ELISA kits R D PGE2 Parameter or Prostaglandin E2 Express EIA kit Cayman Chemicals and used according to manufacturer s protocol.

The expression of various cell surface markers was assessed on different MSC populations to determine their individual immunophenotypes. FM MA09 MSCs can be differentiated on various substrates. A panel of cell surface markers were examined to determine their expression profile on MSCs that had been derived on three different matrices Matrigel fibronectin or collagen I versus their expression on BM MSCs. Results show similar patterns of expression for these markers regardless of the substrate used for their initial differentiation. They were over 95 positive for CD13 29 44 73 90 105 166 and HLA ABC while negative for CD31 34 45 HLA DR FGFR2 CD271 see . Stro 1 expression varied between approximately 5 for FM MA09 MSCs to approximately 30 for BM MSCs.

MSCs slow in growth and population doubling with increasing passage number. The aim of this experiment was to look at surface marker expression for a number of different MSC markers from passage 3 to 17 in FM MA09 MSCs. Cells in all passages of FM MA09 MSCs stained positive for CD90 CD73 CD105 HLA ABC CD166 CD13 and CD44. Cells were negative for CD34 CD45 TLR3 HLA DR CD106 CD133 and CD271 see .

For each line passage number the same protocol was followed. Cells were grown in T75 or T175 flasks in MSC media. Cells were passaged every 3 4 days. Passaging cells consisted of washing flasks with PBS collecting cells using cell dissociation media TryPLE Express and washing with MSC media. Cells were counted for viability with trypan blue and aliquoted at 50 100 000 viable cells per condition. The following antibodies were used CD34 Fitc CD34 PE CD44 Fitc CD73 PE CD106 PE CD45 APC BD HLA DR APC CD90 Fitc HLA ABC Fitc CD133 APC CD29 ebioscience CD166 PE CD105 APC CD13 PE CD13 APC CD271 Fitc CD10 Fitc Stro 1 AF647 CD10 Biolegend TLR3 Fitc Santa Cruz Biotech . Propidium Iodide was also added as a viability marker. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes spun down passed through a 40 m cell strainer and analyzed with na Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer. For each cell type cells were gated on the MSC population FSC vs. SSC PI negative. Percent positive was determined by gating histogram plots and using the unstained cell population as a negative control. See Wagner W et al. Replicative Senescence of Mesenchymal Stem Cells A Continuous and Organized Process. 2008 . 3 5 e2213. doi 10.1371 journal.pone.0002213 and Musina R et al. Comparison of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Obtained from Different Human Tissues. Cell Technologies in Biology and Medicine 2005 April. 1 2 504 509.

Additionally FM MA09 MSCs have a greater level of CD10 expression and less Stro 1 expression than BM MSCs see . This expression pattern of low Stro 1 5 10 of cells and mid level CD 10 40 of cells was confirmed in 10 different lots of FM MA09 MSCs see . Flow cytometry was also used on different populations to evaluate cell size see . Results show that as the cells are maintained in culture for longer periods of time the cell size of BM MSCs increases while FM MA09 MSCs maintain cell size. Cell size was determined by forward vs. side scatter on flow cytometry dot plots. A quadrant gate was used to divide the plot into 4 regions. The upper right quadrant contains the large cells i.e. cells in that area have large forward scatter cell volume and also high side scatter granularity .

FM MA09 MSCs were harvested as previously mentioned and washed in 1 DPBS Life Technologies . 75 100 10cells were washed with flow buffer 3 FBS Atlas Biologicals Fort Collins Colo. followed by incubation with 100 L of flow buffer containing either primary antibody or isotype control antibody for 45 min on ice. Cells were washed with 2 mL flow buffer and incubated in 100 L flow buffer containing secondary antibody for 45 min on ice. Cells were washed a final time and resuspended in flow buffer containing propidium iodide and analyzed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer Accuri Cytometers Inc. Ann Arbor Mich. .

The purpose of these studies was to determine the similarities and differences of mRNA expression between FM MA09 MSCs and BM MSC. In the first set of experiments basal experiments relative differences of mRNA expression of cells from FM MA09 MSCs and BM MSC were compared by Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction QPCR . Taqman probes Life Technologies to the various genes were used to determine relative expression to the endogenous control GAPDH using the Ct method. From a list of 28 genes the following genes were upregulated in the basal experiments in FM MA09 MSCs vs BM MSC AIRE ANGPT1 ANG 1 CXCL1 CD10 CD24 and IL11 see . IL6 and VEGF were downregulated in FM MA09 MSCs vs BM MSC see . There was no significant difference for the following genes between the sources of MSC ALCAM FGF7 HGF LGALS1 NT5E and TNFSF1B data not shown . The following genes were not detected in any of the MSC sources ANGPT2 CD31 CD34 CD45 HLA G IL2RA IL3 IL12B data not shown . As a negative control all MSCs were tested for expression of the hematopoietic progenitor markers CD34 CD41 and CD45. From these experiments we have determined that FM MA09 MSCs do express some genes at higher or lower levels than the equivalent BM MSCs.

We also challenged the MSCs to an environment that mimics an immune response by treating the MSC with T cells and then adding the stimulant Phytohemagglutinin PHA FM MA09 MSCs were grown in the presence of T cells unstimulated or T cells plus PHA stimulated for two days before adding 2.5 g ml PHA for an additional 2 days prior to RNA collection. The gene expression of ESC MSC unstimulated and stimulated are currently being compared to unstimulated and stimulated BM MSC mRNA levels.

For basal experiments FM MA09 MSCs and BM MSC were cultured for 4 days at a starting density of approximately 500 000 cells in a 10 cm dish under previously described conditions. Additionally a negative control for basal experiments was MA09 ESC derived hematopoetic progenitors.

For stimulation experiments FM MA09 MSCs and BM MSC were cultured for 3 4 days at a starting density of approximately 500 000 cells in a 10 cm dish under previously described conditions. MSCs were then exposed to T cells for 2 days and then exposure to 2.5 g ml PHA. As a control MSCs were grown in the presence of T cells without PHA and separately T cells plus PHA no MSCs were also grown. Media was aspirated rinsed 2 times in PBS and aspirated dry. RNA was isolated using the RNAeasy kit Qiagen as per manufacturer s directions. The concentration and purity of RNA was analyzed by using the Nanodrop 2000 Thermo Scientific . cDNA synthesis was performed using the SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT PCR Life Technologies using 1 microgram RNA as the starting material. cDNA was diluted approximately 30 fold for 5 microliters well. Diluted cDNA 1 microliter of QPCR Taqman probe Life Technologies and 15 microliters of SSO Fast Mastermix Biorad were mixed per well. QPCR was performed on the Biorad CFX 96. Data was analyzed using CFX manager 2.1 Biorad . Relative quantities of mRNA expression were determined using the endogenous control GAPDH and the Ct method.

Indoleamine 2 3 dioxygenase IDO is an enzyme involved in the conversion of tryptophan to kynurenine. IFN activated MSCs produce IDO and this may be partly responsible for their ability to suppress T cell proliferation as IDO interferes with T cell metabolism. In this study we are testing the IDO activity of BM MSCs compared with FM MA09 MSCs. IDO expression is being measured before and after stimulation of cells with either IFN or by co culturing with T cells. Experiments show all MSC populations greatly increase IDO activity upon stimulation with IFNgamma see .

Cells were stimulated by the addition of either IFN 50 ng ml to media or by co culture with T cells for 3 days measurement of IDO expression is performed using a spectrophotometric assay. After stimulation cells were collected and 1 2 10cells are lysed. Lysates are collected and mixed 1 1 with 2 IDO buffer PBS with 40 mM ascorbate 20 M methylene blue 200 g ml catalase and 800 M L tryptophan and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 30 trichloroacetic acid and incubated for 30 minutes at 52 C. Lysates were spun down and supernatants are mixed 1 1 with Ehrlich s reagent 0.8 p dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in acetic acid freshly prepared . After color development absorbance was read on a spectrophotometer at 492 nm. OD values were compared with a standard of kynurenine from 0 1000 M for assessing the conversion of tryptophan to kynurenine.

The expression levels of Aire 1 and Prion Protein Prp were monitored using western blot analysis to determine if there are differences among different MSC populations based on cell source derivation method or passage number of the MSCs . Aire 1 helps induce transcription of rare peripheral tissue restricted antigens PTA that are subsequently presented on MHC and quell the response of neighboring T cells. Aire 1 may also suppress expression of early T cell activation factor 1 ETA 1 to inhibit T cell inflammatory response. Prion protein PrP has been shown to enhance the proliferation and self renewal of various stem cell populations hematopoietic neural etc and its expression may correlate with the growth characteristics of different MSC populations in culture. Results show age related decline in both proteins after consideration of loading control actin for each sample . FM MA09 MSCs appear to maintain expression of both Aire 1 and PrP over time see .

MSCs whole cell lysates were run on 12 acrylamide SDS PAGE gels according to standard protocols. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and blocked with 5 milk in PBS 0.05 tween 20. Membranes were probed with antibodies directed against Aire 1 Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Prion Protein Abcam followed by HRP conjugated secondary antibodies. Enhanced chemiluminescent reagent was used to develop the signal prior to analysis on a Biorad GelDoc Imaging System.

MSCs are known to secrete a variety of cytokines and growth factors in both the basal state and in response to various stimuli. More than 20 different secreted factors were analysed using cytokine arrays. Results show that there are a few key differences between FM MA09 MSCs and BM MSCs with respect to secreted factors in both the basal and stimulated states. BM MSCs express higher levels of VEGF and IL6 than do FM MA09 MSCs in both the basal and IFN stimulated state see .

Equivalent numbers of MSCs were initially plated and conditioned medium from MSCs were collected 3 4 days after plating. CM was spun down briefly to remove cellular debris and then frozen at 20 C. CM was thawed for analysis on RayBiotech Norcross Ga. custom membrane arrays or on various R D Systems Minneapolis Minn. ready made cytokine arrays according to manufacturer s protocols.

The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate different growth media used for hESC culture prior to differentiation into MSCs.

Human ES cells were generally cultured on irradiated or mitomycin C treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEF feeder cells in Human ES Cell Growth Medium knockout DMEM or DMEM F12 1 1 base medium 20 serum replacement 1 glutamine non essential amino acids and 10 ng ml bFGF . Passaging is performed using 0.05 trypsin EDTA. Alternatively hESCs were cultured on MEF feeders in Primate Medium and passaged using Dissociation solution both are purchased from ReproCELL . Results showed that Primate Medium consistently gave better looking hESC colonies rounder tighter colonies less spontaneous differentiation compared to cells grown on the Human ES Cell Growth Medium containing knockout DMEM.

The effects of MSC produced from hES cells MA09 MSCs on orofacial pain sensitivity were tested in the mouse. The mouse system used operant conditioning to study orofacial pain sensitivity to extreme temperatures both hot and cold as described in Nolan et al. Behav Brain Res. 2011 Mar. 1 217 2 477 480 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Sensitivity was further augmented by treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent taxol and the effect of MSC on hot and cold sensitivity was determined.

MSCs were derived from hESC line MA09 generally as described in example 1 above. In brief and starting with MA09 hESCs grown on mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEFs we use a 3 step approach to generate MSCs. hESCs were first differentiated into embryoid bodies EB for 4 days and then into hemangioblasts for 9 days. The hemangioblasts were then transferred into an MSC derivation medium. Within about 14 days the attached cells fully differentiated into MSCs cells with cell surface markers similar to those of BM MSCs. hESC MSC cultures were passaged every 3 4 days and replated at 5000 cells sq cm. At the third passage p3 cells were frozen down and then subsequently thawed and grown for 4 days as fourth passage p4 MSCs prior to use in the model. Cells in culture were freshly harvested with 0.05 trypsin on the day of injection into SKH1 hairless mice for the pain study. Orofacial pain testing was performed using the Stoelting Orofacial Pain Assessment Device OPAD www.stoeltingco.com stoelting 3438 1465 1480 Physio OroFacial Pain Assessment Device OPAD NEW as previously described Rossi et al. Molecular Pain 2006 2 37 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety . In brief mice undergo a two week training period whereby after fasting they are placed into a chamber containing a milk reward bottle located behind 2 temperature controlled thermode elements. Mice are conditioned to push through the thermodes with their face in order to gain access to the milk reward. Milk licks per facial contact with the thermodes is measured in an automated fashion. After conditioning baseline measurements thermodes at 37 degrees were taken in 2 independent sessions prior to any treatment and the licks per facial contact ratio was averaged for each group of mice n 10 per group. Animals were then i.p. injected with 1 10E6 MA09 hESC derived MSCs in 250 ul PBS or 250 ul PBS alone. 1 week later mice were injected with 2 mg kg of the chemotherapeutic agent taxol. Heat or cold sensitivity was measured for each group of mice by changing the temperature in the thermode elements to either 42 C. or 18 C. respectively and recording their lick facial contact ratio at these temperatures weekly for 4 weeks.

Results were computed as percentage of baseline licks facial contact ratio over time. Pain sensitivity resulted in a decrease of the licks facial contact ratio as compared to baseline which is set as 100 . Thus the mice avoided pushing through the electrodes due to the sensation of pain when they came in contact with heat or cold.

hMSCs blocked induction of chemotherapy induced heat hyperalgesia. Animals were pretreated with hMSCs 1 10E6 cells 250 l i.p. 1 week prior to injection of taxol 2 mg kg . MSCs blocked the development of heat sensitivity when tested at 42 C. Animals treated with vehicle PBS 250 l i.p. developed heat hyperalgesia over the 3 week period post taxol injection. There was a significant between subjects effect when comparing treatment hMSC vs Veh RM ANOVA F 1 15 4.95 p 0.042 . Baseline values were not significantly different between the hMSC and Veh groups P 0.946 . Thus a statistically significant block in taxol induced sensitivity to heat for MSC injected animals vs controls was observed. Taxol caused mice to feel more pain at 42 C. than they did before taxol treatment with the percentage of baseline being decreased at weeks 1 2 and 3. In animals administered MSCs the taxol induced sensitivity to heat was prevented. By week 4 the effects of the taxol in the vehicle control group had subsided and they returned to the same degree of heat sensitivity as they had before they were given the taxol week 0 levels .

hMSCs also blocked induction of cold sensitivity. Animals were pretreated with hMSCs 1 10E6 cells 250 l i.p. 1 week prior to injection of taxol 2 mg kg . This treatment blocked cold sensitivity when tested at 18 C. as compared to animals treated with vehicle PBS 250 l i.p. . There was a significant between subjects effect when comparing treatment hMSC vs Veh RM ANOVA F 1 15 16.71 p 0.01 . Thus a statistically significant block in cold sensitivity was observed for MSC injected animals vs controls. At weeks 1 2 and 3 no drop in the percentage of baseline due to taxol was observed. Nonetheless general sensitivity to cold was blocked by MSCs as indicated by the fact that the percentage of baseline in the MSC injected mice was significantly higher than in the control group in all 3 weeks tested. Thus taxol treatment was not observed to cause an appreciable development of cold sensitivity in this experiment but nonetheless there was a difference in overall cold sensitivity between the MSC treated and control groups with administration of MSC resulting in decreased cold sensitivity.

Uveitis is an inflammatory eye disorder that affects the uvea of the eye uvea is the middle layer of the eye and is comprised of the ciliary body iris and choroid . Causes include autoimmune related mechanisms i.e. inflammation is due to autoimmune attack on some component within the uvea sometimes observed in lupus and infectious mechanisms i.e. inflammation is due to the immune system fighting an infection in the eye . In this example the effects of MSCs derived from hESC MA09 MSCs are evaluated using an established mouse model of uveitis Tasso et al. Invest Ophthalmol V is Sci. 2012 53 786 793 which is hereby incorporated by reference .

FM MA09 MSCs were generated as described in the preceding example. An experimental autoimmune uveitis EAU model of uveitis in C57BL 6 mice was established generally as previously described Tasso et al. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2012 53 786 793 . In brief male mice aged 7 9 weeks were immunized with 500 ug of a peptide aa1 20 derived from interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein 3 IRBP along with 1.5 ug pertussin toxin PTX . As indicated mice were also i.p. injected with a single bolus of 5 10MA09 hESC MSCs on the same day as the immunization day 0 . On day 21 mice were subjected to funduscope imaging and clinical evaluation and then sacrificed to collect eyes for histological evaluation as well as spleens and serum for tissue banking and follow up e.g. Treg evaluation . Three groups of mice were used in the experiment as follows Group A contained 6 mice induced with EAU but NOT injected with MSCs to evaluate the degree of disease induction without any treatment i.e. a disease specific positive control . Group B contained 8 mice that were not induced with EAU but did receive MSCs negative control for non specific effects of MSCs in wt mice and Group C contained 7 mice that were induced with EAU and given MSCs i.e. the experimental group .

Histological analysis was performed for the 3 groups of mice. Uveitis induced in this model was rather mild as noted by the histology images of the eye. There was an infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes PMN and lymphocytes in the vitreous space for the IRBP PTX treated mice positive control for disease no MSC but no accompanying disorganization of retinal architecture eg retinal folds nor damage to the photoreceptor layer as comparing IRBP PTX treated mice to MSC only treated mice with the latter showing no uveitis disease no infiltrated immune cells . IRBP PTX MSC treated mice showed a striking reduction in the number of PMN and lymphocytes in the vitreous space 0 or 1 cells as compared to IRBP PTX only mice typically more than 40 infiltrated immune cells in the vitreous space with additional cells in the retinal architecture .

To further quantify the effect of MSC treatment histological samples and fundus examinations were independently scored in a blinded fashion by two investigators the fundus and histological samples were performed in separate evaluations. The more severe the inflammation inflammatory cell infiltration and tissue damage the higher the histology score. For funduscope examinations higher scores represent more severe disease features. Additional disease features that do not readily appear in histology such as mild vasculitis and optic nerve head erythema can be captured in funduscope imaging. Both eyes were scored separately for each mouse. Raw scoring numbers per eye per mouse showed general consistency between histology and funduscope scores for each eye mouse. The results further confirmed that administration of MSC decreased the severity of uveitis in this model. Among the group A animals in which EAU was induced without MSC administration histology scores were 0 in 5 eyes and 0.5 in 7 eyes and funduscope scores were 0 in 1 eye 0.5 in 4 eyes 1 in 1 eye 1.5 in 2 eyes and 2 in 4 eyes. Among the group B animals in which MSC were administered without EAU induction histology scores were 0 in all 16 eyes and funduscope scores were 0 in 11 eyes 0.5 in 4 eyes and 1 in 1 eye. Among the group C animals in which EAU was induced and the MSC were administered histology scores were 0 in 11 eyes 0.25 in 2 eyes and 0.5 in 1 eye funduscope scores were 0 in 6 eyes 0.5 in 3 eyes 1 in 3 eyes and 1.5 in 2 eyes.

This example describes performance of human ES cell derived MSCs hES MSC in an EAE model of multiple sclerosis. Particularly it is demonstrated in this example that hES MSC outperform bone marrow MSC BM MSC in this model. Additionally the hES MSC exhibited lower IL 6 expression compared to BM MSC which may contribute to better immunosuppression. Additionally hES MSC exhibited superior extravasation migratory properties into injured CNS compared to BM MSC.

hESC lines were cultured either on Matrigel in TeSR1 medium or on MEFs in DMEM F12 20 KOSR 10 ng ml bFGF. To generate hES MSCs hESCs were first differentiated into EBs for 4 days and then hemangioblasts HBs for an additional 6 12 days as previously described Lu et al. 2008 . HB containing cell clusters were then transferred to MEM with 20 FBS and cultured on Matrigel BD Bioscience coated plates at a density of 5 000 cells cm. The medium was refreshed every 3 4 days and after 7 14 days the adherent cells gradually differentiated into spindle shaped cells.

BM MSCs 1 2 3 were derived from BM mononuclear cells BMMNCs obtained from AllCells Inc Alameda 4 was derived from Lonza Basel Switzerland BMMNCs while 5 GFP labeled and 6 were obtained as BM MSCs from Dr. Darwin Prockop at Texas A M. For derivation of 1 4 BMMNCs were thawed and plated onto tissue culture plastic dishes in MEM 20 FBS. Adherent cells began to appear within the first 4 5 days and fed every 3 days until day 10 12 when cells were harvested and replated at 3 000 5 000 cells cm.

EAE mice were perfused with cold PBS through the left ventricle. Brain and spinal cord were harvested ground and digested with collagenase and Dispase 1 mg ml each at 37 C. for 20 minutes. Single cells passed through 40 m cell strainer were washed and re suspended in 4 ml of 40 Percoll overlaid onto 5 ml of 70 Percoll and centrifuged at 2 000 rpm for 20 minutes. Inter layer cells were collected and stimulated with 12 O tetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate TPA at 50 ng ml Sigma and ionomycin at 500 ng ml Sigma in the presence of GolgiStop BD Bioscience for 6 h. Cells were then immunostained with anti CD4 FITC and anti CD8 Pacific Blue BD Bioscience . Flow cytometry for IFN and IL 17 was performed using an intracellular staining kit BD Bioscience according to manufacturer s instructions.

Paraffin embedded spinal cord cross sections were immunostained for CD3 Biocare Medical or Iba1 Waco and counterstained with anti MBP Millipore or fluoromyelin as previously described Crocker et al. 2006 Moore et al. 2011 . Quantification of anti MBP staining intensity was performed on the lateral columns of sections from the thoracic and lumbar levels of spinal cord samples using ImageJ NIH Crocker et al. 2006 . At least three regions of interest were analyzed for each subject in each treatment group.

Naive CD4 T cells were purified from mouse spleens with the Naive CD4 T Cell Enrichment kit Stem Cell Technologies and activated with anti CD3 1 g ml and anti CD28 1 g ml . Cytokines and antibodies were added as follow Th0 condition anti mIFN 5 g ml and anti mIL 4 5 g ml eBioscience Th1 condition rmIL 12 10 ng ml PeproTech anti mIL4 5 ug ml Th17 condition anti mIL 4 5 g ml anti mIFN 5 g ml rmIL 6 20 ng ml Peprotech rhTGF 1 1 ng ml Peprotech . For some groups anti hIL 6 10 g ml eBioscience was added. hES or BM MSCs that had been mitotically arrested through irradiation at 80 Gy were added 1 hour later.

180 000 MSCs were plated per well of a 6 well plate and conditioned medium CM was collected 3 days after plating. CM was spun down briefly to remove cellular debris and then frozen at 20 C. CM was thawed for analysis on RayBiotech Norcross custom membrane arrays according to manufacturer s protocols.

Spinal cord tissue was prepared as reported previously by Paul et al. 2013 . In brief after perfusion fixation spinal cords were harvested by laminectomy and cryosectioned for immunostaining Anti GFP Alexa 488 anti CD31 BD Bioscience Alexa 555 secondary antibody Life Technologies were used to detect GFP and endothelial cells DRAQ5 Biostatus Ltd. were used to visualize the nuclei. Following staining sections were mounted in Mowiol and confocal z stacks were acquired at 1 m increments between z slices following a multitrack scan using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope. Images were analyzed with Imaris suite version 7.1 software Bitplane Inc. . The GFP channel was isosurface rendered to provide a better spatial perspective for visualizing GFP cells.

Clinical disease scores for each treatment group are expressed as mean SE. The difference in 30 day clinical scores between groups was analyzed by two way ANOVA and by t test for the one day scores in comparing the ability of GFP hES MSCs and GFP BM MSCs to extravasate from inflamed CNS venules and migrate into CNS parenchyma of EAE mice. Percentage data for CNS infiltrated T cells were arcsine transformed prior to analysis. SPSS 15 software was used for statistical analysis. A probability of P

Flow cytometry staining was performed using standard methods. Antibodies include anti CD31 CD34 CD29 CD73 CD90 CD105 CD44 CD45 CD166 HLA ABC HLA DR HLA G BD Bioscience Biolegend or eBioscience . Data were collected on FACS LSR II Flow Cytometer or Accuri C3 flow cytometer. Data analysis was performed with FlowJo Treestar or Accuri C6 software.

Cells were fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde permeabilized with PBS 0.2 Triton X 100 and stained with primary antibody in 5 goat serum overnight at 4 C. Cells were then washed 3 with PBS stained with fluorochrome conjugated secondary antibodies washed 3 with PBS and mounted under cover slips prior to phase and fluorescence microscopy.

Chemicals for all 3 differentiation conditions were purchased from Sigma Aldrich unless otherwise indicated. Undifferentiated MSCs were stained as controls. Osteogenic differentiation was performed as previously described Karlsson et al. 2009 In brief MSCs were grown in low glucose DMEM plus 10 FCS 80 M ascorbic acid 2 phosphate 1 M dexamethasone and 20 mM beta glycerophosphate fed every 3 4 days for 28 days and stained with Alizarin Red. Adipogenic differentiation was performed as previously described Karlsson et al. 2009 . In brief MSCs were grown in low glucose DMEM plus 20 FCS 5 g ml insulin 2 M dexamethasone 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine and 60 M indomethacin fed every 3 4 days for 30 32 days total and stained with Oil Red O. Chondrogenic differentiation was performed as previously described Barry et al. 2001 . In brief 2.5 10cells MSCs were pelleted in 15 ml conical tubes and grown in high glucose DMEM 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate 0.1 mM ascorbic acid 2 phosphate 0.1 M dexamethasone 1 ITS Collaborative Biomedical Products and 10 ng mL TGF 3 Peprotech . Pellet cultures were fed every 2 3 days for 21 28 days total fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde and sent to MassHistology Worcester Mass. for paraffin embedding and sectioning prior to Alcian Blue and Nuclear Fast Red staining

The mouse EAE model was induced as previously described Stromnes and Goverman 2006 . In brief C57BL 6 mice were subcutaneously injected with a mixture of MOG Freund s adjuvant and pertussis toxin contained in the EAE Induction kit from Hooke Laboratories Inc MA Cat. EK 0114 following the manufacturer s protocol. BM or hES MSCs at 1 10cells mouse or PBS a vehicle control were i.p. injected on day 6 for pre onset or 18 for post onset after the immunization. Disease score was monitored every day for up to 31 days as follows 0 no sign of disease 1 loss of tone in the tail 2 partial hind limb paralysis 3 complete hind limb paralysis 4 front limb paralysis and 5 moribund Stromnes and Goverman 2006 . For some experiments cumulative and maximal disease scores were also calculated e.g. in evaluating the ability of hES MSCs to attenuate cumulative and maximal disease scores in EAE mice .

Lymphocytes isolated from mouse peripheral lymph nodes were labeled with 5 M of CFSE for 10 min. at 37 C. 1 000 hES or BM MSCs were mixed with 10 000 lymphocytes per well in a 96 well plate and the cells were stimulated for proliferation with plate bound anti CD3 and soluble anti CD28 antibodies eBioscience CA . The cells were collected 3 days after the stimulation followed by flow cytometry staining with anti CD4 and anti CD8 antibodies BD Bioscience CA . CFSE dilution was gated on CD4 and CD8 T cells respectively.

MSC RNA was isolated using the RNAeasy kit Qiagen per manufacturer s instructions. cDNA synthesis was performed using the SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT PCR Life Technologies . Quantitative RT PCR qRT PCR was performed using Taqman probes Life Technologies and SSO Fast Mastermix Biorad on a Biorad CFX 96 qRT PCR machine. Data was analyzed using CFX Manager 2.1 software Biorad and the Ct method following normalization with GAPDH. For IL 6 RNA expression in the stimulation experiments MSCs were co cultured with non adherent human PBMCs containing T cells for 4 days total. 2.5 ng ml PHA was added for the final 2 days. Non adherent PBMCs were then aspirated away and adherent cells were rinsed 3 with PBS prior to RNA processing.

Non adherent human PBMC from 2 different donors were used as a source of T cell responders hES MSCs from 5 different lots and BM MSCs from 3 different donors were used as inhibitors among 4 independent experiments. MSCs were mitotically arrested with 5 10 g ml mitomycin C Sigma Aldrich for 2.5 3 h rinsed 2 with PBS and responder cells were added to the MSC culture at a 1 6 ratio in IMDM 10 heat inactivated human serum. On day 3 2.5 ng ml PHA Sigma was added to induce T cell proliferation. On day 4 10 M BrdU BD Bioscience was added and on day 5 T cell proliferation was assessed through flow cytometric staining using anti CD4 FITC CD8 APC and BrdU PE antibodies with the BrdU Incorporation kit BD Bioscience according to manufacturer s protocol.

Human PBMCs AllCells were co cultured for 4 days in suspension with adherent hES MSCs or BM MSCs that had been previously mitotically inactivated with mitomycin C Sigma Aldrich . Media was IMDM Gibco 10 heat inactivated human serum Mediatech and 30 IU ml rhIL 2 Peprotech . Tcells were determined by triple positivity for CD4 CD25 and FoxP3 by staining with anti CD4 FITC CD25 APC and FoxP3 PE antibodies using the FoxP3 Intracellular Flow Staining kit Biolegend according to manufacturer s protocol.

Starting from either feeder free hESCs or hESCs grown on mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEFs we obtained MSCs by using a 3 step approach that goes through both embryoid body EB and HB intermediate stages . The HB intermediate contains a heterogeneous population of cells including 68 CD45 cells hematopoietic progenitors and 22 CD31 cells endothelial progenitors . Replating these cells on Matrigel in an MEM based MSC medium allowed the emergence of MSC like cells 24 h after plating 5 10 of the cells attached to the plate and 7 14 days thereafter the attached cells fully differentiated into MSC like cells with cell surface markers similar to those of BM MSCs. They expressed high levels of CD73 99 CD90 90 CD105 90 CD13 85 CD29 90 CD54 80 CD44 99 and CD166 90 but did not express non MSC markers such as CD31 CD34 and CD45 . Demonstrating the capability and reproducibility of this method we found that cells harvested anytime between HB d7 and HB d12 could similarly give rise to hES MSCs. Specifically flow cytometric analysis of cell surface markers on hESC derived HB enriched cells and hES MSCs was performed and expression levels were determined from the mean of four independent experiments. hESC MA09 derived HB enriched cells were harvested after culture in methylcellulose containing medium for 7 12 days and hES MSCs were harvested after culture in the MSC Medium for 14 21 days. In hES MSC over about 90 95 of cells were positive for CD105 CD90 CD29 CD73 CD166 CD44 and HLA ABC while less than 5 of cells were positive for CD34 CD45 or CD31. In contrast in hESC HB enriched cells less than about 10 of cells were positive for CD105 CD90 CD73 CD34 and CD31 about 45 of cells were positive for CD29 about 30 of cells were positive for CD166 about 90 of cells were positive for CD44 about 50 of cells were positive for HLA ABC and about 80 of cells were positive for CD45. Moreover we have used this method to generate MSCs from 4 different hESC lines H9 Thomson et al. 1998 CT2 derived at UConn Wang et al. 2009 MA09 a FDA approved clinical grade line derived at Advanced Cell Technology Klimanskaya et al. 2006 and ES03 Envy Envy a GFP labeled line derived at ES International Costa et al. 2005 .

Like BM MSCs Le Blanc et al. 2003 Selmani et al. 2008 our hES MSCs express high levels of immunosuppressive non classical MHC antigen HLA G and MHC class I antigen HLA ABC determined by flow cytometry as discussed above but not MHC class II antigen HLA DR and co stimulatory molecule CD80 IFN treatment induces up regulation of HLA DR but not CD80 . Functionally the hES MSCs are multipotent as they can differentiate into osteocytes adipocytes and chondrocytes a defining criterion for MSCs FIG. E . The hES MSCs can be cultured in vitro for at least 12 passages and were determined to have a normal karyotype at this time point the cells also sustained their immunophenotype and differentiation capabilities data not shown .

We employed a standard EAE model of MS in C57BL 6 mice to test the therapeutic utility of our hES MSCs. EAE was induced as previously described Stromnes and Goverman 2006 . Six days after immunization mice were injected with 1 10hES MSCs or PBS intraperitoneally i.p. . hES MSCs derived from three hESC lines CT2 MA09 and H9 all significantly attenuated the daily disease scores as well as cumulative and maximal disease scores. However mice injected with parental CT2 hESCs manifested high disease scores similar to those of PBS controls . To confirm the clinical score data we also histologically analyzed microglial inflammatory activity within the spinal cord. Immunostaining for ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 IBA1 revealed reduced microgliosis in EAE mice treated with hES MSCs compared to those treated with PBS . Infiltration of total T cells stained as CD3 cells into the spinal cord was also decreased by hES MSC treatment . Strong immunostaining for myelin binding protein MBP indicates that demyelination was prevented in mice treated with hES MSCs compared to those treated with PBS .

In addition to the prophylactic effects shown above we also tested the effect of hES MSCs treatment on mice that had already developed EAE post disease onset . When hES MSCs were injected on day 18 post immunization we observed a gradual decline in disease scores from 3.0 down to an average score of 1.67 by day 30 in hES MSCs treated mice whereas the PBS treated EAE mice showed an average score of 2.8 by day 30 . Collectively data presented in show that hES MSCs can reproducibly decrease disease severity both prophylactically and therapeutically in the EAE model.

Additionally control experiments demonstrated that hES MSCs but not parental hESCs attenuated cumulative and maximal disease scores in EAE mice. Cumulative and maximal disease scores during the course of 28 32 days were compared for mice administered hES cells CT2 hES MSC CT2 hES MSC H9 and hES MSC MA09 as well as negative controls administered PBS only . N 5. Cumulative and maximal disease scores were similar for hES CT2 administered mice and negative controls. Cumulative and maximal disease scores were significantly lower for each group of mice that were administered hES MSC compared to negative controls P

Some reports suggest that MSCs transplanted into animals may undergo malignant transformation or support tumor growth formed by host cells Djouad et al. 2003 Wong 2011 . Yet since short term cytokine secretion and cell cell contact may be sufficient to exert MSC functions Uccelli and Prockop 2010 we hypothesized that irradiated MSCs may still provide an anti EAE effect. To test this hypothesis we irradiated hES MSCs at 80 Gy immediately before injecting cells into EAE mice at day 6 post immunization. We observed comparable anti EAE effects to the non irradiated hES MSC groups when we used 2 10cells mouse of irradiated cells . To test the actual lifespan of injected cells we transduced CT2 hESCs with the lentiviral luciferase expressing vector Pomper et al. 2009 and generated a stable luciferase positive hESC MSC line. Stable luciferase expression was confirmed by immunostaining not shown . We found that both the irradiated and non irradiated hES MSCs had roughly the same lifespan of 7 10 days in the mice .

Teratogenicity is an additional concern for any therapeutic cell type differentiated from pluripotent cells. To assess this risk we injected hES MSCs into immunodeficient SCID beige mice at 1 10cells mouse and found no tumor formation at the injection sites within 2 months whereas teratomas formed in mice injected with the same dose of parental hESCs data not shown .

Given the reported variability in in vivo efficacy of BM MSCs we decided to compare hES MSCs and human BM MSCs in the prophylactic EAE model. We obtained MSCs from 6 different BM donors and found 5 out of the 6 failed to significantly attenuate the disease score of EAE mice B and GFP expressing BM MSCs while one BM MSC line BM MSC 6 showed a moderate effect . This is in marked contrast to the four different hES MSC lines that all showed a strong anti EAE effect and GFP expressing hES MSCs .

EAE MS is accompanied by infiltration of reactive T cells into the CNS McFarland and Martin 2007 . Therefore we purified all T cells that had penetrated into the CNS and found that hES MSC injected mice had significantly fewer CD4 and CD8 T cell infiltrates than PBS control EAE mice coinciding with their reduction of disease severity. In contrast BM MSC treated mice had the opposite effect and actually displayed significantly more CD4 and slightly more CD8 T cell infiltrates than PBS control EAE mice. The percentage of total numbers of CD4 and CD8 cells in the CNS of EAE mice treated with PBS hESC or hES MSCs was determined on day 15 post immunization. Lymphocytes purified from the CNS were analyzed for numbers of CD4 and CD8 cells by flow cytometry N 4 . The number of Th17 expressing cells was significantly reduced P

Considering the important role of regulatory T cells Tcells detected as CD4 Foxp3 and CD25 in suppressing inflammation we examined the ratio of Tcells among infiltrated CD4 T cells in the CNS and found no difference in hES MSC treated vs control EAE mice. Influence of hES MSCs or BM MSCs on regulatory T cell populations in vivo and in vitro was examined by flow cytometry and percentage of Foxp3 CD25 cells among infiltrated CD4 T cells in the CNS of EAE mice treated with hES MSCs CT2 or PBS was determined. In PBS treated animals 5.17 of cells were Foxp3 only 11.5 of cells were CD25 only and 21.7 of cells were both Foxp3 and CD25. In hES MSC treated animals 1.52 of cells were Foxp3 only 13.1 of cells were CD25 only and 17.2 of cells were both Foxp3 and CD25. This is similar to a previous report on murine BM MSCs in EAE Zappia et al. 2005 . In vitro both hES and BM MSCs increased Tcell proliferation but there was no remarkable difference between the two groups. Human PBMC were co cultured with mitotically inactivated hES MSCs MA09 n 6 or BM MSCs n 5 at a ratio of 1 10 and IL 2 at 30 IU ml for 4 days. Percentages of Tcells were determined via flow cytometry staining for CD4 CD25 Foxp3 cells and were less than 0.5 for T cells without IL 2 about 1.5 for T cells cultured with IL 2 about 5 for T cells cultured with hES MSC and IL 2 p

We next compared hES MSCs and BM MSCs for their ability to inhibit T cell proliferation in vitro. We stimulated carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester CFSE labeled mouse na ve T cells with increasing amounts of anti CD3 antibody and found that hES MSCs inhibited the proliferation of mouse CD4 and CD8 T cells when stimulated with anti CD3 antibody at 0.2 and 0.6 g ml or 0.1 and 0.3 g ml whereas BM MSCs only did so at low doses i.e. 0.2 or 0.1 g ml of anti CD3 antibody. hES MSCs were observed to have stronger suppression of T cell functions in vitro than BM MSCs. hES MA09 or BM MSCs were incubated with CFSE labeled mouse lymphocytes at a ratio of 1 10 and stimulated by various concentrations of anti CD3 antibody. The ratios of proliferating CD4 and CD8 T cell were analyzed by flow cytometry N 3 . Flow cytometry histogram plots were carried out to show the percentage of divided CD4 or CD8 T cells with diluted CFSE signal.

Similarly hES MSCs showed stronger inhibition than BM MSCs on proliferation of human T cells among phytohaemagglutinin PHA stimulated human peripheral blood mononucleocytes PBMCs . Mitotically inactivated hES MA09 or BM MSCs were incubated with PHA stimulated human PBMCs at a ratio of 1 6. The percentage of proliferating CD4 or CD8 cells was measured with BrdU incorporation and the mean of 4 independent experiments was determined. The percentage of BrdU human T cells was approximately 0 for T cells only 30 for T cells only plus PHA about 15 for T cells plus hES MSC plus PHA and about 25 for T cells plus BM MSC plus PHA. The difference in percentage of BrdU positive T cells was statistically significant between T cells incubated with hES MSC or BM MSC P

Since EAE mice treated with BM MSCs had more Th1 and Th17 cell infiltration in the CNS than mice treated with hES MSCs we examined these T cell subtypes in vitro in the presence or absence of hES and BM MSCs. Under the Th1 condition differentiation of na ve CD4 T cells into Th1 CD4 IFN cells was reduced by hES MSCs but was unaffected or even enhanced by different BM MSC lines. In these experiments hES MA09 or BM MSCs were incubated with mouse na ve CD4 T cells at a ratio of 1 10 followed by Th1 or Th17 differentiation for 5 days. IFN and IL 17 CD4 T cells were detected via intracellular flow cytometry staining after TPA ionomycin stimulation and results were obtained from four independent experiments. Under Th1 condition the fraction of CD4 IFN double positive cells was 29.7 in controls 18.0 for hES MSC 26.9 for BM MSC 2 43.6 for BM MSC 3 and 33.6 for BM MSC 6. Of note even the BM MSC line that gave a modest therapeutic response in the EAE model BM MSC 6 could not effectively reduce Th1 differentiation in this in vitro assay. Under the Th17 differentiation condition both hES and BM MSCs reduced the differentiation of Th17 CD4 IL17 cells the fraction of IFN IL17 cells was 21.4 5.15 1.13 2.73 and 2.20 for control hES MSC BM MSC 2 BM MSC 3 and BM MSC 6 respectively. However under the same Th17 inducing conditions BM MSCs but not hES MSCs significantly increased the percentage of IFN IL17 i.e. Th1 cells the fraction of IFN IL17 cells was 0.190 0.611 17.7 12.1 and 14.2 for control hES MSC BM MSC 2 BM MSC 3 and BM MSC 6 respectively. Collectively these results show that hES MSCs effectively dampen both Th1 and Th17 differentiation cascades in vitro while BM MSCs can surprisingly promote Th1 differentiation under a Th17 inducing environment.

BM MSCs Express Higher IL 6 than hES MSCs and IL 6 Blockage Enhances the Immunosuppressive Effect of BM MSCs

A large number of soluble or matrix factors have been reported to mediate the immunomodulatory and or neuroprotective effects of MSCs Uccelli and Prockop 2010 . Therefore we conducted microarray analysis to identify differences in the expression of these factors between BM MSCs and hES MSCs. The overall expressional profiles of hES and BM MSCs samples were quite similar data not shown yet a small set of genes was expressed differentially. Among these IL6 appeared to be much more highly expressed in BM MSCs than in hES MSCs. Multiple methods including qRT PCR intracellular flow cytometry and cytokine antibody arrays confirmed this finding. By qRT PCR the average of three independent experiments demonstrated that the relative normalized expression of IL 6 was about 0.05 for hES MSC and about 1.0 for BM MSC p

Upon IFN stimulation the percentage of IL 6 expressing hES MSCs did not change however the percentage of IL6 expressing cells BM MSCs nearly doubled as determined by intracellular flow cytometry which showed the percentage of IL6 expressing cells IFN 10 ng ml for 12 h . We also tested MSC production of IL6 following co culture with stimulated PBMCs T cells as the latter produces high levels of IFN and TNF upon stimulation. After removing the PBMCs in suspension much higher IL 6 expression was detected via qRT PCR in the adherent BM MSCs than in the adherent hES MSCs. Specifically the IL 6 level in BM MSCs but not hES MSCs MA09 was dramatically enhanced following co culture with non adherent human PBMCs for 4 days. In these experiments 2.5 ng ml PHA was added for the final 2 days. PBMCs were washed away and qRT PCR was used to determine IL 6 expression normalized to GAPDH. Relative normalized IL 6 gene expression for hES MSC with PHA stimulated T cells was about 3 but was about 25 for BM MSC treated in the same manner. When incubated with unstimulated T cells relative normalized IL 6 gene expression was about 1 for hES MSC and about 2 for BM MSC.

Since IL 6 has been found to enhance T cell survival and differentiation Dienz and Rincon 2009 we sought to determine the effects of MSC secreted human IL6 on mouse T cell differentiation. Under Th0 conditions i.e. without mouse cytokines plus anti mouse IFN and anti mouse IL4 co culture with three different BM MSC samples including BM MSC 6 was found to enhance the percentage of IFN secreting CD4 T cells Th1 cells while hES MSCs had no effect for Th0 condition plus IgGkappa the percentage of CD4 IFN was 3.22 3.57 39.4 41.6 and 36.8 in controls hES MSC BM MSC 2 BM MSC 3 and BM MSC 6 treated cells respectively. An anti human IL 6 neutralizing antibody reduced this BM MSC effect by 23 50 . Specifically for TH0 condition plus anti IL 6 the percentage of CD4 IFN was 2.89 0.672 26.7 21.4 and 28.2 in controls hES MSC BM MSC 2 BM MSC 3 and BM MSC 6 treated cells respectively. Thus elevated IL 6 production may be at least partially responsible for the compromised anti EAE effects of BM MSCs by promoting pro inflammatory differentiation of T cells.

Both hES MSCs and BM MSCs Home to Spinal Cord but Only hES MSCs Successfully Extravasate into the Inflamed Tissue

To determine if hES and BM MSCs home to the injured CNS and extravasate through the damaged BBB and or BSCB we tracked the migration of MSCs differentiated from the constitutively GFP expressing hESC line Envy Costa et al. 2005 and GFP labeled human BM MSCs Hofstetter et al. 2002 in EAE mice. Cells were injected on day 6 after immunization and spinal cords were analyzed 8 days later a time point when clinical scores for GFP BM MSCs injected mice and PBS controls were 1.5 2.0 and scores for GFP hES MSCs were effectively 0 when comparing average clinical scores on day of spinal cord harvest day 14 post immunization N 3 mice per group . As indicated by 3D reconstruction of confocal z stacks from fluorescently stained spinal cord cryosections while both BM and hES MSCs homed to the injured EAE spinal cord the vascular associations of the two type MSC lines were vastly different. Both parenchymal and meningeal venules were analyzed as leukocytes are thought to first exit from the latter vascular bed during neuroinflammation Bartholomaus et al. 2009 Kivisakk et al. 2003 . The GFP hES MSCs were clearly observed to migrate out from both vessel populations into the perivascular space. With regard to parenchymal vessels hES MSCs also extended well beyond the perivascular space migrating deeper into the parenchymal tissue. hES MSCs also conclusively extravasated across meningeal venules into the subarachnoid space surrounding the spinal parenchyma. In marked contrast GFP BM MSCs appeared to remain closely associated with parenchymal vessels as if trapped inside or not capable of effectively exiting from vessels and migrating into the parenchyma. BM MSCs also failed to show as extensive extravasation from meningeal vessels compared to hES MSC. These observations pinpoint a key difference between hES and BM MSCs in vivo functionality in the EAE model. For the 3D reconstructions 3D confocal datasets from spinal cord cryosections 60 m of MSC injected EAE mice were used. Sections were stained with anti GFP to track MSC anti CD31 to identify endothelial cells and DRAQ5 to label nuclei. Clusters of GFP MSCs were observed in the parenchymal and meningeal venules. GFP DRAQ5 and isolated GFP channels were observed. Isosurface rendered GFP cells highlighted within the selected region of interest ROI were detectable. DISCUSSION

In this study we describe a novel reproducible and highly efficient method for generating hES MSCs and show that hES MSCs derived from multiple hESC lines all significantly attenuate disease scores in a mouse EAE model of MS. In stark contrast human BM MSCs displayed little to no therapeutic activity in the EAE model and limited immunosuppressive effects in vitro as compared to hES MSCs. Mechanistically the superior anti EAE effects of hES MSCs may in part be related to their lower expression of IL6 and greater ability to extravasate the BBB BSCB and migrate into inflamed CNS tissue than their BM MSCs counterparts.

In examining the anti EAE effects of hES MSCs we observed that prophylactic treatment of EAE mice was more effective in attenuating disease scores than therapeutic treatment. This is not surprising since prophylactic treatment may only require MSC immunosuppressive activity while therapeutic intervention may additionally require extensive neural repair and regeneration. hES MSCs may also contribute to neuroregeneration perhaps through recruitment of endogenous progenitors . More effective therapeutic intervention may be possible with larger doses and or repeated injections of cells. Of note irradiated hES MSCs were also effective in reducing EAE disease score and had the same lifespan in vivo as their non irradiated counterparts. Mitotic inactivation through irradiation or mitomycin C treatment is routinely used in mixed leukocyte reaction MLR assays and does not appear to greatly affect MSC cytokine secretion or immunomodulatory activities in these assays Bocelli Tyndall et al. 2007 . Thus irradiation of cells may have important clinical value since being able to reduce the concern for tumorigenic potential may outweigh a slight reduction in potency.

The muted in vivo efficacy of BM MSCs that we observed is consistent with previous reports that showed only mild Gordon et al. 2008 Zhang et al. 2005 or negligible Payne et al. 2012 effects of human BM MSCs on EAE mice. Interestingly BM MSC 6 the one BM MSC line in our studies that caused a modest reduction in EAE clinical scores was injected at passage 2 while the other BM MSCs which showed no effect were used at passage 3 or 4. Despite being injected at later passages p4 6 all hES MSC lines offered large reductions in the clinical score of EAE mice. This suggests that the therapeutic potency of BM MSCs is more sensitive to in vitro culture and expansion a requirement for clinical scale use than that of hES MSCs. Indeed other studies have shown that BM MSCs have lower proliferative capacity than do hES MSCs Sanchez et al. 2011 and may readily senesce with even limited culturing Wagner et al. 2008 . While we did not observe massive senescence or changes in immunophenotype in BM MSC cultures by passage 4 data not shown identifying biomarkers that accurately predict the in vivo functionality of MSCs is an ongoing area of investigation in our lab and others.

In our search for molecular differences between hES and BM MSCs we found that IL 6 was expressed much higher in BM MSCs than in hES MSCs in both the basal and IFN stimulated state. Elevated IL 6 levels have been found in blood and brain tissue from MS patients Patanella et al. 2010 while site specific production of IL 6 in the CNS can re target and enhance inflammation in EAE Quintana et al. 2009 . Interestingly mice lacking IL 6 receptor at the time of T cell priming are resistant to EAE Leech et al. 2012 and an IL 6 neutralizing antibody can reduce symptoms in EAE mice Gijbels et al. 1995 . As discussed further below high levels of IL 6 may contribute to functional differences between BM MSCs and hES MSCs in terms of how they influence immune effector cells and how potent they are in a therapeutic setting. Indeed it would be interesting to determine if combined treatment of BM MSCs with an IL 6 neutralizing antibody or use of BM MSCs with IL 6 knockdown enhances the anti EAE effect.

Many studies have reported that MSCs can inhibit the differentiation of both Th1 and Th17 cells yet recent reports have noted that they can actually promote differentiation of pro inflammatory T cells under certain permissive environments Carrion et al. 2011 Darlington et al. 2010 . In vivo and in comparison to PBS controls we observed reduced CNS infiltration of Th1 and Th17 cells with hES MSC treatment but increased CNS infiltration of Th1 and Th17 cells with BM MSC treatment. In vitro and unlike hES MSCs we found that BM MSCs skewed T cell differentiation to a Th1 phenotype under both Th0 non polarizing and Th17 conditions. It is possible that certain factors produced highly by human BM MSCs but not hES MSC can trigger Th1 differentiation thus overriding Th17 differentiation under these artificial in vitro conditions Lazarevic et al. 2011 . An anti human IL 6 antibody was able to partially reverse the effect under Th0 conditions but not Th17 conditions data not shown presumably because the presence of exogenous mouse IL 6 which is added for Th17 induction cannot be neutralized by the anti human IL 6 antibody. Together these suggest that high IL6 secretion by BM MSCs may impact the local cytokine milieu and augment the overall inflammatory response resulting into a striking difference in Th1 Th17 CNS infiltration between hES and BM MSC treated mice. Lastly as the BBB and BSCB show evidence of structural damage and functional impairment in EAE Bennett et al. 2010 it is possible that MSCs at least partially execute their therapeutic effects in this disease by repairing these barriers Pati et al. 2011 . Since both GFP labeled hES and BM MSC homed to the CNS while only hES MSC showed high therapeutic potential with capacity to effectively extravasate and migrate into the parenchyma we hypothesize therapeutic efficacy and extravasation may be mechanistically linked. That MSCs might need to extravasate during EAE therapy is consistent with evidence these cells can downregulate pro inflammatory effector functions of parenchymal microglia Lee et al. 2012 Sheikh et al. 2011 . It is significant that in vitro culture and expansion of MSCs have both been implicated as factors that impair homing and transendothelial migration De Becker et al. 2007 Rombouts and Ploemacher 2003 . A priori it may be that BM MSCs are more sensitive to these factors than hES MSCs and this is a determinant of the differences in therapeutic efficacy observed between the two MSC types. A variety of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors including 4 1 4 7 integrins and several CXCRs and CCRs that are involved in leukocyte transmigration may also participate in MSC transmigration Chamberlain et al. 2011 . However MSC extravasation may involve additional or unique mechanisms Teo et al. 2012 especially in the context of breaching the BBB and BSCB. Determining the dynamic changes and differences in expression of these molecules between hES and BM MSCs in situ will be critical in delineating the molecular requirements for MSC extravasation. In situ gene profiling of both MSC types is currently in play and should further shed light on the mechanism s responsible for the unique therapeutic efficacy of hES MSCs.

 NZB NZW F1 BWF1 lupus prone mice were treated with hESC derived MSCs either in one single dose of 2 10cells or in two doses of 0.5 10cells per dose with second dose being administered two weeks after the first day 0 . The rate of survival of hESC MSC treated mice was compared to control animals. The hESC treated and control animal cohorts included 20 animals each. As shown in forty percent 40 of the control animals were deceased within 50 days while the animals treated with the hESC derived MSCs had a substantially improved rate of survival in comparison 95 100 survival at 50 days . Relative to the control group the animals treated with hESC derived MSCs also showed a higher average weight after 7 weeks post treatment as well as increases in CD4 Foxp3 T cells and Regulatory T cells in peripheral blood samples. As shown in mice treated with the hESC derived MSCs also had substantially lower levels of proteinuria presence of an excess of serum proteins in the urine relative to the control group.
