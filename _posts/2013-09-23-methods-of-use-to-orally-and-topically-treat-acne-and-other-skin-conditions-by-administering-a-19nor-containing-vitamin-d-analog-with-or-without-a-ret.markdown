Natural and synthetic retinoid compounds have been used to treat a variety of hyperproliferative skin disorders as well as other skin disorders including for example acne psoriasis wrinkling sun damaged skin and age spots. See Fox L P et al. Section XIII Dermatology 11th Ed. In many cases retinoids have been applied topically. Retinoic acid has also been administered orally to treat severe cases of acne. For example Accutane contains 13 cis retinoic acid also referred to as isotretinoin which is related to both retinoic acid and retinol i.e. vitamin A. See p. 1288 1289 21Ed. . Accutane has been approved for treating nodular acne by administering oral pharmacologic dosages of 0.5 to 2.0 mg kg day which inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization.

Retinoids are natural and synthetic compounds that are structurally related to vitamin A. All trans retinol is the major circulating form of vitamin A. It is oxidized in the body first to all trans retinaldehyde and then to all trans retinoic acid atRA . Blomhoff et al. 199212 37 57 and Moise et al. 200746 4449 4458 . atRA is the functional form of the vitamin that regulates growth cellular differentiation and embryonic development whereas all trans retinaldehyde functions in the visual cycle. Clagett Dame et al. 200222 347 381 . Because atRA is such a potent regulatory molecule it is formed in very small amounts and it is rapidly metabolized such that its half life is relatively short. Roberts et al. 1967102 600 605 .

Systemic administration of retinoids has also been indicated for diseases such as pityriasis rubra pilaris condylomata accuminata skin cancers rosacea hidradenitis suppurativa granuloma annular lupus erythematosus and lichen planus. Akyol M et al. 20066 3 175 184 .

Topical administration of retinoids has been limited largely due to side effects such as skin irritation e.g. redness and burning dryness and photosensitivity reactions. Akhavan et al. 20034 473 492 . Oral administration of retinoids has been even more limited due to more serious side effects such as teratogenicity e.g. fetal malformation elevation of triglyceride cholesterol and transaminase levels bone demineralization and other side effects associated with topical administration e.g. drying of mucosal membranes and photosensitivity . Armstrong et al. 1994 pp. 545 572 and DiGiovanna 200145 S176 S182 . Such numerous and varied sided effects have substantially limited the medical and pharmaceutical use of retinoids particularly those related to skin therapies.

It is believed that retinoic acid and other synthetic retinoids bind to and regulate the transcriptional activity of a family of nuclear proteins known as the retinoic acid receptors RARs . Chambon 199610 940 954 Clagett Dame et al. 19977 299 342 and Mark et al. 200646 451 480 . All trans retinoic acid is the endogenous ligand for the RAR family of receptors. The 13 cis retinoic acid isomer does not bind to the RARs. Repa J J et al. 199390 7293 7297 . The 13 cis retinoic acid isomer must isomerize to all trans retinoic acid that is active in terms of receptor binding and activation.

It has been reported that the active hormonal form of vitamin D i.e. calcitriol and various synthetic analogs thereof demonstrate differentiative antiproliferative and immunomodulatory activity. Such compounds have also demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in treating skin disease such as psoriasis. See Smith E L et al 198819 516 528 and Holick M F 1989125 1692 1697 . It is also been reported that calcitriol and therapeutic analogs thereof are used to target the nuclear vitamin D receptor. DeLuca H F 2004. Suppl 1689S 1696S . It is believed that calcitriol and therapeutic analogs thereof may act directly within the epidermis on basal keratinocytes and Langerhans cells as well as on other cells within the immune system. The use of calcitriol and various synthetic analogs at therapeutic dosages is further limited by side effects such as hypercalcemia hypercalcuria and calcification of soft tissues.

Recently a new class of vitamin D analogs referred to as 19 nor vitamin D compounds has been discovered. 19 Nor vitamin D compounds are characterized by replacement of the A ring exocyclic methylene group at the 19 carbon in typical vitamin D molecules with two hydrogens. Further substitution at the 2 position and or modification of the side chain at 17 carbon of the five membered ring has yielded pharmacologically active compounds that are much less calcemic at physiologically active concentrations as compared to the native hormone. Plum L. A. et al. 101 18 6900 9004 2004 . Some 19 nor containing vitamin D analogs have also exhibited enhanced potency and tissue selectivity activities suggesting that such analogs may have important therapeutic advantages over the native vitamin D hormone or other less selective and or non selective analogs. See Sicinski R R et al. 1998 41 4662 4674 and Shevde N K et al. 200299 21 13487 13491 .

Acne is a condition of the pilosebaceous unit. Acne involves a spectrum of effects including non inflammatory comedones inflammatory papules pustules and cysts. When administered topically or systemically retinoids cause epidermal hyperproliferation leading to comedolysis and improvement of the disease. See Fisher G J et al. 1996 Molecular Mechanisms of Retinoid Actions in the Skin 10 1002 21013 . Although very effective retinoid therapy is substantially limited by the number and extent of side effects which are particularly limiting when retinoids are administered orally. See Fox L P et al. 2006 . Thus there is an important and substantial need for retinoid containing therapies having reduced side effects to treat various skin disorders such as acne.

The pharmaceutically suitable topical and oral carrier systems also referred to as drug delivery systems which are modern technology distributed with or as a part of a drug product that allows for the uniform release or targeting of drugs to the body preferably include FDA approved and or USP approved inactive ingredients. Under 21 CFR 210.3 b 8 an inactive ingredient is any component of a drug product other than the active ingredient. According to 21 CFR 210.3 b 7 an active ingredient is any component of a drug product intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease or to affect the structure or any function of the body of humans or other animals. Active ingredients include those components of the product that may undergo chemical change during the manufacture of the drug product and be present in the drug product in a modified form intended to furnish the specified activity or effect. As used herein a kit also referred to as a dosage form is a packaged collection of related material.

As used herein the topical dosage form includes various dosage forms known in the art such as lotions an emulsion liquid dosage form whereby this dosage form is generally for external application to the skin lotion augmented a lotion dosage form that enhances drug delivery whereby augmentation does not refer to the strength of the drug in the dosage form gels a semisolid dosage form that contains a gelling agent to provide stiffness to a solution or a colloidal dispersion whereby the gel may contain suspended particles ointments a semisolid dosage form usually containing 50 hydrocarbons waxes or polyols as the vehicle whereby this dosage form is generally for external application to the skin or mucous membranes ointment augmented an ointment dosage form that enhances drug delivery whereby augmentation does not refer to the strength of the drug in the dosage form creams an emulsion semisolid dosage form usually containing 20 water and volatiles 5 and or 

The topical dosage form composition contains an active pharmaceutical ingredient and one or more inactive pharmaceutical ingredients such as excipients colorants pigments additives fillers emollients surfactants e.g. anionic cationic amphoteric and nonionic penetration enhancers e.g. alcohols fatty alcohols fatty acids fatty acid esters and polyols and the like. Various FDA approved topical inactive ingredients are found at the FDA s The Inactive Ingredients Database that contains inactive ingredients specifically intended as such by the manufacturer whereby inactive ingredients can also be considered active ingredients under certain circumstances according to the definition of an active ingredient given in 21 CFR 210.3 b 7 . Alcohol is a good example of an ingredient that may be considered either active or inactive depending on the product formulation.

As used herein the oral dosage form includes capsules a solid oral dosage form consisting of a shell and a filling whereby the shell is composed of a single sealed enclosure or two halves that fit together and which are sometimes sealed with a band and whereby capsule shells may be made from gelatin starch or cellulose or other suitable materials may be soft or hard and are filled with solid or liquid ingredients that can be poured or squeezed capsule or coated pellets solid dosage form in which the drug is enclosed within either a hard or soft soluble container or shell made from a suitable form of gelatin the drug itself is in the form of granules to which varying amounts of coating have been applied capsule coated extended release a solid dosage form in which the drug is enclosed within either a hard or soft soluble container or shell made from a suitable form of gelatin additionally the capsule is covered in a designated coating and which releases a drug or drugs in such a manner to allow at least a reduction in dosing frequency as compared to that drug or drugs presented as a conventional dosage form capsule delayed release a solid dosage form in which the drug is

The oral dosage form composition contains an active pharmaceutical ingredient and one or more inactive pharmaceutical ingredients such as diluents solubilizers alcohols binders controlled release polymers enteric polymers disintegrants excipients colorants flavorants sweeteners antioxidants preservatives pigments additives fillers suspension agents surfactants e.g. anionic cationic amphoteric and nonionic and the like. Various FDA approved topical inactive ingredients are found at the FDA s The Inactive Ingredients Database that contains inactive ingredients specifically intended as such by the manufacturer whereby inactive ingredients can also be considered active ingredients under certain circumstances according to the definition of an active ingredient given in 21 CFR 210.3 b 7 . Alcohol is a good example of an ingredient that may be considered either active or inactive depending on the product formulation.

Treatment regimens may also include numerous dosing regimens. A description of acne vulgaris is found in p. 1131. For a human various therapeutically effective doses and dosing regimens thereof may be determined from the animal data set forth herein using known Allometric Scaling AS factors. For example for a mouse having a body weight of 0.03 kg the AS factor is around 7 assuming a human body weight of 70 kg.

The predictive dosing ranges set forth in Tables 1 2 and 3 was calculated assuming that for the high end of the oral dose range the top dose given to the Rhino mouse is corrected for the expected lesser sensitivity of the human and further increased by 0.5 log dose. The low dose is 1 10lower than the high dose. For the high end of the topical dose the value was further multiplied by a factor of 20 as humans absorb only about 5 of the dose compared to 100 by the mouse.

Differences in the animal species sensitivity to various vitamin D analogs as well as differences in relative absorption of various vitamin D analogs by the skin may also significantly affect the human efficacious dose compared to that used in the animal studies detailed herein.

Further there is a synergistic effect by administering a combination of 2MBisP and atRA. The synergistic effect is evidenced by a substantial reduction in comedone size as compared to vehicle alone 2MBisP alone or atRA alone. The synergistic effect is further evidenced by a substantial reduction in comedone size upon administering atRA at a low and previously ineffective dose. By rendering such a low and previously ineffective atRA dose now effective potential side effects caused by administration of atRA can be minimized or avoided.

Animals and dose administration. Rhino mice 6 10 weeks old were dosed via the oral and or topical route. In the majority of studies the mice were dosed daily. In one topical study the efficacy of daily versus intermittent Monday Wednesday Friday dosing was compared. The mice were weighed three times per week and doses were adjusted weekly based on body weight. The topical formulations were applied to the back of the animal in a maximum volume of 110 L. The topical formulations were made by mixing the APIs with a topical carrier comprising 70 vol propylene glycol and 30 vol ethanol or 30 vol propylene glycol and 70 vol ethanol as indicated. The topical vehicle control was the vehicle carrier solution matched to the formulation containing API and vehicle carrier.

The oral formulation was made by mixing the APIs with Wesson soybean oil or NeoBee oil. The oral dose was delivered to the back of the mouth of each mouse. Mice were sacrificed 4 hours after the final oral dose and 72 hours after the final topical dose. At sacrifice the dorsal skin was collected for histological studies.

Comedolytic effect. The extent of the comedolytic effect i.e. efficacy was assessed by measuring the average area of the comedones whereby the smaller the area the larger the effect. The comedone area was determined by histological analysis of tissue sections based on a method developed in our lab see . Skin was fixed overnight in 4 paraformaldehyde at 4 deg. C. with gentle agitation and dehydrated the next day into 100 methanol. Samples were embedded in paraffin and a total of nine 10 micron sections 150 microns apart were prepared from each Rhino mouse. Five of the nine sections were digitally imaged 6 magnification for comedone analysis using Metamorph Imaging Software trace function . The perimeter of each comedone on the images taken from the 5 sections was then traced using a Wacom Intuos 3 Graphics Tablet interfaced with the software. The number of pixels comprising the area of each individual comedone was obtained and transferred to an Excel spreadsheet and the mean number of pixels per comedone was obtained for each Rhino mouse. For comedones that were completely healed area 0 a pixel value approaching 0 

Preparation of oral dosing solutions containing 2MBisP CAGE 3 24R 2MD VitIII 17 20E and NEL. Separate concentrated stocks of 2MBisP CAGE 3 24R 2MD VitIII 17 20E and NEL were obtained in ethanol. The concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient 42 000 and a 252.7. Oral dosing solutions were prepared by adding the appropriate volume of the ethanolic solution to oil NeoBee or Wesson whereby the final concentration of ethanol does not exceed 5 vol . The final dose was delivered in 50 L of oil.

Separate concentrated ethanolic stocks of 2MBisP CAGE 3 24R 2MD VitIII 17 20E and NEL were diluted to a final concentration containing 70 vol propylene glycol and 30 vol ethanol or 30 vol propylene glycol and 70 vol ethanol as the excipient carrier system. The mixture was thoroughly mixed. The topical dosing formulation delivered the desired dosing amount of drug on a per kilogram body weight basis. A dose ranging from 100 110 L in volume was administered to the back of the mouse. An average weight of 24 or 30 g mouse was assumed in dose volume calculations. Dosing volumes were adjusted weekly to deliver the desired dosing amount of API based on the body weight of each individual animal.

Preparation of oral atRA dosing formulation. A concentrated stock solution containing atRA was prepared in dichloromethane. The atRA concentrated stock solution was diluted into ethanol. The concentration of atRA in that diluted stock solution was determined spectrophotometrically whereby the molar extinction coefficient 45 200 and 350. The purity of atRA was determined to be 99 by HPLC. The appropriate volume of atRA was added to Wesson Oil the sample was mixed and the residual dichloromethane was removed by flushing the oil with argon for 3 hours under a vapor hood. The final dose was delivered orally using 50 L of oil.
