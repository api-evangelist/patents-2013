Another embodiment of the invention provides processes for making the novel compounds of the invention and to the intermediates useful in such processes. The reactions are performed in solvents appropriate to the reagents and materials used are suitable for the transformations being effected. It is understood by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the functionality present in the molecule must be consistent with the chemical transformation proposed. This will on occasion necessitate judgment by the routineer as to the order of synthetic steps protecting groups required and deprotection conditions.

Substituents on the starting materials may be incompatible with some of the reaction conditions required in some of the methods described but alternative methods and substituents compatible with the reaction conditions will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art. The use of sulfur and oxygen protecting groups is well known for protecting thiol and alcohol groups against undesirable reactions during a synthetic procedure and many such protecting groups are known and described by for example Greene and Wuts Third Edition John Wiley Sons New York 1999 .

The chemical reactions described herein are generally disclosed in terms of their broadest application to the preparation of the compounds of this invention. Occasionally the reactions may not be applicable as described to each compound included within the disclosed scope. The compounds for which this occurs will be readily recognized by one skilled in the art. In all such cases either the reactions can be successfully performed by conventional modifications known to one skilled in the art e.g. by appropriate protection of interfering groups by changing to alternative conventional reagents by routine modification of reaction conditions and the like or other reactions disclosed herein or otherwise conventional will be applicable to the preparation of the corresponding compounds of this invention. In all preparative methods all starting materials are known or readily prepared from known starting materials.

The amino acid esters compounds may be based on natural and modified amino acids with side chain as presented herein. Any of the amino acids and their side chains could be modified at various reactive sites such for example carbon amide amine carboxy oxo thio hydroxyl sites with extra attachments as are known in the art. Such attachments may include CH CH O CH OCH and other modifications well known in the art. These attachments may for example alter uptake crossing of the blood brain barrier when a glycosidic linkage is made to the amide or other potentials applications. Also the more lipophilic modifications may be used for transdermal crossing applications which include but are not limited to anti aging of the skin.

The amino acid ester compounds are nitrosated and or nitrosylated through one or more sites such as oxygen sulfur and or nitrogen using conventional methods known to one skilled in the art.

The methods of nitrosating and or nitrosylating the compounds described in these references can be applied by one skilled in the art to produce any of the nitrosated and or nitrosylated amino acid ester compounds described herein. The nitrosated and or nitrosylated amino acid ester compounds of the invention donate transfer or release a biologically active form of nitrogen monoxide i.e. nitric oxide .

Nitrogen monoxide can exist in three forms NO nitroxyl NO uncharged nitric oxide and NO nitrosonium . NO is a highly reactive short lived species that is potentially toxic to cells. This is critical because the pharmacological efficacy of NO depends upon the form in which it is delivered. In contrast to the nitric oxide radical NO nitrosonium NO does not react with Oor O species and functionalities capable of transferring and or releasing NO and NO are also resistant to decomposition in the presence of many redox metals. Consequently administration of charged NO equivalents positive and or negative is a more effective means of delivering a biologically active NO to the desired site of action.

Compounds contemplated for use in the invention e.g. amino acid ester compounds that contain nitric oxide releasing group linked through one or more sites such as oxygen hydroxyl condensation sulfur and or nitrogen are optionally used in combination with nitric oxide and compounds that release nitric oxide or otherwise directly or indirectly deliver or transfer a biologically active form of nitrogen monoxide to a site of its intended activity such as on a cell membrane in vivo.

Polymeric matrix patches also comprise a polymeric matrix forming material. Suitable transdermal patches are described in more detail in for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 262 165 5 948 433 6 010 715 and 6 071 531.

Solid dosage forms for oral administration can include capsules sustained release capsules tablets sustained release tablets chewable tablets sublingual tablets effervescent tablets pills powders granules and gels. In such solid dosage forms the active compounds can be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose lactose or starch. Such dosage forms can also comprise as in normal practice additional substances other than inert diluents e.g. lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules tablets effervescent tablets and pills the dosage forms can also comprise buffering agents. Soft gelatin capsules can be prepared to contain a mixture of the active compounds or compositions of the invention and vegetable oil. Hard gelatin capsules can contain granules of the active compound in combination with a solid pulverulent carrier such as lactose saccharose sorbitol mannitol potato starch corn starch amylopectin cellulose derivatives of gelatin. Tablets and pills can be prepared with enteric coatings.

Liquid dosage forms for oral administration can include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions solutions suspensions syrups and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art such as water. Such compositions can also comprise adjuvants such as wetting agents emulsifying and suspending agents and sweetening flavoring and perfuming agents.

Suppositories for vaginal or rectal administration of the compounds and compositions of the invention such as for treating pediatric fever and the like can be prepared by mixing the compounds or compositions with a suitable nonirritating excipient such as cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols which are solid at room temperature but liquid at rectal temperature such that they will melt in the rectum and release the drug.

Injectable preparations for example sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions can be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing agents wetting agents and or suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent for example as a solution in 1 3 butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be used are water Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution.

The compositions of this invention can further include conventional excipients i.e. pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic carrier substances suitable for parenteral application which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include for example water salt solutions alcohol vegetable oils polyethylene glycols gelatin lactose amylose magnesium stearate talc surfactants silicic acid viscous paraffin perfume oil fatty acid monoglycerides and diglycerides petroethral fatty acid esters hydroxymethyl cellulose polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like. The pharmaceutical preparations can be sterilized and if desired mixed with auxiliary agents e.g. lubricants preservatives stabilizers wetting agents emulsifiers salts for influencing osmotic pressure buffers colorings flavoring and or aromatic substances and the like which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds. For parenteral application particularly suitable vehicles consist of solutions preferably oily or aqueous solutions as well as suspensions emulsions or implants. Aqueous suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension and include for example sodium carboxymethyl cellulose sorbitol and or dextran. Optionally the suspension may also contain stabilizers.

The composition if desired can also contain minor amounts of wetting agents emulsifying agents and or pH buffering agents. The composition can be a liquid solution suspension emulsion tablet pill capsule sustained release formulation or powder. The composition can be formulated as a suppository with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulations can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol lactose starch magnesium stearate sodium saccharine cellulose magnesium carbonate and the like.

Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer the compounds or compositions of the invention including for example encapsulation in liposomes microbubbles emulsions microparticles microcapsules and the like. The required dosage can be administered as a single unit or in a sustained release form.

The bioavailability of the compositions can be enhanced by micronization of the formulations using conventional techniques such as grinding milling spray drying and the like in the presence of suitable excipients or agents such as phospholipids or surfactants.

Sustained release dosage forms of the invention may comprise microparticles and or nanoparticles having a therapeutic agent dispersed therein or may comprise the therapeutic agent in pure preferably crystalline solid form. For sustained release administration microparticle dosage forms comprising pure preferably crystalline therapeutic agents are preferred. The therapeutic dosage forms of this aspect of the invention may be of any configuration suitable for sustained release.

Nanoparticle sustained release therapeutic dosage forms are preferably biodegradable and optionally bind to the vascular smooth muscle cells and enter those cells primarily by endocytosis. The biodegradation of the nanoparticles occurs over time e.g. 30 to 120 days or 10 to 21 days in prelysosomic vesicles and lysosomes. Preferred larger microparticle therapeutic dosage forms of the invention release the therapeutic agents for subsequent target cell uptake with only a few of the smaller microparticles entering the cell by phagocytosis. A practitioner in the art will appreciate that the precise mechanism by which a target cell assimilates and metabolizes a dosage form of the invention depends on the morphology physiology and metabolic processes of those cells. The size of the particle sustained release therapeutic dosage forms is also important with respect to the mode of cellular assimilation. For example the smaller nanoparticles can flow with the interstitial fluid between cells and penetrate the infused tissue. The larger microparticles tend to be more easily trapped interstitiall y in the infused primary tissue and thus are useful to deliver anti proliferative therapeutic agents.

Particular sustained release dosage forms of the invention comprise biodegradable microparticles or nanoparticles.

A novel nitric oxide universal donor consisting of an amino acid ester molecule or of an acetylated methylated or modified amino acid ester molecule linked by an ester linkage to 3 nitrooxymethyl phenyl has been developed. This molecule can not only be used alone as a nitric oxide releasing drug for such applications as the prophylaxis of acute angina pectoris but also in combination with a large number of drug molecules such as aspirin or naproxen for example to either enhance functionality or mitigate side effects or to produce other positive effects mediated by nitric oxide release and increased physiological levels.

C2 and C3 derivatives of the amino acid ethyl esters are developed to produce an ester linkage at the COOH with O NOthru either the ethyl or propyl groups. There are many different possibilities to block the NHof the amino acid ester molecule such as the use of malate hydroxycitronate citrate glycerol and digylcerol for example. Many different moieties are linked to the anhydride group. The amino acid ethyl ester was used as the most desirable due to solvent choice and final lipophilicity stability and absorption for sublingual delivery.

It is well known that the mononitration of alcohols can be usually carried out with concentrated nitric acid. Thus 2 hydroxyethyl nitrate nitrooxyethanol a known compound was prepared through the reaction of concentrated nitric acid and 1 2 ethanediol. The reaction was carefully monitored and the product was extracted washed dried and directly used in the following reaction.

The ester formation can be achieved with different reagents such as commonly used DCC and EDC. Different conditions have been used and the following is one specific example.

To the reactor 2 hydroxyethyl nitrate 8 kg was added followed by dichloromethane 25 L . Then boc L valine 12.5 kg was added slowly under stirring and the reaction mixture was cooled down to 10 C. Afterwards DMAP 50 g was added as the catalyst and DCC 12.5 kg dissolved in 5 L of dichloromethame was slowly added dropwise to the mixture under 10 C. The reaction was continued for another 5 hours at temperature between 10 and 0 under continuous stirring while insoluble white solid was gradually formed. The reaction mixture was then warmed up slowly to room temperature and the reaction was continued for another 12 hours at room temperature. At the end the reaction mixture was filtered and the filtrate was washed with water and dried to yield the crude nitrooxyethyl boc valinate that was used directly in the next step.

Add ethyl acetate 25 L and hydrochloride 9 L separately to the product of Step 2 crude nitrooxyethyl boc valinate and the mixture was stirred for 10 hours. After the reaction concentrated sodium hydroxide was added dropwise to adjust the pH to 9 under strong stirring. The mixture was then separated and the organic phase was washed with saturated NaCl solution 10 L a few times.

Due to the nature of the product nitrooxyethyl valinate the solution obtained at Step 3 was purified by a series of acid base treatments and each step was monitored the final organic phase was washed with saturated NaCl solution a few times and dried o ver MgSOpowder and filtered. The filtrate solution was then dried by rotary evaporation to yield light yellowish oil as the final product 8 kg .

The product nitrooxyethyl valinate has an amino group in its structure thus it can form all kinds of salts with different acids. These acids include organic acids such as acetic acid and inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid. Such a salt may be further purified by re crystallization.

The nitro amino acid esters can be derived from the NHlinkage to form amides or from the carboxyl end to derive esters. Also they can even be both on the same double hybrid molecule. The reactions are through mononitrate intermediates such as nitroacetylchloride for the amide linkage and simple ester linkages on the carboxyl.
