In other embodiments the computer implemented method comprises monitoring on one or more computers the data accuracy of the received record as compared to the golden record over a time period. In exemplary implementations thresholds for the data accuracy are defined and a data steward for the source system is notified that the received record deviates from the golden record so that the data steward is prompted to perform the remediation actions. In further embodiments the computer implemented method comprises normalizing or standardizing on one or more computers attributes of the received record.

Many enterprise systems e.g. core banking systems patient registration systems sales and servicing applications are built to actively manage their data. These systems contain various data sources and or operational applications where different sets of master data are created and maintained. Thus master data is often widely distributed across multiple enterprise systems and departmental applications. Master data management MDM systems or data hubs are designed to validate store and manage the data from multiple source systems. Such MDM systems can cleanse match link merge and semantically reconcile master entities from different data sources to create and maintain a golden entity record golden record .

It is also important that MDM systems proliferate the golden record back to the data sources and operational applications to improve and maintain the accuracy quality of the master data within the data sources and operational applications. Without such an accuracy remediation process sources and applications containing master data that is inconsistent with the golden record will continue to contain poor quality master data. The uncertainties associated with such poor quality inconsistent master data negatively impacts reliant business processes and decision making.

The present invention provides systems and methods for measuring monitoring and improving the accuracy of source data i.e. data accuracy in particular source system master data. is a flow chart illustrating exemplary process steps that can be used to practice one or more embodiments of the present invention. In a computer implemented method is provided for processing data.

In block a record having one or more attributes is received on one or more computers from a source system. In one or more embodiments the record is master data from a source system.

In block the data accuracy of the received record is measured on one or more computers as compared to a golden record stored in a master data management system. In one or more embodiments a probabilistic matching algorithm is used for data quality assessment which utilizes the golden record as the benchmark i.e. best approximation to the actual value for assessing the data accuracy. In further embodiments measurement of data accuracy comprises calculating on one or more computers an accuracy score defined by the closeness of the received record to the golden record. In one exemplary implementation the accuracy score is calculated by dividing a source to golden score by a golden record self score. The source to golden score is computed on one or more computers by comparing the received record to the golden record. The golden record self score is computed on one or more computers by matching the golden record on itself. In another embodiment attributes of the received record are compared to attributes of the golden record while taking into account synonymous values anonymous values and the likelihood that some attribute values may be slightly different due to attribute variability. In an exemplary implementation the accuracy score is calculated for all selected attributes. In further embodiments attributes of the received record are normalized or standardized. The definition of record accuracy may also be customized for the accuracy score by introducing relative importance weights for different attributes.

In block one or more remediation actions are performed on one or more computers to enforce improvements to the measured data accuracy of the received record in the source system. In one or more other embodiments the computer implemented method comprises generating on one or more computers one or more reports on the data accuracy. The detailed reports may be used for accuracy score monitoring. In other embodiments the computer implemented method comprises monitoring on one or more computers the data accuracy of the received record as compared to the golden record over a time period. In exemplary implementations thresholds for the data accuracy are defined and a data steward for the source system is notified when a received record deviates from the golden record so that the data steward can perform a remediation action.

In one aspect of the present invention the system and method measures the accuracy of source system data.

In one or more embodiments estimation of the data accuracy or information quality per data element is accomplished through a binary comparison of the attribute value in a data source with the corresponding benchmark value. The binary comparison yields 1 if the values are exactly equal to each other. The binary comparison yields 0 if the compared values are different.

In one or more other embodiments a slight variation of the binary method is used which includes some simple standardization functions. This addresses possible issues with a strict binary scoring method where even minor deviations in attribute values in the data source compared to the benchmark will result in a data accuracy of 0 . For example if two character strings differ only by leading or trailing zeros the information governance organization may decide to impose a small penalty on this type of deviation e.g. 5 or to not penalize it at all. This type of trivial information quality issues can be systemically addressed at the point of entry. Then there is no need to penalize these issues through data accuracy estimations. The same applies to character case deviations when for example the benchmark uses only capitalized characters while data sources use mixed case characters. The binary comparison method or its simple variations are easy to implement.

In one or more embodiments measurement of data accuracy comprises calculating on one or more computers an accuracy score defined by rating the closeness of the source system record to the golden record. The source accuracy scoring methodology leverages a probabilistic algorithm developed for record matching and applies the algorithm s application programming interfaces APIs as illustrated in . This probabilistic matching algorithm is used to assess the accuracy and quality of data by considering the golden record as the benchmark.

Probabilistic matching measures the statistical likelihood that two records are the same. By rating the matchiness of the two records the probabilistic method is able to find non obvious correlations between data. The correlations drawn offer more flexibility in data analysis because they make fewer assumptions about what is right and what is wrong. It takes into account the frequency of data synonymous values anonymous values and a likelihood that some attribute values are slightly different due to attribute variability e.g. human errors .

In one or more embodiments the accuracy score is calculated by dividing a source to golden score by a golden record self score. The source to golden score is computed on one or more computers by comparing the received record to the golden record to determine the level of similarity between the records. Attributes of the received record are compared to attributes of the golden record. In one embodiment the accuracy score is calculated for all selected attributes. The golden record self score is computed on one or more computers by matching the golden record on itself to determine the level of completeness of the golden record.

One advantage is that the probabilistic matching algorithm is extremely efficient in entity resolution and maintenance. Furthermore the data accuracy measurement method is aligned with the needs of the matching algorithm. Source data accuracy is improved by leveraging the MDM hub which makes use of the probabilistic matching algorithm to compare the source data with the golden record. The same algorithm is also used in computing the golden record. Thus this method provides a standard in how golden records are created and the way source data accuracy is computed.

Furthermore a source to golden comparison score list is created from the source to golden scores for each attribute . For each attribute score from the score list the source to golden comparison score is passed to a source accuracy formula in block . The attribute source accuracy metric is calculated using the source accuracy and persisted in block . The attribute s source accuracy metric is stored in a source accuracy metric repository . Additionally an attribute source to golden consistency metric is determined for each attribute score . All the attribute source accuracy metrics are aggregated in block and the entity s record s source accuracy metric is persisted in block ultimately stored in a source accuracy metric repository .

A source record with the value WILLIAM SMITH is an exact match and thus also has a source to golden score SOURCE TO GOLDEN COMPARISON SCORE of 3.0. Dividing this source to golden score by the golden record self score gives an accuracy score of 1. Multiplying the accuracy score by 100 gives an accuracy score percentage SOURCE ACCURACY of 100 . A source record with the value WILLIAM SMYTH has a character off and thus only has a source to golden score of 2.2. Using the same formula the accuracy score percentage is calculated to only be 73.3 . Furthermore an average accuracy may be calculated for the source records 48.66 .

Additionally the probabilistic matching algorithm provides scores in a range that may be configured to be between a positive number and a negative number. If it cannot relate two data elements by any logic then it provides negative score. This scoring behavior for maximum and minimum scores can be configured depending on the needs of the user. In the source record BILL JAMES is an incorrect name and thus is given a negative source to golden score. This results in a negative accuracy score percentage 10 . The source record Baby Girl is an anonymous null value and thus is a 0 match.

Generally the golden record self score is determined by matching the golden record against itself and measuring the completeness of the golden record. In some cases when computing the golden record self score two records may be used even though the comparison is against itself. This is because even though the data is the same the gold record self score may not be perfect or 100 complete if data values are missing and the gold record is incomplete. Hence determination of the gold record self score is still very important when calculating data accuracy. For example comparing the golden record of JOHN SMITH to itself yields a golden record self score of 9.9 since the record is complete with all of the information and only has a slight difference in the abbreviation for ST. However comparing the golden record B. JONES to itself only yields a golden record self score of 6.2 since golden record is incomplete with the phone number is missing.

In one or more embodiments the definition of record accuracy can be customized for the accuracy score by introducing relative importance weights for different attributes. Some information may be more important to the user than other information and thus the relative significance of each attribute to the record accuracy is taken into account by using attribute weights. In certain embodiments the computer implemented method comprises normalizing or standardizing on one or more computers attributes of the received record.

In one or more other embodiments determination of record accuracy includes penalizing severe information quality issues while imposing smaller penalties on less significant information quality issues. This takes into account the important specifics expected when comparing attribute values for the purpose of information quality. For each data element there are different levels of information quality issues ranging from cosmetic differences to missing and even totally incorrect values. The importance significance and therefore the information penalty that is to be incurred depends on the nature of information quality issue. Often the severity of information quality issues depends on the usage.

As an illustrative example an attribute Name has a benchmark value of WILLIAM SMITH . There are five matching customer records A through E with the following values for the attribute Name 

It is assumed that the five data source records A E share the same enterprise identifier with the benchmark record in the trusted source e.g. a Party data hub. It is also assumed that even for scenarios D and E where the names differ significantly from the benchmark there exists enough similarity in other matching attributes e.g. address phone number email social security number to match and link the records with a common identifier.

Even though only value A is absolutely correct and should score 100 in information quality data accuracy scenarios B E illustrate different levels of deviation from the benchmark value WILLIAM SMITH . From the common sense perspective in scenario B the value is generally speaking right except the first name is incomplete and the nickname Bill is implied. In scenario C the last name is incorrect but only one character is off. Scenario D does not really contain any name. The name is replaced with an anonymous value NAME UNKNOWN . Finally scenario E displays a totally incorrect name that seems to belong to another person. This scenario is a little extreme but this type of mismatch can occur in practice for instance if all other attributes on the record happen to be consistent with WILLIAM SMITH s records.

Scenarios B E are all incorrect in comparison with the golden record for the attribute Name . However the severities of the inaccuracies are different and thus different penalties are assessed which results in different accuracy scores for each scenario. For example the inaccuracy in scenario B which uses the nickname Bill for the first name instead of the formal name William is penalized much less than the inaccuracy in scenario D or E which has an absent or completely incorrect name.

In another aspect of the present invention the system and method monitors the accuracy of source system data. A computer implemented method comprises monitoring on one or more computers the data accuracy of the received record as compared to the golden record over a time period. In one or more embodiments thresholds for the data accuracy are defined for example by a data governance organization. A data steward for the source system is automatically notified when a received record that they steward deviates from the golden record. The data steward is further prompted to perform corrective or remediation actions.

In one or more other embodiments the computer implemented method comprises generating on one or more computers one or more reports on the data accuracy. The detailed reports are provided for accuracy score monitoring. In an exemplary implementation source accuracy is calculated for all the entity attributes selected by a user. This information is presented in reports where the user can drill down to specific levels e.g. attribute level record level system specific level to obtain accuracy information. Source accuracy trends are also reported which enables a data governance organization or user to understand the evolution of source data accuracy.

In a further aspect of the present invention the system and method improves the accuracy of source system data by comparing the source system data s closeness to the golden record and feeding the golden record back to the source system. The system and method leverages the notion that the golden record represents the enterprise truth or the most accurate representation approximation for master data. The data accuracy improvement process measures the accuracy of data in the source systems utilizing the golden record and performs remediation actions to improve the accuracy of data in the source systems. This enables organizations to improve the accuracy of data in enterprise data sources and applications. The source accuracy score is defined by rating the individual source system data against the golden record and come up with a method to govern the data improvement process in the source system. This in turn improves the golden record through a reduction and elimination of variances in the source systems.

In the remediation process the golden record may be sent to the source system to update the source system data without impacting source applications. If the source system has data attributes that cannot be updated e.g. source data is part of a key that cannot be modified such data attributes may still be monitored but assigned lower weights so that the overall accuracy score is not impacted and falls below a threshold.
