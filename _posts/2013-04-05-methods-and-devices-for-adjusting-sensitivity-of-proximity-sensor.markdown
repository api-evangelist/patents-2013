The present disclosure relates to electronic device management and more particularly to methods and electronic devices for adjusting a sensitivity of a proximity sensor of an electronic device based on orientation of the electronic device.

Electronic devices such as smartphones are often equipped with a proximity sensor. A proximity sensor is a sensor capable of detecting the presence of nearby objects without requiring any physical contact with such objects. The proximity sensor allows such an electronic device to detect the presence of objects in proximity to the electronic device. The detection of objects by the electronic device may be used to perform various features and functions. For example in one operating mode the detection of an object in the vicinity of the electronic device such as the presence of a hand of a user may cause the electronic device to activate itself for usage and or activate or de activate a particular feature.

The proximity sensor may be associated with one or more operating characteristics which control operating of the proximity sensor on the electronic device. The characteristics of the proximity sensor may for example define the range of detection of the proximity sensor the power emitted by the proximity sensor etc. These characteristics of the proximity sensor are often pre set by the original equipment manufacturers OEMs of the electronic device.

In an example aspect the present application describes a method implemented by a processor of an electronic device for adjusting sensitivity of a proximity sensor associated with the electronic device. The proximity sensor is positioned biased towards a longitudinal side of the electronic device. The electronic device also includes an orientation sensor that generates orientation data based on an orientation of the electronic device. The method includes obtaining orientation data from the orientation sensor and increasing the sensitivity of the proximity sensor when the orientation of the electronic device is at a first tilted orientation based on the orientation data.

In another example aspect the present application describes an electronic device. The electronic device includes a proximity sensor an orientation sensor and a memory. The proximity sensor is positioned biased towards a longitudinal side of the electronic device. The orientation sensor generates orientation data based on an orientation of the electronic device. The electronic device also includes a processor coupled with the proximity sensor the orientation sensor and the memory. The processor is configured to obtain orientation data from the orientation sensor and increase the sensitivity of the proximity sensor when the orientation of the electronic device is at a first tilted orientation based on the orientation data.

In a further example aspect the present application describes a computer readable storage medium. The computer readable storage medium includes computer executable instructions that are executable by a processor of an electronic device. The electronic device has a proximity sensor that is positioned biased towards a longitudinal side of the electronic device. The electronic device also includes an orientation sensor that generates orientation data based on an orientation of the electronic device. The computer executable instructions when executed configure the processor to obtain orientation data from the orientation sensor and increase the sensitivity of the proximity sensor when the orientation of the electronic device is at a first tilted orientation based on the orientation data.

Other example embodiments of the present disclosure will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings.

Example embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to any particular operating system electronic device architecture server architecture or computer programming language.

Referring first to an example embodiment of an electronic device is provided. In a front view of the example electronic device is illustrated. The electronic device may take a variety of forms. In the example shown the electronic device is a mobile communication device capable of at least voice communications. More specifically in the example embodiment illustrated the electronic device is a smartphone .

The smartphone is a mobile phone which offers more advanced computing capability than a basic non smartphone cellular phone. For example the smartphone may have the ability to run third party applications which are stored on the smartphone . The smartphone may also provide for data communication capabilities as well as voice communication capabilities. It will be appreciated that in at least some example embodiments the electronic device may be of other forms.

The smartphone may include the components discussed below with reference to or a subset of those components. The smartphone includes a housing which houses at least some of the components discussed above with reference to .

In the example embodiment illustrated the smartphone includes a touchscreen display which acts as an input interface and an output interface . The touchscreen display is disposed within the smartphone so that it is viewable at a front side of the smartphone . That is a viewable side of the touchscreen display is disposed on the front side of the smartphone. In the example embodiment illustrated the touchscreen display is framed by the housing .

The example smartphone may include other input interfaces such as one or more buttons keys or navigational input mechanisms. In the example embodiment illustrated some of these additional input interfaces are disposed for actuation at the front side of the smartphone .

The smartphone additionally includes a proximity sensor . The proximity sensor is capable of sensing the presence of objects in proximity to the electronic device . The proximity sensor emits an electromagnetic field or a beam of electromagnetic radiation such as infrared light and looks for changes in the electromagnetic field or reflected electromagnetic radiation. The presence of an object within the vicinity of the emitted electromagnetic field or electromagnetic radiation i.e. within a sensing area of the proximity sensor may cause a change in the electromagnetic field or reflection of the electromagnetic radiation that is detected by the proximity sensor . Accordingly the proximity sensor may detect the presence of the object near the electronic device .

The proximity sensor is shown located underneath the housing and above the touchscreen display and oriented to detect objects on the front side of the electronic device such as the head of a user . That is the sensing area of the proximity sensor is directed to the front side of the electronic device . Accordingly objects in proximity to the front side may be detected while objects in proximity to the rear side may not be detected. For example the proximity sensor may emit an electromagnetic field or electromagnetic radiation that is directed from the front side and a change in the electromagnetic field or reflection in electromagnetic radiation caused by the presence of an object in proximity to the front side may be detected by the proximity sensor and the electronic device may then determine that an object is present.

The electronic device is of a rectangular shape with four sides forming a rectangular front face of the electronic device including two parallel longitudinal sides including a left longitudinal side and a right longitudinal side connected together by two connecting sides a top connecting side and a bottom connecting side . The connecting sides are shorter than the longitudinal sides . The longitudinal sides are the left and right sides of the electronic device when the electronic device is held in a portrait orientation. The left and right notations that are used in association with these sides refer to directions that exist when a front face of the electronic device is viewed. The front side of the electronic device is typically the side on which a main display is mounted. These left and right notations will be used throughout this document to refer to sides of the electronic device when viewed from the front of the electronic device. Since some of the figures in this document illustrate rear views of the electronic device e.g. the left and right longitudinal sides may appear reversed.

The proximity sensor is biased towards one of the longitudinal sides . In the example illustrated the proximity sensor is located biased towards the right longitudinal side of the front side of the smartphone . Accordingly the proximity sensor is positioned closer to the right longitudinal side than the left longitudinal side . For further illustrative purposes an axis a a is shown which is a vertical axis along the center of the electronic device . The axis a a is parallel to the two longitudinal sides and is equidistant from both of these sides thereby splitting the electronic device to form two symmetrical sides i.e. a left side and a right side. The proximity sensor is off centre it is offset from the center axis a a. In the example shown the proximity sensor is located on the right side of axis a a which is closer to the right longitudinal side .

It will be appreciated that in other embodiments the proximity sensor may instead be located biased towards the left longitudinal side of the front side of the smartphone . That is the proximity sensor may be positioned closer to the left longitudinal side than the right longitudinal side . More particularly the proximity sensor is located on the left side of axis a a which is closer to the left longitudinal side .

The electronic device includes one or more orientation sensors . The orientation sensor is configured to detect the orientation of the electronic device relative to a default orientation such as the portrait orientation illustrated in . The orientation sensor may be associated with a plurality of sensing axes which may be used to sense the orientation of the electronic device in a plurality of dimensions. In some embodiments the orientation sensor may be associated with three sensing axes which may be used to sense x y and z components of a current orientation. Each of these sensing axes may be aligned with certain features of the electronic device . In the example two of these sensing axes are illustrated. A first axis y is aligned with the center axis a a of the electronic device and is generally parallel to the longitudinal sides . In the example the first axis y is directed upward towards the top connecting side . The second axis x is perpendicular to the first axis and is generally parallel to the top and bottom connecting sides . The second axis is directed towards the right longitudinal side of the electronic device . A third sensing axis z may be perpendicular to both the first and second sensing axes.

It will be appreciated that the sensing axes may be aligned with other features and the electronic device may include a plurality of components which may be used for determining the orientation of the electronic device . For example a gyroscope accelerometer and or magnetometer may be used.

The orientation sensor may for example detect the orientation of the orientation sensor relative to gravity g. That is the gravitational field may provide a reference point for determining the orientation of the electronic device .

The orientation sensor is typically disposed within the housing and is not viewable from the exterior of the electronic device. However the orientation sensor has been shown as a circle in order to illustrate the sensing axes. The orientation sensor would however typically not be shaped this way it may be packaged in a standard integrated circuit IC .

Reference is now made to which illustrate example operating environments of the example electronic device . As will be described in greater detail below the operating conditions for the proximity sensor that is biased towards one of the longitudinal sides of the electronic device may change depending on whether the electronic device is held at a right side of the head or a left side of the head .

More particularly show a user conventionally operating the electronic device during a phone call by holding the electronic device tilted against a left side of a head or a right side of the head of the user. As noted above the electronic device includes a proximity sensor which allows the electronic device to detect the presence of a nearby object such as a head . In at least some embodiments when the presence of a head is detected the electronic device may turn off a touchscreen display associated with the electronic device to avoid having the touchscreen display activated inadvertently by a face of the user.

In the embodiment illustrated the proximity sensor is not centered on the electronic device . That is the proximity sensor is biased towards one of the longitudinal sides of the electronic device . Due to this orientation the proximity sensor is aligned with different features of the head depending on whether it is held on the left side or the right side of the head . For example the proximity sensor may be further from the head in one of these positions than in the other of these positions. As a result the output of the proximity sensor may be different when it the electronic device is held on the left side of a head than when the electronic device is held on the right side of the head .

As will be described in greater detail below an orientation sensor may be used to determine which side of the head the electronic device is being held on. Based on this determination the proximity sensor may be adjusted. More particularly a sensitivity associated with the proximity sensor may be adjusted depending on whether the electronic device is determined to be held on the left side of the head or the right side of the head .

Accordingly as will be described in greater detail below the electronic device may be configured to adjust sensitivity of an associated proximity sensor based on the orientation of the electronic device when being held by the user for the phone call i.e. whether it is an orientation associated with a left side of the head or an orientation associated with a right side of the head 

Referring now to the electronic device is shown at a left side of a human head . The electronic device being a smartphone is illustrated as being held to allow a speaker not shown to be aligned with an ear of the head and a microphone not shown to be aligned in close proximity to a mouth of the head .

In the example a rear side of the electronic device is illustrated. The rear side is typically a side which does not include the main display of the electronic device . The rear side in at least some embodiments is the side of the electronic device which is opposite to the side which includes the main display i.e. it is opposite the front side . As illustrated the front side is the side facing a side of the head of the user when the electronic device is held during a phone call. The rear side serves as the portion a user may hold by a hand not shown when operating the electronic device for the phone call.

As noted above the electronic device includes a proximity sensor . The proximity sensor may for example be used to detect the presence of a human head in vicinity of the electronic device. More particularly when the electronic device operates in a voice communication operating mode the proximity sensor may attempt to detect the presence of a head of the user. An initiation of a phone call on the electronic device may enable the voice communication operating mode on the electronic device . The presence of the side of the head in proximity to the electronic device may be detected by the electronic device using the proximity sensor when the device is conventionally held by the user for the phone call. When operating in the voice communication mode the detection of an object by the proximity sensor may be interpreted as a detection of the head of the user. That is if the electronic device is operating in a voice communication mode and the voice communication mode is a handset mode as contrasted with a speakerphone mode when an object is detected by the electronic device using the proximity sensor the electronic device may conclude that a head is in proximity to the electronic device and may for example turn off a touch sensitive input interface associated with a front face of the electronic device to avoid having the touch sensitive input interface being inadvertently activated by the head .

Referring to the electronic device is illustrated being held instead against the right side of the head by the user in a position suitable for engaging in a telephone call. The electronic device is now in a tilted orientation that is in a different direction than the tilted orientation shown in . The tilted orientation of may be defined as a second tilted orientation of the electronic device .

As noted above since the proximity sensor is biased towards one of the longitudinal sides i.e. since it is off centre it will be aligned with different facial features depending on whether it is held on the left side or right side of the head . As illustrated in where an electronic device having a proximity sensor that is biased towards a right longitudinal side is held at a left side of a head the proximity sensor may align with a region of the head other than the ear. That is the proximity sensor may align with a region of the head that is adjacent to the ear. In this position the gap between the proximity sensor and the object that it is trying to detect i.e. the head is quite large in comparison to the gap that exists when the electronic device is held at the right side of the head a scenario is illustrated in and the proximity sensor aligns with the ear. More particularly as illustrated in when the electronic device having the proximity sensor that is biased towards the right longitudinal side is held at the right side of the head the proximity sensor is largely aligned with an ear and the gap between the proximity sensor and the head is lessened.

Due to the differing features that may be aligned with the proximity sensor i.e. depending on whether the electronic device is held on the first side of the head or the second side of the head the electronic device may be configured to operate differently depending on whether the electronic device is situated on the left side of the head or on the right side of the head .

As can be seen by comparing the operating environment in with that in the sensing axes of the orientation sensor have a different orientation depending on the side of the head where the device is held. As illustrated in when the electronic device is held at the left side of the head the second axis x is directed upwardly in part. In contrast when held at the right side of the head as illustrated in the second axis x is directed downwardly in part. Thus the orientation sensor may be used to determine whether the electronic device is held on a left side of the head or whether it is held on a right side of the head .

Accordingly the orientation sensor may generate orientation data which specifies an orientation of the electronic device . Such orientations may be used by the electronic device for example to determine whether the electronic device is held at a left side of a head or at a right side of the head . That is the electronic device is tilted differently depending on whether it is held on a left side of the head or on a right side of the head . It is tilted in one direction when held on the left side of the head as illustrated in and is tilted in a second opposite direction when held on the right side of the head as illustrated in . When a user is holding the electronic device on one side of their head e.g. the left side to engage in a telephone call the electronic device may be said to be held in a first tilted orientation and when the device is held at the other side of their head e.g. the right side to allow the user to engage in a telephone call the electronic device may be said to be held in a second tilted orientation. As will be discussed below proximity sensor adjustments may be made based on determined tilt orientations of the electronic device . That is the orientation sensor is effectively used to determine whether the electronic device is held on a left side of the head or on a right side of the head and the adjustment of the proximity sensor may account for the specific side of the head where the electronic device is being used.

More particularly the orientation sensor may generate orientation data which is obtained by the electronic device . The electronic device may then determine whether the orientation of the electronic device is at a first tilted orientation which may be associated with one side of the head e.g. the left side or a second tilted orientation which may be associated with another side of the head e.g. the right side based on the orientation data. Upon determining that the electronic device is at the first tilted orientation i.e. upon determining that the electronic device having a proximity sensor that is biased towards the right longitudinal side is being held on the left side of the head the electronic device may increase a sensitivity associated with the proximity sensor . More particularly where the electronic device is held at a side of the head where a relatively large gap exists between the proximity sensor and the head which in the example described above is the left side of the head due to the location of the proximity sensor then the proximity sensor may be made more sensitive to account for this gap. In contrast where the electronic device is held at a side of the head where a relatively small gap exists between the proximity sensor and the head which in the example described above is the right side of the head then the proximity sensor may be made less sensitive to account for the smaller gap.

It will be appreciated that if the proximity sensor were biased towards the left longitudinal side rather than the right longitudinal side then the sensitivity of the proximity sensor might be decreased in response to detecting that the electronic device is held in the first tilted orientation i.e. the orientation associated with the left side . That is in such example embodiments the adjustment of the sensitivity of the proximity sensor is correspondingly flipped as now the proximity sensor is positioned closer to the head of the user when held against the left side of the head during a phone call and the proximity sensor is positioned further away from the head of the user when held against the right side of the head during the phone call. Accordingly the sensitivity of the proximity sensor is decreased when the electronic device is held against the left side of the head while the sensitivity of the proximity sensor is increased when the electronic device is held against the right side of the head .

As will be described in greater detail below the proximity sensor may in some embodiments be used by the electronic device to avoid inadvertent input due to contact with the touchscreen during a voice communication. For example if the voice communication operating mode is enabled on the electronic device and a handset mode is being used as opposed to a speakerphone mode the presence of an object in proximity to the electronic device may be detected based on the proximity sensor data. After such an object is detected in some embodiments to avoid inadvertent input caused by contact between the head and the electronic device the electronic device may disable processing of instructions input via an associated touchscreen display of the electronic device . For example interface elements displayed on the touchscreen display which may correspond to associated telephony functions may be prevented from being selected via the touchscreen display. Accordingly accidental contact by a user against the touchscreen display for example by a cheek ear etc. will not inadvertently cause operations to be performed by the electronic device during the phone call.

Reference is next made to which illustrates a block diagram of the example electronic device . In the example embodiment illustrated the electronic device is a mobile communication device. That is the electronic device is configured to communicate with other electronic devices servers and or systems i.e. it is a communication device and the electronic device is portable and may be easily moved between different physical locations i.e. it is a mobile device .

Depending on the functionality provided by the electronic device in various example embodiments the electronic device may be a multiple mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication a mobile telephone such as a smartphone a wearable computer such as a watch a tablet computer such as a slate computer a personal digital assistant PDA or a computer system. The electronic device may take other forms apart from those specifically listed above. The electronic device may also in various example embodiments be referred to as a mobile communications device a communication device a mobile device an electronic device and in some cases as a device.

The electronic device includes a housing housing the components of the electronic device . The internal components of the electronic device are constructed on a printed circuit board PCB . The electronic device includes a controller including at least one processor such as a microprocessor which controls the overall operation of the electronic device . It will be appreciated that in at least some example embodiments the controller may instead of or in addition to the processor include an analog circuit or other types of circuits capable of performing a part or all of the functions of the processor that are described herein. The processor interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem for exchanging radio frequency signals with a wireless network to perform communication functions. The processor may be communicably coupled with additional device subsystems including one or more output interfaces such as a touchscreen display one or more speakers and or other output interfaces one or more input interfaces such as a microphone an orientation sensor a proximity sensor a keyboard not shown control buttons not shown a touch sensitive overlay associated with the touchscreen display a camera not shown and or other input interfaces memory such as flash memory random access memory RAM read only memory ROM etc. auxiliary input output I O subsystems a data port which may be a serial data port such as a Universal Serial Bus USB data port a short range communication subsystem and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in perform communication related functions whereas other subsystems may provide resident or on device functions.

The electronic device may include a touchscreen display which acts as both an input interface i.e. touch sensitive overlay and an output interface i.e. display . The touchscreen display may be constructed using a touch sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller. The touch sensitive input surface overlays the touchscreen display and may be referred to as a touch sensitive overlay. The touch sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch sensitive input interface and the processor interacts with the touch sensitive overlay via the electronic controller.

The particular design of the wireless communication subsystem depends on the wireless network in which the electronic device is intended to operate. The wireless network may include one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network WWAN and or a Wireless Local Area Network WLAN and or other suitable network arrangements. In some example embodiments the electronic device is configured to communicate over both the WWAN and WLAN and to roam between these networks. The electronic device may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network via the wireless communication subsystem after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed.

In at least some example embodiments the auxiliary input output I O subsystems may include an external communication link or interface for example an Ethernet connection. The electronic device may include other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks for example a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed OFDM network. The auxiliary I O subsystems may include a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the electronic device such as receipt of an electronic communication or incoming phone call or for other purposes such as haptic feedback i.e. touch feedback .

In at least some example embodiments the electronic device also includes a removable memory module which may be flash memory such as a removable memory card and a memory interface . Network access may be associated with a subscriber or user of the electronic device via the memory module which may be a Subscriber Identity Module SIM card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory module is inserted in or connected to the memory interface of the electronic device in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .

The data port may be used for synchronization with a user s host computer system not shown . The data port enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the electronic device by providing for information or software downloads to the electronic device other than through the wireless network . The alternate download path may for example be used to load an encryption key onto the electronic device through a direct reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.

In at least some example embodiments the electronic device is provided with a service routing application programming interface API which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data i.e. USB or Bluetooth Bluetooth is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG Inc. connection to a host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their electronic device to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth connection traffic that was destined for the wireless network is automatically routed to the electronic device using the USB cable or Bluetooth connection. Similarly any traffic destined for the wireless network is automatically sent over the USB cable or Bluetooth connection to the host computer system for processing.

In at least some example embodiments the electronic device may include one or more sensors. For example the electronic device may include an orientation sensor that detects the orientation of the electronic device or that generates information from which the orientation of the electronic device can be determined such as acceleration or motion information. In at least some example embodiments the orientation sensor is an accelerometer such as a three axis accelerometer. An accelerometer is a sensor which converts acceleration from motion e.g. movement of the electronic device or a portion thereof due to the strike force and gravity which are detected by a sensing element into an electrical signal producing a corresponding change in output . Accelerometers may be available in one two or three axis configurations. Higher order axis configurations are also possible. Accelerometers may produce digital or analog output signals depending on the type of accelerometer. Accordingly the acceleration data generated by the accelerometer may be used to determine the orientation of the electronic device .

In at least some example embodiments the orientation sensor may be a gyroscope such as a three axis gyroscope . A gyroscope is a sensor that measures the rotational velocity of the electronic device . That is the gyroscope may generate an output which specifies the rotational rate of the electronic device . For example the gyroscope may define one or more sensing axis and motion at each of the one or more sensing axis may be measured as a rotation per unit of time irrespective of the other sensing axis. Accordingly the gyroscope may generate motion data associated with movements of the electronic device . This motion data generated by the gyroscope may be used to determine the orientation of the electronic device .

In other example embodiments the orientation sensor may be of other forms instead of or in addition to an accelerometer and or a gyroscope. For example the orientation sensor may be a gravity sensor a tilt sensor an electronic compass or other suitable sensors or combinations thereof.

The orientation sensor such as the accelerometer and or gyroscope may generate orientation data which specifies the orientation of the electronic device . The orientation data in at least some example embodiments specifies the orientation of the electronic device relative to gravity g i.e. the gravitational field of the earth . In at least some example embodiments the orientation data may be used to influence various functions on the electronic device . For example the electronic device may switch between a portrait operating mode and a landscape operating mode based on the orientation data allow for user interface control to manipulate operations within a game application based on the orientation data allow for image stabilization when capturing an image from an associated camera based on the orientation data etc. Similarly in at least some example embodiments the orientation data may be used to manipulate the settings of the components of the electronic device such as the proximity sensor . More particularly the sensitivity of the proximity sensor may be changed i.e. increased or decreased based on the orientation data for example if the orientation data defines tilted orientations of the electronic device . Greater details of such adjustments of the proximity sensor are described below.

It will also be appreciated that the orientation data may be used to manipulate other functions and features of the electronic device not specifically described herein.

As mentioned above the electronic device may also include a proximity sensor . The proximity sensor is capable of sensing the presence of objects in proximity to the electronic device . The proximity sensor emits an electromagnetic field or a beam of electromagnetic radiation such as infrared light and looks for changes in the electromagnetic field or reflected electromagnetic radiation. The presence of an object within the vicinity of the emitted electromagnetic field or electromagnetic radiation i.e. within a sensing area of the proximity sensor may cause a change in the electromagnetic field or reflection of the electromagnetic radiation that is detected by the proximity sensor . Accordingly the proximity sensor may detect the presence of the object near the electronic device . In such a manner a user s head hand and or other body part may be detected by the proximity sensor when near the electronic device .

As noted above in the discussion of the proximity sensor may be located biased towards a longitudinal side of the electronic device . As also noted above the proximity sensor is orientated to detect objects on the front side of the electronic device .

The proximity sensor may be associated with one or more characteristics which affect the operation of the proximity sensor and or which affect the conclusions that are made based on data obtained at the proximity sensor . For example one characteristic is a sensitivity of the proximity sensor . The sensitivity of the proximity sensor affects how sensitive the electronic device is to nearby objects. For example the sensitivity may define the range of the proximity sensor . The range of the proximity sensor may be defined as a distance at which an object may be detected by the proximity sensor . For example the size of a sensing area i.e. the coverage area of the proximity sensor may define the range of the proximity sensor . Objects within the sensing area will be detected by the proximity sensor while objects outside of the sensing area will not be detected by the proximity sensor . The sensitivity may define the distance at which an object must be from the proximity sensor for the sensor to recognize the presence of that object.

The range may be adjusted for example by adjusting the power level associated with the proximity sensor . The level of power emitted by the proximity sensor may be defined as the strength of the electromagnetic field or electromagnetic radiation emitted by the proximity sensor . The stronger the electromagnetic field or electromagnetic radiation emitted the further away an object can be detected by the electronic device as the electromagnetic field or electromagnetic radiation may reach these objects. Additionally objects closer to the electronic device may be more precisely detected. Thus in at least some embodiments the sensitivity of the proximity sensor is a setting that controls the power level of the proximity sensor and thus the range of the proximity sensor. Increasing the sensitivity is performed by increasing the power level and decreasing the sensitivity is performed by decreasing the power level.

The sensitivity of the proximity sensor may in some embodiments be a threshold associated with the proximity sensor. More particularly the proximity sensor may have one or more thresholds associated therewith which are used when determining whether an object is within the vicinity of the electronic device. For example in some embodiments a first threshold may represent a minimum level of change of the electromagnetic field or reflected electromagnetic radiation which must exist before it will be determined that an object is present. That is it represents a minimum proximity sensor reading that is used to determine that an object is present. For example where the proximity sensor detects proximity based on electromagnetic radiation that is reflected off an object in proximity to the electronic device and received at the proximity sensor then a threshold may control how much electromagnetic radiation must be detected before the electronic device will determine that an object is present. This threshold may in some embodiments be referred to as the sensitivity of the proximity sensor. The electronic device may use this threshold to determine whether the level of change of the electromagnetic field or reflected electromagnetic radiation is at least above a certain threshold amount i.e. whether an object in proximity to the electronic device changes the electromagnetic field or reflects electromagnetic radiation to a level that meets a certain threshold so that the object can be determined to be present .

Similarly in some embodiments a time threshold may be associated with the proximity sensor and may act as a sensitivity setting for the proximity sensor . The time threshold may represent a minimum amount of time that the proximity sensor readings must stay above the first threshold before the electronic device will determine that an object is nearby. This time threshold is used so that transient proximity sensor readings that are briefly above the first threshold e.g. due to movement of the electronic device briefly by an object that is not a head are ignored in some operating modes.

In at least some example embodiments the sensitivity of the proximity sensor may be adjusted. In such example embodiments the sensitivity of the proximity sensor may be adjusted based on the orientation data. The electronic device may obtain orientation data from the orientation sensor and determine whether the orientation of the electronic device is at a first tilted orientation i.e. associated with the left side of the head or a second tilted orientation i.e. associated with a right side of the head . The sensitivity of the proximity sensor is in some embodiments increased when the orientation of the electronic device is at the first tilted orientation and decreased when the orientation of the electronic device is at the second tilted orientation. Accordingly the sensitivity of the proximity sensor is manipulated based on the orientation of the electronic device .

In at least some example embodiments after detecting the presence of an object such as the head of the user in proximity to the electronic device the electronic device may use the information to perform various functions. For example in at least some example embodiments the information may be used to enable or disable processing of instructions input via the touchscreen display for example by activating or de activating the touchscreen display increase or decrease power emitted from the wireless communication subsystem and or other operations.

It will be appreciated that the electronic device may include other sensors not specifically described herein.

The electronic device also includes or is connectable to a power source such as a battery . The battery may be one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged for example through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the data port . The battery provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the electronic device and the battery interface provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface is coupled to a regulator not shown which provides power V to the circuitry of the electronic device .

The electronic device stores data in an erasable persistent memory which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various example embodiments the data includes service data including information used by the electronic device to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data may also include user application data such as email messages address book and contact information image data calendar and schedule information notepad documents image files and other commonly stored user information stored on the electronic device by its user and other data. The data stored in the persistent memory e.g. flash memory of the electronic device may be organized at least partially into one or more databases or data stores. The databases or data stores may contain data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example email messages contact records and task items may be stored in individual databases within the memory. The data may further include sensor related data. For example the sensor related data may include orientation sensor related data that defines a range of orientations that are associated with a left side of a head and a range of orientations that are associated with a right side of the head .

A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations including data and possibly voice communication applications may be installed on the electronic device during or after manufacture. Additional applications and or upgrades to the operating system or software applications may also be loaded onto the electronic device through the wireless network the auxiliary I O subsystem the data port the short range communication subsystem or other suitable device subsystem . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed for example written into the program memory i.e. the flash memory or written into and executed from the RAM for execution by the processor at runtime.

The electronic device may in at least some example embodiments be a mobile communication device which may provide two principal modes of communication a data communication mode and a voice communication mode. In the data communication mode a received data signal such as a text message an email message or a web page download will be processed by the wireless communication subsystem and input to the processor for further processing. For example a downloaded web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by an email messaging application and output to the touchscreen display . A user of the electronic device may also compose data items such as email messages for example using the input devices in conjunction with the touchscreen display . These composed items may be transmitted through the wireless communication subsystem over the wireless network .

In the voice communication mode the electronic device provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone such as allowing for phone calls . The overall operation is similar to the data communication mode except that the received signals would be output to the speaker and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software firmware e.g. a voice communication module and hardware e.g. the microphone the speaker and input interfaces . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem may also be implemented on the electronic device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker the touchscreen display may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party duration of a voice call or other voice call related information.

The processor operates under stored program control and executes software modules stored in memory such as persistent memory for example in the flash memory . As illustrated in the software modules include operating system software and other software applications including a sensor control module .

The software applications on the electronic device may also include a range of additional applications including for example a notepad application Internet browser application voice communication e.g. telephony application mapping application media player application or any combination thereof. Each of the software applications may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements e.g. text fields input fields icons etc. in the user interface e.g. the touchscreen display according to the application.

The software modules or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information as will be apparent. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory this is merely one example and it will be appreciated that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.

As noted above the electronic device includes various detection and adjustment capabilities. In one such example embodiment the sensor control module may be configured to perform some these detection and adjustment functionalities by interfacing with various components such as the orientation sensor and the proximity sensor . For example in at least some example embodiments the electronic device may obtain orientation data from the orientation sensor and determine whether the orientation of the electronic device is at a first tilted orientation or a second tilted orientation based on the obtained orientation data.

More particularly the electronic device may determine whether the orientation is one associated with a left side of the head or the right side of the head . This determination may be made by comparing the orientation of the electronic device to predetermined ranges of orientations. For example a first range of orientations may be associated with a first side of the head and a second range of orientations may be associated with a second side of the head . The first range includes the first tilted orientation and the second range includes the second tilted orientation.

The sensor control module may then adjust the sensitivity of the proximity sensor based on the determined orientation of the electronic device . More particularly the sensor control module may increase the sensitivity of the proximity sensor when the orientation of the electronic device is in the first tilted orientation and decrease the sensitivity of the proximity sensor when the orientation of the electronic device is in the second tilted orientation. As mentioned above in at least some example embodiments by varying the sensitivity of the proximity sensor the range of the proximity sensor may be correspondingly varied. That is increasing the sensitivity of the proximity sensor may include increasing the range of the proximity sensor and decreasing the sensitivity of the proximity sensor may include decreasing the range of the proximity sensor .

Additionally in at least some example embodiments by varying the sensitivity of the proximity sensor the level of power emitted by the proximity sensor may be correspondingly varied i.e. varying the strength of the electromagnetic field or radiation emitted . That is increasing the sensitivity of the proximity sensor may include increasing the level of power emitted by the proximity sensor and decreasing the sensitivity of the proximity sensor may include decreasing the level of power emitted by the proximity sensor .

Furthermore in at least some example embodiments by varying the sensitivity of the proximity sensor the threshold associated with a determination whether an object is present or not may be varied. As the threshold may include a level of change of the electromagnetic field or reflected electromagnetic radiation to detect the presence of the object and or a length of time to detect the presence of the object increasing the sensitivity of the proximity sensor may decrease the required level of change of the electromagnetic field or reflected electromagnetic radiation to detect the object and or decrease the required length of time to detect the presence of the object. Similarly decreasing the sensitivity of the proximity sensor may increase the required level of change of the electromagnetic field or reflected electromagnetic radiation to detect the object and or increase the required length of time to detect the presence of the object. That is an increase to the threshold may be a decrease of the sensitivity while a decrease of the threshold may be an increase of the sensitivity.

As mentioned above the relationship between the orientation of the electronic device i.e. whether it is held on the left side or the right side of the head and the corresponding adjustments to the sensitivity of the proximity sensor will depend on the longitudinal side that is nearest the proximity sensor .

By appropriately adjusting the sensitivity of the proximity sensor the sensor control module may optimize operation of the proximity sensor based on changes in the orientation of the electronic device .

In at least some example embodiments the sensor control module may further obtain sensor data from the adjusted proximity sensor and detect a head based on the obtained sensor data. For example the adjusted proximity sensor may obtain sensor data defining the presence of a head when the electronic device is held tilted in close proximity to either the right side of the head or the left side of the head of the user. This sensor data is then analyzed by the sensor control module to detect the presence of the head of the user. In at least some example embodiments in response to detecting the head the sensor control module may disable processing of instructions input via the touchscreen display to the electronic device . For example the touchscreen display may be deactivated e.g. the overlay of the touchscreen display may be deactivated and or the electronic device is unresponsive to instructions input via the touchscreen display e.g. the sensor control module may prevent the processing of the instructions . Accordingly a user using the electronic device for a phone call may not inadvertently cause the electronic device to perform functions by accidently inputting instructions on the touchscreen display for example by selecting displayed interface elements via contact with the touchscreen display by the head ear cheek or other body part as processing of instructions input via the touchscreen display is disabled.

Specific functions and features of the sensor control module will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to .

In at least some example embodiments the operating system may perform some or all of the functions of the sensor control module . In other example embodiments the functions or a portion of the functions of the sensor control module may be performed by one or more other applications. For example in at least some example embodiments the determining of the orientation of the electronic device and or the adjusting of the sensitivity of the proximity sensor functions may be performed by other applications.

Further while the sensor control module has been illustrated as a stand alone application in other example embodiments the sensor control module may be implemented as part of the operating system or another application . Furthermore in at least some example embodiments the functions of the sensor control module may be provided by a plurality of software modules. In at least some example embodiments these software modules may be divided among multiple applications.

Additionally in at least some example embodiments the sensor control module may not be stored in the flash memory and may instead be stored in a memory associated with the proximity sensor . In such example embodiments a controller of the proximity sensor may execute the sensor control module to perform all or some of the functions of the sensor control module described herein. Moreover in at least some example embodiments one or more modules located in the flash memory of the electronic device may perform some of the functions of the sensor control module while one or more modules located in a memory associated with the proximity sensor may perform some of the functions of the sensor control module . Accordingly a controller associated with the proximity sensor may cause some or all of the functions of the sensor control module to be performed instead of or in addition to the processor of the electronic device .

Reference will now be made to in which an example method of adjusting sensitivity of the proximity sensor of the electronic device is illustrated in flowchart form. The electronic device may be configured to perform the method of . In at least some example embodiments the processor of the electronic device is configured to perform the method of . One or more applications or modules on the electronic device may contain computer readable instructions which cause the processor of the electronic device to perform the method of . In at least some example embodiments the sensor control module stored in memory of the electronic device is configured to perform the method of . More particularly the sensor control module may contain computer readable instructions which when executed cause the processor to perform the method of . In at least some example embodiments the sensor control module may interface with other components such as the orientation sensor and the proximity sensor to perform the method of 400 of .

It will be appreciated that the method of may in at least some example embodiments be provided by other software applications or modules apart from those specifically discussed above. Accordingly any features which are referred to as being performed by the electronic device may be performed by any one or more of the software applications or modules referred to above or other software modules. In at least some example embodiments at least some of the method of may be performed by or may rely on other applications or modules.

The method includes at operating in a voice communication operating mode. The voice communication operating mode is an operating mode in which the electronic device is used for voice communications. The voice communication operating mode is a handset operating mode in which a microphone and speaker associated with the electronic device are configured for use within close proximity to a mouth and ear of a user respectively. This may be contrasted with a speakerphone mode in which the microphone and speaker may be configured to use over much greater distances. The voice communication operating mode may for example begin when the user initiates or receives a telephone call.

At the method includes obtaining orientation data from the associated orientation sensor . That is the orientation sensor generates orientation data that specifies the orientation of the electronic device which is received by the electronic device . In at least some example embodiments the orientation sensor may directly detect the orientation of the electronic device . In at least some example embodiments the orientation sensor may generate information from which the orientation of the electronic device can be determined.

After obtaining the orientation data the electronic device at may determine whether the orientation of the electronic device is at a first tilted orientation or a second tilted orientation based on the orientation data. That is the electronic device analyzes the received orientation data to determine if the orientation data specifies a first tilted orientation which may be associated with a left side of the head or a second tilted orientation which may be associated with a right side of the head .

As mentioned above the first tilted orientation and the second tilted orientation are orientations of the electronic device when held tilted relative to the gravitational field of the earth. More particularly the first tilted orientation and the second tilted orientation are tilted orientations of the electronic device when typically held by a user against his her ear during a phone call i.e. the electronic device is held by the rear side with the front side in contact or proximity with an ear of the user . In such example embodiments the first tilted orientation may pertain to the orientations of the electronic device when held against one ear of the user and the second tilted orientation may pertain to the orientations of the electronic device when held against the other ear of the user.

Accordingly the electronic device may determine whether the orientation is one associated with a left side of the head or the right side of the head . This determination may be made by comparing the orientation of the electronic device to predetermined ranges of orientations. For example a first range of orientations may be associated with a first side of the head and a second range of orientations may be associated with a second side of the head . The first range includes the first tilted orientation and the second range includes the second tilted orientation.

In at least some embodiments the determination of the orientation of the electronic device at is performed in response to the initiation and or receipt of a phone call. That is the determination process may only occur during a phone call on the electronic device i.e. while the device remains in the voice communication operating mode described with reference to .

At if it is determined that the electronic device is at the first tilted orientation the sensitivity of the proximity sensor is increased. While at if it is determined that the electronic device is at the second tilted orientation the sensitivity of the proximity sensor is decreased. As such the electronic device may adjust the sensitivity of the proximity sensor based on whether the orientation of the electronic device is at the first tilted orientation or the second tilted orientation.

Methods of adjusting the sensitivity of the proximity sensor are described in greater detail above with reference to and any one or more of these techniques may be used at and or .

At the electronic device may obtain sensor data from the proximity sensor . That is the proximity sensor generates sensor data that may specify the presence of an object in proximity to the electronic device i.e. within the sensing area of the proximity sensor . More particularly the proximity sensor may emit an electromagnetic field or electromagnetic radiation and detect changes in the electromagnetic field or reflected electromagnetic radiation. This detected information may be generated in the form of sensor data that is received by the electronic device .

After obtaining the sensor data the electronic device at may detect a head based on the sensor data. For example a user conventionally operating the electronic device during a phone call may place the electronic device tilted against either the left side of the head or the right side of the head . The head of the user is within the sensing area of the proximity sensor and may cause a change in the electromagnetic field or reflect electromagnetic radiation that is detected by the proximity sensor and specified in generated sensor data. The electronic device may then determine that the head of the electronic device is in proximity to the electronic device based on the generated sensor data.

In at least some example embodiments in response to detecting the head the electronic device may disable processing of instructions input via the touchscreen display to the electronic device . That is the electronic device stops processing instructions input in to the electronic device from the touchscreen display upon detecting the presence of the head of the user. For example the touchscreen display is deactivated and or the electronic device is unresponsive to gestures input on the touchscreen display . Accordingly a user is not permitted to input instructions to the electronic device when the head of the user is detected in proximity to the electronic device . In such cases a user may not inadvertently cause operations on the electronic device by accidently inputting instructions such as by the ear cheek head etc. via the the touchscreen display when conventionally holding the electronic device against a side of the head during a phone call as the electronic device is disabled from processing input instructions via the touchscreen display .

Additionally in such example embodiments the electronic device may be re enabled i.e. no longer disabled to process instructions input via the touchscreen display when the head of the user is no longer detected. That is the proximity sensor may no longer detect the presence of an object in proximity to the electronic device for example there are no longer any changes in the emitted electromagnetic field or receipt of electromagnetic radiation . In such cases the electronic device is re enabled to process instructions input via the touchscreen display and associated operations are performed by the electronic device . For example a user conventionally holding the electronic device against a side of the head during phone call and in which case the electronic device is disabled for processing of input instructions may move the electronic device away from the head to perform functions and features on the electronic device for example to select a number on a virtual keypad displayed on the touchscreen display to input an associated response during an automated phone call . In such cases the electronic device may be re enabled so that instructions input by the user may be processed.
