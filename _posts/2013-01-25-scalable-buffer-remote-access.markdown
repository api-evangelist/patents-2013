A computing device may execute an operating environment that may include elements such as file system objects and executing applications. The computing device may render a representation of the operating environment as part of a graphical interface which may be output for presentation on a display unit of the computing device. The representation of the operating environment may be rendered at a defined display resolution which may define a display area included in the graphical interface.

An aspect is a method for scalable buffer remote access. Scalable buffer remote access may include generating at a client device a scalable display buffer request indicating a portion of a display area of an operating environment of a host device and a scaling factor ratio transmitting the scalable display buffer request to the host device receiving rendered content including a rendering of a representation of the portion of the display area of the operating environment of the host device wherein the rendering is scaled based on the scaling factor presenting a client display window including the rendered content as a window into the display area of the operating environment of the host device.

Another aspect is another method for scalable buffer remote access. Scalable buffer remote access may include initiating an scalable buffer remote access session wherein initiating the scalable buffer remote access session includes receiving host display information indicating a display area of an operating environment of a host device generating at a client device a scalable display buffer request indicating a portion of the display area of the operating environment of the host device and a scaling factor ratio transmitting the scalable display buffer request to the host device via an electronic communication network receiving via the electronic communication network rendered content including a rendering of a representation of the portion of the display area of the operating environment of the host device wherein the rendered content is scaled based on the scaling factor ratio and presenting a client display window including the rendered content as a window into the display area of the operating environment of the host device by outputting the client display window to a graphical display device of the client device.

Remote access technologies such as remote desktop or screen sharing may allow a computing device client to remotely access an operating environment of another computing device host . For example the host device may render a representation of a display area of the operating environment which may be associated with a defined resolution and may transmit the rendered output to the client device for presentation on a display unit of the client device. Rendering the representation of the display area may include for example encoding the content of the display area as a series of frames.

In moving window based remote access technologies the host device may render a representation of a portion of the display area of operating environment on the host device and may transmit the output including the rendered output of the display area to the client device. The client device may present the rendered output as a window into the display area of the operating environment. The window may be moved to include another portion of the display area or zoomed to include greater detail of the portion of the display area and the host device may render the updated portion of the display area and transmit the output to the client device for presentation.

In some implementations moving window based remote access technologies may perform poorly at the client device due to the time utilized between input of a change in window position or zoom at the client device and receipt at the client device of the output rendered by the host device. For example changing the portion displayed may include transmitting information indicating the new the portion of the display area from the client device to the host device which may include a size of the portion rendering the new portion of the display area at the host device transmitting the output from the host device to the client device and presenting the rendering of the new portion at the display unit of the client device.

Scalable buffer remote access may improve remote access performance and may include transmitting information indicating a buffer portion of the display area from the client device to the host device rendering the buffer portion of the display area at the host device which may include scaling the rendered buffer portion transmitting the rendered output from the host device to the client device and presenting a client display window including the rendered buffer portion at a display unit of the client device. In some implementations the presenting the client display window at the client device may include scaling the rendered output received from the host device.

For example the client device may scale the rendered output for presentation via the graphical display unit of the client device . In some implementations the host device may receive an indication of the display resolution of the client device and may render the representation of the operating environment using the display resolution of the client device .

For example the host device may adjust the display resolution of the host device to match the display resolution of the client device and may render the representation of the display area at the adjusted display resolution. Adjusting the display resolution may cause unwanted interference with the operating environment of the host device .

In another example rendering the representation of the display are at the host device may include scaling or sampling the representation of the display area to generate output at the display resolution of the client device which may consume significant resources such as processing resources and may produce graphical artifacts.

The scalable display window buffer may indicate a height and width of a portion of the display area of the host device such as a portion requested by a client device. For example the scalable display window buffer may be expressed as a width which may be a number of horizontal pixels such as client buffer width 1224 a height which may be a number of vertical pixels such as client buffer height 1000. In some implementations the height and width of the scalable display window buffer may be expressed as a function of the height and width of the client display window and a respective height and width scaling ratio.

Scalable buffer remote access may include initiating remote access at rendering a portion of a representation of an operating environment at encoding the rendered content at transmitting the encoded rendered content to the client device at presenting the rendered content at receiving a zoom indication at transmitting an updated scalable buffer request to the host device at rendering an updated portion of a representation of an operating environment at encoding the updated rendered content at transmitting the encoded rendered content to the client device at presenting updated rendered content at or a combination thereof.

Scalable buffer remote access may be initiated at . Initiating scalable buffer remote access may include establishing a connection between the client device and the host device . The client device and the host device may exchange information such as a client display buffer request a request identifier request id a requested display buffer size client buffer width client buffer height a requested display buffer position display offset x display offset y a scaling factor ratio ratio x ratio y and a display resolution host width host height of the host device . In some implementations the exchanged information may indicate that the client device is using scalable buffer remote access. In some implementations the client device and the host device may exchange encoding information such as codec type available bandwidth or any other information relevant to encoding the scalable buffer remote access session.

Although not separately shown in in some implementations the client device may determine whether the requested display buffer is within the display area of the host device. For example the client device may determine whether for any pixel x y in requested area x 0 x 0 and y

The host device may render a portion of a representation of a display area of an operating environment of the host device at . The portion rendered may correspond to the requested display buffer information as shown in . In some implementations the host device may render a sequence of frames. Each frame may include implicit or explicit information such as the request identifier offset information buffer information a timestamp or any other information relevant to the rendered sequence of frames. In some implementations the host device may render a representation of a display area of an operating environment of the host device and may capture a portion of the rendered content corresponding to the requested display buffer.

In some implementations the host device may determine whether to render the requested portion or to render the local display area and capture the requested portion from the rendered content. For example for a single client device the host device may render the requested content. In another example for multiple client devices which may each request a different portion of the display area the host device may render the display are and may capture the requested portion of the rendered content for each client device.

The host device may encode the rendered output which may include compressing rendered frames at . Encoding the rendered output may include encoding without scaling encoding using a scalable video coding scheme encoding scaled content or encoding using a hybrid scaling scheme.

Encoding the rendered content without scaling may include encoding the rendered content at the resolution of the host device . Encoding without scaling may utilize relatively large amounts of processing resources at the host device and the client device and may utilize relatively large amounts of communication bandwidth. Encoding the rendered content without scaling may allow the client device to respond to changes in zoom level without requesting additional information from the host device . For example the client device may request zoomed out content which may include determining the size of the un scaled content sending the un scaled size information to the host device and down scaling the received rendered content to fit the client display window on the client device .

Encoding the rendered content using a scalable video coding scheme such as Scalable Video Coding SVC may include adaptively adjusting the frame rate or quality of the encoded output based on available bandwidth and may utilize relatively large amounts of computing resources at the host device and the client device . For example adjusting the frame rate may include including higher resolution layers in the encoded output at a frame rate that is lower than the frame rate the content was rendered. In some implementations the host device may encode the high resolution layers at the frame rate the content was rendered and may reduce the frame rate of the encoded output by omitting some frames from the output. For example the host device may encode at the full frame rate to be prepared for a zoom in request from client.

Encoding scaled content may include scaling the rendered content based on the scaling factor ratio and encoding the scaled content. For example the buffer size may be 640 480 the scaling factor ratio may be 2 3 ratio x 2 ratio y 3 and the host device may scale the rendered content to 320 160. Encoding the scaled content may utilize relatively little communication bandwidth.

Encoding the rendered content using a hybrid encoding scheme may include concurrently encoding multiple output streams. In some implementations each output stream may be encoded using different encoding parameters such as different resolutions or different frame rates. Generating a first encoded output stream may include scaling the rendered content based on the scaling factor ratio and encoding the scaled content. Generating a second encoded output stream may include scaling the rendered content based on the scaling factor ratio and encoding the scaled content at a reduced frame rate. Encoding using a hybrid encoding scheme may utilize a relatively high amount of communication bandwidth and may be performed using a video codec that does not support a scalable video coding scheme.

The client device may decode the encoded content and may present a client display window including the rendering of the buffer portion as a window into the display area of the host operating environment at . For example the client device may present the client display window via a local graphical display device. Although not shown separately the client device may scale the rendering of the buffer portion. For example the decoded content may be unscaled and the client device may scale down the decoded content to fit a smaller client display window.

In some implementations presenting the rendered content may include maintaining position information for elements of the representation of the display such as a cursor location relative to the display area of the host device. For example cursor movement at the client device may be mapped to the operating environment of the host device using the scaling factor ratio ratio x ratio y .

The client device may receive a change of the client display window such as a zoom indication at . For example the client device may receive input such as user input which may be received via an operating system of the client device from a user input device of the client device such as a mouse a keyboard or a touch screen indicating a change in the zoom of the client display window. For example the client device may include a touch screen and the indication of the change of the zoom may be received in response to a gesture received by the touch screen.

In some implementations the zoom indication may indicate a change of the portion displayed in the client display window wherein the updated display portion is included within the received rendered display information and the client device may present the updated display portion at . For example the zoom indication may indicate a zoom in of the display portion the client device may scale the zoomed in portion to fit the client display window and the client device may present the zoomed in display portion.

In some implementations the zoom indication may indicate a request to change the portion displayed in the client display window wherein the requested display portion is not included within the received rendered content and the client device may transmit information indicating updated requested display buffer information to the host device at . For example the client device may transmit a new request identifier request id a new requested display buffer size client buffer width client buffer height a new requested buffer position buffer offset x buffer offset y a new scaling factor ratio ratio x ratio y or a combination thereof. For example the scaling factor ratio may be set dynamically.

The host device may render a portion of a representation of the display area of the operating environment of the host device corresponding to the updated requested display buffer information at . The host device may encode the rendered portion at which may include encoding with the same or a different encoding scheme.

The host device may transmit and the client device may receive the updated rendered content at . The client device may decode and present the updated rendered content at .

Although described with reference to an operating environment of the host device scalable buffer remote access may be used for remote presentation at the client device of any content rendered at the host device . For example scalable buffer remote access may be associated with an identified application running at the host device and the client buffer include a portion of the display area of the application.

Other implementations of the diagram of scalable buffer remote access as shown in are available. In implementations additional elements of scalable buffer remote access can be added certain elements can be combined and or certain elements can be removed. For example in an implementation scalable buffer remote access can include an additional element involving determining an encoding mode or the elements at can be skipped and or omitted for one or more frames.
