The subject disclosure relates to wireless communications and also generally to network selection architecture.

The use of mobile devices and the resulting mobile traffic has been growing at a very fast pace and the trend shows no signs of stopping. To meet the mobile traffic growth and improve the end user experience mobile service providers are actively looking for mechanisms to improve network efficiency system capacity and end user experience by cost effectively leveraging all radio technologies including cellular and Wi Fi technologies. The routing of network traffic to a Wi Fi radio or to a cellular radio for example can impact the user experience. For example if the network traffic is routed to a network that is not appropriate for that network traffic it can result in loss of the communication e.g. dropped calls poor services and other negative impacts to the user experience.

Aspects of the subject disclosure will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which example embodiments are shown. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments. However the subject disclosure may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the example embodiments set forth herein.

To meet mobile traffic growth one or more of the disclosed aspects provides a network selection architecture that enables selection of the best available radio technology from all available radio technologies including cellular and Wi Fi technologies for user traffic delivery. The network selection can be based on radio network conditions user subscription profile device mobility state e.g. speed and pattern applications and so on to improve network efficiency. Further the selection can provide a consistent user experience across multiple types of user equipment operating system and original equipment manufacturer OEM manufactures and platforms. One or more of the disclosed aspects also provides application program interfaces APIs that allow for the development of access network discovery and selection function ANDSF carrier clients.

In an embodiment the user equipment device e.g. mobile device makes the decision related to which radio to use when to use that radio and under what conditions to route the user traffic based on one or more attributes or conditions. The decision can be based on one or more of the following an ANDSF policy which can include the 3GPP ANDSF capabilities network conditions and user equipment intelligence cellular network congestion condition and parameters Wi Fi network congestion condition and or mobile device information including battery usage mobile device relative movement with respect to a Wi Fi access point e.g. speed vibration patterns mobile device relative movement with respect to a cellular access point and so on. Instructions can also be provided as to how to route the user traffic to the selected radio on a per application basis. The instructions can be combined with a user preference and the traffic routing function can be performed e.g. binding user application flow to a radio based in part on the combination.

In another embodiment the mobile device makes the decision based on dynamic cellular network conditions and parameters obtained from the cellular network via cell broadcast CB or system information block SIB using a new message or new attributes on an existing message. The dynamic cellular conditions can include load information signal strength thresholds e.g. reference signal received power reference signal code power RSRP RSCP received signal strength indication RSSI and or subscriber profile based offset to signal strength thresholds percentage.

In a further embodiment the mobile device makes the decision based on Wi Fi access point conditions e.g. basic service set BSS load condition RSSI and wireless access network WAN metrics via HotSpot2.0 and or performance measurement over the Wi Fi network e.g. round trip time RTT delay jitter packet loss and so on .

Wireless communications environment includes one or more cellular broadcast servers and one or more Wi Fi access points deployed within the wireless communications environment and servicing one or more user equipment devices . Each wireless communications network e.g. cellular broadcast servers and Wi Fi access points comprises one or more network devices e.g. a set of network devices that operate in conjunction in order to process network traffic for the one or more user equipment devices . For example cellular broadcast servers can comprise a set of network devices that are cellular enabled network devices. In another example the Wi Fi access points can include a set of network devices that are Wi Fi enabled devices.

As illustrated each of the one or more Wi Fi access points has a corresponding service area . Further each of the one or more cellular broadcast servers has a corresponding service area . However it should be understood that the wireless communications environment is not limited to this implementation. Instead any number of Wi Fi access points and respective service areas can be deployed within the wireless communications environment . Further any number of cellular broadcast servers and respective service areas can be deployed within the wireless communications network.

Further although only five user equipment devices are illustrated any number of user devices can be deployed within the wireless communications environment . A user equipment device may contain some or all of the functionality of a system subscriber unit subscriber station mobile station mobile wireless terminal device mobile device remote station remote terminal access terminal user terminal terminal wireless communication device wireless communication apparatus user agent user device or user equipment UE . A mobile device can be a cellular telephone a cordless telephone a Session Initiation Protocol SIP phone a smart phone a feature phone a wireless local loop WLL station a personal digital assistant PDA a laptop a handheld communication device a handheld computing device a netbook a tablet a satellite radio a data card a wireless modem card and or another processing device for communicating over a wireless system. In addition the user equipment devices can include functionality as more fully described herein.

In one aspect cellular broadcast servers and Wi Fi access points can monitor their surrounding radio conditions e.g. by employing respective measurement components . For example each of the cellular broadcast servers and Wi Fi access points can determine network traffic load on its respective network by performing a network diagnostic procedure. As an example during a network listen procedure cellular broadcast servers and Wi Fi access points can scan their radio environment to determine network performance statistics. Various parameters associated with cellular broadcast servers and Wi Fi access points can be detected during the network diagnostic procedure such as but not limited to frequency bands scrambling codes common channel pilot power bandwidth across respective networks universal mobile telecommunications system terrestrial radio access receive signal strength indicator and so on.

In an example scenario user equipment devices can be serviced by networks through one of the cellular broadcast servers or Wi Fi access points . As a user equipment device is moved within the wireless communications environment the respective user equipment device might be moved in and out of the coverage area of the associated serving network. For example as a user is sending receiving communications through their respective user equipment device the user might be walking riding in a car riding on a train moving around a densely populated urban area e.g. a large city wherein the movement might cause the mobile device to be moved between various wireless communications networks. In such cases it is beneficial to route the network traffic e.g. handoff from a serving network to a target network in order to continue the communication e.g. avoid dropped calls .

Depending on location user equipment devices can have the option to connect to any number of networks. In one scenario one of the cellular broadcast servers can service all the user equipment devices which can cause excessive load on the respective cellular broadcast server which in turn can cause user equipment devices to potentially have a negative user experience.

In an aspect user equipment devices can connect to any available network based on real time or near real time network condition statistics and an intelligent network selection policy. Continuing with an example scenario user equipment device for example can determine Wi Fi access point or Wi Fi access point offer a higher quality of experience and user equipment device can connect to the selected Wi Fi access point based in part on a network selection policy. Further to this example user equipment device might determine cellular broadcast server or cellular broadcast server offer a higher quality of experience and user equipment device can connect to the selected cellular broadcast server based in part on the network selection policy. According to another aspect user equipment device might split its communication traffic flows and use a selected Wi Fi access point for a set of communication traffic flows and use a selected cellular broadcast server for another set of communication traffic flows.

In some situations when an option is available where a particular user equipment device can be serviced by either a cellular broadcast server or a Wi Fi access point the Wi Fi access point might automatically be selected. For example the user equipment device might have user preferences established which indicates that when a Wi Fi network is available network traffic of the user equipment device should be routed to the Wi Fi network. Such user preference might be established because in some cases there is no associated cost to the user of the user equipment device when a Wi Fi network is utilized as compared to usage of a cellular network. Thus the network traffic of the user equipment device is automatically routed to the Wi Fi network regardless of the load on the Wi Fi network and or other considerations which could result in a negative user experience e.g. dropped communications poor communications and so on .

However according to some aspects discussed herein rather than automatically connecting to a Wi Fi access point other considerations can be utilized to route the network traffic of the user equipment device to the Wi Fi network or to determine that the network traffic should remain on the cellular network and or move to a different cellular network or Wi Fi network. For example instead of moving to the Wi Fi network automatically when the Wi Fi network is available a comparison is made between the Wi Fi network and a cellular network. If the Wi Fi network is more congested than the cellular network the user traffic of the user equipment device can be routed to the cellular network. However if it is determined that the Wi Fi network is not as congested as the cellular network or both networks have about the same level of congestion the user traffic of the user equipment device can be routed to the Wi Fi network.

According to various aspects discussed herein a user equipment device can continuously periodically or based on other temporal conditions receive data indicative of network statistics e.g. traffic load or congestion on the network capability of the network and so on . As network performance changes a user equipment device can determine that at least a portion of its respective network traffic should be routed to a different network. The determination can be made based on real time or near real time network statistics.

In accordance with an implementation a user equipment device can be configured to perform dynamic intelligent network selection per service provided based on a combination of an access network discovery and selection function policy network conditions and intelligence associated with the user equipment device. For example the user equipment device can autonomously determine under what conditions to route network traffic and to which network e.g. Wi Fi radio or cellular radio the network traffic should be routed on a per application basis e.g. by splitting traffic flows . The decision can be made in such a manner that the decision has a positive impact on the user experience.

The access network discovery and selection function policy can be received from a network server that can be configured to push e.g. broadcast the information to the user equipment device. The network selection policy can include logic that can instruct the user equipment device to select a network based at least in part on network statistics which can include network conditions and load conditions e.g. network congestion . According to some implementations one or more network collection agents can monitor multiple networks and can periodically continuously e.g. repeatedly push updated network statistic information to the user equipment device. Such periodic and or continuous updates can enable real time or near real time knowledge of the network conditions by the user equipment device.

Further according to the various aspects described herein the network selection can be based in part on an operator policy driven intelligent network selection and traffic steering capability based on the network conditions and the user equipment device intelligence that offers optimal or as close to optimal as possible and consistent user experience across all user equipment UE operating system OS original equipment manufacturer OEM platforms and manufactures.

User equipment devices can communicate with each other and with other elements via a network for instance a wireless network or a wireline network. A network can include broadband wide area networks such as cellular networks local area networks wireless local area networks e.g. Wi Fi and personal area networks such as near field communication networks including BLUETOOTH . Communication across a network can be packet based however radio and frequency amplitude modulation networks can enable communication between communication devices using appropriate analog digital analog converters and other elements. Communication is enabled by hardware elements called transceivers. User equipment devices can have more than one transceiver capable of communicating over different networks. For example a cellular telephone can include a cellular transceiver for communicating with a cellular base station a Wi Fi transceiver for communicating with a Wi Fi network and a BLUETOOTH transceiver for communicating with a BLUETOOTH device. A Wi Fi network is accessible via access points such as wireless routers etc. that communicate with the Wi Fi transceiver to send and receive data. The Wi Fi network can further be connected to the internet or other packet based networks. The bandwidth of a network connection or an access point is a measure of the rate of data transfer and can be expressed as a quantity of data transferred per unit of time. Additionally communication e.g. voice traffic and or data traffic between one or more components can include wired communications e.g. routed through a backhaul broadband wired network an optical fiber backbone twisted pair line T1 E1 phone line digital subscriber line coaxial cable and or the like and or radio broadcasts e.g. cellular channels Wi Fi channels satellite channels and or the like .

A network can include a plurality of elements that host logic for performing tasks on the network. The logic can be hosted on servers according to an aspect. In packet based wide area networks servers may be placed at several logical points on the network. Servers may further be in communication with databases and can enable communication devices to access the contents of a database. Billing servers and application servers are examples of such servers. A server can include several network elements including other servers and can be logically situated anywhere on a service provider s network such as the back end of a cellular network. A server hosts or is in communication with a database hosting an account for a user of a mobile device. The user account includes several attributes for a particular user including a unique identifier of the mobile device s owned by the user relationships with other users application usage location personal settings business rules bank accounts and other information.

It is noted that although one or more computer executable components may be described herein and illustrated as components separate from the at least one memory e.g. operatively connected to memory in accordance with various embodiments the one or more computer executable components could be stored in the at least one memory . Further while various components have been illustrated as separate components it will be appreciated that multiple components can be implemented as a single component or a single component can be implemented as multiple components without departing from example embodiments.

System also includes an evaluation manager component that can be configured to compare one or more parameters associated with two or more wireless networks. According to an implementation parameters associated with a first network can be compared to parameters associated with a second network and or a parameters associated with subsequent e.g. third fourth networks. For example the one or more parameters associated with the communications networks can include congestion conditions and network parameter conditions. According to an aspect the one or more parameters can include network load information. In accordance with another aspect the one or more parameters can include bandwidth utilization of the network e.g. 3G 4G long term evolution and so on . Other parameters can include peak usage times available bandwidth of a network a number of requests received by a network resource as well as other metrics.

In an implementation a first wireless network can include network devices that are cellular enabled devices e.g. a cellular network and a second wireless network can include network devices that are Wi Fi enabled devices e.g. a Wi Fi network . Parameters related to the cellular networks can include cellular network congestion condition and parameters received through cell broadcast or a system information block s . Dynamic cellular conditions include load information signal strength thresholds and or subscriber profile based offset to signal strength threshold percentages. Parameters related to the Wi Fi networks can include Wi Fi network access point conditions such as BSSI load condition RSSI and WAN metrics and or performance measurements over the Wi Fi network.

The evaluation manager component can also be configured to compare the one or more network parameters associated with the two or more wireless networks with one or more parameters associated with the user equipment device. The one or more parameters of the user equipment device can include usage information e.g. applications being executed e.g. running on the user equipment device . The parameters can also include a movement parameter of the user equipment device. The movement parameter can relate to whether the user equipment device is stationary or moving and if moving a speed at which the device is being moved and or a direction to which the device is being moved. The speed and or direction of the device can be analyzed with respect to a location of a cellular network and or a Wi Fi network according to an implementation. For example if the user equipment device is being moved toward a network that network might be favored over a network that the device is being moved away from or not directly headed toward. In an example speed and or movement of the device can be determined based on a vibration pattern of the device. Other parameters can include user preferences and or settings associated with the selection of a network for routing of network traffic. Further parameters can include a battery usage and or remaining battery capability e.g. battery life .

Also included in system is a selection manager component that can be configured to determine which radio technology and associated set of network devices should be chosen such that at least a portion of the network traffic of the user equipment also referred to as user traffic is routed to the selected network e.g. by a routing manager component . For example the comparison performed by the evaluation manager component can produce various possible results. For example a first possible result can be that at least a portion of the network traffic of the user equipment device should be routed to a first set of network devices e.g. a first set of target devices which are associated with a first radio technology. Further a second possible result can be that the portion of the network traffic or another portion of network traffic of the user equipment device should be routed to a second set of network devices e.g. a second set of target devices which are associated with a second radio technology.

The determination performed by selection manager component can comply with a network selection policy received from a network device that currently provides a service to the user equipment device e.g. a set of source devices . In an implementation complying with the network selection policy can include observing discovery information and selection policies of the serving network e.g. set of serving devices . The discovery information can relate to one or more traffic routing rules established by the serving network. According to some implementations instructions related to the network selection policy e.g. how to route the user traffic can be combined with a user preference in order for the selection manager component to make the network determination.

In an example a cellular network and or a Wi Fi network might be chosen as a result of the cellular network condition when combined with the Wi Fi condition for the determination. For example if the cellular network is loaded e.g. high congestion and the Wi Fi network is not congested under that condition the Wi Fi network can be chosen. However if the cellular network is not congested and also the Wi Fi network is not congested the cellular network might be chosen. Thus the decision is made in part based on comparison of both the networks.

The routing manager component is configured to route one or more portions of the network traffic of the user equipment device to the set of network devices chosen by the selection manager component . For example the routing manager component can be configured to change functionality of the user equipment device from a cellular connectivity function to a Wi Fi connectivity function. In another example the routing manager component can be configured to change the functionality of the user equipment device from a Wi Fi connectivity function to a cellular connectivity function. The routing manager component is configured to perform the appropriate signaling between a source network and the target network to enable seamless handoff or routing of the user network traffic.

According to an implementation the routing manager component is configured to route a first set of network traffic of the user equipment device e.g. a first set of traffic flows to a first network and to route a second set of network traffic of the user equipment device e.g. a second set of traffic flows to a second network. For example a cellular network might be congested and therefore some of the traffic of the user equipment device can be kept on or routed to a LTE network for example. At the same time a media application or video sharing application might be executing on the user equipment device and this set of traffic can be routed to or kept on a Wi Fi network. In such a manner different sets of traffic flows of the user equipment device can be split wherein some of the traffic flows are routed to a cellular network while other traffic flows are routed to a Wi Fi network. Such splitting of the traffic flows can be determined based in part on the network policy such as a network selection policy for example.

Included in system is an intelligent network selection function INS function that makes a network selection decision as to which radio when and under what conditions network traffic of the user equipment device should be routed based on different types of input. In order to perform this selection function various information should be received at the user equipment device and or generated by the user equipment device. Examples of information received at the user equipment device include network congestion conditions and or network parameter conditions. Examples of information generated by the user equipment device include usage information and movement parameters of the user equipment device.

A first input received by system can be a service provider access network discovery and selection function policy which can be received by an access network discovery and selection function ANDSF function . The service provider access network discovery and selection function policy can be received through an S14 interface for example. The access network discovery and selection function policy can include according to an implementation the 3GPP access network discovery selection function capabilities and enhancements such as network conditions and user equipment device intelligence. The selection manager component of utilizes the access network discovery and selection function policy to perform selection of a radio network e.g. a radio technology .

Another input to the system can be a cellular network congestion condition and one or more cellular network parameters. This input can be received by at a cell broadcast CB system information block SIB function illustrated as CB SIB function . The network conditions and parameters can be transmitted through a cell broadcast or a system information block. The CB SIB function can be a cellular network intelligent function on the user equipment device that receives and or extracts various dynamic cellular network condition s and or parameter s from the cellular network. Such cellular network conditions s and or parameter s can be obtained through the CB or SIB using a new message or new attributes on an existing message for example.

A cellular network condition can relate to load information which can be in the format of a load flag. For example the load flag can be color coded e.g. red yellow green and so forth to indicate the amount of network traffic e.g. load on that particular cellular network. In another example another manner of indicating the load information on the cellular network can be utilized e.g. a pie chart a line chart based on a number of lights illuminated and so on .

Another cellular network condition can relate to signal strength thresholds. For example a signal strength threshold is a reference signal received power RSRP over the reference signal subcarriers in a long term evolution LTE implementation. In another example a signal strength threshold can be a reference received signal code power RSCP in a universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS implementation.

A cellular network profile can relate to a subscriber profile based offset to signal strength thresholds. For example a user equipment device associated with a first signal strength threshold can be ranked differently than another user equipment device associated with a second signal strength threshold. In an implementation the various thresholds can be associated with different colors. For example the first signal strength threshold can be coded as a gold user and the second signal strength threshold can be coded as a silver user wherein the gold user has a different offset from the silver user.

Another cellular network condition or profile can be a percentage that can be used to move portions or sets of the user equipment devices between cellular networks and Wi Fi networks. For example a threshold level of a number or percentage of users that can be adequately serviced by a particular network might be utilized. According to this implementation when the threshold level or threshold percentage is reached or almost reached no new user equipment devices might be routed to that network until the amount of user equipment devices serviced by the network is below the threshold level. In an example the percentage can be indicative of a congestion percentage e.g. based on total available bandwidth used bandwidth or capable bandwidth verses used bandwidth .

Another input can be a Wi Fi network congestion condition and one or more Wi Fi network parameters illustrated as a Wi Fi function . The Wi Fi function can relate to a Wi Fi network condition function on the user equipment device that receives and or extract Wi Fi access point conditions. One condition can be a basic service set BSS load condition. Another condition can be a received signal strength indicator RSSI . A further condition can be wireless access node WAN metrics via HotSpot2.0. Another condition can be a performance measurement over the Wi Fi network which can include round trip time RTT delay jitter packet loss and so on.

The CB SIB function and the Wi Fi function represent network information . Such network information can be utilized by the evaluation manager component of to perform the comparison. For example the network information is utilized with the information obtained related to the user equipment device to perform the comparison.

A further input can be user equipment device intelligence. Such information can include applications executing on the user equipment device. For example some applications might be better served by a cellular radio e.g. cellular network while other applications might execute well on either cellular networks or Wi Fi networks. If an application executing on the user equipment device might not function properly on a Wi Fi network the decision to route the network traffic to the Wi Fi network might be delayed and or disabled according to an aspect. In another example traffic flows might be split so that some traffic flows utilize the Wi Fi network while other traffic flows utilize the cellular network.

Another input can include user preferences . For example a user preference might be to route the network traffic to a Wi Fi network whenever a Wi Fi network is available. Such user preference is taken into consideration when a determination is made whether or not to route the network traffic to a Wi Fi network. In some instances the traffic will not be routed to the Wi Fi network even though the Wi Fi network is available and is preferred by the user e.g. user preference .

A connection manager can be included as a portion of the user equipment device operating system OS . The connection manager can comprise instructions or actions on how to route user traffic to the proper radio e.g. Wi Fi radio or cellular radio on a per application basis e.g. as a function of the applications executing or expected to be executed on the user equipment device by splitting the traffic flows. It is noted that the term connection manager can refer to any entity that performs a traffic routing function e.g. such as a routing manager component . For example connection manager can refer to an entity that binds user application flow to a radio. The connection manager can be a native connection manager a connectivity engine or the like.

User equipment device intelligence can relate to intelligent network selection e.g. INS function which can relate to various information that can be known or generated internal to the user equipment device. Such intelligence can include battery usage level e.g. amount of battery life remaining statistics as to the amount of battery being consumed for various applications and or programs executing on the user equipment device and so on . Another example of user equipment device intelligence relates to the user equipment device relative movement to the Wi Fi access point. The relative movement can include speed vibration patterns and so on. For example relative movement can relate to whether the user equipment device is stationary or is moving and if moving the speed at which the user equipment device is being moved. In another example the relative movement can relate to a direction that the user equipment device is being moved relative to the locations of the various radio networks. This information can be received from the connection manager illustrated at according to an aspect.

As discussed above the connection manager is a generic term that refers to an entity that takes the input from the user preference and operator intelligent network selection instruction and performs a traffic routing function. For example the connection manager can bind user application flow to a radio e.g. cellular radio and or Wi Fi radio . The connection manager can be a native connection manager a connectively engine or the like.

System can be configured to enable the service provider to provide seamless policy driven intelligent network selection that takes into account the network condition and the user equipment device intelligence. System can also provide a consistent user experience across many different types of manufacturers and platforms. Further the disclosed aspects can improve overall network efficiency. In addition by separating the areas of concerns the intelligent network selection can be decoupled from the operating system which enables faster implementation for user equipment devices.

The APIs are utilized as enablers that provide the necessary information and or support for the various components to perform network selection according to an aspect. The user equipment device architecture utilizes the operating system or lower layer components e.g. chipset or connectivity engine to expose the various APIs to allow for the service provider intelligent network selection function to collect intelligence from the network and the user equipment device and to instruct the connection manager on action that should be taken.

The operating system and or connection manager notifies a CB SIB client of the received cellular load information along with other parameters as discussed herein and sets up a data path to deliver the load to the CB SIB client function of . The cellular network condition includes but is not limited to load information signal strength thresholds usage subscriber profile offset and so on. The Wi Fi API obtains Wi Fi access point conditions such as BSS and WAN metrics and so forth from the operating system or from a lower layer.

A user equipment device intelligence API obtains the user equipment local information. This information can include battery usage relative movement to Wi Fi access point speed vibration patterns and so on from the operating system to other applications.

Also included is an access network discovery and selection function client ANDSF client that performs a policy decision function PDF . The decision as to which network the network traffic should be routed can be selected in order to comply with the access network discovery and selection function policy as discussed herein. Consideration is also given to a user preference which can indicate a preference of a particular type of network over another type of network.

The intelligent network selection API class provides the operator s policy to the connection manager . This information allows the connection manager to route applications to a specific radio e.g. WLAN radio and or cellular radio . The intelligent network selection API binds an application with a corresponding radio based on operator policies and or user preferences. Such binding can result in different sets of network traffic flows of the user equipment device being split between two or more networks e.g. a first set of traffic flows is routed to a first network and a second set of traffic flows is routed to a second network .

For example each communications network of the one or more communications networks can monitor parameters related to network congestion and or other network parameters. According to an implementation the parameters can include but are not limited to traffic load over the network and available bandwidth of the network. Other parameters can include but are not limited to signal strength thresholds received signal strength indications and or subscriber profile based offset to signal strength thresholds percentage.

Receiver component or another system component can be configured to obtain network selection policy information for a serving network e.g. from a network device that provides a service to the user equipment device . The network selection policy information can include discovery information and selection policies of the serving network .

For example the serving network can comprise an access network discovery and selection function server that can utilize network security techniques to communicate securely with a selected group of user equipment devices. For example access network discovery and selection function server can authenticate select user equipment devices and allow only those user equipment devices that are serviced by a particular service provider to communicate with the access network discovery and selection function server . Further access network discovery and selection function server can utilize secure channels encoded channels encrypted channels and the like to perform communications within a wireless network environment.

Access network discovery and selection function server can create and determine network traffic steering rules or routing rules . The network traffic steering rules can be created for individual user equipment devices or for groups of user equipment devices. In one or more implementations access network discovery and selection function server can create group network traffic steering rules for groups of user equipment devices based on for example subscription profiles quality of service agreements user equipment device type user equipment device capabilities and so on.

According to an implementation a network traffic steering rule can include instructions to guide a user equipment device in connection with radio access network selection. For example a traffic steering rule can include instructions for radio access network selection based on network load condition mobility states user equipment device hardware metrics user equipment device performance metrics and so on.

The access network discovery and selection function server can create one or more traffic steering rules when a new subscription is created when a subscription is modified when a user equipment device location changes and so forth. Thus access network discovery and selection function server can create and or modify traffic steering rules and store the traffic steering rules in one or more data stores e.g. a library for future use. It is noted that although an access network discovery and selection function server is illustrated and described as an exemplary component system can utilize various servers components and or articles of manufacture to perform the same or substantially the same functions as access network discovery and selection function server as discussed herein.

In some implementations access network discovery and selection function server can communicate traffic steering policies to the user equipment device. In one aspect access network discovery and selection function server can assist user equipment device in discovery of non third generation partnership project access networks e.g. Wi Fi or worldwide interoperability for microwave access . In another aspect access network discovery and selection function server can select appropriate traffic steering policies for a user equipment device and issue the policies. In one aspect access network discovery and selection function server selects the traffic steering rule based on a user subscription a user account or other classification associated with user equipment device. In another aspect access network discovery and selection function server communicates the appropriate traffic steering policy over a communication framework. In an aspect access network discovery and selection function server can communicate directly with user equipment device through a server to client connection e.g. standard S14 interface . However access network discovery and selection function server can communicate with user equipment device through an indirect connection a cellular broadcast and the like in accordance with some implementations.

The policy information provided by the access network discovery and selection function server can be retained in the one or more data stores . According to an implementation one or more data stores can be integrated with the evaluation manager component and or memory . In another implementation one or more data stores can be located external to but accessible by the evaluation manager component and or memory . It is noted that a data store can include volatile memory or nonvolatile memory or can include both volatile memory and nonvolatile memory. By way of illustration and not limitation nonvolatile memory can include read only memory programmable read only memory electrically programmable read only memory electrically erasable programmable read only memory or flash memory. Volatile memory can include random access memory which can operate as external cache memory. By way of illustration and not limitation random access memory is available in many forms such as static random access memory dynamic random access memory synchronous dynamic random access memory double data rate synchronous dynamic random access memory enhanced synchronous dynamic random access memory Synchlink dynamic random access memory and direct Rambus random access memory. The memory e.g. data stores databases and so on of the various disclosed aspects is intended to comprise without being limited to these and any other suitable types of memory.

The evaluation manager component can also receive information related to the user equipment device. For example usage of the user equipment device can be received by the evaluation manager component . The usage can indicate how the device is being used e.g. voice call data call streaming video surfing the Internet and so forth . The usage can also indicate the applications being executed on the user equipment device wherein more than one application might be executing at any particular time. Some applications might perform better e.g. have a better connectivity with a cellular network and other applications might perform as expected on either a cellular network or a Wi Fi network. According to an implementation traffic flows of the user equipment device can be split between radio networks as discussed herein.

Other information related to the user equipment device and received by the evaluation manager component can be one or more mobility parameters of the user equipment device. A mobility parameter can relate to whether the user equipment device is stationary or is moving and if moving a speed at which the user equipment device is being moved. For example the user equipment device might be stationary e.g. a user of the user equipment device is sitting at her desk . In another example the user equipment device might be moved and traveling at different speeds which can be a function of the mode of transportation e.g. walking riding a bicycle in a car on a train in a airplane and so on .

Another parameter relates to the direction that the user equipment device is being moved. The direction can be a horizontal direction which can be associated with cardinal directions or cardinal points e.g. north south east west or intermediate points . Further the direction can include an altitude or changes in the height of the user equipment device. For example the user equipment device might be traveling in an elevator and a range of one network might not reach all points along that altitude e.g. connectivity is only enabled at the higher locations .

An analysis component can be configured to compare the information related to the networks and the information related to the user equipment device. For example if a network has a congestion condition that is near or approaching a maximum congestion level that network might be removed from consideration. In another example if the user equipment device is being moved toward a network the evaluation manager component and or analysis component can take into consideration the movement of the user equipment device and might give more consideration to the one or more networks that are expected to be located along the movement path of the user equipment device.

A policy component can be configured to review the recommendation provided by the analysis component and determine if the selected network complies with the access network discovery and selection function policy of the serving network . According to some aspects the policy component ascertains whether a network conforms to the policy before the analysis component analyzes the information related to the network. Thus if a particular network does not conform to the policy that particular network is not considered by the analysis component . Further information related to that network is not obtained or is disregarded if such information is obtained .

Based on the recommendation of the analysis component a selection manager component can determine to which radio technology or radio network e.g. set of network devices the network traffic of the user equipment device should be routed. For example the comparison by the analysis component might reveal that although various network could properly service the user equipment device based on user preferences only cellular networks should be used. In another example based on user preferences Wi Fi networks should be used where feasible. In a further example based on an application or multiple applications executing on the user equipment device a particular radio technology or more than one radio technology can be selected for at least a portion of the user traffic.

A routing manager component provides the appropriate signaling to the source network and the target network in order to route at least a portion of the network traffic of the user equipment device to the selected network. Such signaling can utilize various types of signaling as a function of the network types and other parameters and these signaling techniques will not be discussed herein for purposes of simplicity.

According to some implementations the various aspects disclosed herein can utilize an artificial intelligence component not shown which can facilitate automating one or more features in accordance with the disclosed aspects. As discussed herein the disclosed aspects have a wide application and can provide consistent implementations across different device original equipment manufacturers and or operating systems. The disclosed aspects in connection with monitoring analyzing and comparing device network traffic usage can employ various artificial intelligence based schemes for carrying out various aspects thereof. For example a process for receiving network congestion conditions and parameters comparing the network congestion conditions and parameters with one or more usage and one or more movement parameters of a user equipment device can be facilitated with an example automatic classifier system and process.

An example classifier can be a function that maps an input attribute vector x x1 x2 x3 x4 xn to a confidence that the input belongs to a class that is f x confidence class . Such classification can employ a probabilistic and or statistical based analysis e.g. factoring into the analysis utilities and costs to prognose or infer an action that can be automatically performed. In the case of communication systems for example attributes can be types of radio networks congestion thresholds and the classes can be a type of traffic usage e.g. voice traffic data traffic short message service traffic and so on the amount of network traffic usage the expected location of a user equipment device based on a movement parameter and so on.

A support vector machine is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The support vector machine can operate by finding a hypersurface in the space of possible inputs which the hypersurface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non triggering events. Intuitively this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near but not identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches include for example na ve Bayes Bayesian networks decision trees neural networks fuzzy logic models and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also may be inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.

The disclosed aspects can employ classifiers that are explicitly trained e.g. via a generic training data as well as implicitly trained e.g. via observing usage of the user equipment device by observing a movement pattern of the user equipment device and so on . For example support vector machines can be configured via a learning or training phase within a classifier constructor and feature selection module. Thus the classifier s can be used to automatically learn and perform a number of functions including but not limited to ascertaining network traffic should be routed from a source network to a target network determining the user equipment device is likely to be moved into the coverage area of one or more networks determining an application executing on the user equipment device or anticipated to be executed on the user equipment device can be supported by a particular network and so forth. Further functions can include but are not limited to gathering information e.g. network traffic usage information network congestion information from a group of devices e.g. a set of network devices aggregating the data gathered from the subject user equipment device comparing two or more networks to determine the most appropriate network for routing of the network traffic and so on. The criteria can include but is not limited to a type of network traffic patterns associated with network traffic usage and so on.

For example if the mobile device is moving in a particular direction the network might be selected at least in part by the relative movement of the mobile device toward that network. Thus according to an implementation the comparison can include analyzing relative movement of the mobile device with respect to a first set of network devices and a second sect of network devices. In an aspect the analyzing includes detecting a speed and a direction of the mobile device. According to another aspect the analyzing includes detecting a vibration pattern of the mobile device.

The first possible result can cause the network traffic of the mobile device to be routed to the first set of network devices at . The second possible result can cause the network traffic of the mobile device to be routed to the second set of network devices at . The network traffic is routed to the selected network at e.g. using a routing manager component .
