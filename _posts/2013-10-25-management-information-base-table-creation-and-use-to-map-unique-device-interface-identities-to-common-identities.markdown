The present disclosure relates to computer systems and in particular to managing devices within a networked system.

Facilities devices such as a uninterruptable power supplies power distribution units remote power panels cooling equipment generators etc oftentimes provide communication interfaces that enable various operational parameters of the devices to be monitored by a computer management system. However there currently does not exist a standard approach for accessing such parameters. Instead different manufacturers provide different application programming interfaces or other interfaces for reading querying or otherwise accessing parameter values also referred to herein as variables . Moreover different manufacturers products and or versions of the same product may use different variable names when referring to the same type of parameter e.g. input temperature output temperature power consumption particular type of operational fault alarm etc. . Consequently integrating new devices into a management system can be a laborious process and require operator expertise with both the management system and the particular devices.

Some embodiments disclosed herein are directed to a management information base MIB mapping controller that maps requests from a common access interface containing common interface variables to device interface variables that address interfaces of electronic devices. The MIB mapping controller includes a processor and a memory having computer readable program code that when executed by the processor causes the processor to perform operations that include discovering presence of an electronic device accessible through a network connected to the MIB mapping controller. A MIB table contains information mapping device interface variables that address interfaces of electronic devices to common interface variables received through common access interface. The MIB table is accessed to determine whether the MIB table contains particular information mapping a device interface variable of the electronic device to one of the common interface variables received through the common access interface. Responsive to determining that the MIB table does not contain the particular information new information is determined that maps the device interface variable of the electronic device to one of the common interface variables received through the common access interface. The new information is added to the MIB table.

Some embodiments are directed to a management system for managing communications with electronic devices and more particularly to identifying and managing communications between the unique interface variables of electronic devices and a common set of interface variable that are known and used by a human operator or electronic system to access values of the electronic devices without having to know the unique interface variables of the electronic devices.

An example facility management system is shown in as including a management system a Management Information Base MIB mapping controller a MIB table and various electronic devices that include an uninterruptible power supply UPS device a cooling device a power distribution unit PDU and another electronic device . Although four electronic devices are shown in the system may include any number of electronic devices and operational types of electronic devices e.g. remote power panels power generators power conditioners fluid gas pressure monitors regulators mechanical electro mechanical actuator controllers environmental electrical optical sensors etc. .

The management system may include but is not limited a simple network management protocol SNMP based management system. SNMP is an Internet standard protocol for managing devices on Internet protocol IP networks. SNMP exposes management data in the form of interface object identities OIDs which can then be queried or set changed through the common access interface . Although various embodiments are described in the context of a SNMP the management system is not limited to SNMP and may alternatively or additionally be a Modbus based management system and or a BACnet based management system. A Modbus based management system exposes management data in the form of registers and a BACnet based management system exposes management data as points. Accordingly to support SNMP Modbus and BACnet the MIB table can provide mapping from SNMP OIDs to device interface variables from Modbus registers to device interface variables and from BACnet points to device interface variables respectively where the device interface variables correspond to the unique interface variables of different ones of the electronic devices being monitored and or controlled.

Moreover although embodiments are described in the context of facilities devices the system may more generally be used to control any type of electronic devices including but not limited to network routers network switches network server computers user computers peripheral devices e.g. printers scanners IP telephones IP video cameras and communication modems interfaces.

The management system can obtain data values from and may further provide data values to interfaces of the electronic devices through one or more communication networks e.g. one or more wired and or wireless interfaces to local area networks and or wide area networks which may include segments of the Internet . The management system provides a common access interface through which a human operator and or an electronic system can use common interface variables to request data values from individual ones of the electronic devices to monitor their status and provide data values to individual ones of the electronic devices to control their operation.

Each of the electronic devices may provide different device interface variables which address application programming interfaces APIs or other interfaces for reading querying writing changing or otherwise accessing parameter values also referred to herein as data values . Moreover different manufacturers products and or versions of the same type of electronic device e.g. two different manufacturers of UPS devices and may use device interface variables when addressing the same type of interface data e.g. input temperature output temperature power consumption voltage level particular type of operational fault alarm etc. . Consequently integrating new devices directly into the management system may be a laborious process and require operator expertise with both the management system and the particular electronic devices 

Various embodiments of the present disclosure provide a MIB mapping controller that can operate to facilitate integration of the electronic devices with the management system and facilitate communications between the electronic devices and human operators and or electronic systems that request access e.g. read modify interface values of the electronic devices through the common access interface . The MIB mapping controller can operate to discover or be informed of by an operator e.g. via the common access interface the presence of an electronic device e.g. the UPS device or another one of the electronic devices that is accessible through the network s . The electronic device can be identified through communication between the MIB mapping controller and the electronic device and or via an operator setup procedure.

The MIB mapping controller responds to the new presence of the electronic device by accessing a MIB table which contains information that maps device interface variables that addressing interfaces of electronic devices to common interface variables that are received in request through the common access interface to determine whether the MIB table contains particular information mapping a device interface variable of the electronic device to one of the common interface variables that is known outside the management system and provided with requests made through the common access interface .

When the MIB table does not contain the particular information the MIB mapping controller determines new information that maps the device interface variable for the interface of the electronic device to one of the common interface variables that can be received in a request through the common access interface and which is used to commonly refer to at least one interface of each of a plurality of different ones of the electronic devices and adds the new information to the MIB table .

At least some or all of the common interface variables can each be used in requests to access a plurality of different device interface variables. Accordingly a human operator or electronic system can generate a request that references one of the common interface variables without knowing any of the device interface variables that are needed for accessing the particular interfaces of the electronic devices . The MIB mapping controller uses the MIB table to translate the common interface variables to one or more device interface variables which are used to access the desired values of one or more of the electronic devices 

The MIB sub table may further contain value translation information that identifies a plurality of different mathematical operations for translating data values communicated between the common access interface and at least some different ones of the interfaces of the UPS device

The MIB sub table may further contain protocol information that identifies a plurality of different operational protocols used to obtain data values from at least some different ones of the interfaces of the UPS device

Example device interface variables for the sub table for the UPS device may be used to obtain data values representing output power kW power factor internal temperature fault conditions etc. Although the MIB sub table contains four rows corresponding to four different device interface variables addressing four interfaces of the UPS device the MIB sub table may contain information for any number of device interface variables.

Other sub tables may be similarly formatted to the sub table but may contain different numbers of device interface variables and corresponding common interface variables depending upon the number of network accessible interfaces values provided by the respective electronic device and may similarly further contain data value translation information and or protocol information for the associated device interface variables. Example device interface variables for the sub table for the cooling device may be used to obtain data values representing inlet temperature to the cooling device output temperature from the cooling device air flow speed through the cooling device power consumption humidity etc.

The common access interface can receive an access command that contains one of the common interface variables for one of the electronic devices that requests reading e.g. polling of a data value from the interface of the electronic device. The MIB mapping controller receives the command and uses the MIB table to map the common interface variable of the command which does not properly address a desired interface of a desired one of the electronic devices to the device interface variable for the associated interface of the electronic device and obtains one or more data values therefrom e.g. temperature value s power parameter s fault parameter s and or other operational parameter s of the electronic device .

The MIB mapping controller and MIB table may therefore operate to provide interface variable normalization functionality which may provide a more uniform interface between the requests provided to the common access interface and the unique interfaces of the electronic devices . The common access interface may access e.g. read a single data value or a plural set of data values that are defined by and calculated derived from a set of polled data values. The MIB mapping controller can be responsible for storing the associated data values as a time series set of data values which is referenced by one or more common interface variables defined in the MIB table .

In one illustrative example the common access interface may communicate a first access command containing one of the common interface variables associated with sensed device temperature and directed to the UPS device . Although the first access command does not directly address the desired interface of the UPS device which contains the referenced temperature data value and the human operator and or electronic system that provided the first access command may not know the dimensional units e.g. Centigrade Kelvin or Fahrenheit and or protocol used to access the referenced temperature data value the MIB mapping controller accesses the sub table for the UPS device within the MIB table to obtain the corresponding device interface variable for the particular interface of the UPS device and may further operate using protocol information defined therein to obtain the data value via the network from the interface of the UPS device addressed by the common interface variable. The MIB mapping controller may select one of a plurality of different known mathematical operations based on the common interface variable from the first access command translate the data value to a translated data value using the selected one of the plurality of different mathematical operations and communicate the translated data value through common access interface to the human operator and or electronic device that provided the first access command.

The common access interface may then similarly communicate a second access command containing the same common interface variable associated with sensed device temperature but which is now directed to the cooling device . Again the MIB mapping controller accesses the sub table for the cooling device within the MIB table to obtain the corresponding device interface variable for the particular interface of the cooling device and may further operate using protocol information defined therein to obtain the data value via the network from the interface of the cooling device addressed by the common interface variable. The MIB mapping controller may select one of a plurality of different known mathematical operations based on the common interface variable from the first access command translate the data value to a translated data value using the selected one of the plurality of different mathematical operations and communicate the translated data value through common access interface to the human operator and or electronic device that provided the second access command.

The MIB mapping controller may be further configured to receive a single access command through the common access interface and generate a plurality of access operations to a plurality of different interfaces of a same one of the electronic devices and or to one or more interfaces of a plurality of different electronic devices . Thus for example the first and second access command may be combined into a single command resulting in the MIB mapping controller responding to the common access interface with translated data values representing sensed temperatures from interfaces of both of the UPS device and the cooling device

These and other example operations are described in further detail with regard to the operational flowcharts and data flow diagrams of . illustrates example operations by which the MIB mapping controller can generate information entries in the MIB table e.g. generate sub tables for each of the electronic devices . illustrates example operations by which the MIB mapping controller can use the MIB table to facilitate the common access interface accessing data values from the electronic devices. The illustrated operations may similarly be repeated to generate MIB table entries for and or to access other interfaces of the UPS device and or for other ones of the electronic devices 

Referring to the MIB mapping controller discovers block the new presence of the UPS device which is accessible through the network connected to the MIB mapping controller . The MIB mapping controller may discover the UPS device through information provided by an operator of the common access interface and or by one or more conventional device discovery operations block such as for example Bluetooth and or WLAN automatic network device discovery and registration.

The MIB mapping controller accesses block the MIB table to determine whether the MIB table contains particular information mapping a device interface variable for an interface of the UPS device to one of the common interface variables known by a human operator and or electronic system that provides requests through the common access interface . The MIB table responsively searches block for a sub table for the UPS device containing the particular information.

Responsive to the MIB table not containing block the particular information e.g. no sub table has yet been created or does not contain information providing mapping between a newly identified interface of the UPS device and one of the common interface variables the MIB mapping controller determines block new information mapping the device interface variable for the interface of the UPS device to one of the common interface variables. The MIB mapping controller then adds block the new information to the MIB table which the MIB table in turn adds block to the sub table e.g. creating a new sub table or adding a new information entry to an existing sub table for the UPS device

To determine block the new information the MIB mapping controller may pole an interface of the UPS device to obtain a data value and select among the common interface variables based on a characteristic of the data value. The selection may include determining a unit of measurement of the data value and selecting among the common interface variables based on the unit of measurement. Alternatively or additionally the selection may include determining a range of possible values that are obtainable from the interface of the UPS device based on the data value and selecting among the common interface variables based on the range of possible values. Alternatively or additionally the selection may include selecting one of a plurality of value ranges defined by the MIB table e.g. defined by information in sub table within which the data value fits and selecting among the common interface variables based on the selected one of a plurality of value ranges.

The MIB mapping controller may use a network accessible repository of information for use when determining the new information mapping the device interface variable for the interface of the UPS device to one of the common interface variables. For example the MIB mapping controller may communicate with the UPS device via the network to request device identification e.g. manufacturer identifier model identifier version identifier etc. . The MIB mapping controller may determine based on the device identification an Internet address of a repository of information that identifies characteristics of the UPS device and may query the repository of information to obtain a characteristic of the UPS device . The MIB mapping controller can then select among the common interface variables based on the characteristic of the UPS device

Referring now to the MIB mapping controller uses the MIB table to facilitate the common access interface accessing a data value from an interface of the UPS device . The common access interface receives from a human operator and or from an electronic system block an access command containing one of the common interface variables which is provide for receipt block to the MIB mapping controller . The MIB mapping controller performs mapping block using the information contained in the MIB table of the common interface variable from the access command to a particular one of the device interface variables for an interface of the UPS device . The MIB table searches block in the sub table for information that identifies the device interface variable for the interface of the UPS device and provides that information to the MIB mapping controller .

As explained above the MIB table may further contain protocol information e.g. within sub table that identifies a plurality of different operational protocols that can be used by the MIB mapping controller to obtain data values from at least some different ones of the interfaces of the electronic devices. The MIB mapping controller may select block one of the operational protocol based on the common interface variables from the access command in order to be able to properly obtain the data value from interface of the UPS device using a selected proper operational protocol.

The MIB mapping controller obtains a data value from the interface addressed by the device interface variable. The UPS device can receive block one or more access commands e.g. a read command and provide a data value through the interface back to the MIB mapping controller via the network . When the MIB sub table provides operational protocol information the MIB mapping controller may perform the selected operational protocol to obtain the data value via the network from the interface of the UPS device addressed by the particular one of the device interface variables.

As explained above the MIB table may further contain translation information e.g. within sub table that identifies a plurality of different mathematical operations that can be used by the MIB mapping controller for translating data values between the MIB common access interface and at least some different ones of the interfaces of the electronic devices.

The MIB mapping controller may select block one of the mathematical operations based on the common interface variable from the access command translating the data value to a translated data value using the selected mathematical operation.

The MIB mapping controller communicates block the data value or when translated the translated data value towards the MIB common access interface . The common access interface receives and forwards block the received data value translated data value to the human operator via an operator interface and or the electronic system that provided the access request. For example the common access interface may display on a display device the data value translated data value and or another value that is generated based thereon for review by a human operator and or may communicate the data value translated data value or another value generated based thereon to an electronic system. The common access interface may receive and provide responsive control commands to control operation of the UPS device and or another one of the electronic devices responsive to the data value translated data value.
