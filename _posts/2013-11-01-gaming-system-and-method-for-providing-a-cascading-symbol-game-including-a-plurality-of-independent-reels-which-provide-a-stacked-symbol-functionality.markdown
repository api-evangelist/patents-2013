This application is a continuation of claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 271 504 filed on Nov. 14 2008 the entire contents of which is incorporated by reference herein.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the photocopy reproduction of the patent document or the patent disclosure in exactly the form it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

Gaming machines which provide players awards in primary or base games are well known. Gaming machines generally require the player to place or make a wager to activate the primary or base game. In many of these gaming machines the award is based on the player obtaining a winning symbol or symbol combination and is also based on the amount of the wager e.g. the higher the wager the higher the award . Generally symbols or symbol combinations which are less likely to occur provide higher awards. In such known gaming machines the amount of the wager made on the base game by the player can vary.

Certain known gaming machines provide reel games implemented using a plurality of independent reels wherein each independent reel is configured to generate a single symbol for a spin of the reel. Such gaming machines display the plurality of independent reels in a matrix or other arrangement of independent reels. For a play of a game provided by such gaming machines the gaming machine generates and displays a plurality of symbols by spinning each independent reel. The gaming machine provides an award for any winning symbol or winning symbol combination displayed by the plurality of independent reels.

Symbol stacking in a reel game is also known. Symbol stacking is implemented by forming stacks of one or more identical symbols in adjacent symbol positions of a reel strip utilized by a single reel. The identical symbols on the same single reel are adjacent to each other and thus stacked. For example in a slot game with three rows of symbols three cherry symbols may appear adjacent to each other on a reel to form a stack of three cherry symbols. For a spin of the stacked reel of such a slot game part or all of a stack of symbols can be displayed in a viewing area of the gaming machine. In one known slot gaming device when a gaming machine generates stacks of symbols that are identical on three or more adjacent reels multiple winning symbol combinations can be formed and the gaming machine can provide large payouts to the player if portions of one or more stacks of symbols are displayed.

Gaming machines which provide cascading symbol games are also known. In one such cascading symbol game a gaming machine generates and displays a plurality of symbols in a plurality of symbol positions. The gaming machine evaluates the displayed symbols and provides an award for each winning symbol combination formed. The gaming machine then removes the displayed symbols that form the winning symbol combination s to create one or more empty symbol positions. The gaming machine shifts zero one or more of the remaining displayed symbols downward into zero one or more of the empty symbol positions and generates and displays a symbol for each remaining empty symbol position. The gaming machine re evaluates the displayed symbols provides an award for any displayed winning symbol combinations and repeats the steps of removing symbols shifting symbols generating new symbols and evaluating symbol combinations until no winning symbol combination is displayed.

There is a continuing need to increase the excitement and entertainment experienced by people playing gaming machines. There is a further need for increasing the number of winning symbol combinations generated and awards provided to a player for a single play of a game.

The present disclosure relates generally to gaming systems and methods for providing a cascading or tumbling symbol game including a plurality of independent reels with stacked symbols. More particularly the present disclosure relates to a gaming system which includes a plurality of independent reels arranged as a matrix of independent reels. Each independent reel is associated with a virtual reel strip which includes a plurality of symbols in a plurality of symbol positions wherein the symbols are displayable for spins of that independent reel. Each symbol of each independent reel also has a probability of being generated for a spin of that independent reel. At least two adjacent independent reels are each associated with a virtual reel strip which provides a relatively high probability of generating a same designated symbol. Moreover at least one of the plurality of independent reels is associated with a virtual reel strip having a same designated symbol in a plurality of adjacent symbol positions of that virtual reel strip.

In operation of one embodiment the gaming system disclosed herein generates one of the symbols of each independent reel by randomly selecting that symbol from among the plurality of symbols of each associated virtual reel strip. The gaming system provides an award based on any generated winning symbol combinations. In one embodiment the gaming system then generates a different symbol for at least one of the independent reels such as by displaying a symbol which is adjacent to a previously displayed symbol of a virtual reel strip. The gaming system determines whether any new winning symbol combinations are displayed and provides any appropriate award. Since as described above at least two adjacent independent reels are each associated with a virtual reel strip having a relatively high probability of generating the same designated symbol the gaming system provides a stacked symbol effect with respect to the designated symbol for each new symbol generation. Moreover since the gaming system includes at least one independent reel associated with a reel strip having a plurality of adjacent designated symbols the gaming system also provides a stacked symbol effect with respect to the designated symbol for each re generation of a symbol for such stacked independent reels. Thus the gaming system is relatively likely to display the designated symbol for a plurality of subsequent generations by that independent reel increasing the probability of winning multiple awards for a play of the game.

In one embodiment the gaming system disclosed herein includes a plurality of independent reels displayed as a matrix of independent reels. Each independent reel includes a plurality of symbols in a plurality of symbol positions wherein any of the symbols can be generated for a spin of that independent reel. In one embodiment each independent reel is associated with a virtual reel strip which includes a plurality of symbols. In another embodiment each independent reel utilizes a table including a plurality of symbols. In various embodiments each symbol of each independent reel includes a probability of being generated for a spin of that independent reel. For example a first independent reel utilizes a reel strip including a designated symbol the symbols of the first independent reel being generated in accordance with an 80 chance of generating the designated symbol. In this example a second independent reel utilizes a reel strip which generates symbols in accordance with a 70 chance of generating the same designated symbol.

In one embodiment the gaming system is configured such that at least two adjacent independent reels each utilize a table and or a virtual reel strip which includes a relatively high probability of generating a same designated symbol. In one such embodiment each of the adjacent independent reels utilizes a same reel strip. In another embodiment each of the adjacent independent reels utilize different virtual reel strips having different and relatively high probabilities of generating the same designated symbol. Continuing with the example discussed above the first and second tables are utilized by independent reels which are adjacent to one another such that each adjacent independent reel has at least a 70 chance of generating the designated symbol for a spin of each symbol generation or re generation of that independent reel. It should be appreciated that this arrangement of independent reels adjacent independent reels which each have at least a 70 percent chance of generating the designated symbol results in the stacked symbol effect with respect to the designated symbol for an initial random generation by the plurality of independent reels due to the relatively high likelihood of simultaneously generating the designated symbol for at least two adjacent independent reels.

In one embodiment at least one of the independent reels provides a stacked symbol effect with respect to the designated symbol. In this embodiment any independent reel which provides a stacked symbol effect includes a plurality of symbols displayed in a plurality of symbol positions of a virtual reel strip wherein at least two adjacent symbol positions of the virtual reel strip include the designated symbol. For such a stacked independent reel the gaming system is relatively likely to generate and display the designated symbol a plurality of times for a plurality of symbol generations. For example the virtual reel strip of a stacked independent reel includes the designated symbol in four adjacent symbol positions.

In one embodiment for a play of the game the gaming system randomly generates and displays a symbol for each independent reel such as by spinning the independent reels based on the probabilities defined by the virtual reel strip or table utilized by that independent reel. In this embodiment the gaming system determines whether the displayed symbols form any winning symbol combinations. If any winning symbol combinations are formed the gaming system provides an award for such whining symbol combinations. In one embodiment the gaming system determines at least one independent reel for which to re generate a symbol by displaying a symbol in an adjacent symbol position of the virtual reel strip. In one embodiment the gaming system determines such an independent reel based on the independent reels which displayed a symbol included in a winning symbol combination. In another embodiment the gaming system determines such an independent reel based on independent reels which displayed the designated symbol. In one embodiment for each determined independent reel the gaming system activates that independent reel to display a symbol of an adjacent symbol position of the virtual reel strip associated with that independent reel. The gaming system determines whether any new winning symbol combinations are displayed and provides an award for such newly displayed winning symbol combinations. In the example discussed above wherein at least one of the reels includes five adjacent designated symbols the gaming system displays a first one of the five adjacent designated symbols for an initial generation of symbols and displays a second one of the five adjacent symbols upon the re generation for the play of the game. It should be appreciated that in this example the gaming system can display the designated symbol for as many as five generations of symbols for the at least one example independent reel.

It should be appreciated that by providing a plurality of independent reels wherein at least two adjacent independent reels each have a relatively high probability of generating a same designated symbol the disclosed gaming system provides a game having a stacked symbol effect with respect to the designated symbol for an initial generation of symbols. That is the disclosed gaming system provides an increased probability of generating winning symbol combinations or winning symbol combinations associated with higher award values based on the relatively high probability of generating designated symbols for initial spins of two or more adjacent independent reels. Moreover because the designated symbols are in adjacent symbol positions of a virtual reel strip i.e. the symbols are stacked for one or more of the independent reels an activation of such an independent reel to display an adjacent symbol to the currently displayed designated symbol has a relatively high probability of displaying another designated symbol. Thus the stacked symbol effect provided by the disclosed gaming system increases the probability of generating a plurality of different winning symbol combinations for a play of the game.

That is different primary wagering games such as video poker games video blackjack games video keno video bingo or any other suitable primary or base game may be implemented.

In one embodiment as illustrated in a base or primary game may be a slot game with one or more paylines . The paylines may be horizontal vertical circular diagonal angled or any combination thereof. In this embodiment the gaming device includes at least one and preferably a plurality of reels such as three to five reels in either electromechanical form with mechanical rotating reels or video form with simulated reels and movement thereof. In one embodiment an electromechanical slot machine includes a plurality of adjacent rotatable reels which may be combined and operably coupled with an electronic display of any suitable type. In another embodiment if the reels are in video form one or more of the display devices as described above displays the plurality of simulated video reels . Each reel displays a plurality of indicia or symbols such as bells hearts fruits numbers letters bars or other images which preferably correspond to a theme associated with the gaming device. In another embodiment one or more of the reels are independent reels or unisymbol reels. In this embodiment each independent or unisymbol reel generates and displays one symbol to the player. In one embodiment the gaming device awards prizes after the reels of the primary game stop spinning if specified types and or configurations of indicia or symbols occur on an active payline or otherwise occur in a winning pattern occur on the requisite number of adjacent reels and or occur in a scatter pay arrangement.

In an alternative embodiment rather than determining any outcome to provide to the player by analyzing the symbols generated on any wagered upon paylines as described above the gaming device determines any outcome to provide to the player based on the number of associated symbols which are generated in active symbol positions on the requisite number of adjacent reels i.e. not on paylines passing through any displayed winning symbol combinations . In this embodiment if a winning symbol combination is generated on the reels the gaming device provides the player one award for that occurrence of the generated winning symbol combination. For example if one winning symbol combination is generated on the reels the gaming device will provide a single award to the player for that winning symbol combination i.e. not based on the number of paylines that would have passed through that winning symbol combination . It should be appreciated that because a gaming device that enables wagering on ways to win provides the player one award for a single occurrence of a winning symbol combination and a gaming device with paylines may provide the player more than one award for the same occurrence of a single winning symbol combination i.e. if a plurality of paylines each pass through the same winning symbol combination it is possible to provide a player at a ways to win gaming device with more ways to win for an equivalent be or wager on a traditional slot gaming device with paylines.

In one embodiment the total number of ways to win is determined by multiplying the number of symbols generated in active symbol positions on a first reel by the number of symbols generated in active symbol positions on a second reel by the number of symbols generated in active symbol positions on a third reel and so on for each reel of the gaming device with at least one symbol generated in an active symbol position. For example a three reel gaming device with three symbols generated in active symbol positions on each reel includes 27 ways to win i.e. 3 symbols on the first reel 3 symbols on the second reel 3 symbols on the third reel . A four reel gaming device with three symbols generated in active symbol positions on each reel includes 81 ways to win i.e. 3 symbols on the first reel 3 symbols on the second reel 3 symbols on the third reel 3 symbols on the fourth reel . A five reel gaming device with three symbols generated in active symbol positions on each reel includes 243 ways to win i.e. 3 symbols on the first reel 3 symbols on the second reel 3 symbols on the third reel 3 symbols on the fourth reel 3 symbols on the fifth reel . It should be appreciated that modifying the number of generated symbols by either modifying the number of reels or modifying the number of symbols generated in active symbol positions by one or more of the reels modifies the number of ways to win.

In another embodiment the gaming device enables a player to wager on and thus activate symbol positions. In one such embodiment the symbol positions are on the reels. In this embodiment if based on the player s wager a reel is activated then each of the symbol positions of that reel will be activated and each of the active symbol positions will be part of one or more of the ways to win. In one embodiment if based on the player s wager a reel is not activated then a designated number of default symbol positions such as a single symbol position of the middle row of the reel will be activated and the default symbol position s will be part of one or more of the ways to win. This type of gaming machine enables a player to wager on one more than one or all of the reels and the processor of the gaming device uses the number of wagered on reels to determine the active symbol positions and the number of possible ways to win. In alternative embodiments 1 no symbols are displayed as generated at any of the inactive symbol positions or 2 any symbols generated at any inactive symbol positions may be displayed to the player but suitably shaded or otherwise designated as inactive.

In one embodiment wherein a player wagers on one or more reels a player s wager of one credit may activate each of the three symbol positions on a first reel wherein one default symbol position is activated on each of the remaining four reels. In this example as described above the gaming device provides the player three ways to win i.e. 3 symbols on the first reel 1 symbol on the second reel 1 symbol on the third reel 1 symbol on the fourth reel 1 symbol on the fifth reel . In another example a player s wager of nine credits may activate each of the three symbol positions on a first reel each of the three symbol positions on a second reel and each of the three symbol positions on a third reel wherein one default symbol position is activated on each of the remaining two reels. In this example as described above the gaming device provides the player twenty seven ways to win i.e. 3 symbols on the first reel 3 symbols on the second reel 3 symbols on the third reel 1 symbol on the fourth reel 1 symbol on the fifth reel .

In one embodiment to determine any award s to provide to the player based on the generated symbols the gaming device individually determines if a symbol generated in an active symbol position on a first reel forms part of a winning symbol combination with or is otherwise suitably related to a symbol generated in an active symbol position on a second reel. In this embodiment the gaming device classifies each pair of symbols which form part of a winning symbol combination i.e. each pair of related symbols as a string of related symbols. For example if active symbol positions include a first cherry symbol generated in the top row of a first reel and a second cherry symbol generated in the bottom row of a second reel the gaming device classifies the two cherry symbols as a string of related symbols because the two cherry symbols form part of a winning symbol combination.

After determining if any strings of related symbols are formed between the symbols on the first reel and the symbols on the second reel the gaming device determines if any of the symbols from the next adjacent reel should be added to any of the formed strings of related symbols. In this embodiment for a first of the classified strings of related symbols the gaming device determines if any of the symbols generated by the next adjacent reel form part of a winning symbol combination or are otherwise related to the symbols of the first string of related symbols. If the gaming device determines that a symbol generated on the next adjacent reel is related to the symbols of the first string of related symbols that symbol is subsequently added to the first string of related symbols. For example if the first string of related symbols is the string of related cherry symbols and a related cherry symbol is generated in the middle row of the third reel the gaming device adds the related cherry symbol generated on the third reel to the previously classified string of cherry symbols.

On the other hand if the gaming device determines that no symbols generated on the next adjacent reel are related to the symbols of the first string of related symbols the gaming device marks or flags such string of related symbols as complete. For example if the first string of related symbols is the string of related cherry symbols and none of the symbols of the third reel are related to the cherry symbols of the previously classified string of cherry symbols the gaming device marks or flags the string of two cherry symbols as complete.

After either adding a related symbol to the first string of related symbols or marking the first string of related symbols as complete the gaming device proceeds as described above for each of the remaining classified strings of related symbols which were previously classified or formed from related symbols on the first and second reels.

After analyzing each of the remaining strings of related symbols the gaming device determines for each remaining pending or incomplete string of related symbols if any of the symbols from the next adjacent reel if any should be added to any of the previously classified strings of related symbols. This process continues until either each string of related symbols is complete or there are no more adjacent reels of symbols to analyze. In this embodiment where there are no more adjacent reels of symbols to analyze the gaming device marks each of the remaining pending strings of related symbols as complete.

When each of the strings of related symbols is marked complete the gaming device compares each of the strings of related symbols to an appropriate paytable and provides the player any award associated with each of the completed strings of symbols. It should be appreciated that the player is provided one award if any for each string of related symbols generated in active symbol positions i.e. as opposed to a quantity of awards being based on how many paylines that would have passed through each of the strings of related symbols in active symbol positions .

In one embodiment a base or primary game may be a poker game wherein the gaming device enables the player to play a conventional game of video draw poker and initially deals five cards all face up from a virtual deck of fifty two cards. Cards may be dealt as in a traditional game of cards or in the case of the gaming device the cards may be randomly selected from a predetermined number of cards. If the player wishes to draw the player selects the cards to hold via one or more input devices such as by pressing related hold buttons or via the touch screen. The player then presses the deal button and the unwanted or discarded cards are removed from the display and the gaming machine deals the replacement cards from the remaining cards in the deck. This results in a final five card hand. The gaming device compares the final five card hand to a payout table which utilizes conventional poker hand rankings to determine the winning hands. The gaming device provides the player with an award based on a winning hand and the number of credits the player wagered.

In another embodiment the base or primary game may be a multi hand version of video poker. In this embodiment the gaming device deals the player at least two hands of cards.

In various embodiments the gaming system provides more than two adjacent weighted independent reels. In one embodiment the gaming system provides a cluster or clump of weighted independent reels such that two or more weighted independent reels are horizontally adjacent to each other and two or more weighted independent reels are vertically adjacent to each other.

In one embodiment the disclosed gaming system enables a player to wager on a play of the game including the plurality of independent reels as indicated by block . In one embodiment for the play of the game the gaming system generates a symbol for each of the plurality of independent reels as indicated by block . In one such embodiment the gaming system generates the plurality of symbols by selecting one of the numbers associated with one of the symbols of the table such as based on an output of a random number generator and by displaying the appropriate symbol of the virtual reel strip. In another embodiment each of the independent reels is a mechanical reel and the gaming system generates a symbol for each of the independent reels by spinning that mechanical reel. It should be appreciated that the instant disclosure contemplates any suitable method of determining a random symbol for display by an independent reel based on a probability associated with that symbol.

In one embodiment the gaming system determines whether any winning symbol combinations are generated for the play of the game as indicated by block . It should be appreciated that in various embodiments by displaying at least two adjacent independent reels which are weighted toward generating the designated symbol the disclosed gaming system increases the probability of generating winning symbol combinations for plays of the game. In one embodiment if no winning symbol combination is generated the gaming system ends the play of the game and enables the player to wager again on a play of the game as indicated by block .

In one embodiment if at least one winning symbol combination is generated the gaming system provides an award based on any generated winning symbol combinations as indicated by block . In this embodiment the gaming system determines at least one independent reel for which to re generate a symbol for the play of the game as indicated by block . In one such embodiment the at least one determined independent reel is an independent reel displaying a symbol included in a winning symbol combination as indicated by block .

In one embodiment the gaming system re generates a symbol for display by any determined independent reels as indicated by block . Specifically the gaming system in one embodiment displays a symbol for that independent reel which is in a symbol position of the associated virtual reel strip adjacent to the symbol position of the currently displayed symbol of the associated virtual reel strip. It should be appreciated that if the currently displayed symbol is a designated symbol the gaming system is relatively likely to re generate and display another designated symbol due to the plurality of adjacent i.e. stacked designated symbols of one or more of the independent reels disclosed herein.

In one embodiment based on any re generated symbols the gaming system determines whether any new winning symbol combinations are displayed as indicated in block . If any new winning symbol combinations are displayed the gaming system provides an award as indicated by block and re generates one or more symbols for one or more independent reels as indicated by blocks and . In one embodiment if the gaming system determines that no additional winning symbol combinations are generated as indicated by block the gaming system ends the play of the game and enables the player to wager on a new play of the game as indicated by block .

In an alternative embodiment the gaming system disclosed herein does not re generate any symbols for a play of the game. In this embodiment upon providing the determined award based on any winning symbol combinations as indicated by block the gaming system ends the play of the game. In another embodiment the gaming system performs at least one re generation of symbols for a play of the game up to a maximum number of re generations. That is the gaming system performs the loop indicated by block and a plurality of times up to a maximum number of times. In various such embodiments the maximum number of regenerations is predetermined randomly determined determined based on a generated symbol or symbol combination determined based on a quantity of designated symbols of the independent reel determined based on a random determination by the central controller determined based on a random determination at the gaming system determined based on one or more side wagers placed determined based on the player s primary game wager determined based on time such as the time of day determined based on an amount of coin in accumulated in one or more pools or determined based on any other suitable method or criteria.

In the illustrated embodiment for a generation of a symbol for an independent reel the gaming system selects one of the symbols from either Table A or Table B by randomly selecting one of the numbers of the number column or respectively and displaying the symbol associated with the selected number. In this embodiment the gaming system has an equal probability of selecting each of the numbers one through twenty of number columns and . It should therefore be appreciated that the symbols in symbol columns and define probabilities of selecting each symbol for a spin of a reel associated with either Table A or Table B . Specifically since sixteen of the twenty symbols of Table A are King symbols a random selection of one of the numbers of the number column results in an 80 chance of generating a King symbol. A spin of an independent reel associated with Table A has a 5 chance of generating each of an Ace symbol a Queen Symbol a Jack symbol and a Ten Symbol i.e. each symbol is included once out of twenty total symbols . Since each symbol of Table B is repeated four times the probability of generating an Ace symbol a King symbol a Queen symbol a Jack symbol and a Ten symbol is each 20 . It should therefore be appreciated that Table A represents a weighted table with respect to the King symbol and that Table B represents a non weighted table.

In one embodiment each of the independent reels of the disclosed gaming system includes a virtual reel strip associated with one of the tables or . In this embodiment the order of symbols of the tables or define the order of symbols of the virtual reel strip. Thus in the illustrated embodiment a virtual reel strip associated with Table A includes fifteen King symbols in adjacent symbol positions of the virtual reel strip. In this embodiment displaying a plurality of symbols sequentially according to the order of symbols of the reel strips is relatively likely to result in a plurality of the King symbols being displayed sequentially for the independent reel associated with Table A . In various embodiments the quantity of adjacent designated symbols such as King symbols is less than fifteen designated symbols such as approximately five designated symbols.

In the illustrated schematic representation any independent reel which uses Table A to generate symbols for spins of that independent reel is weighted with respect to the King symbol . It should be appreciated that in the schematic representation of a plurality of adjacently positioned independent reels are associated with Table A thus resulting in a stacked symbol effect with respect to the King symbol for a plurality of different portions of the matrix of independent reels. Specifically independent reels and are positioned vertically adjacently to one another and thus provide a vertically oriented stacked symbol effect for an initial generation of symbols. Similarly independent reels and are positioned horizontally adjacently to one another and thus provide a horizontally oriented stacked symbol effect for an initial generation of symbols. Independent reels and are positioned vertically adjacently to one another and provide a vertically oriented stacked symbol effect for an initial generation of symbols. It should be appreciated that independent reel which utilizes Table A is not positioned adjacently to another independent reel which utilizes weighted Table A . Thus in one embodiment the gaming system does not provide a stacked symbol effect with respect to independent reel

In one embodiment each of the independent reels and provides a stacked symbol effect with respect to subsequent generations of symbols during the play of the game. In this embodiment the gaming system is configured to determine one or more independent reels for a play of the game in which to regenerate a symbol. The gaming system regenerates such symbols by displaying a symbol from a symbol position of a virtual reel strip which is adjacent to the symbol position of the displayed symbol. Thus it should be appreciated that if one of the designated symbols from the stack of designated symbols is initially displayed the gaming system is relatively likely to display another one of the stacked symbols for the re generation. When implemented as a cascading symbols game with respect to the individual independent reels it should be appreciated that each of the independent reels and provides a stacked symbol effect.

Specifically illustrate a gaming device including a plurality of independent reels and at various points in time during a play of a game. In the illustrated embodiment the gaming system spins each independent reel by selecting one of the symbols from the associated table of symbols based on an output of a random number generator.
