title: Rapid modulation scheme determination for linear digital signals
abstract: Various embodiments associated with modulation scheme determination for an unknown signal with noise are described. An unknown signal can have an unknown modulation scheme to a system. In order to determine a modulation scheme to use with the unknown signal, the unknown signal can be compared to a plurality of known signals, with an individual known signal being associated with a particular modulation scheme. A rapid classification method can be used that is less computationally intensive than an average likelihood ratio test method based on the distances between unknown symbols and constellation alphabets of a set of known modulation schemes. Signal to noise ratios before and after classification can be used to check an accuracy of classification and distribution of signal symbols can be used to verify a classification result.

In a combat environment different forces can broadcast different signals. In a singular environment enemy combatants can each broadcast different signals. It may be possible for one combatant to intercept the signal of another combatant. The intercepting combatant may not know the modulation scheme of an intercepted signal. Without the modulation scheme it may be difficult to put the intercepted signal to use.

A system comprising a computation component a determination component a designation component and a processor is described. The computation component is configured to compute a first value from comparison of a first known signal format with an unknown signal where a modulation scheme of the unknown signal is unknown to the system where a modulation scheme of the first known signal format is known to the system and where the unknown signal includes a noise. The computation component is also configured to compute a second value from comparison of a second known signal format with the unknown signal where a modulation scheme of the second signal format is known to the system. The determination component is configured to determine a preferred value from a value set where the value set comprises the first value and the second value. The designation component is configured to designate a modulation scheme of the known signal associated with the preferred value as a modulation scheme for the unknown signal. The processor is configured to execute at least one command in relation to the computation component the determination component the designation component or a combination thereof.

In addition a system comprising a calculation component an identification component a distribution component a comparison component a selection component and a non transitory computer readable medium is described. The calculation component is configured to calculate a first error from comparison of a signal with a noise against a first known signal where a modulation of the signal is unknown to the system. The calculation component is also configured to calculate a second error from comparison of the signal with the noise against a second known signal. The identification component is configured to make an identification that the first known signal and second known signal share common alphabets where the identification is made through comparison of the first error and the second error. The distribution component is configured to determine a first constellation distribution difference of the signal against the first known signal as well as determine a second constellation distribution difference of the signal against the second known signal. The comparison component is configured to determine a lower difference between the first constellation distribution difference and the second constellation distribution difference.

Furthermore a non transitory computer readable medium configured to store computer executable instructions that when executed by a processor cause the processor to perform a method is described. The method comprises receiving a signal with a noise where a classification of the signal is unknown to a system. The method also comprises calculating a first error from comparison of the signal with the noise against a first known signal as well as calculating a second error from comparison of the signal with the noise against a second known signal. In addition the method comprises determining a smallest error from an error set where the error set comprises the first error and the second error and designating a modulation scheme associated with the known signal with the smallest error as a modulation scheme for the signal. Furthermore the method comprises causing the signal to be demodulated through use of the modulation scheme for the signal and causing the signal to be outputted after demodulation.

Cognitive radio based adaptive demodulation can be an effective technique for maximizing a communication data rate within a given bandwidth. Automatic modulation classification is a tool that employs selecting a correct demodulation scheme proactively e.g. automatically without hand shaking between a transmitter and receiver. A rapid processing method can be used in real time communication to make communication faster.

With digitizing communications closer to the antenna radios with programmable modulation schemes and transmission rates can be a practical wireless communication platform. The radio transmission environment can be exploited and a system can choose a best modulation scheme to maximize the channel capacity in real time. In cognitive radio the signal data can be transmitted frame by frame. The modulation scheme in an individual data frame can be determined depending upon a channel noise level estimated before the transmission. An adaptive modulation scheme can maintain a bit error rate BER below a certain threshold to ensure the quality of service in data transmission. To do this pilot symbol can be used in transmitted data frame to indicate a modulation scheme for proper demodulation of the receiver. Automatic modulation classification algorithms can function to recognize the modulation scheme change automatically without redundant pilot symbols. A modulation estimator can operate in parallel with a programmable demodulator in the receiver. A change in the modulation scheme of a transmitter among individual data frames can be detected and the demodulator can change the demodulation scheme accordingly. The objective of the automatic modulation recognition can be to identify the modulation scheme of a transmitted signal with a high probability of success within a short observation time.

A fast and simplified modulation classification method can be used to recognize digital modulation schemes including phase shift keying PSK modulation and quadrature amplitude modulation QAM for adaptive demodulation of the cognitive radios.

Classification among L number of linear modulation schemes can be described by choosing the maximum signal to noise ratio SNR or minimum noise variance among L hypotheses denoted by H H . . . and H. A concept is that if the hypothesis is true the SNR of the signal will be maximized. For hypothesis H the imodulation scheme i 1 2 . . . L it can be assumed that there are Msignal symbol alphabets b b . . . b in baseband coding where b j 1 2 . . . M is assumed to be zero mean and uniformly distributed over the alphabet set and has unity average power. For the convenience in analysis the alphabets at the instance k is denoted by a time varying complex number b k which is unknown but belong to the known alphabet set b b . . . b. Let r k be a noisy copy of b k obtained from the output of the RF to baseband conversion unit and the result is 1 where a is the channel gain and n k is the i.i.d. circularly complex white Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance . a and can be estimated such as by using 2and 4order cumulants so that EQ. 1 can be reformatted to 2 

Since the result of EQ. 3 includes the knowledge of b k an estimate can occur under the assumption that the SNR of r k is sufficiently high such that majority of noisy copies of b k will be located inside the boundary of region R b . To reduce the false alarm rate a SNR Threshold is used to provided an off line calculated value Tfor hypothesis H i 1 . . . L based on the BER requirement for the imodulation scheme and the coarse SNR of r k is estimated online at Pre Noise Power Estimator. Existing methods can be used for both BER and SNR estimation. If the estimated SNR is below T the BER will be too high for reliable communication so that the Hypotheses Prescreen excludes the hypothesis Hand report the low SNR error message. Otherwise for each r k an correspondent estimate circumflex over b k bis obtained if at the instance k bis the closest alphabet to r k . Mathematically if r k b k 

If the conditions in EQs. 5 and 6 are not satisfied the hypothesis Hcan be rejected and the recognition error will be reported.

After the modulation scheme of the received data is recognized an appropriate demodulator can be selected by the Software Demodulator and the data can be demodulated. SNR can be estimated before classification to prescreen the hypotheses threshold D is used for verify the consistency of SNR after classification and the histogram is applied to check the uniform distribution assumption. The proposed method has simple processing units to obtain the classification result promptly. Aspects disclosed herein can be used in developing the next generation software defined radios and cognitive radios with adaptive demodulation capability in maximizing the channel bandwidth.

The instructions may be embodied in various forms including routines algorithms modules methods threads and or programs including separate applications or code from dynamically linked libraries.

The determination component is configured to determine a preferred value from a value set where the value set comprises the first value and the second value. In one embodiment the preferred value is a lowest overall value. The preferred value can be a result that includes noise and or a smallest amount of signal along with the noise.

The designation component is configured to designate a modulation scheme of the known signal associated with the preferred value as a modulation scheme for the unknown signal. A database e.g. a computer readable medium can retain the known signal modulation schemes. The known modulation scheme can be designated and used in demodulation of the unknown signal.

The processor is configured to execute at least one command in relation to the computation component the determination component the designation component or a combination thereof. In addition the processor can be configured to execute at least one command in relation to at least one other component disclosed herein.

In one embodiment the first value is a first signal to noise ratio and the second value is a second signal to noise ratio. The preferred value can be a maximum signal to noise ratio. In one embodiment the first value is a first noise variance and the second value is a second noise variance. The preferred value can be a minimum noise variance. Thus based on minimum noise variance and or maximum signal to noise ratio a matching signal can be determined. In one embodiment the preferred value is about equivalent to the noise e.g. equal to the noise equal to the noise except a difference that is statistically insignificant etc. .

In one embodiment the digital baseband signal is a frame of baseband symbols. The digital baseband signal can be normalized. The computation component can be configured to subtract the first known signal from the unknown signal as the digital baseband signal after normalization. The computation component can be configured to subtract the second known signal from the unknown signal as the digital baseband signal after normalization. Thus during operation of the system the unknown signal can be a digital baseband signal after normalization.

In order to process a signal and ultimately demodulate the signal it may be desirable to have the signal have a minimum signal to noise ratio. Otherwise the signal may be too distorted to be of use. Thus the signal to noise ratio of the unknown signal can be compared to the threshold to determine if the signal is strong enough for use. If the signal is strong enough then the signal can be demodulated e.g. a demodulation scheme can be designated and used to demodulate the unknown signal . If the signal is not strong enough the signal can be discarded and or an error report can be produced e.g. a user can be notified an entry in a log can be made etc. .

In one embodiment it is possible that two known signals can produce the same result when subtracted from the unknown signal. In one embodiment the two known signals will not be identical and will not have the same modulations scheme. Therefore further actions should occur to determine which known signal actually matches the unknown signal and thus what modulation scheme to use upon the unknown signal. Constellations of the unknown signal can be plotted and compared against constellations of the known signals. A comparison of these constellations can determine which of the two or more known signals are the better match when the two or more known signals produce the same result.

The identification component can be configured to make an identification that the first known signal and second known signal share common alphabets where the identification is made through comparison of the first error and the second error. If the first and second known signals share common alphabets then the first error and the second error can be about equal to one another. Thus the identification can be made when the first error and the second error are about equal.

The distribution component can be configured to determine a first constellation distribution difference of the signal against the first known signal. The distribution component can also be configured to determine a second constellation distribution difference of the signal against the second known signal. Since error difference is not enough to distinguish between two known signals the distribution component can employ a different strategy to differentiate between the known signals with regard to the signal with the noise e.g. the unknown signal .

The comparison component can be configured to determine a lower difference between the first constellation distribution difference and the second constellation distribution difference. A known signal whose constellation matched better with the signal with noise can be considered as having the lower difference. The difference can be how points line up against one another in a four quadrant plot.

The selection component can be configured to select a modulation scheme of the known signal with the lower difference for demodulation of the signal with the noise. The computer readable medium e.g. a non transitory computer readable medium can be configured to retain at least one instruction in relation to the calculation component the identification component the distribution component the comparison component the selection component or a combination thereof.

It is possible that two known signals can be equally efficient at matching a signal with noise once subtracted e.g. that essentially only noise remains . However the two known signals can be different and therefore have different modulation schemes. Since one modulation scheme should be used to demodulate the signal with the noise one of the schemes that is associated with one of the known signals should be selected. Thus other actions can occur to differentiate among the matching signals and select an optimal match. To do this constellations of the signals e.g. signal with noise error matching known signals etc. can be taken and comparison can occur to determine which known signal best matches the signal with the noise. This best matching signal can have its modulation scheme used to demodulate the signal with the noise.

When the signal with the noise is evaluated it may be unknown if more than one known signal has a similar lowest error with the signal with the noise. Having a similar lowest error e.g. errors that are about equal to one another can mean that the known signals share a common alphabet. Therefore the system can be configured to process when a single known signal has a lowest error with the signal with noise and when multiple known signals have a lowest error with the signal with the noise. In one embodiment the identification component can make an identification that the first known signal and second known signal share common alphabets or an identification that the first known signal and the second known signal do not share common alphabets e.g. that the first known signal and second known signal do not share an error that is about equal . When there is a single known signal with a lowest error the choice component and designation component can function. When there is more than a single known signal with a lowest error the distribution component the comparison component and the selection component can function.

If the identification component makes an identification that the first known signal and the second known signal share a common alphabet then it can be beneficial to make sure that the signal to noise ratio of the signal with the noise is sufficiently strong. The threshold can be set e.g. by a technician by a computer etc. and employed in determining if the signal to noise ratio is strong enough for use. If the signal to noise ratio is strong enough for use then the distribution component the comparison component and the selection component can function. If the signal to noise ratio is not strong enough for use then a failure report can be produced and sent that includes the error e.g. that the signal to noise ratio is not strong enough that more than one known signal has a lowest error and that the signal to noise ratio is not strong enough etc. . The measurement component can measure the signal to noise ratio and the threshold component can compare the measured signal to noise ratio against the threshold for the signal to noise ratio. If the threshold is not met e.g. signal to noise ratio is less than the threshold signal to noise ratio does not exceed the threshold etc. then an error can be reported to a user to a system other than the system etc.

Before determining a matching known signal for the signal with the noise a determination can be made on if a signal to noise ratio of the signal with the noise is sufficiently high. If the signal to noise ratio is too low e.g. the signal is considered too noisy then the signal with the noise may be of little value. Since operation of components can consume resources e.g. usage of a processor it can be beneficial to determine if the signal with the noise is valuable before having certain components e.g. the distribution component perform. Thus the processor component power component and notice component can function to determine if the signal with the noise is suitable for use e.g. the signal is strong enough before at least some other operations are performed e.g. by other components of the system .

A signal with noise can be received and individual comparisons can be made with the signal with the noise against a plurality of known signals. This comparison can include subtracting the known signal for the signal with the noise. A best matching signal can leave as an error a minimal part of signal content of the signal with the noise and the noise. A non best matching signal can leave along with the noise a part of the signal that is larger than the minimal part of signal content. Thus the smallest error can be a result with the smallest signal portion remaining. The best matching signal can have its demodulation scheme used to demodulate the signal with the noise. Demodulation according to this demodulation scheme can occur and the result can be outputted and used e.g. content of the signal can be identified .

A comparison can occur at on if the signal to noise ratio before and after processing the signal to noise ratio should not be significantly different e.g. an allowable difference threshold can be used to determine if difference is significant . If they are significantly different e.g. the threshold is not met then the method can go to action and cause an error message to be reported that the signal with the noise is not usable. However if the threshold is met then smallest error determination can occur from comparison of different known signals to the signal with the noise. The smallest error can belong to a single known signal or multiple known signals. If multiple known signals are identified as having the smallest error then further actions can be taken to select a known signal that best matches the signal with the noise e.g. determined through matching constellations of the signal with the noise against those of the known signals with the smallest error .

When more than one known signal has the smallest error constellations can be compared of the known signals with the smallest error against the known signal with the noise. Based on these constellations a best match for the signal with the noise can be found among the known signals with the smallest error. From this best match known signal a modulation scheme can be identified and used to demodulate the signal with the noise.
