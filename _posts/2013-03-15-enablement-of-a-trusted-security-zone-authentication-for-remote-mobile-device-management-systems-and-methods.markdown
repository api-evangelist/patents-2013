These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.

It should be understood at the outset that although illustrative implementations of one or more embodiments are illustrated below the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented using any number of techniques whether currently known or not yet in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations drawings and techniques illustrated below but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.

Systems and methods are taught herein that may be used to secure mobile device management software applications managed by mobile device management software and or one or more persona of a mobile device. In an embodiment the systems and methods taught herein may be used to secure any application such as a mobile device management application stored at the layer 7 level of a mobile device. In an embodiment a layer 7 level may comprise an application layer of a plurality of abstraction layers of a mobile device utilizing the Open System Interconnection OSI model or other communication layered model e.g. TCP IP stack model as known in the art.

Generally the systems and methods disclosed allow a mobile device user to remotely access control and or protect particular applications and or persona on a mobile device for example if the mobile device has been lost. For example a mobile device comprising the systems disclosed herein may be left by the mobile device owner in a coffee shop. The owner of the mobile device may not have realized that their mobile was left in the coffee shop until hours later. The mobile device may comprise a business persona with confidential information and or applications concerning their business stored on the mobile device. The confidential information and or applications associated with the business persona may be backed up by a server at the business location and thus easily re obtained if deleted. Additionally the mobile device may comprise a personal persona with a list of personal contacts and a personal email account neither of which are backed up by a server and or other back up storage devices and difficult to replace if deleted. Thus when the mobile device user realizes that the mobile device was left at the coffee shop the mobile device user may access remotely and set one or more flags associated with the personal persona and or may have previously accessed and set the one or more flags associated with the personal persona and implement a remote wipe i.e. a deletion of all unprotected and or accessible data on the mobile device deleting the applications and or confidential information associated with the business persona without the deleting the information associated with the personal persona. Using the system disclosed the mobile device user may prevent a nefarious entity from accessing the confidential information before the user gets back to the coffee shop to retrieve their mobile device. Additionally if the mobile device user does recover their mobile device the user retains all the data associated with the personal persona. Furthermore even though the personal persona is protected because the flags have been set authorized entities i.e. non nefarious entities may access one or more data packages associated with the persona persona by providing credentials to obtain authorization.

This may be accomplished by creating a secure environment on a mobile device. The secure environment may protect data instructions and or flags associated with data stored in an unsecured memory environment and or data stored in the secured environment on the mobile device. Flags stored in the secure environment may be set so that a server such as a data package administering server may access manipulate update delete and or the like one or more data packages associated with the one or more set flags. In an embodiment data packages may comprise one or more bits of data utilized for example by an application logic instructions for an application such as a device management application and or the like.

A data package administering server may desire to install for example an update to one or more data packages stored in the memory of a mobile device. The data package administering server and or an entity associated with the data package administering server may have been given one or more request identification such as security codes to access data packages stored in the memory of the mobile device. The data package administering server may have also given a network administrator additional information which may be used to create a login account. For example the data package administering server may have informed a network administrator of the types of access such as updating installing deleting and or the like that a data package administrator would desire to carry out in a secure environment on the mobile device as well as which data files it would store in the secure environment on the mobile device. The network administrator may create a login account for that particular data package administering server and store the login account in the memory of an access server for example. Thus when the data package administering server sends a request to access a data package stored on the mobile device the access server and or the mobile device may receive the request and attempt to authorize the request. The access server and or the mobile device may authorize the request by querying the request to obtain one or more request identifications. The access server and or the mobile device may access a look up table with one or more login accounts. The access server may compare the request identification with the login accounts to find a match.

If a match is found the access server may grant one or more keys to the data package administering server who sent the request to access a data package. The one or more keys may provide access to a secure environment on one or more mobile devices the secure environment may store one or more flags which may provide access to one or more data packages stored on one or more of the mobile devices. The mobile device s and or the access server may grant access to the secure environment in response to the data package administering server presenting the key s to the secure environment. In an embodiment the key may be configured to expire after a predetermined time and or a predetermined number of access attempts. In an embodiment the access server may configure the secure environment so that key s allow access to the secure environment for a predetermined period of time and or a predetermined number of access attempts. Once a data package administering server accesses the secure environment the data package administering server may set and or unset one or more flags to access one or more data packages.

It should be understood that depending on the application a user preference a service provider preference and or a data package administering servicer preference one or more flags may initially be set allowing access to one or more associated data packages for example. Thus unsetting the flags may prevent access to one or more associated data packages. Alternatively one or more flag may initially be unset preventing access to one or more associated data packages for example. Thus setting the flags may allow access to one or more associated data packages. Furthermore depending on the application a user preference a service provider preference and or a data package administering servicer preference one or more flag may initially be set preventing access to one or more associated data packages for example. Thus unsetting the flags may allow access to one or more associated data packages. Alternatively one or more flags may initially be unset allowing access to one or more associated data packages for example. Thus setting the flags may prevent access to one or more associated data packages.

Similar embodiments may be used to install data packages in the secure environment of the mobile device. Additionally the display on the mobile device may provide a window listing one or more applications which may be protected by setting and or unsetting one or more flags in the secure environment. The window may be displayed in response to installing one or more applications and or updating one or more applications. The window may also be provided by selecting an icon on the display of the mobile device. The user of the mobile device may then select which data packages the user wants protected. This feature may allow a mobile device user to protect certain content stored on the mobile device while allowing other content to be remotely deleted for example in the event that a mobile device is lost and or stolen.

A trusted security zone provides chipsets with a hardware root of trust a secure execution environment for applications and secure access to peripherals. A hardware root of trust means the chipset should only execute programs intended by the device manufacturer or vendor and resists software and physical attacks and therefore remains trusted to provide the intended level of security. The chipset architecture is designed to promote a programmable environment that allows the confidentiality and integrity of assets to be protected from specific attacks. Trusted security zone capabilities are becoming features in both wireless and fixed hardware architecture designs. Providing the trusted security zone in the main mobile device chipset and protecting the hardware root of trust removes the need for separate secure hardware to authenticate the device or user. To ensure the integrity of the applications requiring trusted data such as a mobile financial services application the trusted security zone also provides the secure execution environment where only trusted applications can operate safe from attacks. Security is further promoted by restricting access of non trusted applications to peripherals such as data inputs and data outputs while a trusted application is running in the secure execution environment. In an embodiment the trusted security zone may be conceptualized as hardware assisted security.

A complete trusted execution environment TEE may be implemented through the use of the trusted security zone hardware and software architecture. The trusted execution environment is an execution environment that is parallel to the execution environment of the main mobile device operating system. The trusted execution environment and or the trusted security zone may provide a base layer of functionality and or utilities for use of applications that may execute in the trusted security zone. For example in an embodiment trust tokens may be generated by the base layer of functionality and or utilities of the trusted execution environment and or trusted security zone for use in trusted end to end communication links to document a continuity of trust of the communications. For more details on establishing trusted end to end communication links relying on hardware assisted security see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 532 588 filed Jun. 25 2012 entitled End to end Trusted Communications Infrastructure by Leo Michael McRoberts et al. which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Through standardization of application programming interfaces APIs the trusted execution environment becomes a place to which scalable deployment of secure services can be targeted. A device which has a chipset that has a trusted execution environment on it may exist in a trusted services environment where devices in the trusted services environment are trusted and protected against attacks. The trusted execution environment can be implemented on mobile phones and tablets as well as extending to other trusted devices such as personal computers servers sensors medical devices point of sale terminals industrial automation handheld terminals automotive etc.

The trusted security zone is implemented by partitioning all of the hardware and software resources of the mobile device into two partitions a secure partition and a normal partition. Placing sensitive resources in the secure partition can protect against possible attacks on those resources. For example resources such as trusted software applications may run in the secure partition and have access to hardware peripherals such as a touchscreen or a secure location in memory. Less secure peripherals such as wireless radios may be disabled completely while the secure partition is being accessed while other peripherals may only be accessed from the secure partition. While the secure partition is being accessed through the trusted execution environment the main mobile operating system in the normal partition is suspended and applications in the normal partition are prevented from accessing the secure peripherals and data. This prevents corrupted applications or malware applications from breaking the trust of the device.

The trusted security zone is implemented by partitioning the hardware and software resources to exist in a secure subsystem which is not accessible to components outside the secure subsystem. The trusted security zone is built into the processor architecture at the time of manufacture through hardware logic present in the trusted security zone which enables a perimeter boundary between the secure partition and the normal partition. The trusted security zone may only be manipulated by those with the proper credential and in an embodiment may not be added to the chip after it is manufactured. Software architecture to support the secure partition may be provided through a dedicated secure kernel running trusted applications. Trusted applications are independent secure applications which can be accessed by normal applications through an application programming interface in the trusted execution environment on a chipset that utilizes the trusted security zone.

In an embodiment the normal partition applications run on a first virtual processor and the secure partition applications run on a second virtual processor. Both virtual processors may run on a single physical processor executing in a time sliced fashion removing the need for a dedicated physical security processor. Time sliced execution comprises switching contexts between the two virtual processors to share processor resources based on tightly controlled mechanisms such as secure software instructions or hardware exceptions. The context of the currently running virtual processor is saved the context of the virtual processor being switched to is restored and processing is restarted in the restored virtual processor. Time sliced execution protects the trusted security zone by stopping the execution of the normal partition while the secure partition is executing.

The two virtual processors context switch via a processor mode called monitor mode when changing the currently running virtual processor. The mechanisms by which the processor can enter monitor mode from the normal partition are tightly controlled. The entry to monitor mode can be triggered by software executing a dedicated instruction the Secure Monitor Call SMC instruction or by a subset of the hardware exception mechanisms such as hardware interrupts which can be configured to cause the processor to switch into monitor mode. The software that executes within monitor mode then saves the context of the running virtual processor and switches to the secure virtual processor.

The trusted security zone runs a separate operating system that is not accessible to the device users. For security purposes the trusted security zone is not open to users for installing applications which means users do not have access to install applications in the trusted security zone. This prevents corrupted applications or malware applications from executing powerful instructions reserved to the trusted security zone and thus preserves the trust of the device. The security of the system is achieved at least in part by partitioning the hardware and software resources of the mobile phone so they exist in one of two partitions the secure partition for the security subsystem and the normal partition for everything else. Placing the trusted security zone in the secure partition and restricting access from the normal partition protects against software and basic hardware attacks. Hardware logic ensures that no secure partition resources can be accessed by the normal partition components or applications. A dedicated secure partition operating system runs in a virtual processor separate from the normal partition operating system that likewise executes in its own virtual processor. Users may install applications on the mobile device which may execute in the normal partition operating system described above. The trusted security zone runs a separate operating system for the secure partition that is installed by the mobile device manufacturer or vendor and users are not able to install new applications in or alter the contents of the trusted security zone.

A secure element SE comprises a tamper resistant hardware platform typically a one chip secure microcontroller capable of securely hosting applications and their confidential and cryptographic data e.g. key management in accordance with one or more rules and or security requirements. The one or more rules and or security requirements may be set forth by a set of one or more well identified trusted authorities such as a mobile service provider a credit card provider a third party manager managing system a mobile device user and or the like. In an embodiment multiple secure elements may be linked together so that one or more related applications stored in different secure elements may communicate between each other. Secure element may be implemented with mobile devices personal computers mobile electronics and or the like. Secure element may utilize at least one of three different form factors Universal Integrated Circuit Card UICC embedded secure element and microSD. The UICC and microSD may comprise removable form factors from for example a handset and or mobile device. The utilization of different form factors for example may link applications utilizing secure element to different business implementations and or satisfy different market needs.

Generally secure element may provide a secure operating environment for financial transactions transit ticketing identification and authentication physical security access and other functions through near field communication NFC . A secure element generally includes its own operating environment with a tamper proof microprocessor memory and operating system. For example a trusted service manager among other things installs provisions and personalizes the secure element. The secure element may have one or more access keys that are typically installed at manufacture time. A corresponding key may be shared by the trusted service manager so that the TSM can establish a cryptographically secure channel to the secure element for installation provisioning and personalization of the secure element while the device having the secure element is in the possession of an end user. In this way the secure element can remain secure even if the host CPU in the device has been compromised.

Additionally a user may receive communication from the mobile device via the user interface such as messages emails contact information caller identification call history internet access etc. A user may additionally employ the user interface for viewing and or listening to media such as music movies shows videos photos games etc.

The mobile device may also comprise a secure environment . In an embodiment the secure environment may comprise secure element zone a trusted security zone and or the like. The secure environment may be accessed only with a particular key configured to provide access into the secure environment . The secure environment may also store one or more flags . The flags may be manipulated for example set so that setting the flag may allow a server such as the data package administering server to access manipulate update delete and or the like one or more data packages on the memory of the mobile device . In an embodiment setting may comprise preventing access to one or more data packages so that by unsetting one or more flags access may be obtained to one or more data packages and or one or more persona.

In an embodiment the flags may be configured to provide access to a particular data package stored in the memory of the mobile device . For example the data package administering server may desire to access a particular data package on the memory of the mobile device in order to update the operating system of the mobile device . The data package administering server may gain access to one or more flags associated with one or more data packages of the data package administering server . The data package administering server may set one or more of the flags to access the one or more packages. While depicts that data packages are stored in memory in an embodiment data packages may be additionally and or alternatively stored in the secure environment .

In an embodiment an application administrator may desire to install a new version of a mobile device application on the mobile device . The application administrator may desire to restrict access to the mobile device application because the mobile device application may be for example populated with confidential information. The application administrator may install one or more flags in the secure environment to protect the data package associated with the mobile device application from access or manipulation by nefarious entities.

In an embodiment the flags may be configured to provide access to a particular set of data packages stored in the memory of the mobile device . For example a particular set of data packages may be associated with a particular persona. In an embodiment a persona may comprise a group of one or more applications associated with one or more categories. The persona may define rules for accessing data and or may provide authorization for accessing data. For example a mobile device may have a business persona which comprises one or more applications associated with the mobile device user s employment and or business ventures. Alternatively or additionally the mobile device may have a financial persona which comprises one or more applications associated with the mobile device user s bank accounts credit cards and or investments. Alternatively or additionally the mobile device may comprise a personal persona which comprises a personal email account and contact list which stores the names phone numbers and addresses of the mobile device user s family and friends. In an embodiment one or more applications may be associated with one or more persona for example a business persona and a personal persona.

As an example the mobile device may comprise at least two persona for example a business persona and a personal persona. The owner of the mobile device may have misplaced his mobile device while at a coffee shop. The business persona may have highly confidential information such as trade secret information and or company data security codes stored which may be easily repopulated within the mobile device if found but dangerous and or detrimental in the wrong hands. Conversely the personal persona may comprise addresses and phone numbers of friends and family members which have little or no confidential information but may be more difficult to repopulate. Thus if the owner of the mobile device desires to delete the business persona to protect the confidential information but does not desire to delete the personal person the owner of the mobile device may be able to remotely set e.g. via a secured webpage and or by calling a customer care representative of a mobile service provider and providing one or more security codes the one or more flags associated only with the personal persona. By setting only the one or more flags associated with the personal persona one or more data packages associated with the personal persona may for example be protected during for example a remote wipe such that all the data packages which has flags which were not set and thus unprotected such as the data packages associated with the business persona may be deleted by the remote wipe without also deleting the data packages associated with the personal persona. It should be understood that a remote wipe comprises remotely deleting and or wiping out all unprotected and or accessible data packages e.g. data packages associated with applications and or data instructions. In this example if a nefarious entity finds the mobile device the nefarious entity may not be able to obtain the confidential information of the business persona. However if the mobile device is found by the owner the owner will not have lost his personal information stored in the personal persona. The owner of the mobile device may then be able to repopulate the confidential data associated with the business persona later at his company facility for example.

The access server may comprise a processor a memory an application and a plurality of keys stored in the memory . The access server may also comprise a plurality of processors located in a plurality of computers. Computers are discussed in more detail hereinafter. The application when executed by the processor of the access server may receive a request message from for example a mobile device and or data package administering server to obtain a key providing access to the secure environment and or a particular set of one or more flags on the secure environment . In response to the request message the application may identify at least one key stored in the memory of the access server for example a key associated with a particular flag and or a key associated with the secure environment of the mobile device .

Turning now to a method is described. At block a mobile device and or the access server receives a request to access a data package stored on one or more mobile devices . In an embodiment the data package may be associated with one or more applications one or more mobile device management applications and or a particular persona of two more personas. For example a data package administering server may desire access to a data package stored in the memory of the mobile device . The data package may have been provided by the data package administering server and or a data package management server administrator. The data package administering server may have a data package update to install with the data package that the data package administering server desires to access. The mobile device may receive a request from the data package administering server identifying for example which set of one or more data packages the data package administering server desires to access how much additional memory an update will consume on the mobile device the identity of the data package administering server which action or actions the data package administering server desires to take the IP address of the set of one or more mobile device the data package administration server desires to access and or one or more access codes verifying that the data package administering server is a trusted server. In an embodiment the term access and or accessed may be construed to comprise the following actions accessed viewed manipulated updated modified deleted and or the like. Thus if the data package administering server sends a request to a mobile device to access one or more data packages stored on the mobile device access may comprise one or more of the above interpretations. In an embodiment the access server may receive the request to access a data package stored on the mobile device .

At block the mobile device and or the access server authorizes the request to access the data package wherein authorizing comprises querying the request to obtain one or more request identifications. For example upon receiving a request to access one or more data packages stored on the mobile device the mobile device may query the data package administering server to provide one or more security codes as well as identify which actions the data package administering server purports to take with one or more data packages . The data package administering server may transmit the request identifications to the mobile device for verification. In an embodiment the data package administering server may provide request identification used by the mobile device to verify the authentication of the data package administering server in the request to access a data package . The mobile device may access a look up table to verify that the one or more security codes matches one or more codes in an approved list of security codes or to verify that the one or more codes provided are associated with a particular trusted data package administering server . It should be understood that a trusted data package administering server may be a data package administering server that is approved and or authorized by for example a mobile service provider to access one or more data packages stored in the memory of the mobile device . Thus for example by matching a security code provided in an access request with a security code in a look up table that is associated with an approved and or authenticated data package administering server the data package administering server may be considered a trusted data package administering server .

In an embodiment the mobile device and or the access server may also examine how much additional memory an update and or an installation of an access request purports to consume on the memory of the mobile device . For example the mobile device may access a look up table which matches a security code provided in response to identification request with a security code in the look up table associated with a trusted data package administering server . The look up table may also indicate that the data package administering server that provides a particular security code is allocated fixed amount of memory space on the memory of the mobile device for example for this particular access attempt. Thus if the access request or the request identification provides a different memory requirement than what is indicated in the look up table then the data package administering server may not be provided access to one or more data packages . In an embodiment the look up tables may be located on the mobile device and or on the access server . Additionally in an embodiment the access server may query the request to receive access to a data package stored on the mobile device .

In an embodiment the mobile device and or the access server may also examine if the IP address the data package administering server requests to access is an authorized IP address for that particular data package administering server . For example through one or more means disclosed herein the access request and or in response to querying request identification s the mobile device may examine if the data package administering server is authorized to access the IP address of the mobile device that the data package administering server desires to access. Although the data package administering server may be authorized to access the memory of a first set of mobile devices the data package administering server may not be permitted to access the memory of a different set of mobile devices . Thus for example by referring to a look up table the mobile device may determine if the data package administering server is authorized to access particular IP address associated with mobile devices .

In an embodiment the mobile device and or the access server may examine the action the data package administering server purports to take is an authorized action. For example data package administering server may be authorized to update data packages on the memory of the mobile device and install additional data packages on the memory of the mobile device . However the data package administering server may not be authorized to delete data packages on the memory of a mobile device . Thus if the data package administering server provides an identification for example to the mobile device and or the access server to delete one or more data packages stored on the memory of the mobile device the data package administering server may be denied access to one or more data packages on a particular mobile device . In an embodiment by using for example a look up table the mobile device and or the access server may verify that the access request from a data package administering server is authorized and comprise an approved request based on one or more request identifications given by a data package administering server .

At block a key is granted in response to authorizing the request wherein the key provides access to a secure environment storing one or more flags associated with the data package . For example if the mobile device and or the access server authorizes a data package administering server to access one or more data packages on the memory of a set of one or more mobile devices the access server may provide one or more keys stored for example in the memory of the access server to access a secure environment on a set of one or more mobile devices . In an embodiment when the mobile device authorizes the request to access the data package the mobile device may transmit one or more signals to the access server to configure one or more keys for the data package administering server . In an embodiment the secure environment may store one or more flags associated with one or more data packages stored on the memory . For example a first set of one or more flags may be associated with a first set of one or more data packages such that by setting the one or more flags a data package administering server may access one or more data package associated with the set of one or more flags.

In an embodiment one or more keys granted in response to authorizing the request may provide access to only a set of one or more flags stored in the secure environment . Thus in this embodiment an access server may be able to protect a first set of one or more flags from a data package administering server that is not authorized to access a first set of one or more data packages while providing access to a second set of one or more flags and thus a second set of one or more data packages that the data package administering server is authorized to access. In an embodiment the one or more keys may provide access to the entire secure environment .

In an embodiment the access server may grant one or more keys which expire after a time limit and or a predetermined number of access attempts. In an embodiment the access server may generate a key that limits the amount of time a data package administering server may access a set of one or more data packages . For example a key may be granted to a data package administering server that sets a fixed amount of time that a data package administering server may access a set of one or more data packages . Thus for example the data package administering server may use a key to access the secure environment to set one or more flags associated with a set of one or more data packages . However when the time on the key expires the one or more flags may unset preventing the data package administering server from accessing the set of one or more data packages and also preventing the data package administering server from accessing the secure environment again. Depending on the application a user preference a service provider preference and or a data package administering servicer preference one or more flag may initially be set allowing access to one or more associated data packages for example. Thus unsetting the flags may prevent access to one or more associated data packages. Alternatively one or more flag may initially be unset preventing access to one or more associated data packages for example. Thus setting the flags may allow access to one or more associated data packages. Furthermore depending on the application a user preference a service provider preference and or a data package administering servicer preference one or more flag may initially be set preventing access to one or more associated data packages for example. Thus unsetting the flags may allow access to one or more associated data packages. Alternatively one or more flag may initially be unset allowing access to one or more associated data packages for example. Thus setting the flags may prevent access to one or more associated data packages. In an embodiment the data package administering server may have to send another request for example to the mobile device and or the access server to access the one or more data packages on the memory .

In an embodiment the time limit may comprise the time limit that a data package administering server may have to access the secure environment . For example an access server may provide one or more keys to a data package administering server with a time limit however the data package administering server does not use the one or more keys until after the time expires. Thus because the one or more keys were not used the data package administering server may have to send another request for example to the mobile device and or the access server to access the one or more data packages on the memory . Conversely if the data package administering server accesses the secure environment with the one or more keys before the time limit expires the data package administering server may continue to access one or more data packages even after the time expires with the one or more keys because the one or more flags have already been set. In an embodiment the one or more flags which were set by the data package administering server may automatically unset when the data package administering server no longer desires access to the memory of the mobile device .

In an embodiment the one or more keys may expire after a predetermined number of access attempts. For example the one or more flags may not automatically unset when the data package administering server no longer desires access to the memory and or one or more data packages stored on the memory . The one or more keys may expire after two access attempts. Thus after the data package administering server uses the one or more keys a first time to set one or more flags and the data package administering server may use the one or more keys a second time to unset the one or more flags preventing further access to one or more data packages .

At block access is granted to the secure environment wherein access is granted to the secure environment in response to presenting the key to the secure environment . In an embodiment access may be granted to a particular set of one or more flags such that access is granted to only the particular set of one or more flags by presenting the key to the secure environment . For example the access server may generate one or more keys providing access to the data package administering server . After generating the one or more keys the access server may transmit one or more signals to the secure environment on the mobile device configuring the secure environment with the generated one or more keys so that the one or more keys provide access to a particular set of one or more flags . In an embodiment after generating the one or more keys the access server may transmit one or more signals to the secure environment on the mobile device configuring the secure environment with the generated one or more keys so that the one or more keys provide access to the entire secure environment .

At block the mobile device and or the access server may grant access to the data package wherein granting access to the data package comprises setting the one or more flags associated with the data package . In an embodiment setting one or more flags may allow the data package administering server to access any of the data packages stored in the memory of the mobile device . In an embodiment setting one or more flags may allow the data package administering server to access one or more specific data packages stored in the memory of the mobile device . In an embodiment access to the one or more data packages comprises at least one of viewing content associated with the data package manipulating content associated with the data package modifying a data package deleting a data package and executing a data package.

Turning now to a method is described. At block the mobile device and or the access server enables a user to secure one or more data packages from wireless access wherein securing one or more data packages comprises setting one or more data package flags associated with the one or more data packages using a mobile device interface wherein at least the one or more data package flags are stored in a secure environment on the mobile device . For example a user of the mobile device may have one or more data packages stored on the memory of the mobile device which the user wants protected from nefarious entities which may for example attempt to wirelessly hack into the mobile device to obtain confidential information. The user may access via the interface a menu allowing the user to set one or more flags in the secure environment associated with one or more data packages whereby setting one or more flags may prevent access to the one or more data packages . In an embodiment the one or more flags may be associated with a particular persona for example a business persona with confidential information. In an embodiment one or more flags may be associated with one or more data packages maintained and or developed via the data package administering server for example a mobile device management application maintained and or developed via a mobile device management server. In an embodiment one or more flags may be associated with one or more data packages associated with a particular application for example an email application contact list application and or the like.

In an embodiment one or more data packages may be secured e.g. by setting flags in the secure environment automatically when the one or more data packages are installed in the memory . In an embodiment the user of the mobile device may have to secure the one or more data packages manually after the data package s is installed on the mobile device . In an embodiment when a mobile device is powered on the interface may provide a window which notifies a user that one or more data packages and or one or more persona may be protected and or secured. In an embodiment the interface may provide a window which notifies a user that one or more data packages and or one or more persona may be protected when a data package and or a persona are installed and or updated on the mobile device . For example a mobile device user may not be aware that a persona and or one or more data packages may be protected from access by storing flags associated with the persona and or data package s in the secure environment . Thus when the mobile device user downloads an update for example to the mobile device the interface may provide a window indicating that the data being updated may be protected with a flag stored on the secure environment . The mobile device user may select an option in the window or navigate to another window via the interface and set one or more flags in the secure environment associated with the one or more data packages . In an embodiment a password and or number combination may be entered into the mobile device by the user to set the one or more flags .

In an embodiment the one or more flags may be set remotely. For example the user may access a secured webpage allowing the user to access the secure environment to set one or more flags associated with one or more data packages whereby setting one or more flags may prevent access to the one or more data packages . The user may also call a customer care representative of a mobile service provider provide one or more security codes and direct the customer care representative to set one or more flags . Thus a user may set one or more flags protecting one or more applications and or one or more persona while leaving the remaining unprotected so that for example the user may subsequently implement a remote wipe function deleting confidential information within a mobile device without deleting information that is not confidential and or difficult to re obtain.

At block the mobile device and or the access server may receive a wireless request to access the one or more data packages . At block the mobile device may query the wireless request to access the one or more data packages wherein querying comprises requesting one or more wireless request identifications. At block access to the one or more data packages may be denied based on querying the wireless request to access the one or more data packages wherein denying access to the one or more data packages comprises denying access to the secure environment storing at least the one or more data package flags . For example a nefarious entity e.g. a nefarious server and or an unauthorized server may attempt to access one or more data packages . The nefarious entity may desire to delete one or more data packages on a plurality of mobile devices . The nefarious entity may make a request for example to each of the plurality of mobile devices and or the access server . The nefarious entity may provide request identifications such as at least one of a security code an identification of the source of the request an identification of the action the request purports to take an identification of one or more data packages the request purports to access and an identification of the IP address of the mobile device sought by the request. However one or more of the request identifications may not match one or more valid identifications stored in a look up table. Thus because one or more identifications do not match one or more valid identifications stored in a look up table the nefarious entity may not access the secure environment to set one or more flags .

In an embodiment access may be denied if a nefarious entity provides one or more combinations of identifications. For example if an entity desires to access one or more data packages in order to install an update to a data package the entity may be queried to identify the action the entity and or request purports to take the amount of memory the action may occupy as well as a security code. A nefarious entity may have stolen a valid security code as well as sent a false notification identifying that the nefarious entity wants to install an update with one or more data packages. However the nefarious entity may not provide a memory space need which matches the memory space needed to install the update. In this case the nefarious entity would be denied access because it did not provide the identification information which matches the information in for example a look up table.

Turning to a method is described. At block a mobile device and or the access server may receive a request to install one or more data package flags in a secure environment on the mobile device wherein the one or more data package flags are associated with one or more data packages . In an embodiment the request may originate from server data package source and or one or more data packages that has been approved and or has previously been authenticated by for example a network administrator. As previously disclosed an approved and or authenticated data package source and or data package may be given one or more request identifications to present to the access server in order to obtain one or more key to access to the secure environment.

At block the mobile device and or the access server authorizes the request to install the one or more data package flags in the secure environment wherein authorizing comprises querying the request to obtain one or more request identifications. For example the mobile device may query the originator of the request to provide a security code and data package identification of the data package that the originator purports to install in the memory of the mobile device . In an embodiment authorizing may comprise examining the one or more request identifications with a look up table which lists authorized data package source s and or authorized data package s . For example a data package source may have been authorized by a network administrator to install one or more data package flags in the secure environment of the mobile device . The network administrator may create a login account associated with a data package source. The login account may comprise request identifications. The network administrator may have provided the request identifications to the data package source so that when the data package source sends a request to the mobile device and or the access server to install one or more data package flags on the mobile device the data package source may provide one or more request identifications in response to a query for one or more request identifications. The mobile device and or the access server may match the request identifications with login accounts stored in a memory such as memory of the access server and or the memory of the mobile device . If a match is found between the request identification and the login accounts the data package source and or one or more data packages may be authorized so that one or more flags associated with the data package source and or the one or more data packages may be installed on the secure environment of the mobile device .

At block the mobile device and or the access server grants a key based on the authorization of the request to install the one or more data package flags in the secure environment wherein the key provides access to install one or more data package flags in the secure environment . For example if a match is found between the request identification s and the login accounts and the data package source and or one or more data packages may be authorized so that one or more flags associated with the data package source and or the one or more data packages may be installed on the secure environment of the mobile device . The access server may be instructed based on the authorization for example by the mobile device to grant one or more keys so that one or more flags associated with one or more data packages may be stored in the secure environment . In an embodiment the access server may unilaterally grant one or more keys so that one or more flags associated with one or more data packages may be stored in the secure environment . In an embodiment the one or more keys may be configured so that use of the one or more keys may expire after a predetermined time and or a predetermined number of attempts. In an embodiment the access server may transmit one or more signals configuring the secure environment to permit access to the secure environment with the one or more keys . The configuration signal may cause one or more keys to expire after a predetermined period of time and or a predetermined number of attempts.

At block the mobile device and or the access server stores one or more installed data package flags in the securement environment through the use of one or more keys wherein storing the one or more installed data package flags secures one or more associated data packages on the mobile device . For example after a data package source is granted one or more keys the data package source may use the one or more keys to access the secure environment . The secure environment is configured so that entities outside the secure environment and or entities not authorized e.g. an entity denied one or more keys to access the secure environment may not view content stored in the secure environment manipulate content stored in the secure environment modify content stored in the secure environment delete content stored in the secure environment execute content stored in the secure environment and or the like. Additionally the flags may be set and unset to enable to the viewing manipulation modification deletion execution and or the like of data packages associated with one or more flags . Thus by securing the one or more flags in the secure environment authorized sources may not access one or more data packages and or one or more persona comprising one or more data packages stored on the mobile device .

The DSP or some other form of controller or central processing unit operates to control the various components of the mobile device in accordance with embedded software or firmware stored in memory or stored in memory contained within the DSP itself.

The keypad couples to the DSP via the interface to provide one mechanism for the user to make selections enter information and otherwise provide input to the mobile device . Another input mechanism may be the touch screen LCD which may also display text and or graphics to the user. The touch screen LCD controller couples the DSP to the touch screen LCD . The GPS receiver is coupled to the DSP to decode global positioning system signals thereby enabling the mobile device to determine its position.

It is understood that by programming and or loading executable instructions onto the computer system at least one of the CPU the RAM and the ROM are changed transforming the computer system in part into a particular machine or apparatus having the novel functionality taught by the present disclosure. It is fundamental to the electrical engineering and software engineering arts that functionality that can be implemented by loading executable software into a computer can be converted to a hardware implementation by well known design rules. Decisions between implementing a concept in software versus hardware typically hinge on considerations of stability of the design and numbers of units to be produced rather than any issues involved in translating from the software domain to the hardware domain. Generally a design that is still subject to frequent change may be preferred to be implemented in software because re spinning a hardware implementation is more expensive than re spinning a software design. Generally a design that is stable that will be produced in large volume may be preferred to be implemented in hardware for example in an application specific integrated circuit ASIC because for large production runs the hardware implementation may be less expensive than the software implementation. Often a design may be developed and tested in a software form and later transformed by well known design rules to an equivalent hardware implementation in an application specific integrated circuit that hardwires the instructions of the software. In the same manner as a machine controlled by a new ASIC is a particular machine or apparatus likewise a computer that has been programmed and or loaded with executable instructions may be viewed as a particular machine or apparatus.

The secondary storage is typically comprised of one or more disk drives or tape drives and is used for non volatile storage of data and as an over flow data storage device if RAM is not large enough to hold all working data. Secondary storage may be used to store programs which are loaded into RAM when such programs are selected for execution. The ROM is used to store instructions and perhaps data which are read during program execution. ROM is a non volatile memory device which typically has a small memory capacity relative to the larger memory capacity of secondary storage . The RAM is used to store volatile data and perhaps to store instructions. Access to both ROM and RAM is typically faster than to secondary storage . The secondary storage the RAM and or the ROM may be referred to in some contexts as computer readable storage media and or non transitory computer readable media.

Such information which is often represented as a sequence of instructions to be executed using processor may be received from and outputted to the network for example in the form of a computer data signal embodied in a carrier wave.

Such information which may include data or instructions to be executed using processor for example may be received from and outputted to the network for example in the form of a computer data baseband signal or signal embodied in a carrier wave. The baseband signal or signal embedded in the carrier wave or other types of signals currently used or hereafter developed may be generated according to several methods well known to one skilled in the art. The baseband signal and or signal embedded in the carrier wave may be referred to in some contexts as a transitory signal.

The processor executes instructions codes computer programs scripts which it accesses from hard disk floppy disk optical disk these various disk based systems may all be considered secondary storage ROM RAM or the network connectivity devices . While only one processor is shown multiple processors may be present. Thus while instructions may be discussed as executed by a processor the instructions may be executed simultaneously serially or otherwise executed by one or multiple processors. Instructions codes computer programs scripts and or data that may be accessed from the secondary storage for example hard drives floppy disks optical disks and or other device the ROM and or the RAM may be referred to in some contexts as non transitory instructions and or non transitory information.
