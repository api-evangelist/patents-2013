The present invention relates to a virtual sensor network system and more particularly to a virtual sensor network system for convergence of heterogeneous sensors.

An intelligent vehicle is a vehicle that reads interior and exterior information of a vehicle using a sensor recognizes conditions by processing information based on an algorithm and performs appropriate measures according to the recognized conditions.

Specifically various sensors may be used in the intelligent vehicle such as a homogeneous sensor and the sensors each have different characteristics. Additionally various algorithms may be used such as an algorithm the performs a same function using various methods and characteristics of a single algorithm may change depending on a change of parameters.

Moreover each system developed by variously combined sensors and an algorithm may be verified by being applied to a test vehicle and during the verification process and performance according to the changed the sensor and the algorithm may be tested under the same conditions.

However during the development or changing of the sensor and the algorithm the process of applying and verifying the developed or changed sensor and algorithm to the test vehicle is required and the development cost and time are consumed due to the driving verification of the test vehicle

The above information disclosed in this section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the invention and therefore it may contain information that does not form the prior art that is already known in this country to a person of ordinary skill in the art.

The present invention provides a virtual sensor network system capable of implementing reliable verification during an algorithm development process by reproducing a time deviation of sensor data included in an actual sensor by a virtual sensor network system configuration to which a time synchronization algorithm may be applied.

An exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides a virtual sensor network system that may include a virtual sensor node that stores sensor data collected from a sensor mounted within a vehicle in time synchronization therewith and provides the stored sensor data in time synchronization therewith and a master node that performs a control on the virtual sensor node and performs an algorithm used in an intelligent vehicle using the sensor data wherein the master node receives the sensor data stored in the virtual sensor node as the virtual sensor data in time synchronization therewith without inputting actual sensor data from the sensor mounted within the vehicle while performing the algorithm.

The virtual sensor network system may further include a convergence sensor node that transfers a command from the master node to the virtual sensor node and the virtual sensor data transferred from the virtual sensor node to the master node between the master node and the virtual sensor node. The convergence sensor node may include an algorithm that processes the virtual sensor data transferred from the virtual sensor node. Furthermore the master node may perform a control to store the sensor data via the virtual sensor node during the driving of the vehicle in time synchronization therewith and control the virtual sensor node to provide the sensor data stored in the virtual sensor node as the virtual sensor data when the master node is not connected with the vehicle.

The master node and the virtual sensor node each may include an interface unit that serves as an interface with networks extraneous to the vehicle a basic function unit that performs a basic function of a node an algorithm unit e.g. a processor mounted with the algorithm for operating components of the node and an interaction unit that relays mutual data transmission between the basic function unit and the algorithm unit.

The interface unit may include a sensor interface connected with the sensor of the vehicle to operate the sensor and configured to receive the sensor data from the sensor and a network interface connected with a node of an upper layer or a lower layer to receive command data and transmit sensor data.

The basic function unit may include a time synchronization module that provides a time period for synchronization a data storage module that stores the sensor data received from the sensor interface with a time provided from the time synchronization module and a virtual sensor module that provides the sensor data stored in the data storage module to the node of the upper layer as the virtual sensor data in the time provided from the time synchronization module.

The interaction unit may include an application programming interface API module that provides the functions of the basic function unit to the algorithm unit via a standardized interface and a standard profile module that converts and provides heterogeneous sensor protocols into a single integrated standard protocol. Furthermore the time synchronization module of the master node may synchronize the entire time of the virtual sensor network system and the time synchronization may be performed periodically.

The sensor data stored in the data storage module may be converted by the standard profile module and transferred to the node of the upper layer as the virtual sensor data through the virtual sensor module. The sensor data stored in the data storage module may be transferred to the algorithm unit via the API module processed by the algorithm unit and transferred to the node of the upper node as the virtual sensor data via the virtual sensor module.

As described above according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention the time deviation of the sensor data included in the actual sensor may be reproduced by the virtual sensor network system configuration which the time synchronization algorithm may be applied thereby implementing the reliable verification during the algorithm development process.

Further the sensor interface and the protocol may be unified during the processing of the sensor data by applying the standard profile for the active safety sensor. The unified sensor interface and protocol may be more efficient than the related art that develops the system based on each sensor interface and the protocol respectively.

Further the layering of the sensors and the introduction of the convergence node may further improve the complexity of the algorithm as compared to when the single controller processes all the data to improve the efficiency and the stability and the substantial amount of data may be processed by the dispersion processing of the data.

In addition the virtual sensor node may be directly connected with the sensor extraneous to the vehicle under the driving environment to store the sensor data input from the sensor and provide the stored sensor data to the node of the upper layer under the laboratory environment.

Hereinafter the operation of the virtual sensor network system according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.

In both of the driving environment or the laboratory environment the virtual sensor network system may utilize the time synchronization module of the master node at the time of the initial operation to synchronize the time of the time synchronization module of the convergence sensor node of the lower layer and the virtual sensor node with the time of the master node . The time synchronization may be performed periodically.

First the operation of the virtual sensor network system under the driving environment will be described with reference to .

Referring to the virtual sensor network system may be connected with various types of sensors that are mounted within the test vehicle for collecting the test sensor data under the driving environment. In particular the sensor interface of the virtual sensor node of the virtual sensor network system may be connected with the sensor of the vehicle.

As described above when the virtual sensor network system is configured within the test vehicle the algorithm unit of the master node may be configured to transfer a command for storing the sensor data to the convergence sensor node and the virtual sensor node . Therefore the virtual sensor node of the lower layer of the virtual sensor network system that is the virtual sensor node directly connected with the sensor of the test vehicle may be configured to receive a command received from the upper layer via the network interface . In particular the received command may be converted into a unique protocol of the sensor by the standard profile module of the interaction unit and may be transferred to the sensor via the sensor interface to execute the operation of the sensor.

In this configuration when the test vehicle is driven the virtual sensor node may be configured to store the sensor data output from the sensors of the test vehicle. In particular the sensor data output from the sensor of the test vehicle may be received via the sensor interface and the sensor data may be stored in the data storage module along with the receiving time provided from the time synchronization module .

Moreover the sensor data received via the sensor interface according to the setting of the virtual sensor network system may be converted into the standard protocol using the standard profile module transferred to the exterior via the virtual sensor module or processed by the algorithm unit via the API module transferred to the virtual sensor module and transferred to the exterior via the network interface along with the time provided from the time synchronization module . The sensor data storage may end by the command of the master node or end by the driving completion of the test vehicle.

Next the operation of the virtual sensor network system under the laboratory environment will be described. The laboratory environment corresponds to the reproduction of the driving environment of the test vehicle based on the sensor data collected and stored in the driving environment.

The algorithm unit of the master node may be configured to transfer the command for reproducing the driving environment using the virtual sensor based on the collected and stored sensor data to the convergence sensor node and the virtual sensor node . Therefore the virtual sensor node of the lower layer may be configured to receive a command directly transferred from the master node or transferred through the convergence sensor node via the network interface .

The data storage module of the virtual sensor node may be configured to transfer the stored sensor data to the standard profile module and the standard profile module may be configured to convert the sensor data into the standard protocol and transfer the sensor data to the virtual sensor module . Alternatively the data storage module may be configured to transfer the sensor data to the algorithm unit via the API module and the algorithm unit may be configured to perform the appropriate processing and transfer the processed sensor data to the virtual sensor module .

The virtual sensor module may be configured to transfer the sensor data transferred from the standard protocol module or the sensor data transferred from the algorithm unit to the convergence sensor node or the master node of the upper layer via the network interface in the transmitting time provided from the time synchronization module .

Moreover the time synchronization module of the virtual sensor module may be configured to determine the transmitting time by referring to the sensor data stored in the data storage module and the receiving time. Therefore the virtual sensor module may be configured to provide the sensor data collected under the driving environment by the transmitting time provided from the time synchronization module as the virtual sensor data even in the laboratory environment and similarly the time collected under the driving environment.

Furthermore when the convergence sensor node receives the sensor data from the sensor node of the lower layer that is another convergence sensor node or the virtual sensor node via the network interface the convergence sensor node may be configured to process the corresponding sensor data using the algorithm unit via the API module transfer the sensor data to the virtual sensor module and transfer the sensor data to the node of the upper layer via the network interface in the transmitting time provided from the time synchronization module .

As described above at the time of the driving of the test vehicle the sensor data collected through the sensor may be stored in time synchronization therewith and generated as the virtual sensor data under the laboratory environment and transferred to the upper layer that is finally the master node thereby implementing the virtual sensor even though there is no sensor data from the actual sensor of the test vehicle.

The operation of the virtual sensor network system according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention is described above but the utilization of the developing tool using the virtual sensor network system according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described below.

At the time of the driving of the test vehicle the sensors may be mounted within the test vehicle and each sensor may be connected with the virtual sensor node . Here each virtual sensor node may be connected with a lower network of the master node . The lower nodes connected with the master node may be set using the user interface of the master node . To perform the algorithm test in real time while storing the sensor data during the driving the algorithm unit of the master node may include an algorithm to be tested.

For the algorithm test in real time during the driving the lower network may be configured via the convergence sensor node . Therefore the algorithm unit of the convergence sensor node may include the algorithm to be tested. During the driving of the test vehicle the sensor data from the sensor may be stored in each virtual sensor node along with the receiving time synchronized with the master node . After the driving of the test vehicle ends the driving environment may be reproduced under the laboratory environment. In particular the data storage module of the virtual sensor node may be configured to store the sensor data of each condition collected during the driving of the test vehicle.

The entire network may be set by the master node and each algorithm may be verified during the replacement of the algorithm included in the algorithm unit of the master node the convergence sensor node and the virtual sensor node .

Meanwhile the virtual sensor network system according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention may also be used for the intelligent safety system. First the sensor mounted within the test vehicle may be connected with the virtual sensor node . In particular the data storage module may be omitted from the virtual sensor node .

The virtual sensor node may be configured to provide the sensor protocol interface integrated by the standard profile module to the upper layer during communication with the sensor and the convergence sensor node may be configured to process the sensor data from the lower layer and transfer the processed sensor data to the upper layer. The master node may be configured to process the sensor data from the lower layer and provide the processed sensor data to the intelligent safety system.
