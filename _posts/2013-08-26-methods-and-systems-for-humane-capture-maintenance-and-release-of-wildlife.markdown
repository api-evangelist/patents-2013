This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 693 565 filed on Aug. 27 2012 entitled Methods and Systems for Humane Capture Maintenance and Release of Wildlife which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The disclosure relates to the capture of wildlife. More particularly the methods and systems described herein relate to the humane capture maintenance and release of wildlife.

Conventional systems for wildlife removal typically include cages and traps that usually cause injuries to captured wildlife. Conventional systems that do attempt to prevent injury to captured wildlife may not injure the captured wildlife but do not typically provide any resources for the captured wildlife such as heating ventilation air conditioning food water or other resources for maintaining the health or well being of the captured wildlife.

In one aspect a method for humane capture maintenance and release of wildlife includes capturing by a wildlife capture unit a wild animal. The method includes transmitting by the wildlife capture unit to a remote communications device a notification of the capture of the wild animal. The method includes managing by the wildlife capture unit an environmental condition of the wildlife containment unit to sustain the wild animal.

In some embodiments the methods and systems described herein provide functionality for humane capture maintenance and release of wildlife.

For purposes of this application it should be understood that wildlife or wild animal may include any type of animal that is roaming free and wherein the user desires to capture said animal. For instance one of ordinary skill in the art would readily recognize that said device and system could be used to capture a lost dog or cat.

Referring now to a block diagram depicts one embodiment of a system for humane capture maintenance and release of wildlife. In brief overview the system includes a capture unit an environmental maintenance system a communications system a video device a wildlife containment area and an animal detection device . The system may also include a power unit . The capture unit may include the wildlife containment area with the animal detection device in a separate area from the environmental maintenance system the communications system and the video device alternatively all components may be stored within the same area. The power unit may optionally provide a solar charger that charges one or more batteries during the day. The capture unit may include a thermal view that displays data such as for example and without limitation thermal data temperature data and humidity data. In some embodiments the wildlife containment area is customized for containing and safely maintaining young animals including babies. In one embodiment the environmental maintenance system includes a fan. In another embodiment the environmental maintenance system includes a heater. In other embodiments the capture unit is attached to a structure such as a house or garage via a bracket such as a louver bracket or a roof ridge bracket.

Referring now to a block diagram depicts certain aspects of one embodiment of a system for humane capture maintenance and release of wildlife. As shown in the embodiment depicted by the capture unit includes a wildlife containment area and a communications system . In one embodiment an animal entering the capture unit through the entrance and accessing the wildlife containment area triggers the animal detection device not shown in resulting in the closing of the door to the wildlife containment area . As will be discussed in greater detail below triggering the animal detection device may also result in activation of the communications system alerting a user of the system as to the capture of the animal in the capture unit triggering the animal detection device may also result in activation of the environmental maintenance system not shown in . It should be understood that the configuration of the capture unit shown in is but one example of an embodiment of the capture unit other embodiments may include different shapes and sizes to accommodate different types of wildlife.

Referring now to a block diagram depicts certain aspects of one embodiment of a system for humane capture maintenance and release of wildlife. As shown in the embodiment depicted by the capture unit includes an entrance a wildlife containment area a feeding station a tech service opening and a view window . The feeding station may contain food or water for sustaining a contained animal until a wildlife management professional arrives to remove the animal. The tech service opening and the view window may provide the wildlife management professional with functionality for viewing the contained animal and cleaning and maintaining the feeding station . In one embodiment the tech service opening allows the wildlife management professional to provide additional food to a captured animal without allowing the captured animal to escape. In some embodiments the capture unit optionally includes a wire mesh ramp . For example if the capture unit is customized for subterraneous or burrowing animals e.g. skunks and possums the capture unit may include both an upper level and a lower level and the wire mesh ramp allows a captured animal to move between the two levels.

Referring now to and in connection with a flow diagram depicts one embodiment of a method for humane capture maintenance and release of wildlife. In brief overview the method includes capturing by a wildlife capture unit a wild animal . The method includes transmitting by the wildlife capture unit to a remote communications device a notification of the capture of the wild animal . The method includes managing by the wildlife capture unit an environmental condition of the wildlife containment unit to sustain the wild animal .

The capture unit captures a wild animal . In some embodiments the capture unit may be installed at an entrance to a structure such as without limitation a chimney . For example the capture unit may be installed at a location in a structure where wildlife is known to attempt to enter the structure. In one of these embodiments the capture unit may include an outer area and an inner area. By way of example should an animal enter an outer area of the capture unit the animal may still exit the structure without setting off the animal detection device . However and as an alternate example should an animal enter the capture unit and proceed through the outer area to the inner area of the capture unit the animal may enter the wildlife containment area and trigger the animal detection device . In some embodiments the capture unit includes bait for luring an animal into the capture unit . In other embodiments a wildlife management professional uses tools such as a push pole discussed in greater detail below to push an animal into the capture unit .

In one embodiment the animal detection device includes an infrared device generating a beam when an animal enters the wildlife containment area it disrupts the beam alerting the animal detection device that something has entered the wildlife containment area . The animal detection device may then close a circuit to close a door to the wildlife containment area capturing the animal inside the wildlife containment area . For example the animal detection device may be connected to an arm motor not shown which controls a door switching gear that moves the door from an open position to a closed position and vice versa. In some embodiments the animal detection device includes a motion sensing device. In other embodiments the animal detection device includes a micromagnetic switch. In further embodiments the animal detection device includes a weighted plate e.g. with a switch that is activated when an animal steps on the weighted plate .

The examples above illustrate scenarios in which a wild animal enters the capture unit and the system contains the animal in the wildlife containment area without human intervention. However in other embodiments a human is required to move the animal into the wildlife containment area .

Referring ahead to a block diagram depicts one embodiment of a push pole for use in moving a wild animal into a wildlife containment area . As shown in in some embodiments the push pole includes a handle an audio system and a component . A human using the push pole to move a wild animal into the wildlife containment area may use the handle to manipulate the push pole and thus the wild animal at a distance from the wild animal the length of the handle may vary based upon the animal or a user preference. In one embodiment the audio system plays a sound that encourages a wild animal to move in the direction of the wildlife containment area . By way of example and without limitation the audio system may play the sound of a predator of the wild animal which may have the effect of having the wild animal move in the opposite direction of the sound towards the wildlife containment area . As another example if the wild animal is a raccoon the audio system may play a recording of a growling bobcat.

Referring ahead to the component may be configured to allow for positioning of the component in a structure and behind a body part of a wild animal e.g. the animal s head or body . As shown in the component was parallel to the handle however and as shown in the component may be configurable so that the component is perpendicular to the handle . The component may include a solid material such as a light transparent weather resistant thermoplastic e.g. PLEXIGLAS formed into a shape such as a square with dimensions appropriate for fitting into a building structure such as a chimney behind the wild animal blocking the wild animal s egress from the building structure. For example if a wildlife management professional needs to move a raccoon up a chimney the wildlife management professional may select a component having dimensions such that the component will fit inside the open space of the chimney behind the raccoon in such an example the wildlife management professional can push the raccoon up the chimney towards a wildlife containment area and the component prevents the raccoon from coming back down the chimney and potentially injuring either the raccoon or the wildlife management professional . By using a transparent material to form the surface of the component the wildlife management professional can see the wild animal and determine whether the wild animal has reached the wildlife containment area but the wild animal cannot exit the structure. In one embodiment the component is removable so that a user of the push pole may use a first component in interacting with a first wild animal and may then remove the first component replacing it with a second component for interacting with a second wild animal for example to select a different shape or size customized for either the wild animals or the structures through which the wild animals need to be pushed to reach the capture unit . Using the push pole a human may move a wild animal into the wildlife containment area from a safe distance.

Referring back to the method includes transmitting by the wildlife capture unit to a remote communications device a notification of the capture of the wild animal . In one embodiment the communications system includes a telecommunications device examples of telecommunications devices include without limitation telephones of any type including by way of example mobile phones computing devices of any type with access wired or wireless to a network over which to transmit data and combinations of the two including by way of example smart phones tablet computers and other devices providing some or all of the functionality of both a computer and a telephone .

In some embodiments the animal detection device controls the communications system . In one of these embodiments the animal detection device controls the communications system directly. For example the animal detection device may activate a motor that pushes a physical button on the communications system in order to transmit data from the communications system . In another of these embodiments the animal detection device controls the communications system indirectly. For example the animal detection device may activate a timer upon disruption of an infrared beam or other detection system and the timer may after a predetermined period of time activate a motor that pushes a button on the communications system in order to transmit data from the communications system . As another example the animal detection device may control both a door to the wildlife containment area and the communications system . In such an example when the animal detection device closes the door the door may depress one or more switches that close a circuit resulting in the activation of a timer that may after a predetermined period of time directly or indirectly activate the communications system alternatively the door may have depressed one or more switches when open and closing the door releases the switches closing the circuit and resulting in activation of the timer. It should be understood that these examples are not limiting and that other configurations of the system are available for directly or indirectly activating the communications system . In another example the timer and the communications system are wired together such that when the timer determines that the predetermined period of time has elapsed the timer may send an electronic signal to the communications system directing the transmission of data from the communications system .

As an alternative to pushing a physical button the system may activate a motor that controls a device capable of activating a software based user interface element instead of a physical button e.g. a device capable of interacting with a capacitive touch screen and or of activating a capacitive touch sensor such as for example a stylus or other device incorporating conductive silicone silver nylon fabric or other material generating a difference in a level of electrical capacitance on a touch screen surface or a device capable of transmitting a command e.g. using an application programming interface API to a software based device . In still another of these embodiments the communications system includes a pre programmed message that is transmitted to a user of the system upon depression of a button on the communications system . For instance an administrator of the system may program the communications system to transmit a notification when an animal is captured in the wildlife containment area .

In some embodiments therefore upon an animal disrupting an infrared beam or other detection system the animal detection device may not only close a door capturing the animal in the wildlife containment area but also activate the communications system to transmit a message to a remote communications device such as without limitation a communications device associated with a property manager a wildlife management company or other user of the system . In other embodiments in addition to audio and text based messages the communications system may transmit video data. For example the video device may provide functionality for transmitting video of activity within the capture unit to a remote communications device for example the animal detection device may activate the video device upon detecting that an animal has entered the capture unit and the video device may transmit video images of the animal to a wildlife management professional s remote communications device.

The method includes managing by the wildlife capture unit an environmental condition of the wildlife containment unit to sustain the wild animal . In one embodiment to manage the environmental condition the capture unit modifies a setting of the environmental maintenance system . In one embodiment the environmental maintenance system may include a heating ventilation air conditioning HVAC system. Environmental conditions may include without limitation a temperature of the wildlife containment area and therefore an amount of heating or of air conditioning required to maintain the temperature an amount of light e.g. by turning on or off artificial lighting or by raising or lowering shades or film over windows into the capture unit an amount of ventilation available and an amount of food or water available to the animal e.g. by opening or closing sections of the capture unit accessible to the animal . For example the capture unit may open a door to a food container within the wildlife containment area not shown in allowing a captured animal access to food and or water.

In some embodiments the animal detection device controls the environmental maintenance system . In one of these embodiments the animal detection device controls the environmental maintenance system directly. For example the animal detection device may activate a motor that powers on the environmental maintenance system or may actuate a mechanism for modifying the environmental maintenance system . In another of these embodiments the animal detection device controls the environmental maintenance system indirectly. For example the animal detection device may activate a timer that controls the environmental maintenance system after a predetermined period of time. As another example the animal detection device may control both a door to the wildlife containment area and the environmental maintenance system . In such an example when the animal detection device closes the door the door may depress one or more switches that close a circuit resulting in the activation of a timer that may after a predetermined period of time directly or indirectly activate the environmental maintenance system alternatively the door may have depressed one or more switches when open and closing the door releases the switches closing the circuit and resulting in activation of the timer. It should be understood that these examples are not limiting and that other configurations of the system are available for directly or indirectly activating the environmental maintenance system .

Alternatively the communications system may control the environmental maintenance system . For example the communications system may receive from a remote communications device such as a mobile phone or computing device accessed by an administrator of the system or other user of the system a command to power on power off or modify a setting of the environmental maintenance system and the communications system may execute the command on behalf of the remote communications device. As one example the remote communications device may establish a communications channel with the communications system over which to transmit a signal for administration of the environmental maintenance system . As another example and without limitation the environmental maintenance system may include a sensor not shown with which to determine that the remote communications device has contacted the communications system for example the environmental maintenance system may include a sensor identifying a level of light emanating from the communications system or may include a sensor decoding a dual tone multi frequency signal. By way of example only the environmental maintenance system may include a sensor determining that the communications system has turned on a light such as a backlight used on a mobile phone when the mobile phone receives an incoming call. As another example where the communications system is a mobile phone the environmental maintenance system may include a sensor that determines how many times the communications system emits a ring tone or what type of tone the communications system emits. The environmental maintenance system may include a processor receiving data from the sensor and identifying an action to take based on the data for example the processor may determine to turn on the environmental maintenance system turn off the environmental maintenance system or modify a level of heating or cooling provided by the environmental maintenance system . As another example the processor may determine to turn on or off the animal detection device based on the data. As a further example the processor may determine to open or close a door within the capture unit e.g. enabling or disabling animal access to a food or water source or a door to the wildlife containment area e.g. allowing an animal to leave the capture unit .

Referring now to a block diagram depicts one embodiment of a capture unit designed to provide a habitable environment for a wild animal after capture of the animal. In some embodiments a habitable environment is required for the animal after removal of the capture unit from a man made structure e.g. a residence or place of business but before the animal is released into the wild. A capture unit may be designed so that it can attach to a man made structure or as shown in to stand alone after removal from a man made structure. For example a wildlife management professional may place a capture unit at a residence wait for an animal to be captured and then move the unit with the animal to an area where the animal may safely be rehabilitated and released into the wild. By way of example and without limitation a customer of the wildlife management professional may complain of raccoon activity substantially in or about a residential area the wildlife management professional may place the capture unit in a location in the residential area where the raccoon may enter the capture unit . After the raccoon enters the capture unit the wildlife management professional may relocate the capture unit to a different part of the residential area e.g. away from a house or outside the residential area entirely and leave the unit in an area where the raccoon can be rehabilitated. As another example a family of raccoons may have established a nest in a chimney and the wildlife management professional can move the raccoon family into the capture unit either by means of bait encouragement or use of a tool such as the push pole when the wildlife management professional relocates the capture unit the professional may leave the doors to the unit open allowing the animals to come and go until they establish a nest in or near the new location.

Referring now to a block diagram depicts another embodiment of a capture unit designed to provide a habitable environment for a wild animal after capture of the animal. As discussed above the capture unit may be provided in different sizes for different animals or locations. As shown in the example depicted by the capture unit is smaller than the capture unit depicted in and intended for a different animal e.g. squirrels instead of raccoons . Additionally as shown in the example depicted by the capture unit may be configured to attach to different types of structures as shown in the capture unit may be attached to a tree trunk when used to capture certain wild animals e.g. squirrels .

In some embodiments implementing the methods and systems described herein allows users of the system to leave a capture unit at a structure receive notification when the capture unit has captured wildlife and know that the captured wildlife will be in a comfortable environment with appropriate HVAC and other environmental conditions until the users of the system can arrive at the structure and release the captured animal back into the wild. In one of these embodiments for example and without limitation where the structure is a residential building a wild animal captured in a unit with the ability to minimize the amount of time before a wildlife management technician can arrive to remove the animal provides any humans residing in the structure with the knowledge that the trapped animal will be removed promptly and without injury to the animal.
