Traditionally pharmaceuticals have primarily consisted of small molecules that are dispensed orally as solid pills and liquids or as injectables. Over the past three decades formulations i.e. compositions that control the route and or rate of drug delivery and allow delivery of the therapeutic agent at the site where it is needed have become increasingly common and complex. Nevertheless many questions and challenges regarding the development of new treatments as well as the mechanisms with which to administer them remain to be addressed. For example many drugs exhibit limited or otherwise reduced potencies and therapeutic effects because they are either generally subject to partial degradation before they reach a desired target in the body or accumulate in tissues other than the target or both.

One objective in the field of drug delivery systems therefore is to deliver medications intact to specifically targeted areas of the body through a system that can stabilize the drug and control the in vivo transfer of the therapeutic agent utilizing either physiological or chemical mechanisms or both.

Antibody drug conjugates have been developed as target specific therapeutic agents. Antibodies against various cancer cell surface antigens have been conjugated with different cytotoxic agents that inhibit various essential cellular targets such as microtubules maytansinoids auristatins taxanes U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 208 020 5 416 064 6 333 410 6 441 163 6 340 701 6 372 738 6 436 931 6 596 757 and 7 276 497 DNA calicheamicin doxorubicin CC 1065 analogs U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 475 092 5 585 499 5 846 545 6 534 660 6 756 397 and 6 630 579 . Antibody conjugates with some of these cytotoxic drugs are actively being investigated in the clinic for cancer therapy Ricart A. D. and Tolcher A. W. 20074 245 255 Krop et al. 201028 2698 2704 . However existing antibody drug conjugates have exhibited a few limitations. A major limitation is their inability to deliver a sufficient concentration of drug to the target site because of the limited number of targeted antigens and the relatively moderate cytotoxicity of cancer drugs like methotrexate daunorubicin maytansinoids taxanes and vincristine. One approach to achieving significant cytotoxicity is by linkage of a large number of drug molecules either directly or indirectly to the antibody. However such heavily modified antibodies often display impaired binding to the target antigen and fast in vivo clearance from the blood stream. Therefore there is a need to improve the ability to deliver a sufficient concentration of a drug to the target such that maximum cytotoxicity for the drug is achieved.

 Biocompatible as used herein is intended to describe compounds that exert minimal destructive or host response effects while in contact with body fluids or living cells or tissues. Thus a biocompatible group as used herein refers to an aliphatic cycloalkyl heteroaliphatic heterocycloalkyl aryl or heteroaryl moiety which falls within the definition of the term biocompatible as defined above and herein. The term Biocompatibility as used herein is also taken to mean that the compounds exhibit minimal interactions with recognition proteins e.g. naturally occurring antibodies cell proteins cells and other components of biological systems unless such interactions are specifically desirable. Thus substances and functional groups specifically intended to cause the above minimal interactions e.g. drugs and prodrugs are considered to be biocompatible. Preferably with exception of compounds intended to be cytotoxic such as e.g. antineoplastic agents compounds are biocompatible if their addition to normal cells in vitro at concentrations similar to the intended systemic in vivo concentrations results in less than or equal to 1 cell death during the time equivalent to the half life of the compound in vivo e.g. the period of time required for 50 of the compound administered in vivo to be eliminated cleared and their administration in vivo induces minimal and medically acceptable inflammation foreign body reaction immunotoxicity chemical toxicity and or other such adverse effects. In the above sentence the term normal cells refers to cells that are not intended to be destroyed or otherwise significantly affected by the compound being tested.

 Biodegradable As used herein biodegradable polymers are polymers that are susceptible to biological processing in vivo. As used herein biodegradable compounds or moieties are those that when taken up by cells can be broken down by the lysosomal or other chemical machinery or by hydrolysis into components that the cells can either reuse or dispose of without significant toxic effect on the cells. The term biocleavable as used herein has the same meaning of biodegradable . The degradation fragments preferably induce little or no organ or cell overload or pathological processes caused by such overload or other adverse effects in vivo. Examples of biodegradation processes include enzymatic and non enzymatic hydrolysis oxidation and reduction. Suitable conditions for non enzymatic hydrolysis of the biodegradable protein polymer drug conjugates or their components e.g. the biodegradable polymeric carrier and the linkers between the carrier and the antibody or the drug molecule described herein for example include exposure of the biodegradable conjugates to water at a temperature and a pH of lysosomal intracellular compartment. Biodegradation of some protein polymer drug conjugates or their components e.g. the biodegradable polymeric carrier and the linkers between the carrier and the antibody or the drug molecule can also be enhanced extracellularly e.g. in low pH regions of the animal body e.g. an inflamed area in the close vicinity of activated macrophages or other cells releasing degradation facilitating factors. In certain preferred embodiments the effective size of the polymer carrier at pH 7.5 does not detectably change over 1 to 7 days and remains within 50 of the original polymer size for at least several weeks. At pH 5 on the other hand the polymer carrier preferably detectably degrades over 1 to 5 days and is completely transformed into low molecular weight fragments within a two week to several month time frame. Polymer integrity in such tests can be measured for example by size exclusion HPLC. Although faster degradation may be in some cases preferable in general it may be more desirable that the polymer degrades in cells with the rate that does not exceed the rate of metabolization or excretion of polymer fragments by the cells. In preferred embodiments the polymers and polymer biodegradation byproducts are biocompatible.

 Bioavailability The term bioavailability refers to the systemic availability i.e. blood plasma levels of a given amount of drug or compound administered to a subject. Bioavailability is an absolute term that indicates measurement of both the time rate and total amount extent of drug or compound that reaches the general circulation from an administered dosage form.

In certain exemplary embodiments the conjugates of the invention find use in biomedical applications such as drug delivery and tissue engineering and the carrier is biocompatible and biodegradable. In certain embodiments the carrier is a soluble polymer nanoparticle gel liposome micelle suture implant etc. In certain embodiments the term soluble polymer encompasses biodegradable biocompatible polymer such as a polyal e.g. hydrophilic polyacetal or polyketal . In certain other embodiments the carrier is a fully synthetic semi synthetic or naturally occurring polymer. In certain other embodiments the carrier is hydrophilic.

In certain exemplary embodiments the carriers used in the present invention are biodegradable biocompatible polyals comprising at least one hydrolysable bond in each monomer unit positioned within the main chain. This ensures that the degradation process via hydrolysis cleavage of the monomer units will result in fragmentation of the polymer conjugate to the monomeric components i.e. degradation and confers to the polymer conjugates of the invention their biodegradable properties.

Examples of biodegradable biocompatible polymers suitable for practicing the invention can be found inter alia in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 811 510 5 863 990 5 958 398 7 838 619 and 7 790 150 and U.S. Publication No. 2006 0058512 each of the above listed patent documents is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Thus in certain exemplary embodiments carriers suitable for practicing the present invention are polyals having at least one acetal ketal oxygen atom in each monomer unit positioned within the main chain. As discussed above this ensures that the degradation process via hydrolysis cleavage of the polymer acetal ketal groups will result in fragmentation of the polyal conjugate to low molecular weight components i.e. degradation .

In yet another embodiment the polymeric carrier is dextrin that is produced by the hydrolysis of a starch obtained from various natural products such as for example wheat rice maize and tapioca. Depending on the structure of the starch starting material each dextrin comprises a unique distribution of 1 4 linkages and 1 6 linkages. Since the rate of biodegradability of 1 6 linkages is typically less than that for 1 4 linkages preferably the percentage of 1 6 linkages is less than 10 and more preferably less than 5 . In one embodiment the molecular weight of the dextrin is in the range of about 1 kDa to about 200 kDa more preferably from about 2 kDa to about 55 kDa.

In certain embodiments the carrier comprises polysaccharides activated by selective oxidation of cyclic vicinal diols of 1 2 1 4 1 6 and 2 6 pyranosides and 1 2 1 5 1 6 furanosides or by oxidation of lateral 6 hydroxy and 5 6 diol containing polysaccharides prior to conjugation with drug molecules or PBRMs.

In certain embodiments the functional group is a hydroxyl moiety.

In one embodiment the polymeric carrier comprises activated hydrophilic biodegradable biocompatible polymers comprising from 0.1 to 100 polyacetal moieties whose backbone is represented by the following chemical structure CH CHR O CHR O Wherein 

Rand Rare independently hydrogen hydroxyl hydroxy alkyl e.g. CHOH CH OH CH OH CHO CH OH CHO or carbonyl and

In yet other embodiments the polymeric carrier comprises a biodegradable biocompatible polyketal wherein at least a subset of the polyketal repeatable structural units have the following chemical structure 

Biodegradable biocompatible polyketal polymers and their methods of making have been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 811 510 7 790 150 and 7 838 619 which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

In one embodiment the polymeric carrier can be obtained from partially oxidized dextran 1 6 D glucose followed by reduction. In this embodiment the polymer comprises a random mixture of the unmodified dextran A partially oxidized dextran acetal units B and exhaustively dextran acetal units C of the following structures 

In another embodiment the polymeric carrier comprises unmodified acetal units i.e. polyacetal segments. In some embodiments the polyacetals can be derived from exhaustively oxidized dextran followed by reduction. These polymers have been described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 811 510 which is hereby incorporated by reference for its description of polyacetals at column 2 line 65 to column 8 line 55 and their synthesis at column 10 line 45 to column 11 line 14. In one embodiment the unmodified polyacetal polymer is a poly hydroxymethylethylene hydroxymethyl formal polymer PHF .

In addition to poly hydroxymethylethylene hydroxymethyl formal polymers the backbone of the polymeric carrier can also comprise co polymers of poly hydroxymethylethylene hydroxymethyl formal blocks and other acetal or non acetal monomers or polymers. For example polyethylene glycol polymers are useful as a stealth agent in the polymer backbone because they can decrease interactions between polymer side chains of the appended functional groups. Such groups can also be useful in limiting interactions such as between serum factors and the modified polymer. Other stealth agent monomers for inclusion in the polymer backbone include for example ethyleneimine methacrylic acid acrylamide glutamic acid and combinations thereof.

The acetal or ketal units are present in the modified polymer in an amount effective to promote biocompatibility. The unmodified acetal or ketal unit can be described as a stealth agent that provides biocompatibility and solubility to the modified polymers. In addition conjugation to a polyacetal or polyketal polymer can modify the susceptibility to metabolism and degradation of the moieties attached to it and influence biodistribution clearance and degradation.

The molar fraction n of unmodified polyacetal units is the molar fraction available to promote biocompatibility solubility and increase half life based on the total number of polymer units in the modified polymer. The molar fraction n may be the minimal fraction of unmodified monomer acetal units needed to provide biocompatibility solubility stability or a particular half life or can be some larger fraction. The most desirable degree of cytotoxicity is substantially none i.e. the modified polymer is substantially inert to the subject. However as is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art some degree of cytotoxicity can be tolerated depending on the severity of disease or symptom being treated the efficacy of the treatment the type and degree of immune response and like considerations.

Table C below provides more examples of the PBRM described hereof which are suitable for conjugation to form the polymer drug protein conjugates or polymer PBRM scaffolds of the invention.

As described above the drug or PBRM is connected to the polymeric carrier via a linker Lor L. In some embodiments the linker is biocleavable biodegradable under intracellular conditions such that the cleavage of the linker releases the drug or PBRM from the polymer unit in the intracellular environment.

A linker is any chemical moiety that is capable of linking a drug or a PBRM to a polymer backbone through chemical bonds such that the drug or PBRM and the polymer are chemically coupled e.g. covalently bonded to each other. In some embodiments the linker comprises a biodegradable linker moiety e.g. a biodegradable bond such as an ester or amide bond .

In other embodiments the linker Lor Lis biodegradable under mild conditions i.e. conditions within a cell under which the activity of the drug is not affected. Examples of suitable biodegradable linker moiety include disulfide linkers acid labile linkers photolabile linkers peptidase labile linkers and esterase labile linkers.

In some embodiments the linker Lor Lis biocleavable under reducing conditions e.g. a disulfide linker . In this embodiment the drug or PBRM moiety is linked to the polymer through a disulfide bond. The linker molecule comprises a reactive chemical group that can react with the drug. Preferred reactive chemical groups for reaction with the drug or PBRM moiety are N succinimidyl esters and N sulfosuccinimidyl esters. Additionally the linker molecule comprises a reactive chemical group preferably a dithiopyridyl group that can react with the drug to form a disulfide bond. In some embodiments the linker molecules include for example N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridyldithio butanoate SPDB N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridyldithio pentanoate SPP N succinimidyl 5 acetylthioacetate SATA and N succinimidyl oxycarbonyl alpha methyl alpha 2 pyridyl dithio toluene or 2 5 dioxopyrrolidin 1 yl 4 1 pyridin 2 yldisulfanyl ethyl benzoate SMPT .

In other embodiments the biocleavable linker Lor Lis pH sensitive i.e. sensitive to hydrolysis at certain pH values. Typically the pH sensitive linker is hydrolysable under acidic conditions. For example an acid labile linker that is hydrolysable in the lysosome or endosome e.g. a hydrazone semicarbazone thiosemicarbazone cis aconitic amide orthoester acetal ketal or the like can be used. Such linkers are relatively stable under neutral pH conditions such as those in the blood but are unstable at below pH 5.5 or 5.0 the approximate pH of the lysosome. In certain embodiments the hydrolysable linker is a thioether linker such as e.g. a thioether attached to the therapeutic agent via an acylhydrazone bond.

In other embodiments the linker Lor Lis photo labile and is useful at the body surface and in many body cavities that are accessible to light. Furthermore Lor Lis biocleavable by infrared light which can penetrate tissue. Accordingly Lor Lis useful for both applications on the body surface and in the tissue.

In some embodiments the linker Lor Lis biocleavable by a cleaving agent that is present in the intracellular environment e.g. within a lysosome or endosome or caveolea . The linker can be for example a peptidyl linker that is cleaved by an intracellular peptidase or protease enzyme including but not limited to a lysosomal or endosomal protease.

In some embodiments the linker Lor Lis cleaved by esterases. Only certain esters can be cleaved by esterases present inside or outside cells. Esters are formed by the condensation of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Simple esters are esters produced with simple alcohols such as aliphatic alcohols and small cyclic and small aromatic alcohols.

In yet other embodiments the linker Lor Lis not biocleavable and the drug is released by antibody degradation. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 7 498 298 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and for all purposes.

Typically the linker Lor Lis not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment. As used herein not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment in the context of a linker means that no more than about 20 typically no more than about 15 more typically no more than about 10 and even more typically no more than about 5 no more than about 3 or no more than about 1 of the linkers in a sample of Polymer Drug Conjugate are cleaved when the Polymer Drug Conjugate presents in an extracellular environment e.g. in plasma for 24 hours. Whether a linker is not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment can be determined for example by incubating the Polymer Drug Conjugate with plasma for a predetermined time period e.g. 2 4 8 16 or 24 hours and then quantitating the amount of free drug present in the plasma.

In embodiments the linker Lhas the structure R C O X M Y M Z M Q M with Rconnected to an oxygen atom of the polymeric carrier and Mconnected to the drug molecule to be delivered.

In embodiments the linker Lhas the structure Lis a linker having the structure R C O X M Y M Z M Q M with Rconnected to an oxygen atom of the polymeric carrier and Mconnected to the PBRM.

For example L D can have one of the following structures below in which the wavy bond indicates that D i.e. Drug is either connected to the functional linker directly or via another moiety 

While biocleavable linkers preferably are used in the invention a non biocleavable linker also can be used to generate the above described conjugate. A non biocleavable linker is any chemical moiety that is capable of linking a drug or PBRM to a polymer in a stable covalent manner. Thus non biocleavable linkers are substantially resistant to acid induced cleavage light induced cleavage peptidase induced cleavage esterase induced cleavage and or disulfide bond cleavage at conditions under which the drug or polymer remains active.

In one embodiment a substantial amount of the drug moiety is not cleaved from the conjugate until the protein polymer drug conjugate enters a cell with a cell surface receptor specific for the PBRM of the protein polymer drug conjugate and the drug moiety is cleaved from the protein polymer drug conjugate when the protein polymer drug conjugate does enter the cell.

In another embodiment the bioavailability of the protein polymer drug conjugate or an intracellular metabolite of the protein polymer drug conjugate in a subject is improved when compared to a drug compound or conjugate comprising the drug moiety of the protein polymer drug conjugate or when compared to an analog of the compound not having the drug moiety.

In another embodiment the drug moiety is intracellularly cleaved in a subject from the protein polymer drug conjugate or an intracellular metabolite of the protein polymer drug conjugate.

Conjugates of the invention comprise one or more occurrences of D where D is a therapeutic agent e.g. a drug wherein the one or more occurrences of D may be the same or different.

In certain other embodiments one or more occurrences of PBRM is attached to the polymeric carrier wherein the one or more occurrences of PBRM may be the same or different. In certain other embodiments one or more polymer carriers that contains one or more occurrences of D are connected to a PBRM e.g. an antibody .

As discussed more generally above in certain embodiments each polymeric carrier independently has about 0.1 to about 25 monomers comprising a D more preferably about 0.5 to about 20 more preferably about 1 to about 15 and even more preferably about 2 to about 10 .

In certain embodiments the conjugates are formed in several steps. These steps include 1 modifying a polymer so that it contains a functional group that can react with a functional group of the drug or its derivative 2 reacting the modified polymer with the drug or its derivative so that the drug is linked to the polymer 3 modifying the polymer drug conjugate so that the polymer contains a functional group that can react with a functional group of the PBRM or its derivative and 4 reacting the modified polymer drug conjugate with the PBRM or its derivative to form the conjugate of this invention. Step 3 may be omitted if the modified polymer produced by step 1 contains a functional group that can react with a functional group of the PBRM or its derivative.

In another embodiment the conjugates are formed in several steps 1 modifying a polymer so that it contains a functional group that can react with a functional group of a first drug or its derivative 2 reacting the modified polymer with the first drug or its derivative so that the first drug is linked to the polymer 3 modifying the polymer drug conjugate so that it contains a different functional group that can react with a functional group of a second drug or its derivative 4 reacting the modified polymer drug conjugate with the second drug or its derivative so that the second drug is linked to the polymer drug conjugate 5 modifying the polymer drug conjugate containing 2 different drugs so that the polymer contains a functional group that can react with a functional group of the PBRM or its derivative and 6 reacting the modified polymer drug conjugate of step 5 with the PBRM or its derivative to form the conjugate of this invention. Steps 5 and 6 may be repeated if 2 different PBRM or its derivatives are to be conjugated to form a polymer drug conjugate comprising two different drugs and two different PBRMs.

In yet another embodiment the conjugates are formed in several steps. These steps include 1 modifying a polymer so that it contains a functional group that can react with a functional group of the drug or its derivative 2 further modifying the polymer so that it also contains a functional group that can react with a functional group of the PBRM or its derivative 3 reacting the modified polymer with the drug or its derivative so that the drug is linked to the polymer and 4 reacting the modified polymer drug conjugate with the PBRM or its derivative to form the conjugate of this invention. The sequence of steps 1 and 2 or that of steps 3 and 4 can be reversed. Further either step 1 or 2 may be omitted if the modified polymer contains a functional group that can react with both a functional group of the drug or its derivatives and a functional group of the PBRM or its derivative.

In another embodiment the conjugates are formed in several steps 1 modifying a polymer so that it contains a functional group that can react with a functional group of a first drug or its derivative 2 further modifying a polymer so that it contains a functional group that can react with a functional group of the PBRM or its derivative 3 reacting the modified polymer with the first drug or its derivative so that the first drug is linked to the polymer 4 modifying the polymer drug conjugate so that it contains a different functional group that can react with a functional group of a second drug or its derivative 5 reacting the modified polymer drug conjugate with the second drug or its derivative so that the second drug is linked to the polymer drug conjugate 6 reacting the modified polymer drug conjugate containing 2 different drugs so that the polymer with the PBRM or its derivative to form the conjugate of this invention. Step 6 may be repeated if 2 different PBRM or its derivatives are to be conjugated to form a polymer drug conjugate comprising two different drugs and two different PBRMs. Step 4 may be carried out after step 1 so that the modified polymer contains two different functional groups that can react with two different drugs or their derivatives. In this embodiment the modified polymer containing two different functional group that can react with two different drugs or their derivatives can be further modified so that it contains a functional group that can react with a functional group of the PBRM or its derivative prior to the reaction of the modified polymer with either the two different drugs step 3 and step 5 or PBRM step 6 .

The biodegradable biocompatible conjugates of the invention can be prepared to meet desired requirements of biodegradability and hydrophilicity. For example under physiological conditions a balance between biodegradability and stability can be reached. For instance it is known that molecules with molecular weights beyond a certain threshold generally above 40 100 kDa depending on the physical shape of the molecule are not excreted through kidneys as small molecules are and can be cleared from the body only through uptake by cells and degradation in intracellular compartments most notably lysosomes. This observation exemplifies how functionally stable yet biodegradable materials may be designed by modulating their stability under general physiological conditions pH 7.5 0.5 and at lysosomal pH pH near 5 . For example hydrolysis of acetal and ketal groups is known to be catalyzed by acids therefore polyals will be in general less stable in acidic lysosomal environment than for example in blood plasma. One can design a test to compare polymer degradation profile at for example pH 5 and pH 7.5 at 37 C. in aqueous media and thus to determine the expected balance of polymer stability in normal physiological environment and in the digestive lysosomal compartment after uptake by cells. Polymer integrity in such tests can be measured for example by size exclusion HPLC. One skilled on the art can select other suitable methods for studying various fragments of the degraded conjugates of this invention.

In many cases it will be preferable that at pH 7.5 the effective size of the polymer will not detectably change over 1 to 7 days and remain within 50 from the original for at least several weeks. At pH 5 on the other hand the polymer should preferably detectably degrade over 1 to 5 days and be completely transformed into low molecular weight fragments within a two week to several month time frame. Although faster degradation may be in some cases preferable in general it may be more desirable that the polymer degrades in cells with the rate that does not exceed the rate of metabolization or excretion of polymer fragments by the cells. Accordingly in certain embodiments the conjugates of the present invention are expected to be biodegradable in particular upon uptake by cells and relatively inert in relation to biological systems. The products of carrier degradation are preferably uncharged and do not significantly shift the pH of the environment. It is proposed that the abundance of alcohol groups may provide low rate of polymer recognition by cell receptors particularly of phagocytes. The polymer backbones of the present invention generally contain few if any antigenic determinants characteristic for example for some polysaccharides and polypeptides and generally do not comprise rigid structures capable of engaging in key and lock type interactions in vivo unless the latter are desirable. Thus the soluble crosslinked and solid conjugates of this invention are predicted to have low toxicity and bioadhesivity which makes them suitable for several biomedical applications.

In certain embodiments of the present invention the biodegradable biocompatible conjugates can form linear or branched structures. For example the biodegradable biocompatible polyal conjugates of the present invention can be chiral optically active . Optionally the biodegradable biocompatible polyal conjugates of the present invention can be scalemic.

In certain embodiments the conjugates of the invention are water soluble. In certain embodiments the conjugates of the invention are water insoluble. In certain embodiments the inventive conjugate is in a solid form. In certain embodiments the conjugates of the invention are colloids. In certain embodiments the conjugates of the invention are in particle form. In certain embodiments the conjugates of the invention are in gel form.

This invention also features a polymeric scaffold useful for conjugating with a PBRM to form a polymer drug PBRM conjugate described herein. The scaffold comprises a polymeric carrier one or more L D connected to the polymeric carrier and one or more Lconnected to the polymeric carrier which is suitable for connecting a PBRM to the polymeric carrier wherein 

Lis a linker different from Land having the structure R C O Lwith Rconnected to an oxygen atom of the polymeric carrier and Lsuitable for connecting directly or indirectly to a PBRM 

Lis a moiety containing a functional group that is capable of forming a covalent bond with a functional group of a PBRM.

For example the functional group of Lor Lis selected from SRP S S LG maleimido and halo in which LG is a leaving group and RP is H or a sulfur protecting group.

For example Lcomprises X CH C O with X directly connected to the carbonyl group of R C O in which X is CH O or NH and v is an integer from 1 to 6.

For example the polymeric carrier of the scaffold of the invention is a polyacetal e.g. a PHF having a molecular weight i.e. MW of the unmodified PHF ranging from about 2 kDa to about 300 kDa. The selection of a polymeric carrier with a specific MW range may depend on the size of the PBRM to be conjugated with.

For example for conjugating a PBRM having a molecular weight of 40 kDa or greater e.g. 80 kDa or greater the polymeric carrier of the scaffold of the invention is a polyacetal e.g. a PHF having a molecular weight i.e. MW of the unmodified PHF ranging from about 2 kDa to about 40 kDa e.g. about 6 20 kDa or about 8 15 kDa .

PBRM drug polymer conjugates drug carring polymeric scaffolds or PBRM caning polymer scaffolds can be purified i.e. removal of residual unreacted drug PBRM or polymeric starting materials by extensive diafiltration. If necessary additional purification by size exclusion chromatography can be conducted to remove any aggregated PBRM drug polymer conjugates. In general the PBRM drug polymer conjugates as purified typically contain 

Tables D and E below provide examples of the drug carrying polymeric scaffolds and the polymer drug protein conjugates of the invention respectively.

According to the present invention any available techniques can be used to make the inventive conjugates or compositions including them and intermediates and components e.g. carriers and modifiers useful for making them. For example semi synthetic and fully synthetic methods such as those discussed in detail below may be used.

Methods for preparing polymer carriers e.g. biocompatible biodegradable polymer carriers suitable for conjugation to modifiers are known in the art. For example synthetic guidance can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 811 510 5 863 990 5 958 398 7 838 619 and 7 790 150 and U.S. Publication No. 2006 0058512. The skilled practitioner will know how to adapt these methods to make polymer carriers for use in the practice of the invention.

For example semi synthetic polyals may be prepared from polyaldoses and polyketoses via complete lateral cleavage of carbohydrate rings with periodate in aqueous solutions with subsequent conversion into hydrophilic moieties e.g. via borohydride reduction for conjugation of hydroxyl groups with one or more drug molecules or PBRMs via a dicarboxylic acid linker e.g. glutaric acid linker . In an exemplary embodiment the carbohydrate rings of a suitable polysaccharide can be oxidized by glycol specific reagents resulting in the cleavage of carbon carbon bonds between carbon atoms that are each connected to a hydroxyl group. An example of application of this methodology to dextran B 512 is illustrated below 

In the above schemes the wavy bond indicates that Wor Ware connected directly as shown or via another moiety such as Mor Mrespectively

In the above schemes q is an integer from 0 to 4 and each occurrence of R is independently hydrogen halogen CN NO an aliphatic heteroaliphatic carbocyclic or heterocycloalkyl moiety or GRwherein G is O S NR C O S O SO C O O C O NR OC O NRC O OC O O OC O NR NRC O O NRC O NR C S C S S SC S SC S S C NR C NR O C NR NR OC NR NRC NR NRSO NRSONR or SONR wherein each occurrence of R Rand Ris independently hydrogen halogen or an optionally substituted aliphatic heteroaliphatic carbocyclic or heterocycloalkyl moiety.

In certain embodiments each occurrence of R is independently hydrogen alkyl alkenyl alkynyl cycloalkyl heteroalkyl heteroalkenyl heteroalkynyl heterocycloalkyl aryl heteroaryl C O Ror ZR wherein Z is O S NR wherein each occurrence of Rand Ris independently hydrogen or an alkyl alkenyl alkynyl cycloalkyl heteroalkyl heteroalkenyl heteroalkynyl heterocycloalkyl aryl or heteroaryl moiety. In certain embodiments each occurrence of Ris hydrogen. In certain embodiments one or more occurrences of Ris a Calkyl moiety. In certain embodiments one or more occurrences of Ris lower alkyl. In certain embodiments one or more occurrences of Ris a hydrophobic group. In certain embodiments one or more occurrences of Ris a hydrophilic group. In certain embodiments one or more occurrences of Ris an anionic group. In certain embodiments one or more occurrences of Ris a cationic group. In certain embodiments one or more occurrences of Ris a receptor ligand.

In one embodiment a method for forming the biodegradable biocompatible polyal conjugates of the present invention comprises a process by which a suitable polysaccharide is combined with an efficient amount of a glycol specific oxidizing agent to form an aldehyde intermediate. The aldehyde intermediate which is a polyal itself may then be reduced to the corresponding polyol succinulated and coupled with one or more suitable modifiers to form a biodegradable biocompatible polyal conjugate comprising succinamide containing linkages.

In another preferred embodiment fully synthetic biodegradable biocompatible polyals for used in the present invention can be prepared by reacting a suitable initiator with a suitable precursor compound.

For example fully synthetic polyals may be prepared by condensation of vinyl ethers with protected substituted diols. Other methods such as cycle opening polymerization may be used in which the method efficacy may depend on the degree of substitution and bulkiness of the protective groups.

One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that solvent systems catalysts and other factors may be optimized to obtain high molecular weight products.

In certain embodiments the drug may be modified before conjugation to the polymeric carrier. Schemes 1 and 2 are illustrative methods for modifying a Vinca alkaloid. Scheme 3 shows a method for modifying a non natural camptothecin derivative. Scheme 4 shows a method for modifying auristatin F. More modification methods are described in US 2010 0305149 which is hereby incorporated by reference.

Reaction of the Cester of a Vinca alkaloid with hydrazine followed by treatment with NaNOresults in an active azido ester. Reaction of the azido ester with an amino compound such as propanolamine or 1 aminopropan 2 ol results in a Vinca alkaloid derivative with a functionalized hydroxyl which can be further derivatized with amino containing compounds such as for example alanine or methyl alanine derivates for conjugation with polymers see Scheme 1 .

Treatment of the hydroxyl derivative of the Vinca alkaloid with a protected amino containing tether such as t butoxy esterified amino acid followed by TFA hydrolysis of the ester gives the triflate salt of the vinca alkaloid. Scheme 2 Conjugation of the vinca alkaloid to functionalized polymers results in drug polymer conjugates that can be further conjugated with a PBRM or its derivative to result in protein drug polymer conjugates.

The 10 hydroxy group of non natural camptothecin derivative for example SN38 is selectively protected by reacting the derivative with tert butyldiphenylsilyl chloride TBDPSiCl in the presence of triethylamine. The 20 hydroxy group can be by reacted with t butylcarbonyl alanine to form the alanine derivative using the procedure described in Sapra P. et al. Clin. Cancer Res. 14 1888 1896 2008 . Alternatively other amino acids can be employed e.g. glycine. The primary amine is unmasked by removing the Boc protecting group by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid followed by removing the TBDPS protecting group with tetrabutylammonium fluoride see Scheme 3 . The resulting amino derivatized SN38 compound can be conjugated with a functionalized polymer to form a drug polymer conjugate.

Treatment of auristatin F with a protected amino containing tether such as t butoxy esterified 2 hydroxypropyl amine followed by HCl hydrolysis of the ester gives the 2 hydroxylpropyl amino derivative of auristatin F see Scheme 4 . Conjugation of the auristatin F derivative to functionalized polymers results in drug polymer conjugates that can be further conjugated with a PBRM or its derivative to result in protein polymer drug conjugates.

The general methods of producing the conjugates or polymeric scaffolds of this invention have been described above. Schemes 5 10 below exemplify how the conjugates or polymeric scaffolds are synthesized. The variables e.g. X X L and Letc in these schemes have the same definitions as described herein unless otherwise specified.

X M Y M Wand X M Y MWmay be different such as in Schemes 5 and 5A or the same such as in Scheme 6 . In some embodiments X M Y MWis formed by further modification of X M Y M W.

The PBRM can be linked to the drug polymer conjugate to form the protein drug polymer conjugate using standard synthetic methods for protein conjugation including but not limited to reactions based on reductive amination Staudinger ligation oxime formation thiazolidine formation and the methods and reactions described herein.

Schemes 10 below shows a general synthetic scheme of making the polymeric scaffolds of the invention. The wavy bond indicates direct or indirect connection between Land D or L.

The PBRM can be linked to the drug polymer conjugate to form the protein drug polymer conjugate using standard synthetic methods for protein conjugation including but not limited to reactions based on reductive amination Staudinger ligation oxime formation thiazolidine formation and the methods and reactions described herein.

Also included are pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more protein polymer drug conjugates as disclosed herein in an acceptable carrier such as a stabilizer buffer and the like. The conjugates can be administered and introduced into a subject by standard means with or without stabilizers buffers and the like to form a pharmaceutical composition. Administration may be topical including ophthalmic and to mucous membranes including vaginal and rectal delivery pulmonary e.g. by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols including by nebulizer intratracheal intranasal epidermal and transdermal oral or parenteral administration including intravenous intraarterial subcutaneous intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection or infusion or intracranial e.g. intrathecal or intraventricular administration. The conjugates can be formulated and used as sterile solutions and or suspensions for injectable administration lyophilized powders for reconstitution prior to injection infusion topical compositions as tablets capsules or elixirs for oral administration or suppositories for rectal administration and the other compositions known in the art.

A pharmacological composition or formulation refers to a composition or formulation in a form suitable for administration e.g. systemic administration into a cell or subject including for example a human. Suitable forms in part depend upon the use or the route of entry for example oral inhaled transdermal or by injection infusion. Such forms should not prevent the composition or formulation from reaching a target cell i.e. a cell to which the drug is desirable for delivery . For example pharmacological compositions injected into the blood stream should be soluble. Other factors are known in the art and include considerations such as toxicity and forms that prevent the composition or formulation from exerting its effect.

By systemic administration is meant in vivo systemic absorption or accumulation of the modified polymer in the blood stream followed by distribution throughout the entire body. Administration routes that lead to systemic absorption include without limitation intravenous subcutaneous intraperitoneal inhalation oral intrapulmonary and intramuscular. Each of these administration routes exposes the modified polymers to an accessible diseased tissue. The rate of entry of an active agent into the circulation has been shown to be a function of molecular weight or size. The use of a conjugate of this invention can localize the drug delivery in certain cells such as cancer cells via the specificity of PBRMs.

A pharmaceutically acceptable formulation means a composition or formulation that allows for the effective distribution of the conjugates in the physical location most suitable for their desired activity. In one embodiment effective delivery occurs before clearance by the reticuloendothelial system or the production of off target binding which can result in reduced efficacy or toxicity. Non limiting examples of agents suitable for formulation with the conjugates include P glycoprotein inhibitors such as Pluronic P85 which can enhance entry of active agents into the CNS biodegradable polymers such as poly DL lactide coglycolide microspheres for sustained release delivery after intracerebral implantation and loaded nanoparticles such as those made of polybutylcyanoacrylate which can deliver active agents across the blood brain barrier and can alter neuronal uptake mechanisms.

Also included herein are pharmaceutical compositions prepared for storage or administration which include a pharmaceutically effective amount of the desired conjugates in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Acceptable carriers diluents and or excipients for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art. For example buffers preservatives bulking agents dispersants stabilizers dyes can be provided. In addition antioxidants and suspending agents can be used Examples of suitable carriers diluents and or excipients include but are not limited to 1 Dulbecco s phosphate buffered saline pH about 6.5 which would contain about 1 mg ml to 25 mg ml human serum albumin 2 0.9 saline 0.9 w v NaCl and 3 5 w v dextrose.

The term pharmaceutically effective amount as used herein refers to an amount of a pharmaceutical agent to treat ameliorate or prevent an identified disease or condition or to exhibit a detectable therapeutic or inhibitory effect. The effect can be detected by any assay method known in the art. The precise effective amount for a subject will depend upon the subject s body weight size and health the nature and extent of the condition and the therapeutic or combination of therapeutics selected for administration. Pharmaceutically effective amounts for a given situation can be determined by routine experimentation that is within the skill and judgment of the clinician. In a preferred aspect the disease or condition to can be treated via gene silencing.

For any conjugate the pharmaceutically effective amount can be estimated initially either in cell culture assays e.g. of neoplastic cells or in animal models usually rats mice rabbits dogs or pigs. The animal model may also be used to determine the appropriate concentration range and route of administration. Such information can then be used to determine useful doses and routes for administration in humans. Therapeutic prophylactic efficacy and toxicity may be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals e.g. ED the dose therapeutically effective in 50 of the population and LD the dose lethal to 50 of the population . The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD ED. Pharmaceutical compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed sensitivity of the patient and the route of administration.

In one embodiment the conjugates are formulated for parenteral administration by injection including using conventional catheterization techniques or infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form e.g. in ampules or in multi dose containers with an added preservative. The conjugates can be administered parenterally in a sterile medium. The conjugate depending on the vehicle and concentration used can either be suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. Advantageously adjuvants such as local anesthetics preservatives and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. The term parenteral as used herein includes percutaneous subcutaneous intravascular e.g. intravenous intramuscular or intrathecal injection or infusion techniques and the like. In addition there is provided a pharmaceutical formulation comprising conjugates and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. One or more of the conjugates can be present in association with one or more non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and or diluents and or adjuvants and if desired other active ingredients.

The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non toxic parentally acceptable diluent or solvent for example as a solution in 1 3 butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition sterile fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose a bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono or diglycerides. In addition fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.

The conjugates and compositions described herein may be administered in appropriate form preferably parenterally more preferably intravenously. For parenteral administration the conjugates or compositions can be aqueous or nonaqueous sterile solutions suspensions or emulsions. Propylene glycol vegetable oils and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate can be used as the solvent or vehicle. The compositions can also contain adjuvants emulsifiers or dispersants.

Continuous infusions are given in about 250 to about 500 ml of normal saline to which about 25 to about 50 ml of human serum albumin can be added per 24 hour period.

In some embodiments about one to about four weeks after treatment the patient can receive a second course of treatment. Specific clinical protocols with regard to route of administration excipients diluents dosages and times can be determined by the skilled artisan as the clinical situation warrants.

It is understood that the specific dose level for a particular subject depends upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific conjugate the age body weight general health sex diet time of administration route of administration and rate of excretion combination with other active agents and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.

For administration to non human animals the conjugates can also be added to the animal feed or drinking water. It can be convenient to formulate the animal feed and drinking water so that the animal takes in a therapeutically appropriate quantity of the conjugates along with its diet. It can also be convenient to present the conjugates as a premix for addition to the feed or drinking water.

The conjugates can also be administered to a subject in combination with other therapeutic compounds to increase the overall therapeutic effect. The use of multiple compounds to treat an indication can increase the beneficial effects while reducing the presence of side effects. In some embodiment the conjugates are used in combination with chemotherapeutic agents such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7 303 749. In other embodiments the chemotherapeutic agents include but are not limited to letrozole oxaliplatin docetaxel 5 FU lapatinib capecitabine leucovorin erlotinib pertuzumab bevacizumab and gemcitabine.
