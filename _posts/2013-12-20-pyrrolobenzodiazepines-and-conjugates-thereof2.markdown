The present invention relates to pyrrolobenzodiazepines PBDs and their inclusion in targeted conjugates. The PBDs of the present invention are in a mixed dimer where one PBD moiety comprises an imine having a labile N10 group for linking to a cell binding agent and the other moiety comprises either an amine or amido group.

Some pyrrolobenzodiazepines PBDs have the ability to recognise and bond to specific sequences of DNA the preferred sequence is PuGPu. The first PBD antitumour antibiotic anthramycin was discovered in 1965 Leimgruber et al. 87 5793 5795 1965 Leimgruber et al. 87 5791 5793 1965 . Since then a number of naturally occurring PBDs have been reported and over 10 synthetic routes have been developed to a variety of analogues Thurston et al. 1994 433 465 1994 . Family members include abbeymycin Hochlowski et al. 40 145 148 1987 chicamycin Konishi et al. 37 200 206 1984 DC 81 Japanese Patent 58 180 487 Thurston et al. 26 767 772 1990 Bose et al. 48 751 758 1992 mazethramycin Kuminoto et al. 33 665 667 1980 neothramycins A and B Takeuchi et al. 29 93 96 1976 porothramycin Tsunakawa et al. 41 1366 1373 1988 prothracarcin Shimizu et al 29 2492 2503 1982 Langley and Thurston 52 91 97 1987 sibanomicin DC 102 Hara et al. 41 702 704 1988 Itoh et al. 41 1281 1284 1988 sibiromycin Leber et al. 110 2992 2993 1988 and tomamycin Arima et al. 25 437 444 1972 . PBDs are of the general structure 

They differ in the number type and position of substituents in both their aromatic A rings and pyrrolo C rings and in the degree of saturation of the C ring. In the B ring there is either an imine N C a carbinolamine NH CH OH or a carbinolamine methyl ether NH CH OMe at the N10 C11 position which is the electrophilic centre responsible for alkylating DNA. All of the known natural products have an S configuration at the chiral C11a position which provides them with a right handed twist when viewed from the C ring towards the A ring. This gives them the appropriate three dimensional shape for isohelicity with the minor groove of B form DNA leading to a snug fit at the binding site Kohn In . Springer Verlag New York pp. 3 11 1975 Hurley and Needham VanDevanter 19 230 237 1986 . Their ability to form an adduct in the minor groove enables them to interfere with DNA processing hence their use as antitumour agents.

It has been previously disclosed that the biological activity of these molecules can be potentiated by joining two PBD units together through their C8 C hydroxyl functionalities via a flexible alkylene linker Bose D. S. et al. 114 4939 4941 1992 Thurston D. E. et al. 61 8141 8147 1996 . The PBD dimers are thought to form sequence selective DNA lesions such as the palindromic 5 Pu GATC Py 3 interstrand cross link Smellie M. et al. 42 8232 8239 2003 Martin C. et al. 44 4135 4147 which is thought to be mainly responsible for their biological activity.

This application is particularly concerned with those Rgroups which have a carbamate link to the N10 position.

The linker attaches the Cell Binding Agent CBA L e.g. antibody to the PBD drug moiety D through covalent bond s . The linker is a bifunctional or multifunctional moiety which can be used to link one or more drug moiety D and an antibody unit Ab to form antibody drug conjugates ADC . The linker R may be stable outside a cell i.e. extracellular or it may be cleavable by enzymatic activity hydrolysis or other metabolic conditions. Antibody drug conjugates ADC can be conveniently prepared using a linker having reactive functionality for binding to the drug moiety and to the antibody. A cysteine thiol or an amine e.g. N terminus or amino acid side chain such as lysine of the antibody Ab can form a bond with a functional group of a linker or spacer reagent PBD drug moiety D or drug linker reagent D R .

Many functional groups on the linker attached to the N10 position of the PBD moiety may be useful to react with the cell binding agent. For example ester thioester amide thioamide carbamate thiocarbamate urea thiourea ether thioether or disulfide linkages may be formed from reaction of the linker PBD drug intermediates and the cell binding agent. The linkers of the ADC preferably prevent aggregation of ADC molecules and keep the ADC freely soluble in aqueous media and in a monomeric state.

The linkers of the ADC are preferably stable extracellularly. Before transport or delivery into a cell the antibody drug conjugate ADC is preferably stable and remains intact i.e. the antibody remains linked to the drug moiety. The linkers are stable outside the target cell and may be cleaved at some efficacious rate inside the cell. An effective linker will i maintain the specific binding properties of the antibody ii allow intracellular delivery of the conjugate or drug moiety iii remain stable and intact i.e. not cleaved until the conjugate has been delivered or transported to its targeted site and iv maintain a cytotoxic cell killing effect or a cytostatic effect of the PBD drug moiety. Stability of the ADC may be measured by standard analytical techniques such as mass spectroscopy HPLC and the separation analysis technique LC MS.

Covalent attachment of the antibody and the drug moiety requires the linker to have two reactive functional groups i.e. bivalency in a reactive sense. Bivalent linker reagents which are useful to attach two or more functional or biologically active moieties such as peptides nucleic acids drugs toxins antibodies haptens and reporter groups are known and methods have been described their resulting conjugates Hermanson G. T. 1996 Bioconjugate Techniques Academic Press New York p 234 242 .

In another embodiment the linker may be substituted with groups which modulate aggregation solubility or reactivity. For example a sulfonate substituent may increase water solubility of the reagent and facilitate the coupling reaction of the linker reagent with the antibody or the drug moiety or facilitate the coupling reaction of Ab L with D or D L with Ab depending on the synthetic route employed to prepare the ADC.

Lis preferably the cleavable linker and may be referred to as a trigger for activation of the linker for cleavage.

The nature of Land L where present can vary widely. These groups are chosen on the basis of their cleavage characteristics which may be dictated by the conditions at the site to which the conjugate is delivered. Those linkers that are cleaved by the action of enzymes are preferred although linkers that are cleavable by changes in pH e.g. acid or base labile temperature or upon irradiation e.g. photolabile may also be used. Linkers that are cleavable under reducing or oxidising conditions may also find use in the present invention.

Lmay comprise a contiguous sequence of amino acids. The amino acid sequence may be the target substrate for enzymatic cleavage thereby allowing release of L R from the N10 position.

In one embodiment Lis cleavable by the action of an enzyme. In one embodiment the enzyme is an esterase or a peptidase.

In one embodiment Lis present and together with C O O forms a self immolative linker. In one embodiment Lis a substrate for enzymatic activity thereby allowing release of L R from the N10 position.

In one embodiment where Lis cleavable by the action of an enzyme and Lis present the enzyme cleaves the bond between Land L.

An amino group of Lthat connects to Lmay be the N terminus of an amino acid or may be derived from an amino group of an amino acid side chain for example a lysine amino acid side chain.

A carboxyl group of Lthat connects to Lmay be the C terminus of an amino acid or may be derived from a carboxyl group of an amino acid side chain for example a glutamic acid amino acid side chain.

A hydroxyl group of Lthat connects to Lmay be derived from a hydroxyl group of an amino acid side chain for example a serine amino acid side chain.

The term amino acid side chain includes those groups found in i naturally occurring amino acids such as alanine arginine asparagine aspartic acid cysteine glutamine glutamic acid glycine histidine isoleucine leucine lysine methionine phenylalanine proline serine threonine tryptophan tyrosine and valine ii minor amino acids such as ornithine and citrulline iii unnatural amino acids beta amino acids synthetic analogs and derivatives of naturally occurring amino acids and iv all enantiomers diastereomers isomerically enriched isotopically labelled e.g. H H C N protected forms and racemic mixtures thereof.

Where Y is NH and n is 0 the self immolative linker may be referred to as a p aminobenzylcarbonyl linker PABC .

The self immolative linker will allow for release of the protected compound when a remote site is activated proceeding along the lines shown below for n 0 

In one embodiment described herein the group L is a linker Las described herein which may include a dipeptide group.

In one embodiment Lcomprises a dipeptide The dipeptide may be represented as NH X X CO where NH and CO represent the N and C terminals of the amino acid groups Xand Xrespectively. The amino acids in the dipeptide may be any combination of natural amino acids. Where the linker is a cathepsin labile linker the dipeptide may be the site of action for cathepsin mediated cleavage.

Additionally for those amino acids groups having carboxyl or amino side chain functionality for example Glu and Lys respectively CO and NH may represent that side chain functionality.

Other dipeptide combinations may be used including those described by Dubowchik et al. 2002 13 855 869 which is incorporated herein by reference.

In one embodiment the amino acid side chain is derivatised where appropriate. For example an amino group or carboxy group of an amino acid side chain may be derivatised.

In one embodiment an amino group NHof a side chain amino acid such as lysine is a derivatised form selected from the group consisting of NHR and NRR .

In one embodiment a carboxy group COOH of a side chain amino acid such as aspartic acid is a derivatised form selected from the group consisting of COOR CONH CONHR and CONRR .

In one embodiment the amino acid side chain is chemically protected where appropriate. The side chain protecting group may be a group as discussed below in relation to the group R. The present inventors have established that protected amino acid sequences are cleavable by enzymes. For example it has been established that a dipeptide sequence comprising a Boc side chain protected Lys residue is cleavable by cathepsin.

Protecting groups for the side chains of amino acids are well known in the art and are described in the Novabiochem Catalog. Additional protecting group strategies are set out in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis Greene and Wuts.

Possible side chain protecting groups are shown below for those amino acids having reactive side chain functionality 

In one embodiment the side chain protection is selected to be orthogonal to a group provided as or as part of a capping group where present. Thus the removal of the side chain protecting group does not remove the capping group or any protecting group functionality that is part of the capping group.

In other embodiments of the invention the amino acids selected are those having no reactive side chain functionality. For example the amino acids may be selected from Ala Gly Ile Leu Met Phe Pro and Val.

In one embodiment the dipeptide is used in combination with a self immolative linker. The self immolative linker may be connected to X .

Where a self immolative linker is present X is connected directly to the self immolative linker. Preferably the group X CO is connected to Y where Y is NH thereby forming the group X CO NH .

 NH X is connected directly to A. A may comprise the functionality CO thereby to form an amide link with X .

In one embodiment Land Ltogether with OC O comprise the group NH X X CO PABC . The PABC group is connected directly to the N10 position. Preferably the self immolative linker and the dipeptide together form the group NH Phe Lys CO NH PABC which is illustrated below 

Alternatively the self immolative linker and the dipeptide together form the group NH Val Ala CO NH PABC which is illustrated below 

Alternatively the self immolative linker and the dipeptide together form the group NH Val Cit CO NH PABC which is illustrated below 

In one embodiment A is a covalent bond. Thus Land the cell binding agent are directly connected. For example where Lcomprises a contiguous amino acid sequence the N terminus of the sequence may connect directly to the cell binding agent.

Thus where A is a covalent bond the connection between the cell binding agent and Lmay be selected from 

An amino group of Lthat connects to the cell binding agent may be the N terminus of an amino acid or may be derived from an amino group of an amino acid side chain for example a lysine amino acid side chain.

A hydroxyl group of Lthat connects to the cell binding agent may be derived from a hydroxyl group of an amino acid side chain for example a serine amino acid side chain.

A thiol group of Lthat connects to the cell binding agent may be derived from a thiol group of an amino acid side chain for example a serine amino acid side chain.

The comments above in relation to the amino carboxyl hydroxyl and thiol groups of Lalso apply to the cell binding agent.

E is selected such that the group is susceptible to activation e.g. by light or by the action of an enzyme. E may be NOor glucoronic acid. The former may be susceptible to the action of a nitroreductase the latter to the action of a glucoronidase.

In this embodiment the self immolative linker will allow for release of the protected compound when E is activated proceeding along the lines shown below for n 0 

Where Lis a dipeptide it is preferred that Y is NH or C O thereby to form an amide bond between Land Y. In this embodiment the dipeptide sequence need not be a substrate for an enzymatic activity.

In another embodiment A is a spacer group. Thus Land the cell binding agent are indirectly connected.

In one embodiment the connection between the cell binding agent and A is through a thiol residue of the cell binding agent and a maleimide group of A.

In each of the embodiments above an alternative functionality may be used in place of the maleimide derived group shown below 

In one embodiment the maleimide derived group is replaced with a group which optionally together with the cell binding agent is selected from 

In one embodiment the maleimide derived group is replaced with a group which optionally together with the cell binding agent is selected from 

The group R is derivable from the group R. The group Rmay be converted to a group R by connection of a cell binding agent to a functional group of R. Other steps may be taken to convert Rto R. These steps may include the removal of protecting groups where present or the installation of an appropriate functional group.

In one embodiment the linker is provided with a functional group to form a connection to a cell binding agent. This application is particularly concerned with those Rgroups which have a carbamate link to the N10 position. The discussion of the linking group in R above is also relevant to their immediate precursors here.

Land Lare as defined above in relation to R. References to connection to A can be construed here as referring to a connection to G.

In one embodiment where Lcomprises an amino acid the side chain of that amino acid may be protected. Any suitable protecting group may be used. In one embodiment the side chain protecting groups are removable with other protecting groups in the compound where present. In other embodiments the protecting groups may be orthogonal to other protecting groups in the molecule where present.

Suitable protecting groups for amino acid side chains include those groups described in the Novabiochem Catalog 2006 2007. Protecting groups for use in a cathepsin labile linker are also discussed in Dubowchik et al.

In certain embodiments of the invention the group Lincludes a Lys amino acid residue. The side chain of this amino acid may be protected with a Boc or Alloc protected group. A Boc protecting group is most preferred.

In one embodiment the group Gis an alkyl maleimide group. This group is suitable for reaction with thiol groups particularly cysteine thiol groups present in the cell binding agent for example present in an antibody.

The group Gmay be convertable from one functional group to another. In one embodiment where Lis present Gis NH. This group is convertable to another group Gcomprising a maleimide group. For example the group NHmay be reacted with an acids or an activated acid e.g. N succinimide forms of those Ggroups comprising maleimide shown above.

The group Gmay therefore be converted to a functional group that is more appropriate for reaction with a cell binding agent.

In other embodiments Ris a group that is a precursor to the linker that is provided with a functional group.

As noted above in one embodiment where Lis present Gis NH NHMe COOH OH or SH. In a further embodiment these groups are provided in a chemically protected form. The chemically protected form is therefore a precursor to the linker that is provided with a functional group.

In one embodiment Gis NHin a chemically protected form. The group may be protected with a carbamate protecting group. The carbamate protecting group may be selected from the group consisting of 

The chemical protecting group may be removed to provide a functional group to form a connection to a cell binding agent. Optionally this functional group may then be converted to another functional group as described above.

In one embodiment the active group is an amine. This amine is preferably the N terminal amine of a peptide and may be the N terminal amine of the preferred dipeptides of the invention.

The active group may be reacted to yield the functional group that is intended to form a connection to a cell binding agent.

In other embodiments the linker is a precursor to the linker having an active group. In this embodiment the linker comprises the active group which is protected by way of a protecting group. The protecting group may be removed to provide the linker having an active group.

Where the active group is an amine the protecting group may be an amine protecting group such as those described in Green and Wuts.

The protecting group is preferably orthogonal to other protecting groups where present in the group R.

In some embodiments the linker contains an electrophilic functional group for reaction with a nucleophilic functional group on the cell binding agent. Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include but are not limited to i N terminal amine groups ii side chain amine groups e.g. lysine iii side chain thiol groups e.g. cysteine and iv sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine thiol and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i maleimide groups ii activated disulfides iii active esters such as NHS N hydroxysuccinimide esters HOBt N hydroxybenzotriazole esters haloformates and acid halides iv alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides and v aldehydes ketones carboxyl and some of which are exemplified as follows 

Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT dithiothreitol . Each cysteine bridge will thus form theoretically two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody or fragment thereof by introducing one two three four or more cysteine residues e.g. preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non native cysteine amino acid residues . U.S. Pat. No. 7 521 541 teaches engineering antibodies by introduction of reactive cysteine amino acids. In some embodiments a Linker has a reactive nucleophilic group which is reactive with an electrophilic group present on an antibody. Useful electrophilic groups on an antibody include but are not limited to aldehyde and ketone carbonyl groups. The heteroatom of a nucleophilic group of a Linker can react with an electrophilic group on an antibody and form a covalent bond to an antibody unit. Useful nucleophilic groups on a Linker include but are not limited to hydrazide oxime amino hydroxyl hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide. The electrophilic group on an antibody provides a convenient site for attachment to a Linker.

Other functional groups suitable for use in forming a connection between Land the cell binding agent are described in WO 2005 082023.

Dendritic linkers can increase the molar ratio of drug to antibody i.e. loading which is related to the potency of the ADC.

The term antibody herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies dimers multimers multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific antibodies and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity Miller et al 2003 170 4854 4861 . Antibodies may be murine human humanized chimeric or derived from other species. An antibody is a protein generated by the immune system that is capable of recognizing and binding to a specific antigen. Janeway C. Travers P. Walport M. Shlomchik 2001 5th Ed. Garland Publishing New York . A target antigen generally has numerous binding sites also called epitopes recognized by CDRs on multiple antibodies. Each antibody that specifically binds to a different epitope has a different structure. Thus one antigen may have more than one corresponding antibody. An antibody includes a full length immunoglobulin molecule or an immunologically active portion of a full length immunoglobulin molecule i.e. a molecule that contains an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen of a target of interest or part thereof such targets including but not limited to cancer cell or cells that produce autoimmune antibodies associated with an autoimmune disease. The immunoglobulin can be of any type e.g. IgG IgE IgM IgD and IgA class e.g. IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA1 and IgA2 or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. The immunoglobulins can be derived from any species including human murine or rabbit origin.

 Antibody fragments comprise a portion of a full length antibody generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab and scFv fragments diabodies linear antibodies fragments produced by a Fab expression library anti idiotypic anti Id antibodies CDR complementary determining region and epitope binding fragments of any of the above which immunospecifically bind to cancer cell antigens viral antigens or microbial antigens single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al 1975 256 495 or may be made by recombinant DNA methods see U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 . The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al 1991 Nature 352 624 628 Marks et al 1991 J. Mol. Biol. 222 581 597 or from transgenic mice carrying a fully human immunoglobulin system Lonberg 2008 Curr. Opinion 20 4 450 459 .

The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include chimeric antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al 1984 81 6851 6855 . Chimeric antibodies include primatized antibodies comprising variable domain antigen binding sequences derived from a non human primate e.g. Old World Monkey or Ape and human constant region sequences.

An intact antibody herein is one comprising a VL and VH domains as well as a light chain constant domain CL and heavy chain constant domains CH1 CH2 and CH3. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains e.g. human native sequence constant domains or amino acid sequence variant thereof. The intact antibody may have one or more effector functions which refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding complement dependent cytotoxicity Fc receptor binding antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC phagocytosis and down regulation of cell surface receptors such as B cell receptor and BCR.

Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains intact antibodies can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of intact antibodies IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM and several of these may be further divided into subclasses isotypes e.g. IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA and IgA2. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called and respectively. The subunit structures and three dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.

Techniques to reduce the in vivo immunogenicity of a non human antibody or antibody fragment include those termed humanisation .

A humanized antibody refers to a polypeptide comprising at least a portion of a modified variable region of a human antibody wherein a portion of the variable region preferably a portion substantially less than the intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species and wherein the modified variable region is linked to at least another part of another protein preferably the constant region of a human antibody. The expression humanized antibodies includes human antibodies in which one or more complementarity determining region CDR amino acid residues and or one or more framework region FW or FR amino acid residues are substituted by amino acid residues from analogous sites in rodent or other non human antibodies. The expression humanized antibody also includes an immunoglobulin amino acid sequence variant or fragment thereof that comprises an FR having substantially the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and a CDR having substantially the amino acid sequence of a non human immunoglobulin.

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. Or looked at another way a humanized antibody is a human antibody that also contains selected sequences from non human e.g. murine antibodies in place of the human sequences. A humanized antibody can include conservative amino acid substitutions or non natural residues from the same or different species that do not significantly alter its binding and or biologic activity. Such antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulins.

There are a range of humanisation techniques including CDR grafting guided selection deimmunization resurfacing also known as veneering composite antibodies Human String Content Optimisation and framework shuffling.

In this technique the humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a complementary determining region CDR of the recipient antibody are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat camel bovine goat or rabbit having the desired properties in effect the non human CDRs are grafted onto the human framework . In some instances framework region FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues this may happen when for example a particular FR residue has significant effect on antigen binding .

Furthermore humanized antibodies can comprise residues that are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications are made to further refine and maximize antibody performance. Thus in general a humanized antibody will comprise all of at least one and in one aspect two variable domains in which all or all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc or that of a human immunoglobulin.

The method consists of combining the Vor Vdomain of a given non human antibody specific for a particular epitope with a human Vor Vlibrary and specific human V domains are selected against the antigen of interest. This selected human VH is then combined with a VL library to generate a completely human VH VL combination. The method is described in Nature Biotechnology N.Y. 12 1994 899 903.

In this method two or more segments of amino acid sequence from a human antibody are combined within the final antibody molecule. They are constructed by combining multiple human VH and VL sequence segments in combinations which limit or avoid human T cell epitopes in the final composite antibody V regions. Where required T cell epitopes are limited or avoided by exchanging V region segments contributing to or encoding a T cell epitope with alternative segments which avoid T cell epitopes. This method is described in US 2008 0206239 A1.

This method involves the removal of human or other second species T cell epitopes from the V regions of the therapeutic antibody or other molecule . The therapeutic antibodies V region sequence is analysed for the presence of MHC class II binding motifs by for example comparison with databases of MHC binding motifs such as the motifs database hosted at www.wehi.edu.au . Alternatively MHC class II binding motifs may be identified using computational threading methods such as those devised by Altuvia et al. J. Mol. Biol. 249 244 250 1995 in these methods consecutive overlapping peptides from the V region sequences are testing for their binding energies to MHC class II proteins. This data can then be combined with information on other sequence features which relate to successfully presented peptides such as amphipathicity Rothbard motifs and cleavage sites for cathepsin B and other processing enzymes.

Once potential second species e.g. human T cell epitopes have been identified they are eliminated by the alteration of one or more amino acids. The modified amino acids are usually within the T cell epitope itself but may also be adjacent to the epitope in terms of the primary or secondary structure of the protein and therefore may not be adjacent in the primary structure . Most typically the alteration is by way of substitution but in some circumstances amino acid addition or deletion will be more appropriate.

All alterations can be accomplished by recombinant DNA technology so that the final molecule may be prepared by expression from a recombinant host using well established methods such as Site Directed Mutagenesis. However the use of protein chemistry or any other means of molecular alteration is also possible.

The method compares the non human sequence with the functional human germline gene repertoire. Those human genes encoding canonical structures identical or closely related to the non human sequences are selected. Those selected human genes with highest homology within the CDRs are chosen as FR donors. Finally the non human CDRs are grafted onto these human FRs. This method is described in patent WO 2005 079479 A2.

This method compares the non human e.g. mouse sequence with the repertoire of human germline genes and the differences are scored as Human String Content HSC that quantifies a sequence at the level of potential MHC T cell epitopes. The target sequence is then humanized by maximizing its HSC rather than using a global identity measure to generate multiple diverse humanized variants described in Molecular Immunology 44 2007 1986 1998 .

The CDRs of the non human antibody are fused in frame to cDNA pools encompassing all known heavy and light chain human germline gene frameworks. Humanised antibodies are then selected by e.g. panning of the phage displayed antibody library. This is described in 36 43 60 2005 .

The parent antibody may also be a fusion protein comprising an albumin binding peptide ABP sequence Dennis et al. 2002 Albumin Binding As A General Strategy For Improving The Pharmacokinetics Of Proteins 277 35035 35043 WO 01 45746 . Antibodies of the invention include fusion proteins with ABP sequences taught by i Dennis et al 2002 277 35035 35043 at Tables III and IV page 35038 ii US 2004 0001827 at 0076 and iii WO 01 45746 at pages 12 13 and all of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The cell binding agent may be labelled for example to aid detection or purification of the agent either prior to incorporation as a conjugate or as part of the conjugate. The label may be a biotin label. In another embodiment the cell binding agent may be labelled with a radioisotope.

The cell binding agent is connected to the linker. In one embodiment the cell binding agent is connected to A where present of the linker.

In one embodiment the connection between the cell binding agent and the linker is through a thioether bond.

In one embodiment the connection between the cell binding agent and the linker is through a disulfide bond.

In one embodiment the connection between the cell binding agent and the linker is through an amide bond.

In one embodiment the connection between the cell binding agent and the linker is through an ester bond.

In one embodiment the connection between the cell binding agent and the linker is formed between a thiol group of a cysteine residue of the cell binding agent and a maleimide group of the linker.

The cysteine residues of the cell binding agent may be available for reaction with the functional group of Rto form a connection. In other embodiments for example where the cell binding agent is an antibody the thiol groups of the antibody may participate in interchain disulfide bonds. These interchain bonds may be converted to free thiol groups by e.g. treatment of the antibody with DTT prior to reaction with the functional group of R.

The cell binding agent may be labelled for example to aid detection or purification of the agent either prior to incorporation as a conjugate or as part of the conjugate. The label may be a biotin label. In another embodiment the cell binding agent may be labelled with a radioisotope.

The drug loading is the average number of PBD drugs per cell binding agent e.g. antibody. Where the compounds of the invention are bound to cysteines drug loading may range from 1 to 8 drugs D per cell binding agent i.e. where 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 drug moieties are covalently attached to the cell binding agent. Compositions of conjgates include collections of cell binding agents e.g. antibodies conjugated with a range of drugs from 1 to 8. Where the compounds of the invention are bound to lysines drug loading may range from 1 to 80 drugs D per cell binding agent although an upper limit of 40 20 10 or 8 may be preferred. Compositions of conjgates include collections of cell binding agents e.g. antibodies conjugated with a range of drugs from 1 to 80 1 to 40 1 to 20 1 to 10 or 1 to 8.

The average number of drugs per antibody in preparations of ADC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as UV reverse phase HPLC HIC mass spectroscopy ELISA assay and electrophoresis. The quantitative distribution of ADC in terms of p may also be determined. By ELISA the averaged value of p in a particular preparation of ADC may be determined Hamblett et al 2004 Clin. Cancer Res. 10 7063 7070 Sanderson et al 2005 Clin. Cancer Res. 11 843 852 . However the distribution of p drug values is not discernible by the antibody antigen binding and detection limitation of ELISA. Also ELISA assay for detection of antibody drug conjugates does not determine where the drug moieties are attached to the antibody such as the heavy chain or light chain fragments or the particular amino acid residues. In some instances separation purification and characterization of homogeneous ADC where p is a certain value from ADC with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis. Such techniques are also applicable to other types of conjugates.

For some antibody drug conjugates p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. Higher drug loading e.g. p 5 may cause aggregation insolubility toxicity or loss of cellular permeability of certain antibody drug conjugates.

Typically fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain for example many lysine residues that do not react with the drug linker intermediate D L or linker reagent. Only the most reactive lysine groups may react with an amine reactive linker reagent. Also only the most reactive cysteine thiol groups may react with a thiol reactive linker reagent. Generally antibodies do not contain many if any free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety. Most cysteine thiol residues in the antibodies of the compounds exist as disulfide bridges and must be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol DTT or TCEP under partial or total reducing conditions. The loading drug antibody ratio of an ADC may be controlled in several different manners including i limiting the molar excess of drug linker intermediate D L or linker reagent relative to antibody ii limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature and iii partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification.

Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT dithiothreitol . Each cysteine bridge will thus form theoretically two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody or fragment thereof by engineering one two three four or more cysteine residues e.g. preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non native cysteine amino acid residues . U.S. Pat. No. 7 521 541 teaches engineering antibodies by introduction of reactive cysteine amino acids.

Cysteine amino acids may be engineered at reactive sites in an antibody and which do not form intrachain or intermolecular disulfide linkages Junutula et al. 2008b Nature Biotech. 26 8 925 932 Dornan et al 2009 Blood 114 13 2721 2729 U.S. Pat.

The engineered cysteine thiols may react with linker reagents or the drug linker reagents of the present invention which have thiol reactive electrophilic groups such as maleimide or alpha halo amides to form ADC with cysteine engineered antibodies and the PBD drug moieties. The location of the drug moiety can thus be designed controlled and known. The drug loading can be controlled since the engineered cysteine thiol groups typically react with thiol reactive linker reagents or drug linker reagents in high yield. Engineering an IgG antibody to introduce a cysteine amino acid by substitution at a single site on the heavy or light chain gives two new cysteines on the symmetrical antibody. A drug loading near 2 can be achieved with near homogeneity of the conjugation product ADC.

Where more than one nucleophilic or electrophilic group of the antibody reacts with a drug linker intermediate or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent then the resulting product is a mixture of ADC compounds with a distribution of drug moieties attached to an antibody e.g. 1 2 3 etc. Liquid chromatography methods such as polymeric reverse phase PLRP and hydrophobic interaction HIC may separate compounds in the mixture by drug loading value. Preparations of ADC with a single drug loading value p may be isolated however these single loading value ADCs may still be heterogeneous mixtures because the drug moieties may be attached via the linker at different sites on the antibody.

Thus the antibody drug conjugate compositions of the invention include mixtures of antibody drug conjugate compounds where the antibody has one or more PBD drug moieties and where the drug moieties may be attached to the antibody at various amino acid residues.

In one embodiment the average number of dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine groups per cell binding agent is in the range 1 to 20. In some embodiments the range is selected from 1 to 8 2 to 8 2 to 6 2 to 4 and 4 to 8.

Unless otherwise specified included in the above are the well known ionic salt solvate and protected forms of these substituents. For example a reference to carboxylic acid COOH also includes the anionic carboxylate form COO a salt or solvate thereof as well as conventional protected forms. Similarly a reference to an amino group includes the protonated form NHRR a salt or solvate of the amino group for example a hydrochloride salt as well as conventional protected forms of an amino group. Similarly a reference to a hydroxyl group also includes the anionic form O a salt or solvate thereof as well as conventional protected forms.

It may be convenient or desirable to prepare purify and or handle a corresponding salt of the active compound for example a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge et al. 66 1 19 1977 .

For example if the compound is anionic or has a functional group which may be anionic e.g. COOH may be COO then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation. Examples of suitable inorganic cations include but are not limited to alkali metal ions such as Na and K alkaline earth cations such as Ca and Mg and other cations such as Al. Examples of suitable organic cations include but are not limited to ammonium ion i.e. NH and substituted ammonium ions e.g. NHR NHR NHR NR . Examples of some suitable substituted ammonium ions are those derived from ethylamine diethylamine dicyclohexylamine triethylamine butylamine ethylenediamine ethanolamine diethanolamine piperazine benzylamine phenylbenzylamine choline meglumine and tromethamine as well as amino acids such as lysine and arginine. An example of a common quaternary ammonium ion is N CH .

If the compound is cationic or has a functional group which may be cationic e.g. NHmay be NH then a salt may be formed with a suitable anion. Examples of suitable inorganic anions include but are not limited to those derived from the following inorganic acids hydrochloric hydrobromic hydroiodic sulfuric sulfurous nitric nitrous phosphoric and phosphorous.

Examples of suitable organic anions include but are not limited to those derived from the following organic acids 2 acetyoxybenzoic acetic ascorbic aspartic benzoic camphorsulfonic cinnamic citric edetic ethanedisulfonic ethanesulfonic fumaric glucheptonic gluconic glutamic glycolic hydroxymaleic hydroxynaphthalene carboxylic isethionic lactic lactobionic lauric maleic malic methanesulfonic mucic oleic oxalic palmitic pamoic pantothenic phenylacetic phenylsulfonic propionic pyruvic salicylic stearic succinic sulfanilic tartaric toluenesulfonic trifluoroacetic acid and valeric. Examples of suitable polymeric organic anions include but are not limited to those derived from the following polymeric acids tannic acid carboxymethyl cellulose.

It may be convenient or desirable to prepare purify and or handle a corresponding solvate of the active compound. The term solvate is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to a complex of solute e.g. active compound salt of active compound and solvent. If the solvent is water the solvate may be conveniently referred to as a hydrate for example a mono hydrate a di hydrate a tri hydrate etc.

The invention includes compounds where a solvent adds across the imine bond of the PBD moiety which is illustrated below where the solvent is water or an alcohol ROH where Ris Calkyl 

These forms can be called the carbinolamine and carbinolamine ether forms of the PBD as described in the section relating to Rabove . The balance of these equilibria depend on the conditions in which the compounds are found as well as the nature of the moiety itself.

Certain compounds of the invention may exist in one or more particular geometric optical enantiomeric diasteriomeric epimeric atropic stereoisomeric tautomeric conformational or anomeric forms including but not limited to cis and trans forms E and Z forms c t and r forms endo and exo forms R S and meso forms D and L forms d and l forms and forms keto enol and enolate forms syn and anti forms synclinal and anticlinal forms and forms axial and equatorial forms boat chair twist envelope and halfchair forms and combinations thereof hereinafter collectively referred to as isomers or isomeric forms .

The term chiral refers to molecules which have the property of non superimposability of the mirror image partner while the term achiral refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.

The term stereoisomers refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space.

 Diastereomer refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties e.g. melting points boiling points spectral properties and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.

 Enantiomers refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non superimposable mirror images of one another.

Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker Ed. 1984 McGraw Hill Book Company New York and Eliel E. and Wilen S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention including but not limited to diastereomers enantiomers and atropisomers as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms i.e. they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane polarized light. In describing an optically active compound the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center s . The prefixes d and l or and are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane polarized light by the compound with or l meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50 50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms racemic mixture and racemate refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species devoid of optical activity.

Note that except as discussed below for tautomeric forms specifically excluded from the term isomers as used herein are structural or constitutional isomers i.e. isomers which differ in the connections between atoms rather than merely by the position of atoms in space . For example a reference to a methoxy group OCH is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer a hydroxymethyl group CHOH. Similarly a reference to ortho chlorophenyl is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer meta chlorophenyl. However a reference to a class of structures may well include structurally isomeric forms falling within that class e.g. Calkyl includes n propyl and iso propyl butyl includes n iso sec and tert butyl methoxyphenyl includes ortho meta and para methoxyphenyl .

The above exclusion does not pertain to tautomeric forms for example keto enol and enolate forms as in for example the following tautomeric pairs keto enol illustrated below imine enamine amide imino alcohol amidine amidine nitroso oxime thioketone enethiol N nitroso hyroxyazo and nitro aci nitro.

The term tautomer or tautomeric form refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example proton tautomers also known as prototropic tautomers include interconversions via migration of a proton such as keto enol and imine enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.

Note that specifically included in the term isomer are compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions. For example H may be in any isotopic form including H H D and H T C may be in any isotopic form including C C and C O may be in any isotopic form including O and O and the like.

Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorous fluorine and chlorine such as but not limited to H deuterium D H tritium C C C N F P P S Cl and I. Various isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H 13C and 14C are incorporated. Such isotopically labelled compounds may be useful in metabolic studies reaction kinetic studies detection or imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography PET or single photon emission computed tomography SPECT including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays or in radioactive treatment of patients. Deuterium labelled or substituted therapeutic compounds of the invention may have improved DMPK drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics properties relating to distribution metabolism and excretion ADME . Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability for example increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements. An 18F labeled compound may be useful for PET or SPECT studies. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non isotopically labeled reagent. Further substitution with heavier isotopes particularly deuterium i.e. 2H or D may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability for example increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements or an improvement in therapeutic index. It is understood that deuterium in this context is regarded as a substituent. The concentration of such a heavier isotope specifically deuterium may be defined by an isotopic enrichment factor. In the compounds of this invention any atom not specifically designated as a particular isotope is meant to represent any stable isotope of that atom.

Unless otherwise specified a reference to a particular compound includes all such isomeric forms including wholly or partially racemic and other mixtures thereof. Methods for the preparation e.g. asymmetric synthesis and separation e.g. fractional crystallisation and chromatographic means of such isomeric forms are either known in the art or are readily obtained by adapting the methods taught herein or known methods in a known manner.

Generally the cytotoxic or cytostatic activity of an antibody drug conjugate ADC is measured by exposing mammalian cells having receptor proteins e.g. HER2 to the antibody of the ADC in a cell culture medium culturing the cells for a period from about 6 hours to about 5 days and measuring cell viability. Cell based in vitro assays are used to measure viability proliferation cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis caspase activation of an ADC of the invention.

The in vitro potency of antibody drug conjugates can be measured by a cell proliferation assay. The CellTiter Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay is a commercially available Promega Corp. Madison Wis. homogeneous assay method based on the recombinant expression of luciferase U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 583 024 5 674 713 and 5 700 670 . This cell proliferation assay determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present an indicator of metabolically active cells Crouch et al 1993 160 81 88 U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 677 . The CellTiter Glo Assay is conducted in 96 well format making it amenable to automated high throughput screening HTS Cree et al 1995 6 398 404 . The homogeneous assay procedure involves adding the single reagent CellTiter Glo Reagent directly to cells cultured in serum supplemented medium. Cell washing removal of medium and multiple pipetting steps are not required. The system detects as few as 15 cells well in a 384 well format in 10 minutes after adding reagent and mixing. The cells may be treated continuously with ADC or they may be treated and separated from ADC. Generally cells treated briefly i.e. 3 hours showed the same potency effects as continuously treated cells.

The homogeneous add mix measure format results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal proportional to the amount of ATP present. The amount of ATP is directly proportional to the number of cells present in culture. The CellTiter Glo Assay generates a glow type luminescent signal produced by the luciferase reaction which has a half life generally greater than five hours depending on cell type and medium used. Viable cells are reflected in relative luminescence units RLU . The substrate Beetle Luciferin is oxidatively decarboxylated by recombinant firefly luciferase with concomitant conversion of ATP to AMP and generation of photons.

The in vivo efficacy of antibody drug conjugates ADC of the invention can be measured by tumor xenograft studies in mice. For example the in vivo efficacy of an anti HER2 ADC of the invention can be measured by a high expressing HER2 transgenic explant mouse model. An allograft is propagated from the Fo5 mmtv transgenic mouse which does not respond to or responds poorly to HERCEPTIN therapy. Subjects were treated once with ADC at certain dose levels mg kg and PBD drug exposure g m and placebo buffer control Vehicle and monitored over two weeks or more to measure the time to tumor doubling log cell kill and tumor shrinkage.

The target location is preferably a proliferative cell population. The antibody is an antibody for an antigen present in a proliferative cell population.

In one embodiment the antigen is absent or present at a reduced level in a non proliferative cell population compared to the amount of antigen present in the proliferative cell population for example a tumour cell population.

At the target location the linker may be cleaved so as to release a compound of formula D . Thus the conjugate may be used to selectively provide a compound of formula D to the target location.

The antibody drug conjugate ADC compounds of the invention include those with utility for anticancer activity. In particular the compounds include an antibody conjugated i.e. covalently attached by a linker to a PBD drug moiety i.e. toxin. When the drug is not conjugated to an antibody the PBD drug has a cytotoxic effect. The biological activity of the PBD drug moiety is thus modulated by conjugation to an antibody. The antibody drug conjugates ADC of the invention selectively deliver an effective dose of a cytotoxic agent to tumor tissue whereby greater selectivity i.e. a lower efficacious dose may be achieved.

Thus in one aspect the present invention provides a conjugate compound as described herein for use in therapy.

In a further aspect there is also provides a conjugate compound as described herein for use in the treatment of a proliferative disease. A second aspect of the present invention provides the use of a conjugate compound in the manufacture of a medicament for treating a proliferative disease.

One of ordinary skill in the art is readily able to determine whether or not a candidate conjugate treats a proliferative condition for any particular cell type. For example assays which may conveniently be used to assess the activity offered by a particular compound are described in the examples below.

The term proliferative disease pertains to an unwanted or uncontrolled cellular proliferation of excessive or abnormal cells which is undesired such as neoplastic or hyperplastic growth whether in vitro or in vivo.

Examples of proliferative conditions include but are not limited to benign pre malignant and malignant cellular proliferation including but not limited to neoplasms and tumours e.g. histocytoma glioma astrocyoma osteoma cancers e.g. lung cancer small cell lung cancer gastrointestinal cancer bowel cancer colon cancer breast carinoma ovarian carcinoma prostate cancer testicular cancer liver cancer kidney cancer bladder cancer pancreas cancer brain cancer sarcoma osteosarcoma Kaposi s sarcoma melanoma leukemias psoriasis bone diseases fibroproliferative disorders e.g. of connective tissues and atherosclerosis. Cancers of particular interest include but are not limited to leukemias and ovarian cancers.

Others include neuronal glial astrocytal hypothalamic glandular macrophagal epithelial stromal blastocoelic inflammatory angiogenic and immunologic including autoimmune disorders.

Generally the disease or disorder to be treated is a hyperproliferative disease such as cancer. Examples of cancer to be treated herein include but are not limited to carcinoma lymphoma blastoma sarcoma and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer e.g. epithelial squamous cell cancer lung cancer including small cell lung cancer non small cell lung cancer adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung cancer of the peritoneum hepatocellular cancer gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer pancreatic cancer glioblastoma cervical cancer ovarian cancer liver cancer bladder cancer hepatoma breast cancer colon cancer rectal cancer colorectal cancer endometrial or uterine carcinoma salivary gland carcinoma kidney or renal cancer prostate cancer vulval cancer thyroid cancer hepatic carcinoma anal carcinoma penile carcinoma as well as head and neck cancer.

Also provided is a method of treatment comprising administering to a subject in need of treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a conjugate compound of the invention. The term therapeutically effective amount is an amount sufficient to show benefit to a patient. Such benefit may be at least amelioration of at least one symptom. The actual amount administered and rate and time course of administration will depend on the nature and severity of what is being treated. Prescription of treatment e.g. decisions on dosage is within the responsibility of general practitioners and other medical doctors.

A compound of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with other treatments either simultaneously or sequentially dependent upon the condition to be treated.

Another aspect of the present invention pertains to methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least one C radiolabelled conjugate or conjugate like compound as defined herein together with one or more other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients well known to those skilled in the art e.g. carriers diluents excipients etc. If formulated as discrete units e.g. tablets etc. each unit contains a predetermined amount dosage of the active compound.

The term pharmaceutically acceptable as used herein pertains to compounds ingredients materials compositions dosage forms etc. which are within the scope of sound medical judgment suitable for use in contact with the tissues of the subject in question e.g. human without excessive toxicity irritation allergic response or other problem or complication commensurate with a reasonable benefit risk ratio. Each carrier diluent excipient etc. must also be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation.

The formulations may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active compound with a carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active compound with carriers e.g. liquid carriers finely divided solid carrier etc. and then shaping the product if necessary.

The formulation may be prepared to provide for rapid or slow release immediate delayed timed or sustained release or a combination thereof.

Formulations suitable for parenteral administration e.g. by injection include aqueous or non aqueous isotonic pyrogen free sterile liquids e.g. solutions suspensions in which the active ingredient is dissolved suspended or otherwise provided e.g. in a liposome or other microparticulate . Such liquids may additional contain other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients such as anti oxidants buffers preservatives stabilisers bacteriostats suspending agents thickening agents and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood or other relevant bodily fluid of the intended recipient. Examples of excipients include for example water alcohols polyols glycerol vegetable oils and the like. Examples of suitable isotonic carriers for use in such formulations include Sodium Chloride Injection Ringer s Solution or Lactated Ringer s Injection. Typically the concentration of the active ingredient in the liquid is from about 1 ng ml to about 10 g ml for example from about 10 ng ml to about 1 g ml. The formulations may be presented in unit dose or multi dose sealed containers for example ampoules and vials and may be stored in a freeze dried lyophilised condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier for example water for injections immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders granules and tablets.

It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that appropriate dosages of the conjugate compound and compositions comprising the conjugate compound can vary from patient to patient. Determining the optimal dosage will generally involve the balancing of the level of therapeutic benefit against any risk or deleterious side effects. The selected dosage level will depend on a variety of factors including but not limited to the activity of the particular compound the route of administration the time of administration the rate of excretion of the compound the duration of the treatment other drugs compounds and or materials used in combination the severity of the condition and the species sex age weight condition general health and prior medical history of the patient. The amount of compound and route of administration will ultimately be at the discretion of the physician veterinarian or clinician although generally the dosage will be selected to achieve local concentrations at the site of action which achieve the desired effect without causing substantial harmful or deleterious side effects.

Administration can be effected in one dose continuously or intermittently e.g. in divided doses at appropriate intervals throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those of skill in the art and will vary with the formulation used for therapy the purpose of the therapy the target cell s being treated and the subject being treated. Single or multiple administrations can be carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected by the treating physician veterinarian or clinician.

In general a suitable dose of the active compound is in the range of about 100 ng to about 25 mg more typically about 1 g to about 10 mg per kilogram body weight of the subject per day. Where the active compound is a salt an ester an amide a prodrug or the like the amount administered is calculated on the basis of the parent compound and so the actual weight to be used is increased proportionately.

In one embodiment the active compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime about 100 mg 3 times daily.

In one embodiment the active compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime about 150 mg 2 times daily.

In one embodiment the active compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime about 200 mg 2 times daily.

However in one embodiment the conjugate compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime about 50 or about 75 mg 3 or 4 times daily.

In one embodiment the conjugate compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime about 100 or about 125 mg 2 times daily.

The dosage amounts described above may apply to the conjugate including the PBD moiety and the linker to the antibody or to the effective amount of PBD compound provided for example the amount of compound that is releasable after cleavage of the linker.

For the prevention or treatment of disease the appropriate dosage of an ADC of the invention will depend on the type of disease to be treated as defined above the severity and course of the disease whether the molecule is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the antibody and the discretion of the attending physician. The molecule is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to 15 mg kg e.g. 0.1 20 mg kg of molecule is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. An exemplary dosage of ADC to be administered to a patient is in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 mg kg of patient weight. For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises a course of administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg kg followed by additional doses every week two weeks or three weeks of an ADC. Other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.

The term treatment as used herein in the context of treating a condition pertains generally to treatment and therapy whether of a human or an animal e.g. in veterinary applications in which some desired therapeutic effect is achieved for example the inhibition of the progress of the condition and includes a reduction in the rate of progress a halt in the rate of progress regression of the condition amelioration of the condition and cure of the condition. Treatment as a prophylactic measure i.e. prophylaxis prevention is also included.

The term therapeutically effective amount as used herein pertains to that amount of an active compound or a material composition or dosage from comprising an active compound which is effective for producing some desired therapeutic effect commensurate with a reasonable benefit risk ratio when administered in accordance with a desired treatment regimen.

Similarly the term prophylactically effective amount as used herein pertains to that amount of an active compound or a material composition or dosage from comprising an active compound which is effective for producing some desired prophylactic effect commensurate with a reasonable benefit risk ratio when administered in accordance with a desired treatment regimen.

Antibody drug conjugates may be prepared by several routes employing organic chemistry reactions conditions and reagents known to those skilled in the art including 1 reaction of a nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent to form antibody linker intermediate Ab L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with an activated drug moiety reagent and 2 reaction of a drug moiety reagent with a linker reagent to form drug linker reagent D L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of an antibody. Conjugation methods 1 and 2 may be employed with a variety of antibodies and linkers to prepare the antibody drug conjugates of the invention.

Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include but are not limited to i N terminal amine groups ii side chain amine groups e.g. lysine iii side chain thiol groups e.g. cysteine and iv sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine thiol and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT Cleland s reagent dithiothreitol or TCEP tris 2 carboxyethyl phosphine hydrochloride Getz et al 1999 Anal. Biochem. Vol 273 73 80 Soltec Ventures Beverly Mass. . Each cysteine disulfide bridge will thus form theoretically two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol.

The subject patient may be an animal mammal a placental mammal a marsupial e.g. kangaroo wombat a monotreme e.g. duckbilled platypus a rodent e.g. a guinea pig a hamster a rat a mouse murine e.g. a mouse a lagomorph e.g. a rabbit avian e.g. a bird canine e.g. a dog feline e.g. a cat equine e.g. a horse porcine e.g. a pig ovine e.g. a sheep bovine e.g. a cow a primate simian e.g. a monkey or ape a monkey e.g. marmoset baboon an ape e.g. gorilla chimpanzee orangutang gibbon or a human.

Furthermore the subject patient may be any of its forms of development for example a foetus. In one preferred embodiment the subject patient is a human.

In one embodiment the patient is a population where each patient has a tumour having integrin on the surface of the cell.
