The disclosure is directed to a method for allowing devices to interact with each other in a user determined rather than programmer determined manner.

User devices such as cell phones smart phones tablet computers personal computers laptops smart televisions personal digital assistants and the like are increasingly able to interact with each other. User devices may communicate with each other on a peer to peer basis over a common local area network. For example a smart phone a smart television and a tablet computer may communicate with each other on a user s home Wi Fi network. Alternatively user devices connected to different networks may communicate with each other via a server with access to each of the different networks.

Currently interactions between user devices are constrained by the limitations set by programmers. Typically in order for user devices to communicate with each other the user devices typically must have applications developed by the same programmer installed. A user might want to have two user devices communicate but because they do not both have a specific application installed the user devices are only able to perform a limited set of actions. Similarly a user will often want to do something with an existing application that is different from its capabilities in some way.

There are numerous examples of user devices interacting in a strictly predetermined manner. For example two user devices can transfer files over Bluetooth when both devices have a Bluetooth file sharing application installed. As another example a number of users can play the same game on their respective user devices when each user device has the same game installed and the same communication abilities. As yet another example a video can be streamed from a smart phone to a smart television when both devices have been explicitly programmed to support this interaction.

Accordingly it would be beneficial to allow user devices to interact with each other in a user determined rather than programmer determined manner.

The disclosure is directed to operating a first device configured to communicate with one or more other devices. An aspect discovers the one or more other devices wherein the first device and the one or more other devices form a device network monitors one or more conditions associated with the device network to identify a triggering condition that occurs within the device network wherein the triggering condition is associated with one or more actions to be performed by the device network detects an occurrence of the triggering condition and in response performs an action associated with the triggering condition.

Various aspects are disclosed in the following description and related drawings. Alternate aspects may be devised without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Additionally well known elements of the disclosure will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the disclosure.

The words exemplary and or example are used herein to mean serving as an example instance or illustration. Any aspect described herein as exemplary and or example is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects. Likewise the term aspects of the disclosure does not require that all aspects of the disclosure include the discussed feature advantage or mode of operation.

Further many aspects are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by for example elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits e.g. application specific integrated circuits ASICs by program instructions being executed by one or more processors or by a combination of both. Additionally these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus the various aspects of the disclosure may be embodied in a number of different forms all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition for each of the aspects described herein the corresponding form of any such aspects may be described herein as for example logic configured to perform the described action.

A client device referred to herein as a user equipment UE may be mobile or stationary and may communicate with a radio access network RAN . As used herein the term UE may be referred to interchangeably as an access terminal or AT a wireless device a subscriber device a subscriber terminal a subscriber station a user terminal or UT a mobile terminal a mobile station and variations thereof. Generally UEs can communicate with a core network via the RAN and through the core network the UEs can be connected with external networks such as the Internet. Of course other mechanisms of connecting to the core network and or the Internet are also possible for the UEs such as over wired access networks WiFi networks e.g. based on IEEE 802.11 etc. and so on. UEs can be embodied by any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC cards compact flash devices external or internal modems wireless or wireline phones and so on. A communication link through which UEs can send signals to the RAN is called an uplink channel e.g. a reverse traffic channel a reverse control channel an access channel etc. . A communication link through which the RAN can send signals to UEs is called a downlink or forward link channel e.g. a paging channel a control channel a broadcast channel a forward traffic channel etc. . As used herein the term traffic channel TCH can refer to either an uplink reverse or downlink forward traffic channel.

Referring to UEs . . . N are configured to communicate with an access network e.g. the RAN an access point etc. over a physical communications interface or layer shown in as air interfaces and or a direct wired connection. The air interfaces and can comply with a given cellular communications protocol e.g. Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Evolution Data Optimized EV DO Enhanced High Rate Packet Data eHRPD Global System of Mobile Communication GSM Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution EDGE Wideband CDMA W CDMA Long Term Evolution LTE etc. while the air interface can be a wireless local area network WLAN that complies with a wireless IP protocol e.g. IEEE 802.11 such as a Wi Fi network. The RAN includes a plurality of access points that serve UEs over air interfaces such as the air interfaces and . The access points in the RAN can be referred to as access nodes or ANs access points or APs base stations or BSs Node Bs eNode Bs and so on. These access points can be terrestrial access points or ground stations or satellite access points. The RAN is configured to connect to a core network that can perform a variety of functions including bridging circuit switched CS calls between UEs served by the RAN and other UEs served by the RAN or a different RAN altogether and can also mediate an exchange of packet switched PS data with external networks such as Internet . The Internet includes a number of routing agents and processing agents not shown in for the sake of convenience . In UE N is shown as connecting to the Internet directly i.e. separate from the core network such as over an Ethernet connection of WiFi or 802.11 based network . The Internet can thereby function to bridge packet switched data communications between UE N and UEs . . . N via the core network . Also shown in is the access point that is separate from the RAN . The access point may be connected to the Internet independent of the core network e.g. via an optical communication system such as FiOS a cable modem etc. . The air interface may serve UE or UE over a local wireless connection such as IEEE 802.11 in an example. UE N is shown as a desktop computer with a wired connection to the Internet such as a direct connection to a modem or router which can correspond to the access point itself in an example e.g. for a WiFi router with both wired and wireless connectivity .

Referring to an application server is shown as connected to the Internet the core network or both. The application server can be implemented as a plurality of structurally separate servers or alternately may correspond to a single server. As will be described below in more detail the application server is configured to support one or more communication services e.g. Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP sessions Push to Talk PTT sessions group communication sessions social networking services etc. for UEs that can connect to the application server via the core network and or the Internet .

While internal components of UEs such as the UEs A and B can be embodied with different hardware configurations a basic high level UE configuration for internal hardware components is shown as platform in . The platform can receive and execute software applications data and or commands transmitted from the RAN that may ultimately come from the core network the Internet and or other remote servers and networks e.g. application server web URLs etc. . The platform can also independently execute locally stored applications without RAN interaction. The platform can include a transceiver operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other processor microprocessor logic circuit or other data processing device. The ASIC or other processor executes the application programming interface API layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory of the wireless device. The memory can be comprised of read only memory ROM or random access memory RAM electrically erasable programmable ROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform also can include a local database that can store applications not actively used in memory as well as other data. The local database is typically a flash memory cell but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art such as magnetic media EEPROM optical media tape soft or hard disk or the like.

Accordingly an aspect of the disclosure can include a UE e.g. UE A B etc. including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example ASIC memory API and local database may all be used cooperatively to load store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore the features of the UEs A and B in are to be considered merely illustrative and the disclosure is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.

The wireless communication between the UEs A and or B and the RAN can be based on different technologies such as CDMA W CDMA time division multiple access TDMA frequency division multiple access FDMA Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM GSM or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art voice transmission and or data can be transmitted to the UEs from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the aspects of the disclosure and are merely to aid in the description of various aspects of the disclosure.

Referring to the communication device includes logic configured to receive and or transmit information . In an example if the communication device corresponds to a wireless communications device e.g. UE A or B the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can include a wireless communications interface e.g. Bluetooth WiFi 2G CDMA W CDMA 3G 4G LTE etc. such as a wireless transceiver and associated hardware e.g. an RF antenna a MODEM a modulator and or demodulator etc. . In another example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can correspond to a wired communications interface e.g. a serial connection a USB or Firewire connection an Ethernet connection through which the Internet can be accessed etc. . Thus if the communication device corresponds to some type of network based server e.g. the application server the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can correspond to an Ethernet card in an example that connects the network based server to other communication entities via an Ethernet protocol. In a further example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can include sensory or measurement hardware by which the communication device can monitor its local environment e.g. an accelerometer a temperature sensor a light sensor an antenna for monitoring local RF signals etc. . In an aspect the logic configured to receive and or transmit information may include logic configured to discover one or more other devices in a device network logic configured to monitor one or more conditions associated with the device network to identify a triggering condition that occurs within the device network and or logic configured to detect an occurrence of the triggering condition. The logic configured to receive and or transmit information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to receive and or transmit information to perform its reception and or transmission function s . However the logic configured to receive and or transmit information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to receive and or transmit information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further includes logic configured to process information . In an example the logic configured to process information can include at least a processor. Example implementations of the type of processing that can be performed by the logic configured to process information includes but is not limited to performing determinations establishing connections making selections between different information options performing evaluations related to data interacting with sensors coupled to the communication device to perform measurement operations converting information from one format to another e.g. between different protocols such as .wmv to .avi etc. and so on. The logic configured to process information may include logic configured to monitor one or more conditions associated with the device network to identify a triggering condition that occurs within the device network and logic configured to perform an action associated with the triggering condition. The processor included in the logic configured to process information can correspond to a general purpose processor a digital signal processor DSP an ASIC a field programmable gate array FPGA or other programmable logic device discrete gate or transistor logic discrete hardware components or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described herein. A general purpose processor may be a microprocessor but in the alternative the processor may be any conventional processor controller microcontroller or state machine. A processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices e.g. a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor a plurality of microprocessors one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core or any other such configuration. The logic configured to process information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to process information to perform its processing function s . However the logic configured to process information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to process information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further includes logic configured to store information . In an example the logic configured to store information can include at least a non transitory memory and associated hardware e.g. a memory controller etc. . For example the non transitory memory included in the logic configured to store information can correspond to RAM flash memory ROM erasable programmable ROM EPROM EEPROM registers hard disk a removable disk a CD ROM or any other form of storage medium known in the art. The logic configured to store information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to store information to perform its storage function s . However the logic configured to store information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to store information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further optionally includes logic configured to present information . In an example the logic configured to present information can include at least an output device and associated hardware. For example the output device can include a video output device e.g. a display screen a port that can carry video information such as USB HDMI etc. an audio output device e.g. speakers a port that can carry audio information such as a microphone jack USB HDMI etc. a vibration device and or any other device by which information can be formatted for output or actually outputted by a user or operator of the communication device . For example if the communication device corresponds to UE A or UE B as shown in the logic configured to present information can include the display A of UE A or the touchscreen display B of UE B. In a further example the logic configured to present information can be omitted for certain communication devices such as network communication devices that do not have a local user e.g. network switches or routers remote servers etc. . The logic configured to present information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to present information to perform its presentation function s . However the logic configured to present information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to present information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further optionally includes logic configured to receive local user input . In an example the logic configured to receive local user input can include at least a user input device and associated hardware. For example the user input device can include buttons a touchscreen display a keyboard a camera an audio input device e.g. a microphone or a port that can carry audio information such as a microphone jack etc. and or any other device by which information can be received from a user or operator of the communication device . For example if the communication device corresponds to UE A or UE B as shown in the logic configured to receive local user input can include the keypad A any of the buttons A or B through B the touchscreen display B etc. In a further example the logic configured to receive local user input can be omitted for certain communication devices such as network communication devices that do not have a local user e.g. network switches or routers remote servers etc. . The logic configured to receive local user input can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to receive local user input to perform its input reception function s . However the logic configured to receive local user input does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to receive local user input relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to while the configured logics of through are shown as separate or distinct blocks in it will be appreciated that the hardware and or software by which the respective configured logic performs its functionality can overlap in part. For example any software used to facilitate the functionality of the configured logics of through can be stored in the non transitory memory associated with the logic configured to store information such that the configured logics of through each performs their functionality i.e. in this case software execution based in part upon the operation of software stored by the logic configured to store information . Likewise hardware that is directly associated with one of the configured logics can be borrowed or used by other configured logics from time to time. For example the processor of the logic configured to process information can format data into an appropriate format before being transmitted by the logic configured to receive and or transmit information such that the logic configured to receive and or transmit information performs its functionality i.e. in this case transmission of data based in part upon the operation of hardware i.e. the processor associated with the logic configured to process information .

Generally unless stated otherwise explicitly the phrase logic configured to as used throughout this disclosure is intended to invoke an aspect that is at least partially implemented with hardware and is not intended to map to software only implementations that are independent of hardware. Also it will be appreciated that the configured logic or logic configured to in the various blocks are not limited to specific logic gates or elements but generally refer to the ability to perform the functionality described herein either via hardware or a combination of hardware and software . Thus the configured logics or logic configured to as illustrated in the various blocks are not necessarily implemented as logic gates or logic elements despite sharing the word logic. Other interactions or cooperation between the logic in the various blocks will become clear to one of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the aspects described below in more detail.

User devices such as cell phones smart phones tablet computers personal computers laptops smart televisions personal digital assistants and the like are increasingly able to interact with each other. User devices may communicate with each other on a peer to peer basis over a common local area network. For example a smart phone a smart television and a tablet computer may communicate with each other on a user s home Wi Fi network. Alternatively user devices connected to different networks may communicate with each other via a server with access to each of the different networks.

Currently interactions between user devices are constrained by the limitations set by programmers. Typically in order for user devices to communicate with each other the user devices typically must have applications developed by the same programmer installed. A user might want to have two user devices communicate but because they do not both have a specific application installed the user devices are only able to perform a limited set of actions. Similarly a user will often want to do something with an existing application that is different from its capabilities in some way.

There are numerous examples of user devices interacting in a strictly predetermined manner. For example two user devices can transfer files over Bluetooth when both devices have a Bluetooth file sharing application installed. As another example a number of users can play the same game on their respective user devices when each user device has the same game installed and the same communication abilities. As yet another example a video can be streamed from a smart phone to a smart television when both devices have been explicitly programmed to support this interaction.

Accordingly aspects of the disclosure allow devices to interact with each other in a user or device determined rather than programmer determined manner.

As an example when a user wants to stream a video from his or her smart phone such as smart phone to a smart television such as smart television there is a question of which device initiates the transfer. One option is for the smart phone to send the video stream to the smart television . In this scenario the smart phone determines that there is another screen available with better resolution or other quality metrics i.e. the smart television . As a result the smart phone sends the video to the smart television .

A second option is for the smart television to request the video stream from the smart phone . In this scenario the smart television sends out a request to receive a video the smart phone receives the request and responds with a video. The smart phone may select the video based on user interaction or based on criteria from the smart television .

A third option is that the network has a collective consciousness where each user device makes decisions based on past interactions with other user devices. In this scenario neither device owns the entire decision making process. In a Collective Consciousness Network user devices recruit other devices to an activity. The recruiting process involves a user device advertising what it is doing or what it would like to do. Networked devices that are able to assist in the experience voluntarily join.

Collective Consciousness Networks provides the possibility for users to use their devices in ways that programmers did not explicitly develop. However since the devices have not been directly told what to do they must explore various options possibly erring before arriving at and providing the desired experience.

When the smart phone begins playing the video it can send out a message to other devices on the air interface such as tablet computer smart television and laptop notifying them that it is playing a video. The notice can also be or include an invitation for another device to play the video instead. In response one or more or none of the various devices may volunteer to play the video. The devices may volunteer if they are not doing anything else and if they are equipped to perform the particular activity here playing a video. The devices can volunteer by sending the smart phone their capabilities and letting the smart phone decide whether or not to pass off performing the activity to another device.

In the example of the smart television volunteers to play the video and the smart phone can decide whether or not to send the video to the smart television . The smart phone can compare its capabilities to the capabilities of the smart television to see which device is better equipped to play the video and or ask the user if he or she wishes to send the video to the smart television . If the smart phone decides to have the smart television play the video it can stream the video to the smart television or instruct the source of the video stream to stream the video to the smart television instead.

In an alternative aspect a third party server such as the access point for the WLAN or WPAN such as access point or one of the devices communicating over air interface i.e. smart phone tablet computer smart television and laptop may act as a broker for the network. In this aspect the smart phone notifies the broker that it is performing an activity here playing a video and the broker notifies the other devices on the air interface instead of the smart phone doing so. Any devices that volunteer to play the video notify the broker which then decides whether or not to have a different device play the video. The broker notifies the smart phone that another device will play the video and instructs the smart phone to send the video to the other device if the video is stored on the smart phone . If the video is being streamed to the smart phone the broker instructs the source of the video to stream it to the other device.

In this aspect each device may send its capability table to the broker when the air interface is setup or when a device joins the network of devices or the broker may request the device capability tables when it receives notice of a new activity being performed. The broker can use the capability tables to determine if a volunteering device would be better suited to perform the current activity. Alternatively rather than the devices volunteering to perform a given activity the broker can use the device capability tables to determine which device would be best at performing the activity and assign the activity to that device. In that case the broker may or may not first notify the devices that a new activity is available to be performed.

Accordingly the various aspects of the disclosure allow users to use their devices as they wish without requiring an application for each desired experience. Rather than requiring an application to perform the functionality described herein various modules are provided. Each module need only reside on one device. Each module can be used in various ways since each module is only one part of the total user experience. This allows the user greater flexibility in achieving a desired result. It also allows fewer blocks to be used in a greater number of ways.

Additionally the networks described herein can have a learning ability. The learning ability enables networks to intuit a user s needs. This is important since the user s needs might not be obvious and the ad hoc network might have to guess before arriving at the desired experience.

The modules can be used by the devices to discover each other s presence on a common communication network such as a WLAN or a WPAN. The devices can automatically discover each other when they connect to the communication network. Connected devices can also periodically poll the network to determine what other devices are connected in case a device disconnects or did not announce itself when it connected. After discovery the devices can exchange device capability messages. For example a first device can be a heart rate monitor that has a device capability of monitoring a user s heart rate a second device can be a smart television that has device capabilities of outputting audio and video data a third device can be a music player such as an MP3 player that has the device capability of outputting audio data and so on.

Once the devices discover each other they become a network of devices with a particular network configuration. For example a first network configuration may be the combination of a heart rate monitor and music player a second network configuration may be the combination of a music player a heart rate monitor a treadmill and a Bluetooth headset a third network configuration may be the combination of a smart phone a smart television and a laptop and so on.

Once a particular network configuration has been established the user can establish rules that govern the actions performed by one or more of the devices that form that network configuration. Alternatively the modules can define the actions the one or more devices should take in various situations. In yet another alternative the devices themselves may determine which actions to take.

The following are examples of operating environments network configurations triggering conditions and actions that illustrate these various aspects 

1. Operating environment A user running on a treadmill listening to a music player and wearing a heart rate monitor.

In the first operating environment the triggering condition s and the associated action s can be identified in different ways. The devices can passively log events i.e. triggering conditions and actions performed by the user and then preemptively perform the actions when the devices detect the triggering conditions. In this case the user may have a history of adjusting the volume playing a certain song and or playing a certain genre of music when the user s heart rate rises above a threshold and or after a certain period of time on the treadmill. The devices can generate a set of rules that define the triggering conditions and corresponding actions based on the log.

It may not always be clear which actions the user would prefer to have the network devices perform upon certain triggering conditions or even what the exact triggering conditions are. This may be because the user performs different acts based on the same triggering conditions or because there is not a sufficient history of user interaction with the device network. In this case the devices can experiment with different actions and different triggering conditions. The user can provide feedback to the network devices that indicates whether this was an appropriate action. In the first operating environment the feedback can include changing the song and or volume on the MP3 player and or changing the speed of the treadmill if the user is not satisfied with the devices chosen actions. The devices can log this user intervention and update the set of rules accordingly.

Alternatively the user or a module installed on the user device can specify the set of rules. The user can explicitly define the triggering condition s and or action s . To do this the user can be presented with the capabilities of the various devices in the network configuration and can configure the actions to be performed when the triggering conditions occur. If the set of rules are provided by a module the set of rules may still not be perfect for the particular user and the module can modify the rules based on user feedback.

In an aspect the specific triggering conditions can be related to the corresponding actions based on a common domain. In the first operating environment for example a heart rate change can trigger a song to be played with a tempo that is commensurate with that heart rate change. In this example the common domain is time or more specifically tempo. That is a rate increase on one device can trigger a rate increase on another device. In the second operating environment the common domain could be video insofar as playing a video causes a video streaming and output action in response.

The common domain can also be space related such as relative positions on X Y Z axes. That is the relative positions of the devices in the device network can be part of a triggering condition. That way for example the music player being in a particular position relative to the treadmill indicates that the user is physically on the treadmill and not just walking by the treadmill.

At the user device sends its device capability profile to the other devices on the network and requests that those devices send it their capability profiles. At the user device builds a device capability table or network configuration table of the devices on the network and their respective capabilities based on the received device capability profiles. Aspects and are optional as the user device can perform the remaining aspects of exemplary flow without this information as described below.

At the user device passively monitors conditions of itself and the other network devices. The user device can use this information to identify one or more triggering conditions that cause a given action to occur in itself and or the one or more other devices on the network. Examples of triggering conditions include a heart rate monitor detecting a heart rate over a threshold a smart phone playing a video and so on. Examples of corresponding actions include the music player switching to a different song or increasing the volume the smart phone sending the video to a smart television and so on. Monitoring these conditions and actions does not require the network devices to have exchanged device capability profiles.

The user device can create a set of rules based on the monitored conditions and actions. Alternatively the user or third party can supply such rules. In that case at the user device simply monitors the conditions of the user device and network devices to determine when a rule is triggered. This alternative may require the device capability table if the rules require knowledge of the other devices capabilities.

At the user device detects an occurrence of one or more identified triggering conditions. The triggering condition s may occur at the user device or the user device may receive a notification that a triggering condition has occurred at one of the other network devices. The notification may be a message that the triggering condition has occurred a request to perform an action based on the occurrence of the triggering condition or receipt of data to process based on the occurrence of the triggering condition. For example where the user device is a smart television and the triggering condition is the user playing a video on a smart phone the notification may be nothing more than the smart television receiving a stream of the video to play.

At the user device performs the action s associated with the triggering condition s . Where the actions are not fully defined the user device can use the device capability profiles or device capability table to guess at an appropriate action. For example if the user device is a smart phone and it has the device capability information for a smart television it may guess that it would be better for the user to watch a video on the smart television. Accordingly it will stream the video to the smart television.

Alternatively if the user device does not have the device capability profiles or table it can ask the other network devices to volunteer to perform the triggered action. The user device may send its capability profile possibly only including the relevant capabilities with the request so that the other devices can compare their capabilities to determine if they would be better at performing the action. If one or more devices volunteer to perform the action the user device will select the best device notify it that it may perform the action and send it the information necessary to perform the action.

When devices need to make decisions regarding how to interact with each other their initial decisions may not be accurate. It is therefore necessary to track interactions and rate them based on levels of success. This allows the devices to reference their history and factor past interactions into future experiences. For example when a smart phone streams a video to the device network and the smart television receives and plays the video through to the end the devices learn that this was a good decision. The device network can now factor in this good decision when similar factors are in place and future decisions are required. Conversely if the user stops the video or turns off the television the device network learns that this was a bad decision and will try different device interactions in the future.

It can take time for a device network to develop a sufficient history of interactions to know how the devices should work together. If the device network has to use only the trial and error learning method it could be discouraging to users preventing them from taking full advantage of the system.

Device networks are location based and therefore there could be many similar networks in various locations around the world. Similar networks provide for similar needs. Therefore successful interactions in Network A can be applied to Network B if Network A and Network B contain similar devices.

To help jump start the learning process as devices in disparate device networks learn they can share that knowledge with a global collective consciousness server. The server stores the individual learned experiences as well as data about the device networks that performed the learning. Other device networks can download a learned history from the server that is relevant to that particular device network. The server can determine a relevant learned history for a device network based on similarities between the device network and the stored histories as well as similarities between the respective users. Similar networks would be networks with the same or similar devices and the same or similar device capabilities that can perform the same interactions. For example two device networks comprising a smart phone a smart television and a tablet computer would be considered similar to each other even if the brands of the devices are different if they can perform the same interactions. Or to the extent that they can perform the same interactions as another device network comprising a smart phone a smart television and a tablet computer they are considered similar to that device network.

The server is needed to track organize group and distribute these learned experiences. Each device network s interactions can be sent to the server. The server organizes and groups the interactions of the device networks. When a similar device network is established the new network can request a history from the servers to effectively jumpstart the learning process. Once the stored history is shared with the new network the new network is better able to make decisions.

The smart phones and and the smart televisions and need not be the same make and model or even the same brand depending on the types of interaction. For instance if the interaction is something that all smart phones and smart televisions can do then the particular make and model is irrelevant. However if the interaction is something that only that make and model can perform or can only perform with other devices of the same make and model then that information is relevant.

A server is in communication with Network A and Network B . Server stores information about networks and such as the types and capabilities of the devices in each network and historical information regarding their interaction. The server determines the capabilities of each device and thus the device network and matches device networks that have the same capabilities. The server can receive the capability information from the device network itself or from third party sources. The server can share history information among networks with matching capabilities.

At the server receives information related to a plurality of different device networks such as device networks and . Each of the plurality of device networks includes a plurality of different devices. Each device has an associated set of device capabilities. The aggregation of device capabilities across the devices in the network provides the capabilities of the network.

The information the server receives from the different device networks also includes an interaction history between the device network s plurality of devices. The history can include actions taken events that triggered the actions and user feedback to the actions. The server can determine if there are any compatibility requirements to perform these actions such as whether the devices must be the same make and model the same brand have the same software installed and the like.

At the server generates at least one set of network specific interaction recommendations that other networks with that network configuration and or network capabilities can use to improve their decision making. The server identifies networks that have the same or similar devices with the same or similar capabilities and aggregates into a set of network specific interaction recommendations at least a portion of the interaction histories of the identified device networks.

At the server identifies one or more target device networks that have the same or similar network configuration as a network for which the server generated network specific interaction recommendations. The server may identify the target device network based on receiving a request for network specific interaction recommendations from the target network. Alternatively the server may identify the device networks from which it has received information and which have the same or similar network configuration and send them the recommendations.

A target device network has the same or similar network configuration if it has a network configuration that matches the network configuration of a network for which the server generated network specific interaction recommendations. Network configurations match if the number and type of devices in the two network are the same if the make and model of the corresponding devices in the two networks are the same if the operating systems of the corresponding devices in the two networks are the same if the feature set e.g. video capable audio capable etc. of the corresponding devices in the two networks are the same if the devices in the two networks are capable of performing the same actions and or the like.

At the server sends the particular set of network specific interaction recommendations to the one or more target devices within the target device network based on the identification. The one or more device networks use the set of interaction recommendations to make decisions regarding interactions among the one or more target devices.
